Abstract = {Declines in terrestrial water storage (TWS) exacerbate regional water
   scarcity and global sea level rise. Increasing evidence has shown that
   recent TWS declines are substantial in ecologically fragile drylands,
   but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, by synergizing satellite
   observations and model simulations, we quantitatively attribute TWS
   trends during 2002-2016 in major climate zones to three mechanistic
   drivers: climate variability, climate change, and direct human
   activities. We reveal that climate variability had transitory and
   limited impacts (<20\%), whereas warming-induced glacier loss and direct
   human activities dominate the TWS loss in humid regions (similar to
   103\%) and drylands (similar to 64\%), respectively. In non-glacierized
   humid areas, climate variability generated regional water gains that
   offset synchronous TWS declines. Yet in drylands, TWS losses are
   enduring and more widespread with direct human activities, particularly
   unsustainable groundwater abstraction. Our findings highlight the
   substantive human footprints on the already vulnerable arid regions and
   an imperative need for improved dryland water conservation.},

Abstract = {A glycoside hydrolase family 32 exo-inulinase gene was cloned from
   Arthrobacter sp. HJ7 isolated from saline soil located in Heijing town.
   The gene encodes an 892-residue polypeptide with a calculated mass of
   95.1kDa and a high total frequency of amino acid residues G, A, and V
   (30.0\%). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used as hosts to
   express the exo-inulinase gene. The recombinant exo-inulinase (rInuAHJ7)
   showed an apparently maximal activity at pH 5.0-5.5 and 40-45 degrees C.
   The addition of 1.0 and 10.0mM Zn2+ and Pb2+ had little or no effect on
   the enzyme activity. rInuAHJ7 exhibited good salt tolerance, retaining
   more than 98\% inulinase activity at a concentration of 3.0\%-20.0\%
   (w/v) NaCl. Fructose was the main product of inulin, levan, and
   Jerusalem artichoke tubers hydrolyzed by the enzyme. The present study
   is the first to report the identification and characterization of an
   Arthrobacter sp exo-inulinase showing a high molecular mass of 95.1kDa
   and NaCl tolerance. These results suggest that the exo-inulinase might
   be an alternative material for potential applications in processing
   seafood and other foods with high saline contents, such as marine algae,
   pickles, and sauces.},

Title = {Inducible defenses in an estuarine bivalve do not alter predator
   handling times and are not affected by climate change},

Abstract = {Mussels use their shells for protection which they can thicken or grow
   in response to predator cues, commonly referred to as an inducible
   defense. Oceans are experiencing elevated pCO(2) due to climate change.
   Elevated pCO(2) can have negative effects on bivalve morphology and
   physiology, but we are still learning about the consequences of these
   effects on predator-prey interactions, a key motivation of this study.
   Using a 4 wk (short-term) laboratory experiment, we orthogonally
   manipulated 2 levels of pCO(2) (ambient or elevated to predicted future
   conditions that mimicked diel variability) and 2 levels of predator
   presence (absent or present) of blue crabs Callinectes sapidus to
   determine their effects on the morphology and predator handling times on
   southern ribbed mussels Geukensia granosissima. Experimental results
   indicated that shell length and width increased in mussels in response
   to the predator cues, and these inducible defenses were not affected by
   elevated pCO(2). Unexpectedly, mussels exposed to elevated pCO(2)
   exhibited greater growth in shell depth independent of the predator
   treatment, resulting in shells with rounder shapes. These effects on
   mussel morphometrics did not affect average crab handling times, but
   mussels exposed to the presence of a predator under elevated pCO(2)
   conditions had highly variable handling times. This work highlights the
   complexity of animal physiology, morphology, and interspecific
   interactions on predator-prey relationships in a changing ocean.},

Abstract = {Lake ice, one of the most direct lake physical characteristics affected
   by climate change, can reflect small-scale environmental changes caused
   by the atmosphere and hydrology, as well as large-scale climate changes
   such as global warming. This study uses National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR),
   MOD09GQ surface reflectance products, and Landsat surface reflectance
   Tier 1 products, which comprehensively used RS and GIS technology to
   study lake ice phenology (LIP) and changes in Qinghai Lake. Over the
   past 38 years, freeze-up start and freeze-up end dates were gradually
   delayed by a rate of 0.16 d/a and 0.19 d/a, respectively, with a total
   delay by 6.08 d and 7.22 d. The dates of break-up start and break-up end
   showed advancing trends by -0.36 d/a and -0.42 d/a, respectively, which
   shifted them earlier by 13.68 d and 15.96 d. Overall, ice coverage
   duration, freeze duration, and complete freeze duration showed
   decreasing trends of -0.58 d/a, -0.60 d/a, and -0.52 d/a, respectively,
   and overall decreased by 22.04 d, 22.81 d, and 9.76 d between 1980 and
   2018. The spatial pattern in the freeze-thaw of Qinghai Lake can be
   divided into two areas; the west of the lake area has similar spatial
   patterns of freezing and ablation, while, in the east of the lake area,
   freezing and ablation patterns are opposite. Climate factors were
   closely related to LIP, especially the accumulated freezing degree-day
   (AFDD) from October to April of the following year. Furthermore,
   freeze-up start time was more sensitive to changes in wind speed and
   precipitation.},

Title = {Natural fiber-reinforced mortars},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Using recycling materials in construction is a safe way for achieving
   sustainability. Although European policy, through directives given,
   supports their use and coherent research results derive from the
   scientific society, their use in practice is limited. It is generally
   accepted that the use of alternative construction materials with low
   environmental impact and of low cost is an important issue. As a part of
   the integration in sustainable development approach, the eco-friendly
   materials present a great interest in building construction
   manufacturing. Towards this direction, many studies have been focused on
   the exploitation of natural fibers as reinforcements in building
   materials. This study is an attempt to add more experimental results by
   the use of bio-fibers to building materials in order to ensure the
   performance of recycled materials such as bio-fibers in the construction
   sector. Three types of natural fibers jute, coconut and kelp were used
   as additives in 1.5\% by mortar volume. Their role in cement and lime
   mortars was recorded by testing mechanical, physical and microstructure
   properties. The results indicate that natural fibers act in favor of
   strength and durability. Nevertheless, bio-fibers work differently in
   strong cement mortars in relation to the ``soft{''} lime-based
   materials. Advantages can be gained in both cases but certain aspects
   should be taken into account such as the adhesion to the mortar matrix
   and the water content of the mixture.},

   material from drill cores obtained at three sites within the Heidelberg
   Basin (Germany). The scientific relevance of this unique archive was
   discovered only in the last decade. The hundreds of metres thick
   sequences of mainly fluvial sediments record the evolution of the
   environment and climatic conditions during the late Pliocene and the
   entire Pleistocene of western Central Europe. In our present study, we
   implement unpublished mineral magnetic S-ratio data, and new evidence
   from X-ray analysis into two previously completed studies on the
   magnetic polarity stratigraphy, and the magnetic mineralogy of the
   Pliocene to Pleistocene sediments of the Heidelberg Basin. The total set
   of data enables distinction of environmental and climatic processes, and
   unveil details on the climatic conditions of continental Europe during
   this period.
   We demonstrate the dominance of a warm climate with alternation of humid
   and dry periods during the Pliocene. Cyclic variations in the
   groundwater table in the Rhine flood plain resulted in redox
   fluctuations, which led to the decomposition of the primary detrital
   mineral assemblage. Authigenic Fe oxides, particularly haematite, formed
   during dry periods. A rapid transition into cooler and moister
   conditions occurred at the end of the Pliocene, as indicated by the
   persistence of Fe sulphides, especially greigite. A high groundwater
   table and the associated reducing conditions have largely persisted to
   the present day.
   We show that the rapid transition from warm to cooler and moister
   climatic conditions in Central Europe during the final Pliocene is a
   regional response to the intensification of Northern Hemisphere
   glaciation (iNHG). This work supplements existing knowledge of the
   climatic evolution of Central Europe during the PliocenePleistocene
   transition by data from a region from which little data has been
   available.
   A sideglance to climatic archives elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere
   (e.g., North Atlantic Ocean, Chinese Loess Plateau, Russian arctic) is
   used to show the coincidence of the iNHG events in quite different
   environmental regimes.},

Abstract = {The Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) concluded that many collectiveobservations gave a aspect of a
   global warming and other changes in the climate system. It is very
   important to understand thisprocess accurately, and to construct the
   model by whom an environmental change is accurately forecast. Future
   earthobservation using satellite data should monitor global climate
   change, and should contribute to social benefits. Especially, human
   activities has given the big impacts to earth environment. This is a
   very complex affair, and nature itself also impacts the clouds, namely
   the seasonal variations. JAXA (former NASDA) has the plan of the Global
   Change Observation Mission (GCOM) formonitoring of global environmental
   change. SGLI (Second Generation GLI) onboard GCOM-C 1 (Climate)
   satellite, which is one of this mission, is an optical sensor from
   Near-UV to TIR. SGLI can provide the various high accuracy products of
   aerosol, cloud information, various biophysical parameters (Biomass,
   Land Cover, Albedo, NPP, Water Stressed Vegetation, LST, etc.), coastal
   information (CDOM, SS, PAR, CHL, SST, etc.), and cryospheric information
   (Albedo, Snow/Ice Cover, NDII, Sea ice type, Snow Grain Size, NDSI, Snow
   Surface Temperature, etc.). This paper shows the introduction of the
   unique aspects and characteristics of the next generation satellite
   sensor, SGLI/GCOM-C, and shows the preliminary research for this sensor.},

   facilitate processes in the extant nitrogen cycle. Molecular genetic and
   evolutionary analyses of these genomes paired with advances in
   postgenomics, biochemical and physiological experimentation have enabled
   scientists to reevaluate existing geochemical and oceanographic data for
   improved characterization of the extant nitrogen cycle as well as its
   evolution since the primordial era of planet Earth. Based on the
   literature and extensive new data relevant to aerobic and anaerobic
   ammonia oxidation (ANAMMOX), the natural history of the nitrogen-cycle
   has been redrawn with emphasis on the early roles of incomplete
   denitrification and ammonification as driving forces for emergence of
   ANAMMOX as the foundation for a complete nitrogen cycle, and concluding
   with emergence of nitrification in the oxic era.},

Title = {Effect of protein source and concentration on somatic growth of juvenile
   green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {320-336},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An important aspect in the development of any aquaculture industry is
   the maximization of juvenile somatic growth (i.e., body growth) to
   reduce production time and increase the size of the final product. In
   this study, green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis were fed
   a prepared diet from 4 December 1998 to 10 September 1999 (i.e., 280 d)
   in a laboratory to investigate the effect of protein source (soybean
   and/or fish), protein concentration (20, 30, 40, and 50\% dry mass) and
   juvenile size (4-8 mm and 12-20 mm initial test diameter) on somatic
   growth. A natural diet of Laminaria longicrurus (i.e., kelp) was used as
   a reference. There was no difference in initial size among the
   treatments for either the smaller cohort I or the larger cohort 2 sea
   urchins (6.3 mm and 13.8 mm initial average test diameter, respectively)
   (P > 0.05 for all tests). After 280 d, the sea urchins fed kelp had an
   average size of 20.7 turn and 24.5 mm (cohort I and cohort 2,
   respectively). The final average sizes of the sea urchins fed the
   prepared diets, which did not relate to dietary protein concentrations
   and/or protein source, ranged from 13.2 mm to 16.2 mm (cohort 1) and
   from 20.4 mm to 22.9 mm (cohort 2), and were significantly smaller than
   the kelp-fed sea urchins (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, cohort 1 and cohort 2,
   respectively). All treatments experienced 95\% survivorship or greater.
   Sea urchin size appears to affect growth rate when optimal conditions
   for growth are available (i.e., diet and water temperature). As water
   temperatures increased during the summer of 1999, the sea urchins in
   cohort 1 fed kelp had a significantly higher growth rate (0.069 mm/d)
   than the cohort 2 kelp-fed sea urchins (0.052 mm/d) (P < 0.05). However,
   within each cohort, there were no significant differences in growth rate
   (P > 0.05) among the sea urchins fed prepared diets, suggesting sea
   urchins do not require high concentrations of dietary protein for
   superior growth, and that plant protein can substitute fish protein in
   sea urchin diets. Furthermore, the sea urchins fed the prepared diets
   had poorer test quality and larger gonad yields (13-22\%) compared to
   the kelp-fed sea urchins (4.2\%) and a wild sample of sea urchins of
   similar size (4.0\%). The results suggest that the sea urchins fed the
   prepared diets allocated more energy to gonad production, whereas those
   fed a natural diet allocated more energy toward test production. To
   address this gap, more research is required to identify the nutritional
   components required for test growth that were present in kelp, but
   appeared to be deficient in the prepared diets.},

Title = {Benthic responses to an Antarctic regime shift: food particle size and
   recruitment biology},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Polar ecosystems are bellwether indicators of climate change and offer
   insights into ecological resilience. In this study, we describe
   contrasting responses to an apparent regime shift of two very different
   benthic communities in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. We compared
   species-specific patterns of benthic invertebrate abundance and size
   between the west (low productivity) and east (higher productivity) sides
   of McMurdo Sound across multiple decades (1960s-2010) to depths of 60 m.
   We present possible factors associated with the observed changes. A
   massive and unprecedented shift in sponge recruitment and growth on
   artificial substrata observed between the 1980s and 2010 contrasts with
   lack of dramatic sponge settlement and growth on natural substrata,
   emphasizing poorly understood sponge recruitment biology. We present
   observations of changes in populations of sponges, bryozoans, bivalves,
   and deposit-feeding invertebrates in the natural communities on both
   sides of the sound. Scientific data for Antarctic benthic ecosystems are
   scant, but we gather multiple lines of evidence to examine possible
   processes in regional-scale oceanography during the eight years in which
   the sea ice did not clear out of the southern portion of McMurdo Sound.
   We suggest that large icebergs blocked currents and advected plankton,
   allowed thicker multi-year ice, and reduced light to the benthos. This,
   in addition to a possible increase in iron released from rapidly melting
   glaciers, fundamentally shifted the quantity and quality of primary
   production in McMurdo Sound. A hypothesized shift from large to small
   food particles is consistent with increased recruitment and growth of
   sponges on artificial substrata, filter-feeding polychaetes, and some
   bryozoans, as well as reduced populations of bivalves and crinoids that
   favor large particles, and echinoderms Sterechinus neumayeri and
   Odontaster validus that predominantly feed on benthic diatoms and large
   phytoplankton mats that drape the seafloor after spring blooms. This
   response of different guilds of filter feeders to a hypothesized shift
   from large to small phytoplankton points to the enormous need for and
   potential value of holistic monitoring programs, particularly in
   pristine ecosystems, that could yield both fundamental ecological
   insights and knowledge that can be applied to critical conservation
   concerns as climate change continues.},

Title = {Load-frequency control in an islanded microgrid PV/WT/FC/ESS using an
   optimal self-tuning fractional-order fuzzy controller},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Due to the increased complexity and nonlinear nature of microgrid
   systems such as photovoltaic, wind-turbine fuel cell, and energy storage
   systems (PV/WT/FC/ESSs), load-frequency control has been a challenge.
   This paper employs a self-tuning controller based on the fuzzy logic to
   overcome parameter uncertainties of classic controllers, such as
   operation conditions, the change in the operating point of the
   microgrid, and the uncertainty of microgrid modeling. Furthermore, a
   combined fuzzy logic and fractional-order controller is used for
   load-frequency control of the off-grid microgrid with the influence of
   renewable resources because the latter controller benefits robust
   performance and enjoys a flexible structure. To reach a better operation
   for the proposed controller, a novel meta-heuristic whale algorithm has
   been used to optimally determine the input and output scale coefficients
   of the fuzzy controller and fractional orders of the fractional-order
   controller. The suggested approach is applied to a microgrid with a
   diesel generator, wind turbine, photovoltaic systems, and energy storage
   devices. The comparison made between the results of the proposed
   controller and those of the classic PID controller proves the
   superiority of the optimized fractional-order self-tuning fuzzy
   controller in terms of operation characteristics, response speed, and
   the reduction in frequency deviations against load variations.},

Abstract = {We propose a floating vessel which extracts energy from wind or tidal
   flow through its pitching motion. In order to extract significant
   energy, a considerable inclination of the vessel is needed. This is
   achieved through the rotation of flat plates which face towards the flow
   of the wind or tidal current at twice the natural oscillation of
   pitching motion. This in turn, creates the desired pitching motion of
   the vessel. In this paper, the dynamics of the pitching motion of the
   vessel and its stability are studied along with the dynamics of the
   rotating plates.},

Abstract = {This paper considers an offshore wind turbine modular power converter
   (ac/dc) with permanent magnet synchronous generator based on three
   stages: an ac-ac converter, a medium-frequency transformer, and a
   full-bridge diode rectifier with LC output filter. Six converter
   topologies are compared; three of them are based on back-to-back (B2B)
   topology: the conventional B2B with three-phase sinusoidal waveform, the
   B2B with three-phase squared waveform, and the B2B with single-phase
   squared waveform. The other solutions are based on matrix topologies:
   the direct matrix converter, the indirect matrix converter, and the
   reduced matrix converter (RMC). A systematic methodology and main
   component models are introduced to evaluate the power loss, volume, and
   mass of the wind energy conversion system for all considered topologies
   as a function of the medium-frequency transformer operational frequency
   and the number of modules parallel connected. The comparison involves a
   tradeoff study between total power losses, size and weight of 10 MW
   modular converters. It was found that when Metglas alloy 2605SA1 is the
   transformer core material, the RMC topology leaves the best tradeoff
   between the considered performance indicators with an extra benefit in
   reducing the semiconductor devices cost of the modular converter.},

Abstract = {Transpiration is a function of plants to evaporate water from their leaf
   stomata, which enables plants to take up ground water from their roots
   to their leaves through the xylem. This water flux function is called
   the transpiration stream. This paper shows the application of the
   concept of a transpiration stream to seawater desalination using
   sunlight as a single energy source. This approach uses a simple mimic of
   plants using a glass gas injection tube, where its inside channel,
   porous glass part and small pores of the porous part are paralleled with
   xylem, leaf and stomata of plants, respectively. Aqueous solutions of a
   dye (methylene blue) absorbing visible light were evaporated from the
   porous part under visible light irradiation and upward pumping of a dye
   solution was observed in the channel. When the porous part of the glass
   gas injection tube was modified with solvent black 5 as
   non-water-soluble dye, the vaporization and the upward pumping of water
   in the tube were observed. Recovered vaporized water from artificial
   seawater was successfully desalinated. Using the mechanism of a
   transpiration stream, desalination and automatic supply of seawater were
   achieved only using sunlight.},

   Keanakako'i Ash Member, Kilauea Volcano},
Journal = {GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {1},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {On the summit of Kilauea Volcano, incipient palagonitization and
   consolidation of vitric tephras from the <500-year-old Keanakako'i Ash
   Member of the Puna Basalt have occurred only adjacent to
   caldera-bounding faults. Calcite intergrown with palagonitized glass has
   6180 values indicative of a hydrothermal origin. Whereas the delta C-13
   of the calcite suggests that it has sequestered carbon from atmospheric
   as well as mantle sources, radiocarbon dates from the calcites, in
   addition to calcites from modern steam vents at Kilauea, indicate that
   >90\% of the carbon is mantle derived. We hypothesize that the
   palagonitized zones may denote the location of fossil steam vents,
   similar to active vents exposed along circumferential faults on both the
   north and the south sides of the Kilauea Caldera. Elsewhere, Keanakako
   tephras are weathering into pedogenic products that closely reflect
   modern environmental conditions. Under acidic soil conditions (pH <
   6.0), tephra is undergoing dissolution, with the development of opaline
   crusts on outcrop faces. Under more neutral soil pH (6.5-7.8), the
   pedogenic products reflect the degree of desilication of tephra
   mitigated by leaching: dominantly smectite where mean annual rainfall is
   <50 cm/yr and dominantly kaolinite, allophane, and/or imogolite where
   rainfall exceeds 250 cm/yr.},

Abstract = {Vegetation cover is an important indicator of the hydrology, habitat
   suitability, and carbon storage of wetlands. The effective management of
   wetland vegetation requires a good understanding of how human activities
   affect vegetation cover. In this study, using China's Yellow River Delta
   as a case study, we examined the factors that have influenced the
   delta's vegetation cover since 1980. Based on structural equation
   modeling, we tested the impacts of seashore reclamation activities,
   including tidal embankment construction, port construction, and land
   reclamation, on vegetation cover. Other potentially important factors,
   such as population, road construction, precipitation, and rising sea
   levels, were incorporated into the analyses. Our results showed that
   seashore reclamation activities have had increasingly negative effects
   on vegetation cover over time. In contrast, ecological restoration
   projects and the development of ecotourism in the wetlands have improved
   vegetation cover. The impact of natural conditions in the delta
   (temperature, precipitation, and sea level rise) showed no consistent
   trend, but overall, seem to have had a positive effect. These findings
   have significant implications for conservation and the management of
   reclamation activities in the Yellow River Delta.},

Title = {Estimation of satellite-derived lake water surface temperatures in the

   imagery and a long-term field dataset using a time series approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a key parameter to help study
   the environmental and ecological impacts of climate change. In this
   work, we measured the LSWT of 1 natural and 23 artificial lakes located
   on the island of Sardinia in the western Mediterranean, which is a
   region where changes in climate are projected to have significant
   impacts. By integrating multi-source and multi-resolution datasets of
   the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat
   and long-term in situ temperature observations, we detected, measured,
   and analysed the LSWT trends during the period of 2000-2018 across all
   the investigated lakes.
   Methodologically, we demonstrated that a simplified approached based on
   Planck's equation for Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) data could be a
   valid alternative to radiative transfer equation retrieval methods for
   the retrieval of LSWT without loss of accuracy. Moreover, we
   demonstrated that rescaled and independently validated MOD112A-derived
   LSWT showed good accuracy, efficiently filled the spatial and temporal
   gaps in long-term in situ LSWT, and could be used for long-term LSWT
   trend detection and measurement.
   All 24 lakes showed an annual warming trend of +0.010 degrees C/y,
   warming winter trend of +0.013 degrees C/y, and cooling summer trend of
   -0.038 degrees C/y during the period of 2000-2018. This study
   demonstrated that the measured trend rates could be explained by and
   were strongly correlated with the climatology of Italy for the 2000-2018
   period. Finally, we demonstrated the key role and the importance of the
   availability of long-term in situ temperature datasets. The approach
   used in this study is up-scalable to other medium to low-resolution TIR
   sensors as well as to other long-term monitoring sites, such as
   LTER-Italy, LTER-Europe, or ILTER sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Model testing of deepwater offshore structures often requires the use of
   statically-equivalent deepwater mooring systems. The need for such
   equivalent systems arises due to the spatial limitations of wave basins
   in accommodating the dimensions of the direct-scaled mooring system.
   With the equivalent mooring system in place and connected to the model
   floater, the static global restoring forces and global stiffness of the
   prototype floating structure can be matched (to within some tolerance)
   by those of the model for specified offsets in the required degrees of
   freedom. A match in relevant static properties of the system provides
   the basis for comparisons of dynamic responses of the model and
   prototype floaters. Although some commercial programs are capable of
   designing equivalent mooring systems, the physics applied in these
   programs are protected by intellectual property, and their methodologies
   are generally inflexible. This paper illustrates a concise approach to
   the design of statically-equivalent deepwater mooring systems. With this
   approach, either manual or advanced optimization techniques can be
   applied as needed based on the complexity of the equivalent system to be
   designed. A simple iterative scheme is applied in solving the elastic
   catenary equations for the optimal static configuration of each mooring
   line. Discussions cover the approach as applied in developing a
   fit-for-purpose tool called STAMOORSYS, its validation, and its
   application to the design of an equivalent mooring system for a spar
   platform in deepwater. The spar model parameters are representative of a
   structure which could be tested in the Offshore Technology Research
   Center, College Station, Texas, USA. Results show that the method is
   capable of producing good design solutions using manual optimization and
   a genetic algorithm.},

Abstract = {According to the complex real-time water situation, the real-time
   simulation of large-scale floods is very important for flood prevention
   practice. Model robustness and running efficiency are two critical
   factors in successful real-time flood simulation. This paper proposed a
   robust, two-dimensional, shallow water model based on the unstructured
   Godunov-type finite volume method. A robust wet/dry front method is used
   to enhance the numerical stability. An adaptive method is proposed to
   improve the running efficiency. The proposed model is used for
   large-scale flood simulation on real topography. Results compared to
   those of MIKE21 show the strong performance of the proposed model.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) transformations in estuarine and coastal ecosystems play a
   crucial role in the global biogeochemical cycles. However, simultaneous
   estimation of gross N transformations and the underlying drivers across
   estuarine and intertidal wetlands remain poorly understood. Here, the
   spatial changes in gross N transformation rates and related functional
   gene abundances were explored in varying habitats of the intertidal zone
   in the Yangtze Es-tuary via an optimized 15N tracing model and
   quantitative PCR. The results indicate that the gross N trans-formation
   rates changed remarkably in estuarine and intertidal wetlands, with
   comparatively higher gross N transformation rates at the upper
   freshwater and low-salinity sites relative to high-salinity sites.
   Meanwhile, the functional gene abundances (amoB, UreC, hzo, nirS and
   nrfA) exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern to corresponding
   N transformation processes. Sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC),
   nitrite (NO2-), ferrous iron (Fe(II)), and microbial functional gene
   abundances jointly mediated the gross N transformations. This study
   carried out the first simultaneous estimation of the gross N
   transformation pattern and driving factors in estu-arine and intertidal
   ecosystems based on the optimized 15N tracing model, providing a better
   understanding of internal mechanisms on the N cycling and strategy for
   estuarine and coastal N management.},

Volume = {56},

Pages = {4-13},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Key steps in atmospheric evolution occurred in the Archaean. The Hadean
   atmosphere was created by the inorganic processes of volatile accretion
   from space and degassing from the interior, and then modified by
   chemical and photochemical processes. The air was probably initially
   anoxic, though there may have been a supply of oxidation power as a
   consequence of hydrodynamic escape to space of hydrogen from water.
   Early subduction may have removed CO2 and the Hadean planet may have
   been icy. In the Archaean, as anoxygenic and then oxygenic
   photosynthesis evolved, biological activity remade the atmosphere.
   Sedimentological evidence implies there were liquid oceans despite the
   faint young Sun. These oceans may have been sustained by the greenhouse
   warming effect of biologically-made methane. Oxygenesis in the late
   Archaean would have released free O-2 into the water. This would have
   created oxic surface waters, challenging the methane greenhouse. After
   the Great Oxidation Event around 2.3 to 2.4 billion years ago, the
   atmosphere itself became oxic, perhaps triggering a glacial crisis by
   cutting methane-caused greenhouse warming. By the early Proterozoic, all
   the key biochemical processes that maintain the modern atmosphere were
   probably present in the microbial community.},

Abstract = {Participatory methods in `conservation for development' projects
   regularly fail to live up to expectations of social and environmental
   change. Stakeholder workshops are an ubiquitous example that can
   reproduce rather than challenge inequality and exclusion. Technical
   tools used in workshops, like maps, games, and computer models, are
   criticised for unjustly privileging expert/scientific viewpoints over
   other perspectives. Iris Marion Young's theory of communicative
   democracy is an insightful and robust framework to examine how people
   interact in the workshop `contact zone', and how to bring workshops
   closer to participatory ideals. Young identifies four communication
   modes critical for inclusive participation: greeting, rhetoric,
   narrative, and argument. We apply her framework to a case study of
   fisheries stakeholder workshops in the Philippines, demonstrating its
   utility and cultural applicability. The workshops used a game-based
   computer modelling tool to structure discussions about coastal
   management. Qualitative analysis of video data shows how stakeholders
   signalled resistance, garnered sympathy, influenced outcomes, and
   established relationships through Young's modes of communication. Based
   on this analysis, and using concepts from Philippine psychology, we
   conclude that workshops have potential as `rehearsal spaces' for
   inclusive deliberation, particularly when they encourage improvisation
   and humour, rather than rote adherence to standardised activities.},

Abstract = {The development of high value crops for domestic consumption and export
   is considered a priority for economic development and improved
   livelihoods for many Pacific Island countries. However, attempts to
   intensify production without adequate attention to research and
   development in areas such as identification of well-adapted cultivars
   may lead to gains being limited and short-lived. The Australian Centre
   for International Agricultural Research project ``Strengthening
   integrated crop management research in the Pacific Islands in support of
   sustainable intensification of high value crop production{''} aims to
   build and sustain capacity to develop integrated crop management
   strategies for the sustainable intensification of high value crop
   production for export and domestic markets. Activities include the
   introduction and evaluation of performance of improved solanaceous
   cultivars in each target country, and the testing of integrated
   technologies for their efficacy to increase and extend vegetable
   production seasons. Tomato is a high-value crop in Fiji and the Solomon
   Islands. It is commonly grown by farmers for household consumption and
   the domestic market. Eleven improved open pollinated tomato cultivars
   sourced from the World Vegetable Center in Taiwan were evaluated over
   three cropping seasons. Three cultivars ('CLN3150A-5', `CLN2585D' and
   `CLN2071D') were selected and officially released in Fiji and the
   Solomon Islands. The released cultivars now locally known as `Melrose'
   and `Rio Gold' in Fiji, and `Rose's Choice' in the Solomon Islands,
   performed well under local growing conditions and are high yielding,
   producing well-shaped fruit with a taste preferred by local consumers.
   For farmers, these new open pollinated cultivars provide an opportunity
   to produce for the local market and also to save their own seeds for
   small-scale planting. This was a milestone achievement for project
   partners - local agriculture ministries, the Pacific Community, the
   University of Queensland, and the World Vegetable Center.},

   (DDTs) was evaluated for four different freshwater fish species (Orienus
   plagiostomus, Tor putitora, Glyptothorax punjabensis, and Cyprinus
   carpio) in in situ riverine conditions of Kabul River, Pakistan.
   The congeners of HCH and DDT were quantified using gas chromatograph
   (GC-ECD). The BSAF for each congener (HCHs and DDTs) was calculated from
   paired observation of congener's measured concentrations in fish and
   sediment taken at the same site. Pearson's correlation and linear
   regression analyses were performed to determine the influence of
   sediment organic carbon fraction (f (soc) ) and organism lipid fraction
   (f (lipid) ) on BSAF, and the relationship between BSAFs and logarithm
   of octanol-water partition coefficients (log K (ow)s) of HCH and DDT
   congeners, respectively.
   The BSAFs for total HCH (t-HCH) and total DDT (t-DDT) ranged from 0.6 to
   1.5 and from 0.2 to 1.6, respectively. The model was significantly
   influenced by both fish (p = 0.004) and chemical types (p = 0.002) at 95
   \% confidence level. The sediment organic carbon fraction (f (soc) ) and
   fish lipid fraction (f (lipid) ) had not-too-weak effects on BSAF values
   for all fish species. The BSAF values were linearly fitted with
   logarithmic octanol-water partition coefficients (log K (ow)s) of HCH
   and DDT congeners, despite the different chemical structures, and
   different compound class significant negative correlations between log K
   (ow)s and BSAF values were found, indicating that hydrophobicity is one
   of the key factors influencing the bioaccumulation potential of the
   investigated compounds.
   The present study confirmed the applicability of the BSAF model as a
   screening tool for predicting bioaccumulation of sediment-associated HCH
   and DDT congeners in investigated fish species under small-scale in situ
   riverine conditions of Kabul River and suite the model for benthic fish
   (G. punjabensis) on the basis of the 25th and 75th percentiles of
   congener-specific BSAF values.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variability of carbon budgets of shallow South
   African subtropical estuaries},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {626},
Pages = {915-926},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Estuarine carbon fluxes constitute a significant component of coastal
   CO2 emissions and nutrients recycling, buthigh uncertainty is still
   present due to the heterogeneity of these areas. Although South Africa
   has nearly 300 estuaries, very little is known about their contribution
   to carbon emissions or sequestration. This study aims to provide a first
   estimation of the carbon emissions and nutrient fluxes of South African
   sub-tropical estuaries through a direct quantification of respiration,
   primary production and nutrient regeneration of benthic and planktonic
   communities. In order to account for the extreme variability in
   subtropical estuarine areas, due to seasonality in rainfall, two
   estuaries with opposite characteristics were studied; the temporarily
   open/closed Mdloti Estuary subjected to strong anthropic pressure, and
   the permanently open Mlalazi Estuary located in a natural reserve. Field
   deployment of benthic chambers and clear/dark bottles assessed oxygen,
   ammonia and phosphate fluxes of both benthic and planktonic communities.
   An inverse pattern between benthic and pelagic primary production was
   found in both estuaries. Different drivers related to mouth status and
   sediment characteristics were identified in the two estuaries. The
   annual average carbon emission indicates that the two systems are
   heterotrophic over the year releasing substantial CO2 emissions into the
   atmosphere. Results show that carbon fluxes in subtropical estuaries are
   extremely variable in space and time. Future up-scaling carbon
   estimations need to account for those small scale and regional dynamics.

Abstract = {The photosynthetic gas-exchange has been assessed traditionally either
   as O-2 evolution or CO2 consumption. In this study, we used a
   liquid-phase O-2 electrode combined with CO2 optodes to examine
   simultaneously photosynthesis in intact leaves of mangrove Rhizophora
   mucronata. We verified suitable conditions for leaf photosynthetic rates
   by assessing pH levels and NaHCO3 concentrations and compared these to
   the gas-exchange method at various PAR levels. The photosynthetic rate
   in response to pH exhibited a similar pattern both for O-2 evolution and
   CO2 consumption, and higher rates were associated with intermediate pH
   compared with low and high pH values. The net photosynthetic quotient
   (PQ) of R. mucronata leaves ranged from 1.04-1.28. The PQ values, which
   were never lesser than 1, suggested that photorespiration did not occur
   in R. mucronata leaves under aqueous conditions. The similar maximum
   photosynthetic rates suggested that all measurements had a high capacity
   to adjust the photosynthetic apparatus under a light saturation
   condition. The simultaneous measurements of O-2 evolution and CO2
   consumption using the Clark oxygen electrode polarographic sensor with
   the CO2 optode sensor provided a simple, stable, and precise measurement
   of PQ under aqueous and saturated light conditions.},

Title = {Effect modifications of green space and blue space on heat-mortality

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {838},
Number = {2},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background: Despite emerging recognition of the benefits of green and
   blue spaces on human health, evidence for their effect modifications on
   heat-mortality associations is limited. We aimed to investigate the
   effect modifications of green and blue spaces on heat-mortality
   associations among different age and sex groups and at different heat
   levels.Methods: Daily mortality and meteorological data from 2008 to
   2017 in Hong Kong, China were collected. The Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index and distance to coast were used as proxies for green
   and blue space exposure, respectively. Time-series analyses was
   performed using fitting generalized linear mixed models with an
   interaction term between heat and levels of exposure to either green or
   blue space. Age-, sex-, and heat level-stratified analyses were also
   conducted.Results: With a 1 degrees C increase in temperature above the
   90th percentile (29.61 degrees C), mortality increased by 5.7\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.6, 10.1\%), 5.4\% (1.4, 9.5\%), and 4.6\%
   (0.8, 8.9\%) for low, medium and high levels of green space exposure,
   respectively, and by 7.5\% (3.9, 11.2\%) and 3.5\% (0.3, 6.8\%) for low
   and high levels of blue space exposure, respectively. Significant effect
   modifications of green and blue spaces were not observed for the whole
   population or any specific age and sex group, either at a moderate heat
   level or a heat level (Ps > 0.05). Conclusions: No significant effect
   modifications of green and blue spaces on heat-related mortality risk
   were observed in Hong Kong. These findings challenge the existing
   evidence on the prominent protective role of green and blue spaces in
   mitigating heat-related mortality risks.},

Abstract = {Ornate threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon) is an economically important
   fishery species in Southeast Asia. In Thailand, N. hexodon decreased
   dramatically due to overexploitation for commercial purposes. To
   construct an effective sustainable management plan, genetic information
   is necessary. Thus, in our study, the population genetic structure and
   demographic history of N. hexodon were investigated using 419 bp of the
   mitochondrial DNA sequence in cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (mtDNA
   COI). A total of 142 samples was collected from nine localities in the
   Gulf of Thailand (Chonburi, Samut Songkhram, Surat Thani, Nakhon Si
   Thammarat, Songkhla), and the Andaman Sea (Satun, Trang, Krabi, Phang
   Nga). Fourteen polymorphic sites defined 18 haplotypes, revealing a high
   haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity among nine localities.
   The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) analysis, pairwise FST, and
   minimum spanning network result revealed that the genetic structure of
   N. hexodon was separated into two populations: the Gulf of Thailand and
   the Andaman Sea population. The genetic structure of N. hexodon can be
   explained by a disruption of gene flow from the geographic barrier and
   the Pleistocene isolation of the marine basin hypothesis. Neutrality
   tests, Bayesian skyline analysis, mismatch distribution, and the
   estimated values of population growth suggested that N. hexodon had
   experienced a population expansion. The genetic information would
   certainly help us gain insight into the population genetic structure of
   N. hexodon living on the coast of Thailand.},

Abstract = {The interest in Direct Electrical Heating (DEH) is increasing and the
   system is being planned for flow assurance in development of oil fields
   on continental shelf around the world. The DEH system is selected due to
   several advantages:
   Allow production of fields that earlier is considered as not feasible
   Effective solution with high heat input
   Easy to install and operate
   Reliable components
   Can be retrofitted on pipelines in operation
   Implementation require minor modification
   The running costs are considerably reduced compared to traditional
   methods utilising chemicals
   At present it is installed on several subsea pipelines in the North Sea
   and DEH is applied actively to prevent hydrate formation during shut
   downs for a total accumulated use of 1 year during the lifetime of the
   field.
   For the new fields being planned with DEH there are several challenges
   due to extended design basis regarding:
   Continuously use of DEH during the lifetime of the field.
   Flow assurance of waxy unprocessed wellstream, requiring large heat

   Impact of steel armoured concrete pipe weight coating
   Use in shallow water
   Heating of risers and spool-pieces
   As the pipeline is an active conductor in the heating system a special
   anode design is required, both to ensure sufficient grounding for the
   heating system and for corrosion protection regarding ac (alternating
   current). The design of the anode system is strongly related to time of
   use. This is one of the main challenges with continuous operation of
   DEH.
   Furthermore the design of the electrical cables is important regarding
   mechanical and thermal stresses. The lifetime of the cable depends on
   several factors. The lifetime of the DEH installation decreases with
   increasing cable temperature and with frequent use.
   It is necessary to obtain the electrical and magnetic characteristics of
   steel pipe materials. Both these characteristics determine the pipeline
   impedance. These data are required input for rating (electrical and
   thermal) of DEH and the anode design layout.},

Title = {Focused hydrocarbon-migration in shallow sediments of a pockmark cluster

Abstract = {The Niger Delta is one of the largest hydrocarbon basin offshore Africa
   and it is well known for the presence of active pockmarks on the seabed.
   During the Guineco-MeBo cruise in 2011, long cores were taken from a
   pockmark cluster in order to investigate the state of its current
   activity. Gas hydrates, oil, and pore-water were sampled for geochemical
   studies. The resulting dataset combined with seismic data reveal that
   shallow hydrocarbon migration in the upper sedimentary section was
   focused exclusively within the pockmarks. There is a clear tendency for
   gas migration within the hydrate-bearing pockmarks, and oil migration
   within the carbonate-rich one. This trend is interpreted as a
   consequence of hydrate dissolution followed by carbonate precipitation
   in the course of the evolution of these pockmarks. We also demonstrate
   that Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM) is the main process
   responsible for the depletion of pore-water sulfate, with depths of the
   Sulfate-Methane Transition Zone (SMTZ) ranging between 1.8 and 33.4 m.
   In addition, a numerical transport-reaction model was used to estimate
   the age of hydrate-layer formation from the present-day sulfate
   profiles. The results show that the sampled hydrate-layers were formed
   between 21 and 3750 years before present. Overall, this work shows the
   importance of fluid flow on the dynamics of pockmarks, and the
   investigated cluster offers new opportunities for future cross-site
   comparison studies. Our results imply that sudden discharges of gas can
   create hydrate layers within the upper sedimentary column which can
   affect the seafloor morphology over few decades.},

Abstract = {Tropical forests are characterized by high tree biomass that forms a
   dense canopy, thereby reducing the amount of light that reaches forest
   streams. Forest streams are likely to receive large amounts of organic
   matter in the form of leaf litter and also have low primary production
   relative to more open forested systems. Forest clearing can, therefore,
   affect the in-stream carbon cycle by increasing carbon immobilization
   and decreasing mineralization. We addressed the question of whether
   heavily shaded streams are bottom-up limited by light and nutrients or
   top-down limited by grazers. To answer these questions, we
   experimentally manipulated nutrients and grazers in enclosures
   established in either a shaded or a partially open stretch of an
   Atlantic Forest stream in Brazil. Algal biomass in this stream was low
   (51.5 to 367.2 mg chl a /m(2)). Prior tree removal resulted in a 58\%
   increase in light in the semi-open stream area, and enclosures in this
   area had a 2.7 x increase in algal biomass and a 4x increase in primary
   production (from 10-40 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) relative to enclosures in
   shaded areas. Nutrient (P) addition had no effect on algal standing
   crop. Grazing by the caddisfly Helicopsyche caused a similar to 50\%
   reduction in algal biomass. The addition of the most abundant predator,
   the stonefly Anacroneuria, to the enclosures did not reduce feeding by
   Helicopsyche. Substrates in the shaded and semi-open stretches differed
   in the dominance of some algal taxa, and grazing appeared to favor the
   cyanobacteria Dolichospermum sp. over diatoms. We conclude that algae in
   forested, low-order streams in the Atlantic Forest are limited by both
   top-down (herbivory) and bottom-up (light) factors. These findings
   suggest that tree removal in riparian areas can cause small changes to
   light availability in streams, but that even small changes can have
   profound effects on primary producers and, therefore, energy supply for
   stream consumers.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Turbulent mixing driven by breaking internal tides plays a primary role
   in the meridional overturning and oceanic heat budget. Most current
   climate models explicitly parameterize only the local dissipation of
   internal tides at the generation sites, representing the remote
   dissipation of low-mode internal tides that propagate away through a
   uniform background diffusivity. In this study, a simple energetically
   consistent parameterization of the low-mode internal-tide dissipation is
   derived and implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
   Earth System Model with GOLD component (GFDL-ESM2G). The impact of
   remote and local internal-tide dissipation on the ocean state is
   examined using a series of simulations with the same total amount of
   energy input for mixing, but with different scalings of the vertical
   profile of dissipation with the stratification and with different
   idealized scenarios for the distribution of the low-mode internal-tide
   energy dissipation: uniformly over ocean basins, continental slopes, or
   continental shelves. In these idealized scenarios, the ocean state,
   including the meridional overturning circulation, ocean ventilation,
   main thermocline thickness, and ocean heat uptake, is particularly
   sensitive to the vertical distribution of mixing by breaking low-mode
   internal tides. Less sensitivity is found to the horizontal distribution
   of mixing, provided that distribution is in the open ocean. Mixing on
   coastal shelves only impacts the large-scale circulation and water mass
   properties where it modifies water masses originating on shelves. More
   complete descriptions of the distribution of the remote part of
   internal-tide-drivenmixing, particularly in the vertical and relative to
   water mass formation regions, are therefore required to fully
   parameterize ocean turbulent mixing.},

Title = {Citrate as a possible iron-pooling substance in the marine diatom
   Thalassiosira pseudonana},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {163},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An iron (Fe)-binding substance (FeBS) was sought for the marine diatom
   Thalassiosira pseudonana, because the organism is devoid of a gene that
   encodes the predominant Fe storage protein ferritin. High-performance
   liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma/emission mass
   spectrometry (HPLC-ICP/MS) analysis of an extract of diatom cells
   indicated the presence of an FeBS specific to the cells grown in
   Fe-replete medium. Heat treatment followed by anion-exchange
   chromatography with monitoring of Fe(III)-dissolving activity was used
   to isolate the FeBS from the cell extract. Structural analysis using H-1
   NMR spectrometry demonstrated that the FeBS was composed of citrate. In
   addition, HPLC-ICP/MS together with ESI-MS demonstrated that the FeBS
   was likely a triferric tricitrate complex. Although the citrate content
   of the diatom cells was enhanced according to the Fe nutritional status
   of the medium, this phenomenon seemed to occur by an indirect mechanism,
   as a previous report demonstrated a reduced citrate content in T.
   pseudonana cells grown in Fe-replete medium (Bromke et al. in Plos One
   doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067340, 2013). It is most likely that, based
   on the extended Redfield ratio 121(C):16(N): 1(P):0.0075(Fe), the
   culture used in the current study may have suffered from nutrient
   deficiency of a major element, such as nitrogen. Such a situation may
   occur frequently for this open sea diatom. As windblown dust is a
   prevailing Fe source for the open oceanic diatom T. pseudonana, a rapid
   elevation in Fe concentration in the seawater can render the cells
   nitrogen deficient, causing enhanced citrate synthesis and resulting in
   the formation of a triferric tricitrate complex as Fe storage machinery.},

Abstract = {In this study, diets containing 5, 10, 15, and 20\% Gracilaria
   lemaneiformis (GL) (D1-D4 diet) were prepared to investigate the effects
   of GL on growth performance, carcass composition, activities of
   digestive enzymes, transaminases activities of black sea bream
   (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) juvenile. Weight Gain (WG) and Feed
   Efficiency Ratio (FER) of the fish fed D4 diet were significantly lower
   than that of control group. Fish fed with the D4 diet showed
   significantly lower crude lipid of both body and liver and
   Hepato-Somatic Index (HSI) than those fed with the control diet.
   Activities of pepsin in the stomach, lipase and amylase in the anterior
   intestinewere significantly suppressed in fish which were fed with the
   D4 diet (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the activities of serum aspartate
   aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were
   significantly higher in fish which were fed with the D4 diet (P < 0.05)
   than that of the control group. These results indicate that
   incorporation of the GL in the diet at up to 15\% level for juvenile
   black sea bream is feasible in terms of the growth performance and the
   physiological state. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Light-driven catalysis-assisted uranium extraction from seawater opens
   up a promising avenue to enhance the extraction capacity, kinetics, and
   selectivity for uranium removal. Herein, we report novel ternary boron
   carbon nitride hollow nanotubes (BCN-HNTs) with tunable p-n homojunction
   as metal-free photocatalyst for efficient uranium extraction. Relying on
   the density functional theory calculations, in conjunction with other
   spectral analyses, we distinguish the six-membered carbon rings
   introduced in h-BN to form a tunable p-n homojunction. Accordingly, the
   BCN-HNTs exhibit a remarkable U(VI) removal rate of > 95\% under a wide
   range of uranium concentrations. By virtue of the X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy technique, we identify the conversion of 3Oax-U-4Oeq
   moieties into the 2Oax-U-3Oeq moieties during the transition from dark
   to light conditions, further verifying the reduction of high-valent
   uranium. In addition, we find that the introduction of carbon into h-BN
   lattice enhances the adsorption energy for uranium species, thereby
   improving the extraction capacity of uranium.},

Title = {In situ observations of coral bleaching in the central Saudi Arabian Red
   Sea during the 2015/2016 global coral bleaching event},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching continues to be one of the most devastating and
   immediate impacts of climate change on coral reef ecosystems worldwide.
   In 2015, a major bleaching event was declared as the ``3rd global coral
   bleaching event{''} by the United States National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration, impacting a large number of reefs in every
   major ocean. The Red Sea was no exception, and we present herein in situ
   observations of the status of coral reefs in the central Saudi Arabian
   Red Sea from September 2015, following extended periods of high
   temperatures reaching upwards of 32.5 degrees C in our study area. We
   examined eleven reefs using line-intercept transects at three different
   depths, including all reefs that were surveyed during a previous
   bleaching event in 2010. Bleaching was most prevalent on inshore reefs
   (55.6\% +/- 14.6\% of live coral cover exhibited bleaching) and on
   shallower transects (41\% +/- 10.2\% of live corals surveyed at 5m
   depth) within reefs. Similar taxonomic groups (e.g., Agariciidae) were
   affected in 2015 and in 2010. Most interestingly, Acropora and Porites
   had similar bleaching rates (similar to 30\% each) and similar relative
   coral cover (similar to 7\% each) across all reefs in 2015. Coral genera
   with the highest levels of bleaching (>60\%) were also among the rarest
   (<1\% of coral cover) in 2015. While this bodes well for the relative
   retention of coral cover, it may ultimately lead to decreased species
   richness, often considered an important component of a healthy coral
   reef. The resultant long-term changes in these coral reef communities
   remain to be seen.},

Title = {Shear Response of Wet Weak Carbonate Rock/Grout Interfaces Under Cyclic
   Loading},
Journal = {ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {The development and construction of offshore wind farms requires the
   correct estimation of the friction that can be mobilised at the
   rock/grout interface. In conventional studies, the shear behaviour of a
   joint is usually investigated with laboratory tests under constant
   normal load/stress (CNL), however, in engineering practice, direct shear
   testing under constant normal stiffness (CNS) has been proved to be more
   realistic in the assessment of the development of the side shear
   resistance in rock grouted pile design. In this work, an extensive
   experimental campaign on the shear response of a weak carbonate rock
   (limestone) interface with grout is presented, in the frame of offshore
   wind turbines. First, basic mechanical testing is performed on the two
   interface materials in order to evaluate their mechanical properties.
   The output of these tests reveals not only the contrasting properties of
   the two interacting materials, but also the decreased response of the
   limestone in the presence of water. A series of monotonic shear tests
   (both under CNL and CNS conditions) on wet rough limestone/grout
   interfaces reveal the high impact of adhesion between the two materials
   to the mechanical response. Based on the monotonic results, a number of
   CNS shear tests under cyclic loading takes place, where different
   failure modes are observed dilatant and contractant response. The
   variability of the failure mode is strongly related not only to the
   adhesion created with the cast grout, but also to the limestone's
   micro-structural heterogeneity that manifests already after
   consolidation. The post-shear morphological state of the interface is
   analysed, while the variability of the failure surface and the presence
   of water gouge creation do not allow a clear correlation of the
   morphologfy to the mechanical response. Overall, the response of this
   type of weak rock interface where the properties of the grout are
   significantly higher, is governed by the behaviour of the rock.},

Abstract = {In 1994, an opportunity arose to augment the expanding research
   activities in photovoltaic at the University of Southampton with a
   large-scale test in building integrated photovoltaic technology.
   Building 2 on the University's Highfield Campus was earmarked for
   renovation both internally and externally. The University welcomed the
   opportunity to combine the refurbishment of the facades with the
   installation of the PV cladding. This, at the time, had the added
   advantage of combining University requirements with the aim of the UK
   photovoltaic community to have an installation and an exemplar PV system
   for test and development on the south coast of England. The data
   collected from such an installation will be used to address the paucity
   of information concerning the use and implementation of PV technology.
   The work on the installation is described in the paper, giving
   step-by-step explanations of processes undertaken and problems
   encountered from initial design brief to final `switch on' of the PV
   facade. The difficulties encountered during both the design, contracting
   and installation phases of the project are detailed. The aim of this
   paper is to highlight the success of the project and to outline some of
   the difficulties encountered so that other similar projects will
   hopefully be able to avoid such pitfalls. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {The present-day vegetation in the tropics is mainly characterized by
   forests worldwide except in tropical East Africa, where forests only
   occur as patches at the coast and in the uplands. These forest patches
   result from the peculiar aridity that is linked to the uplift of the
   region during the Late Cenozoic. The Late Cenozoic vegetation history of
   East Africa is of particular interest as it has set the scene for the
   contemporary events in mammal and hominin evolution. In this study, we
   investigate the conditions under which these forest patches could have
   been connected, and a previous continuous forest belt could have
   extended and fragmented. We apply a dynamic vegetation model with a set
   of climatic scenarios in which we systematically alter the present-day
   environmental conditions such that they would be more favourable for a
   continuous forest belt in tropical East Africa. We consider varying
   environmental factors, namely temperature, precipitation and atmospheric
   CO2 concentrations. Our results show that all of these variables play a
   significant role in supporting the forest biomes and a continuous forest
   belt could have occurred under certain combinations of these settings.
   With our current knowledge of the palaeoenvironmental history of East
   Africa, it is likely that the region hosted these conditions during the
   Late Cenozoic. Recent improvements on environmental hypotheses of
   hominin evolution highlight the role of periods of short and extreme
   climate variability during the Late Cenozoic specific to East Africa in
   driving evolution. Our results elucidate how the forest biomes of East
   Africa can appear and disappear under fluctuating environmental
   conditions and demonstrate how this climate variability might be
   recognized on the biosphere level. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Time series covering up to four decades reveals major changes and
   drivers of marine growth and proportion of repeat spawners in an
   Atlantic salmon population},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Wild Atlantic salmon populations have declined in many regions and are
   affected by diverse natural and anthropogenic factors. To facilitate
   management guidelines, precise knowledge of mechanisms driving
   population changes in demographics and life history traits is needed.
   Our analyses were conducted on (a) age and growth data from scales of
   salmon caught by angling in the river Etneelva, Norway, covering smolt
   year classes from 1980 to 2018, (b) extensive sampling of the whole
   spawning run in the fish trap from 2013 onwards, and (c) time series of
   sea surface temperature, zooplankton biomass, and salmon lice
   infestation intensity. Marine growth during the first year at sea
   displayed a distinct stepwise decline across the four decades.
   Simultaneously, the population shifted from predominantly 1SW to 2SW
   salmon, and the proportion of repeat spawners increased from 3 to 7\%.
   The latter observation is most evident in females and likely due to
   decreased marine exploitation. Female repeat spawners tended to be less
   catchable than males by anglers. Depending on the time period analyzed,
   marine growth rate during the first year at sea was both positively and
   negatively associated with sea surface temperature. Zooplankton biomass
   was positively associated with growth, while salmon lice infestation
   intensity was negatively associated with growth. Collectively, these
   results are likely to be linked with both changes in oceanic conditions
   and harvest regimes. Our conflicting results regarding the influence of
   sea surface temperature on marine growth are likely to be caused by
   long-term increases in temperature, which may have triggered (or
   coincided with) ecosystem shifts creating generally poorer growth
   conditions over time, but within shorter datasets warmer years gave
   generally higher growth. We encourage management authorities to expand
   the use of permanently monitored reference rivers with complete trapping
   facilities, like the river Etneelva, generating valuable long-term data
   for future analyses.},

Title = {Origins, seasonality, and fluxes of organic matter in the Congo River},

Abstract = {The Congo River in central Africa represents a major source of organic
   matter (OM) to the Atlantic Ocean. This study examined elemental (\%OC,
   \%N, and C:N), stable isotopic (C-13 and N-15), and biomarker
   composition (lignin phenols) of particulate OM (POM) and dissolved OM
   (DOM) across the seasonal hydrograph. Even though the Congo exhibits an
   extremely stable intra-annual discharge regime, seasonal variability in
   OM composition was evident. DOM appears predominantly derived from
   vascular plant inputs with greater relative contribution during the
   rising limb and peak in discharge associated with the major
   November-December discharge maximum. Generally, POM appears to be
   sourced from soil-derived mineral-associated OM (low C:N, low (8), and
   higher (Ad:Al)(v)) but the relative proportion of fresh vascular plant
   material (higher C:N, higher (8), and lower (Ad:Al)(v)) increases with
   higher discharge. During the study period (September 2009 to November
   2010) the Congo exported 29.21Tgyr(-1) of total suspended sediment
   (TSS), 1.96Tgyr(-1) of particulate organic carbon (POC), and
   12.48Tgyr(-1) of dissolved organic carbon. The Congo exports an order of
   magnitude lower TSS load in comparison to other major riverine sources
   of TSS (e.g., Ganges and Brahmaputra), but due to its OM-rich character
   it actually exports a comparable amount of POC. The Congo is also 2.5
   times more efficient at exporting dissolved lignin per unit volume
   compared to the Amazon. Including Congo dissolved lignin data in
   residence time calculations for lignin in the Atlantic Ocean results in
   an approximately 10\% reduction from the existing estimate, suggesting
   that this material is more reactive than previously thought.},

Title = {Estimation of Air Surface Temperature From Remote Sensing Images and

Abstract = {The knowledge of air temperature near the Earth's surface plays a
   relevant role in weather and climate studies as well as in the framework
   of solar energy management; e. g., for identifying the most suitable
   locations for a new solar installation or monitoring the performance of
   existing systems. Remote sensing allows air temperature to be estimated
   on a spatially distributed basis, thus complementing the spatially
   sparse observations collected by ground micro-meteorological stations.
   In this paper, a novel approach to periodic (e. g., daily or monthly)
   air temperature estimation from satellite images based on support vector
   machines (SVMs) is proposed. A recently developed SVM-based approach to
   supervised land and sea surface temperature estimation using satellite
   images is generalized to the case of air temperature and integrated with
   case-specific techniques aimed at computing periodic statistics of air
   temperature using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The method is
   fully automated and allows the statistics of the estimation error to be
   modeled on a pixelwise basis. This last result is accomplished by
   combining nonstationary multidimensional stochastic processes and
   Clark's variance approximation. The method is experimentally validated
   with MSG-SEVIRI data acquired over Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (France).},

Abstract = {The bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa in water has adversely affected
   water quality local economies and human health Therefore restricting the

   growth of M aeruginosa and kill the bacteria when it is combined with
   simulated solar radiation energy was prepared and characterised Compared
   with AgNO3 and NaBiO3 AgBiO3 had a stronger deleterious effect on
   Microcystis cultured in BG11 with natural light whereas NaBiO3 was the
   weakest inhibitor This data combined with the results of morphological
   analyses the determination of chlorophyll a levels and the rate of
   electrolyte leakage demonstrates that AgBiO3 can inhibit the
   proliferation cif Microcystis due to its high photocatalytic activity
   which irreversibly damages the cell walls and membranes As such AgBiO3

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using polypropylene
   fiber-cement-stabilized coastal clay as base-course material or
   foundation material for city sustainable development by assessing its
   mechanical performance. The influence of the number of freeze-thaw
   cycles and curing ages on the mechanical properties of ordinary cemented
   clay (OCC) and polypropylene fiber-cemented clay (PCC) was investigated
   by using unconfined compressive test. The experimental results show that
   the addition of fiber with 1\% content can increase the strength as well
   as the ductility of cemented clay by 12.5\% and 15.6\%, respectively.
   The strength of PCC and OCC at 22d age was 1.5 times than at 7d age.
   Under differently timed freeze-thaw cycles, the mechanical performance
   of PCC is improved, and, better than that, OCC improves by 11.8\% in
   strength, 16.5\% in strain and by 5\% in degree of damage, indicating
   that fiber can improve the freeze-thaw resistance of cemented clay. The
   frost resistance of PCC and OCC increases with the increase in curing
   age. Finally, the variation of strength of OCC was explained through the
   change of micro-structure while the strength enhancing mechanism of
   polypropylene fiber for cemented clay was also revealed.},

Abstract = {In order to exploit renewable energies form tidal currents, a unique
   counter-rotating type horizontal-axis tidal turbine was proposed in this
   paper. Although a counter-rotating type horizontal-axis wind turbine can
   be taken as a reference in designing the proposed counter-rotating tidal
   turbine, there are some different characteristics such as the effects of
   the free surface and the occurrence of cavitation. The unique tidal
   turbine in this paper was preliminarily designed on the basis of the
   in-house wind turbine, and then CFD analysis and experimental test were
   carried out to evaluate its performance. For the extreme conditions
   where severe flow separation and vortex exist, the comparison of the
   power coefficients generated by the turbine between the CFD predictions
   and the experimental data shows not so good. However, good agreement has
   been obtained for the comfortable blade pitch setting angles and over a
   range of tip speed ratios, which provides an evidence of validation of
   CFD analysis. Such results give sufficient confidence that the CFD model
   set up here is suitable for the further works.},

Abstract = {Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a marine diatom, rich in omega-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acids especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
   brown pigment, that is, fucoxanthin. These high-value renewables (HVRs)
   have a high commercial and nutritional relevance. In this study, our
   focus was to enhance the productivities of such renewables by employing
   media engineering strategy via., photoautotrophic (P1, P2, P3) and
   mixotrophic (M1, M2, M3, M4) modes of cultivation with varying substrate
   combinations of carbon (glycerol: 0.1 m) and nitrogen (urea: 441 mm
   and/or sodium nitrate: 882 mm). Our results demonstrate that mixotrophic
   {[}M4] condition supplemented with glycerol (0.1 m) and urea (441 mm)
   feed enhanced productivities (mg L-1 day(-1)) as follows: biomass
   (770.0), total proteins (36.0), total lipids (22.0), total carbohydrates
   (23.0) with fatty acid methyl esters (9.6), EPA (2.7), and fucoxanthin
   (1.1), respectively. The overall yield of EPA represents 28\% of total
   fatty acids in the mixotrophic {[}M4] condition. In conclusion, our
   improved strategy of feeding urea to a glycerol-supplemented medium
   defines a new efficient biomass valorization paradigm with
   cost-effective substrates for the production of HVRs in oleaginous

Title = {Wind resource assessment of eastern coastal region of Saudi Arabia},

Abstract = {Depleting oil and gas reserves, combined with growing concerns of global
   warming, have made it inevitable to seek energy from renewable energy
   sources such as wind. The utilization of energy from wind is becoming
   increasingly attractive and is being widely used/disseminated for
   substitution of oil-produced energy, and eventually to minimize
   atmospheric degradation. Quantitative assessment of wind resource is an
   important driving element in successful establishment of a wind
   farm/park at a given location. More often than not, wind-energy
   resources are relatively better along coastlines. In the present study,
   hourly mean wind-speed data of the period 1986-1997 recorded at the
   solar radiation and meteorological station, Dhahran (26 degrees 32' N,
   50 degrees 13' E, eastern coastal plain of Saudi Arabia), have been
   analyzed to present different characteristics of wind speed in
   considerable depth such as: yearly, monthly, diurnal variations of wind
   speed, etc. The long-term monthly average wind speeds for Dhahran range
   from 4.2-6.4 m/s. More importantly, the study deals with impact of hub
   height on wind energy generation. Attention has also been focussed on
   monthly average daily energy generation from different sizes of
   commercially available wind machines (150, 250, 600 kW) to identify
   optimum wind machine size from energy production point of view. It has
   been found that for a given 6 MW wind farm size, at 50 m hub height,
   cluster of 150 kW wind machines yields about 48\% more energy as
   compared to 600 kW wind machines. Literature shows that
   commercial/residential buildings in Saudi Arabia consume an estimated
   10-40\% of the total electric energy generated. So, concurrently, as a
   case study, attempt has been made to investigate/ examine the potential
   of utilizing hybrid (wind+diesel) energy conversion systems to meet the
   load requirements of hundred typical 2-bedroom residential buildings
   (with annual electrical energy demand of 3512 MWh). The hybrid systems
   considered in the present case-study consist of different combinations
   of wind machines (of various capacities), supplemented with battery
   storage and diesel back-up. The deficit energy generated from the
   back-up diesel generator and the number of operational hours of the
   diesel system to meet a specific annual electrical energy demand of 3512
   MWh have also been presented. The diesel back-up system is operated at
   times when the power generated from wind energy conversion systems
   (WECS) fails to satisfy the load and when the battery storage is
   depleted. The evaluation of hybrid system shows that with seven 150 kW
   WECS and three days of battery storage, the diesel back-up system has to
   provide 17.5\% of the load demand. However, in absence of battery
   storage, about 37\% of the load needs to be provided by the diesel
   system.},

Title = {Design and operation of an inexpensive, laboratory-scale, continuous
   hydrothermal liquefaction reactor for the conversion of microalgae
   produced during wastewater treatment},
Journal = {FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY},

Volume = {165},

Abstract = {Recently, much research has been published on the hydrothermal
   liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae to form bio-crude, which can be further
   upgraded into sustainable 3rd generation biofuels. However, most of
   these studies have been conducted in batch reactors, which are not fully
   applicable to large-scale industrial production. In this investigation
   an inexpensive laboratory scale continuous flow system was designed and
   tested for the liquefaction of microalgae produced during wastewater
   treatment. The system was operated at a range of temperatures (300
   degrees C-340 degrees C) and flow rates (3-7 mL min(-1)), with the feed
   being delivered using high pressure N-2 rather than a mechanical pump.
   The design incorporated the in-situ collection of solids through a
   double tube design. The algae was processed at 5 wt\% and the results
   were compared to those from a batch reactor operated at equivalent
   conditions. By combining high heating rates with extended reaction
   times, the continuous system was able to yield significantly enhanced
   bio-crude yields compared to the batch system. This demonstrates the
   need for inexpensive continuous processing in the lab, to aid in scale
   up decision making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The flexible control characteristic of energy storage system makes it
   have an advantage in participating in grid frequency regulation. The
   combination of wind power and energy storage has the effect of
   synergistic enhancement in providing frequency support. However,
   traditional PID controllers are difficult to achieve coordinated control
   of wind farms and energy storage. To address this issue, a model
   predictive control (MPC) based scheme of wind farm with energy storage
   system for frequency support is proposed. The MPC controller optimizes
   the power reference for each offshore wind turbine as well as the energy
   storage system, with the objective of minimizing the grid frequency
   deviation. In the MPC design, power constraints for wind turbines that
   adapt various wind speeds are considered, thereby ensuring the stable
   operation of wind turbines during the frequency support. Meanwhile,
   state of charge (SoC) constraints for the energy storage system is also
   proposed to extend its life. What's more, the moving horizon estimation
   (MHE) is introduced to estimate the grid power imbalance. The results
   show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the performance of
   the grid frequency.},

Abstract = {One paradigm of estuarine ecology is that the ecology (e.g.
   phytoplankton) responds to changes in vertical stratification, which is
   controlled by the balance between buoyancy flux from freshwater inflow
   and the dissipation of kinetic energy by tidal (or wind) mixing. The
   Elbe River is one of the largest rivers in Europe (O(1000 km)) and tidal
   influences in the estuary reaches O(150 km) inward from the center of
   the German Bight to the weir in Geesthacht. The hydrological regime of
   the Elbe estuary is dominated by tides, mainly by the M2 tide and its
   overtides. Tidal dispersion modifies the discharge power spectrum
   upstream the brackish water zone, where mixing and straining processes
   establish density driven circulation patterns. Long-term measurements,
   originated from the Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration -
   spanning the years 1998 to 2013 - are analyzed. The measurement
   instruments of conductivity and currents are placed near surface as well
   as near bottom. They attain temporal resolutions of 5 minutes and a
   spatial resolution of O(10) km. The measurements of discharge,
   conductivity and currents undergo strictly quality assurance including
   outlier testing, gab filling and breakpoint search. Based on current
   velocity and conductivity measurements salinity dynamics are analyzed.
   Processes like advection, straining and mixing are related to each
   other. By the means of numerical modellings the results are reproduced
   and mixing along the estuary is discussed. Beside tidal dominance in the
   Elbe estuary discharge variations on monthly to seasonal timescales
   modify the freshwater related transport processes.},

Abstract = {Currently, research agenda in marine ecotoxicology is facing new
   challenges with the emergence of newly and complex synthetized
   chemicals. The study of the fate and adverse effects of toxicants
   remains increasingly complicated with global change events.
   Ecotoxicology had provided for a decades, precious scientific data and
   knowledge but also technical and management tools for the environmental
   community. Regarding those, it is necessary to update methodologies
   dealing with these issues such as combined effect of conventional and
   emergent stressors and global changes. In this point of view article, we
   discuss one hand the new challenges of ecotoxicology in this context,
   and in the other hand, the need of updating agenda and methodologies
   currently used in monitoring programs and finally recommendations and
   future research needs. Among recommendations, it could be cited the
   necessity to perform long-term experiments, the standardization of
   sentinel species and taking benefit from baseline studies and omics

Abstract = {The province of Zeeland is situated in the coastal zone of the
   Netherlands. The ground surface level is around or below mean sea level.
   Therefore seepage of brackish to saline groundwater is very common. Sea
   level rise as a result of climate change will very likely increase the
   pressure on the coastal groundwater system, leading to an increased
   salinization of the groundwater and surface water system. Still,
   freshwater agriculture is being practiced in large parts of the
   province. The vegetation extracts its fresh water from the unsaturated
   zone and thin rainwater lenses that `float' on top of brackish and
   saline groundwater. Geophysical and hydrogeological data have been
   combined on two spatial scales to obtain a better insight into this
   fresh-brackish-saline groundwater distribution. This information is
   being used to: assess groundwater abstractions, plan landuse and improve
   the input of variable-density groundwater flow and coupled solute
   transport models.
   For over 6000 locations various types of data have been used to estimate
   the depth of the brackish-saline groundwater interface of 1000 mg
   {[}Cl-]/L. These types of data are both of geophysical (vertical
   electrical soundings, EM34, geoelectrical well logs and electrical cone
   penetration tests) and of hydrological origin (water samples and
   abstraction wells). These data have been interpreted and combined with
   knowledge on the distribution of geological units to make an estimation
   of the depth of the brackish-saline water transition for the whole
   province (similar to 66 km x 63 km).
   In addition to the regional brackish-saline interface map, continuous
   vertical electrical soundings (CVES) have been executed to map the
   fresh-brackish-saline distribution on a local scale. The CVES profiles
   were made at eight different plots where brackish-saline water is
   occurring at shallow depths (<5 m below the surface) according to the
   regional map and where freshwater agriculture is still being practised.
   Six of the eight sites have thin (0-3 m) brackish to slightly saline
   water lenses. At two sites up to 15 m thick brackish water lenses have
   been observed with CVES. The thickness of the brackish water lenses
   varies laterally over short distances. Sandy sediment and a higher
   topography are favourable factors for the development of such lenses.},

Title = {Calibration of hydroclimate proxies in freshwater bivalve shells from
   Central and West Africa},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},

Abstract = {Freshwater bivalve shell oxygen and carbon stable isotope ratios (delta
   O-18, delta C-13) may act as recorders of hydroclimate (e.g.,
   precipitation-evaporation balance, discharge) and aquatic
   biogeochemistry. We investigate the potential of these hydroclimate
   proxies measured along the growth axis of shells collected from the
   Oubangui River (Bangui, Central African Republic) and the Niger River
   (Niamey, Niger). Biweekly water samples and in situ measurements
   collected over several years, along with daily discharge data from both
   sites allowed a direct comparison with proxies recorded in the shells.
   Data from a total of 14 unionid shells, including three species
   (Chambardia wissmanni, Aspatharia dahomeyensis, and Aspatharia
   chaiziana), confirmed that shells precipitate carbonate in oxygen
   isotope equilibrium with ambient water. Because water temperature
   variations were small, shell delta O-18 values (delta O-18(shell)) also
   accurately record the seasonality and the range observed in water delta
   O-18 (delta O-18(w)) values when calculated using an average
   temperature. Calculated delta O-18(w) values were in good agreement over
   the entire record of measured delta O-18(w) values, thus delta
   O-18(shell) records can be reliably used to reconstruct past delta
   O-18(w) values. Discharge and delta O-18(w) values from both rivers fit
   a logarithmic relationship, which was used to attempt reconstruction of
   past hydrological conditions, after calculating delta O-18(w) values
   from delta O-18(shell) values. A comparison with measured discharge data
   suggests that for the two rivers considered, delta O-18(shell) data are
   good proxies for recording discharge conditions during low(er) discharge
   levels, but that high discharge values cannot be accurately
   reconstructed due to the large scatter in the discharge-delta O-18(w)
   relationship. Moreover, periods of bivalve shell growth cessation due to
   high turbidity or air exposure should be taken into account. While delta
   C-13 values of dissolved inorganic carbon in both rivers showed clear
   seasonality and correlated well with discharge, most of the shells
   analyzed did not record these variations adequately, likely due to the
   complication of vital effects including the variable contribution of
   metabolic CO2. Thus, tropical African unionid delta O-18(shell) values
   can be used to reconstruct delta O-18(w) values with high confidence to
   provide insight on past hydroclimate such as precipitation-evaporation
   balance and periods of low discharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Effects of climate change and variability on population dynamics in a

Abstract = {Climate change affects both the mean and variability of climatic
   variables, but their relative impact on the dynamics of populations is
   still largely unexplored. Based on a long-term study of the demography
   of a declining Eurasian Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus)
   population, we quantify the effect of changes in mean and variance of
   winter temperature on different vital rates across the life cycle.
   Subsequently, we quantify, using stochastic stage-structured models, how
   changes in the mean and variance of this environmental variable affect
   important characteristics of the future population dynamics, such as the
   time to extinction. Local mean winter temperature is predicted to
   strongly increase, and we show that this is likely to increase the
   population's persistence time via its positive effects on adult survival
   that outweigh the negative effects that higher temperatures have on
   fecundity. Interannual variation in winter temperature is predicted to
   decrease, which is also likely to increase persistence time via its
   positive effects on adult survival that outweigh the negative effects
   that lower temperature variability has on fecundity. Overall, a 0.1
   degrees C change in mean temperature is predicted to alter median time
   to extinction by 1.5 times as many years as would a 0.1 degrees C change
   in the standard deviation in temperature, suggesting that the dynamics
   of oystercatchers are more sensitive to changes in the mean than in the
   interannual variability of this climatic variable. Moreover, as climate
   models predict larger changes in the mean than in the standard deviation
   of local winter temperature, the effects of future climatic variability
   on this population's time to extinction are expected to be overwhelmed
   by the effects of changes in climatic means. We discuss the mechanisms
   by which climatic variability can either increase or decrease population
   viability and how this might depend both on species' life histories and
   on the vital rates affected. This study illustrates that, for making
   reliable inferences about population consequences in species in which
   life history changes with age or stage, it is crucial to investigate the
   impact of climate change on vital rates across the entire life cycle.
   Disturbingly, such data are unavailable for most species of conservation
   concern.},

Title = {Aragonite Precipitation by ``Proto-Polyps{''} in Coral Cell Cultures},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 13},
Abstract = {The mechanisms of coral calcification at the molecular, cellular and
   tissue levels are poorly understood. In this study, we examine calcium
   carbonate precipitation using novel coral tissue cultures that aggregate
   to form ``proto-polyps{''}. Our goal is to establish an experimental
   system in which calcification is facilitated at the cellular level,
   while simultaneously allowing in vitro manipulations of the calcifying
   fluid. This novel coral culturing technique enables us to study the
   mechanisms of biomineralization and their implications for geochemical
   proxies. Viable cell cultures of the hermatypic, zooxanthellate coral,
   Stylophora pistillata, have been maintained for 6 to 8 weeks. Using an
   enriched seawater medium with aragonite saturation state similar to open
   ocean surface waters (Omega(arag) similar to 4), the primary cell
   cultures assemble into ``proto-polyps{''} which form an extracellular
   organic matrix (ECM) and precipitate aragonite crystals. These
   extracellular aragonite crystals, about 10 mm in length, are formed on
   the external face of the proto-polyps and are identified by their
   distinctive elongated crystallography and X-ray diffraction pattern. The
   precipitation of aragonite is independent of photosynthesis by the
   zooxanthellae, and does not occur in control experiments lacking coral
   cells or when the coral cells are poisoned with sodium azide. Our
   results demonstrate that proto-polyps, aggregated from primary coral
   tissue culture, function (from a biomineralization perspective)
   similarly to whole corals. This approach provides a novel tool for
   investigating the biophysical mechanism of calcification in these
   organisms.},

Abstract = {We examined pCO(2)(air) and pCO(2)(sea) observed in the eastern Indian
   sector of the Southern Ocean (south of 50 degrees S, 140 degrees-150
   degrees E) during austral spring-summer from November 2001 to March 2002
   using 4 research vessels. pCO(2)(sea) changed by as much as 200 mu atm
   over the 5-month period in the Seasonal Sea Ice Zone (SSIZ), due mostly
   to very low values in January caused by stratification of water column
   and strong biological activity. In the SSIZ, the air-sea CO2 flux showed
   large temporal variations, from -2.9 g m(-2) month(-1) in January 2002
   to -0.65 g m(-2) month(-1) in February 2002. The monthly oceanic CO2
   uptake in the area covered by this study (1.5 x 10(12) km(2)) was
   estimated to be in a range of 1.0 x 10(-3) to 1.7 x 10(-3) PgC

Title = {First citizen-science population abundance and growth rate estimates for
   green sea turtles Chelonia mydas foraging in the northern Great Barrier
   Reef, Australia},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},

Abstract = {Embayments and coastal reefs of Queensland, Australia have supported
   some of the highest densities of green sea turtle Chelonia mydas
   foraging aggregations in the western Pacific Ocean. Since
   industrialization, many cumulative threats have negatively impacted
   these turtles with some Aboriginal communities concerned about notable
   reductions in local abundance and possible end to their customary
   hunting practice. Guided by collaborators, population trends,
   survivorship and somatic growth were monitored at a broadly
   representative inshore site in Edgecumbe Bay, Queensland, using a local
   citizen-science approach. The 12 yr time series of 1316 tagged turtles
   from 2003 to 2014 was analysed using Capture Mark Recapture (CMR) and
   Bayesian growth models. Models indicated the population comprised of
   4392 individuals in 2014 and is rebuilding at 8.3\% yr(-1). The data did
   not support more complex models with age or timevaried survivorship or
   recruitment. Overall survival (0.90 apparent survival yr(-1)) and growth
   rate (1.20 cm yr(-1)) were high compared to other green turtle
   populations globally. This study represents the first population
   modelling of green turtles foraging in inshore waters of the Great
   Barrier Reef and north-east Australia and will be an important proxy
   indicator for how other sites may be functioning. Although methodology
   and resource capacity should be carefully considered, this study
   demonstrates that citizen-science CMR studies can generate valid data to
   support replicable, robust statistical modelling and allow indigenous
   communities to sustainably manage and protect turtles on indigenous
   traditional Sea Country within Australia and worldwide.},

Abstract = {Understanding the driving forces of absorption of anthropogenic CO2 by
   the oceans is critical for a sustainable ocean carbon cycle. Decadal
   sinking particle flux data collected at 1000 m, 2000 m, and 3500 m at
   the South East Asia Time Series Study (SEATS) Station (18 degrees N, 116
   degrees E), which was located in the northern South China Sea (nSCS),
   show that the fluxes undergo strong seasonal and interannual
   variability. Changes in the flux data are correlated with the
   satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration, indicating that the mass
   fluxes of the sinking particles are largely controlled by the export
   production at or near the SEATS station. The cooling of seawater and the
   strengthening of wind in winter increase the nutrient inventories in the
   euphotic zone, thus also increasing export production in the nSCS. This
   study reveals that the intrusion of low-nutrient seawater from the West
   Philippine Sea into the nSCS significantly reduces the productivity, and
   hence the flux, of sinking particles.},

Title = {Novel Spinifex littoreus fibre and sugarcane biosilica on mechanical,
   wear, time dependent and water absorption behaviour of epoxy structural
   composite},
Journal = {BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY},
Abstract = {A new Spinifex littoreus fibre-reinforced sugarcane bagasse biosilica
   particle dispersed epoxy resin hybrid composite was made and described.
   The major goal of this study was to develop a novel epoxy hybrid
   composite system that included surface-treated Spinifex littoreus fibre
   and sugarcane biosilica particle for sustainable material development.
   The fibre was treated with alkali and silane whereas the biosilica was
   treated with silane alone. The hand layup process was used to create the
   composites, which were then post-cured at 110 degrees C. The composites
   with base and silane-treated fibres have improved mechanical properties.
   The tensile and flexural strengths of the composite containing lvol\%
   powder were 148 and 155 MPa, respectively. Similarly, with a Shore-D
   value of 94, the composite designation SPS4 has the highest hardness.
   Moreover, 2 vol\% powder added composites explicated improved wear
   resistance. Composite fatigue behaviour has significantly improved with
   a fatigue life count of 26,822 for the composite designation SPS3. The
   water absorption \% of silane-treated biosilica particle in epoxy
   produced controlled water uptake. These improved composites might be
   used in structural, automotive, aerospace, residential and military
   applications.},

Title = {Prebiotics as functional ingredients: focus on Mediterranean fish
   aquaculture},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {800-832},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increased demand for food fish, together with the banning of
   antibiotics for fish growth promotion and the greater public awareness
   for healthy fish production, led to an increased interest in the
   potential of functional feeds as health promoters. Prebiotics are
   functional ingredients that are used in fish, being reported to be
   associated with improvements in growth, feed efficiency, gut microbiota,
   digestive enzyme activities, gut morphology, immune status, disease
   resistance, intermediary metabolism, and stress responses. Those
   benefits may be related with the increase in gut beneficial bacteria,
   bacteria end-products of prebiotic fermentation, or the interaction
   between prebiotics and pattern recognition receptors. Due to the
   reported prebiotic-related positive effects in fish, a large amount of
   studies have been published in the last years, mainly focusing on
   prebiotics' benefits to fish. Thus, the present review focuses on
   prebiotics' potential as functional ingredients, focusing on their
   mechanisms of action. In addition, this review summarizes prebiotic
   effects in Mediterranean aquaculture fish, whose production has greatly
   increased in the last years. Finally, topics that deserve to be further
   explored, such as prebiotic effects related with fish age and size, and
   timing and duration of administration are suggested.},

Title = {Effect of cellulose wastes upon the growth of phragmites australis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {197-209},
Abstract = {Growth responses of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. Ex Steud, (reed
   grass), a helophyte species, were examined under in vitro and greenhouse
   conditions in the presence of various residues from a Kraft pulp mill.
   Plant tolerance to solid residues (ashes, dregs, flyashes, grits,
   primary sludge, and brown stock rejects) was tested in vitro. Solid
   residues were added separately up to 30\% (w/v), as well a liquid
   residue up to 30\% (v/v), to a Murashige and Skoog (1962) sucrose-free
   nutrient media with (5 mg l(-1)) 6-benzylaminopurine. After 2 mo in
   vitro, plantlets developed well in the presence of up to 10\% solid or
   liquid wastes, but higher concentrations of either limited growth. This
   effect was mainly attributed to the plant's uptake and accumulation of
   various elements such as sodium, iron, copper, manganese, and boron,
   which are common to these waste types, thus showing an efficient
   phytoremediation potential. When added to MS media, the concentration of
   these elements generally decreased in the residual media after 2 mo of
   culture: the initial sodium, iron, and copper content in the growth
   media was reduced ca. 10-fold detected; a 5-fold reduction occurred for
   manganese and boron. In experiments under greenhouse conditions with in
   vitro propagated plantlets potted in mixtures of a commercial organic
   soil and residues, significant differences in plant development (plant
   size and fresh weight increase) were observed in the presence of ashes
   mixed at levels of 20\% and 30\%, compared to the control in organic
   soil. For other solid wastes, plant growth was inhibited as the
   concentration of each waste increased, causing chlorosis and/or plant
   necrosis.},

Title = {Mass attenuation coefficients of environmental samples for gamma-ray
   energies from 46.5 keV to 1408 keV},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {201-207},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background:In gamma-ray spectrometry for the radioactivity analysis of
   bulk samples, self-attenuation correction is necessary when the
   attenuation rates in test sample differ from the one in the efficiency
   calibration source. Thus, the mass attenuation coefficient of test
   samples is an important factor in gamma-ray spectrometry. This study
   estimates the mass attenuation coefficients for seven kinds of
   environmental samples. Materials and Methods: An uncollimated
   transmission system with a high purity germanium detector system was
   used to measure the gamma-ray transmission rates with and without test
   samples. The system was calibrated using C (activated charcoal), H2O,
   MnO2, NaCl, Na2CO3, and (NH4)(2)SO4 as reference materials. Sea
   sediment, surface soil, fish, seaweed, Chinese cabbage, milk, and pine
   needles were selected, and ten identical samples for each sample type
   were tested using the system. Results: The calibration of the
   uncollimated transmission system was validated with good agreement
   within 4\% between linear attenuation coefficients by experiment and
   calculation for K2CrO4 and SiO2. The standard deviation of the mass
   attenuation coefficients for each kind of sample was estimated as less
   than 5\% above around 100 keV. Conclusions: Mass attenuation coefficient
   does not significantly depend on the sample type for gamma-ray energy
   higher than around 100 keV, but mass attenuation coefficient for the
   lower gamma-ray energy should be considered even with similar kinds of
   sample. The mass attenuation coefficients tabulated in this paper can be
   used as a reference or comparable value in gamma-ray spectrometry for
   environmental samples.},

Title = {The Prediction of Separation Performance of an In-Line Axial Oil-Water
   Separator Using Machine Learning and CFD},

Abstract = {Recently, global energy consumption has increased due to industrial
   development, resulting in increasing demand for various energy sources.
   Aside from the increased demand for renewable energy resources, the
   demand for fossil fuels is also on the rise. Accordingly, the demand for
   resource development in the deep sea is also increasing. Various systems
   are required to efficiently develop resources in the deep sea. A study
   on an in-line type oil-water separator is needed to compensate for the
   disadvantages of a gravity separator that separates traditional water
   and oil. In this paper, the separation performance of the axial-flow
   oil-water separator for five design variables (conical diameter, conical
   length, number of vanes, angle of vane, and thickness of vane) was
   analyzed. Numerical calculations for multiphase fluid were performed
   using the mixture model, one of the Euler-Euler approaches.
   Additionally, the Reynolds stress model was used to describe the
   swirling flow. As a result, it was found that the effect on the
   separation performance was large in the order of angle of vane, conical
   diameter, number of vanes, the thickness of vane, and conical length. A
   neural network model for predicting separation performance was developed
   using numerical calculation results. To predict the oil-water separation
   performance, five design parameters were considered, and the evaluation
   of the separation performance prediction model was compared with the
   multilinear regression (MLR) model. As a result, it was found that the R
   square was improved by about 74.0\% in the neural network model,
   compared with the MLR model.},

Abstract = {Wind waves may play an important role in the evolution of sea ice. That
   role is largely determined by how fast the ice layer dissipates the wave
   energy. The transition from a continuous layer of ice to a series of
   broken floes is expected to have a strong impact on the several
   attenuation processes. Here we explore the possible effects of basal
   friction, scattering, and dissipation within the ice layer. The ice is
   treated as a single layer that can be fractured in many floes.
   Dissipation associated with ice flexure is evaluated using an anelastic
   linear dissipation and a cubic inelastic viscous dissipation. Tests
   aiming to reproduce a Marginal Ice Zone are used to discuss the effects
   of each process separately. Attenuation is exponential for friction and
   scattering. Scattering produces an increase in the wave height near the
   ice edge and broadens the wave directional spectrum, especially for
   short-period waves. The nonlinear inelastic dissipation is larger for
   larger wave heights as long as the ice is not broken. These effects are
   combined in a realistic simulation of an ice break-up event observed
   south of Svalbard in 2010. The recorded rapid shift from a strong
   attenuation to little attenuation when the ice is broken is only
   reproduced when using a nonlinear dissipation that vanishes when the ice
   is broken. A preliminary pan-Arctic test of these different
   parameterizations suggests that inelastic dissipation alone is not
   enough and requires its combination with basal friction.},

Abstract = {Based on the change-of-coordinates that was previously proposed in
   {[}1], in this paper, the wave spectrum inversion problem is solved with
   very high accuracy for the case when there is little or no noise in the
   second-order Doppler spectrum. The new solution is based on the form of
   the forward problem, which is a sum of spatially-dependent linear
   convolution and cross-correlations. This sum can be solved precisely by
   solving for the wave spectrum power spectral densities iteratively from
   larger to smaller frequencies, and it is shown here on synthetic data
   that the solution is exact up to numerical error in the absence of
   noise. This exact solution is found to be sensitive to noise in the
   Doppler spectrum, and thus a second algorithm is derived which reduces
   this sensitivity and still arrives at a sensible solution for the
   nondirectional ocean wave spectrum.},

Abstract = {Partitioning of the nitrogen stock in a Fijian seagrass bed dominated by
   Syringodium isoetifolium (Ascherson) Dandy and in an adjacent area bare
   of macrophytic vegetation was assessed to evaluate the effect of the
   presence of seagrass on coral sediment. Concentrations of major
   nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphate, were as low in the water
   column at the seagrass bed and the bare area as they were in the open
   ocean. Concentrations of ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen,
   however, were higher in the water within the seagrass canopy than they
   were in other waters. In sediments at the seagrass bed and the bare
   area, interstitial nitrogen, such as nitrate and dissolved organic
   nitrogen, was a minor component of the total nitrogen (0.3-0.05\%). On
   the other hand, concentrations of total organic nitrogen in seagrass-bed
   sediment (about 70\% of which was in the form of amorphous organic
   nitrogen and the rest of which came from living and dead seagrass) were
   more than three times higher than those in bare-area sediment.
   Concentrations of organic carbon from amorphous organic materials in
   seagrass-bed sediment showed no large change with depth, resulting in an
   apparent decrease in the carbon/nitrogen atom ratio from 60 to 10. These
   results suggest some mechanisms to minimize the loss of nitrogen stock
   from the sediment of tropical seagrass beds.},

Journal = {ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {The finding of microbial life in the Earth's deep subsurface raises the
   question as to how deep microbial ecosystems are able to survive under
   these extreme environmental conditions. To investigate the effect of
   increasing ambient pressure, a new quantitative approach was developed
   to monitor adaptive changes in the cell membrane phospholipid
   composition of a piezosensitive bacterium, strain LT25, in response to
   different growth pressure conditions (0.1 and 25MPa) using liquid
   chromatography coupled via an electrospray interface to a mass
   spectrometer (HPLC-ESIMS) and collisionally activated dissociation (CAD)
   experiments (MS-MS). Strain LT25 was isolated from deep subsurface
   sediments in the Nankai Trough {[}offshore Japan; Ocean Drilling Program
   (ODP), Leg 190] and was cultivated under atmospheric and high
   hydrostatic pressure conditions. The HPLC-ESI-MS-MS method allows
   detailed structural elucidation and quantification of individual
   phospholipids, taking into account the different response factors of
   individual phospholipids in the ESI-MS detection system. Strain LT25
   contains phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine esters with
   saturated and/or mono-unsaturated fatty acids containing mainly 14, 16
   and, 18 carbon atoms. Quantitative assessment of the phospholipids and
   their fatty acyl side chain inventory illustrates complex restructuring
   processes in the microbial cell membrane of strain LT25: cells
   cultivated under high pressure conditions (25 MPa) show higher
   proportions of phosphatidylglycerol esters and mono-unsaturated fatty
   acids. Both changes are associated with a high degree of cell membrane
   disturbance and, with that, a lowering of the solid to liquid phase
   transition temperature of the cell membrane. Since this counterbalances
   the effect of increasing pressure, it is suggested that an adaptive
   alteration of the membrane phospholipid composition occurs, in response
   to increasing growth pressure conditions, to maintain the membrane
   fluidity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {During a traditional hydrographic survey, data can be acquired, accessed
   and processed by personnel working on the vessel or launch. Improved
   data processing tools have reduced the ratio of acquisition to
   processing time significantly in the past 10 years, despite an increase
   in the quantity and quality of data points available from modern sonars
   and sensors.
   The improved performance of the bathymetric sonars and their associated
   ancillary sensors (motion, position etc.) has allowed surveyors to
   identify smaller targets with higher resolution than ever before. In
   addition, the physical size of these sensors has decreased, allowing
   deployment on platforms previously inaccessible by survey teams. The
   platforms used for acquisition have improved autonomy with Autonomous
   Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs), along
   with extended mission times driven by improved battery technology.
   Hydrographic survey platforms are increasingly becoming autonomous or
   semi-autonomous due to the benefits that these platforms offer. Lower
   capital and operating costs, the ability to work undetected and closer
   to the intended target and multiple unit operation are just some of the
   benefits that can be exploited by the operator.
   AUV technology has allowed for the development of smaller vehicles that
   are able to work in the shallow waters of the littoral, with a lower
   build cost allowing the deployment of several units for a single
   mission. AUVs have also been improved by battery power technology,
   allowing for extended mission times. A good example of a current program
   is the US Navy's Large Displacement Underwater Vehicle (LDUUV) which is
   anticipated to have an endurance measured in weeks rather than hours.
   ASV development has been significant, with the challenges associated
   with navigating a surface vessel autonomously being addressed as a
   priority in the maritime community. The advantages of the ASV is the
   improved bandwidth that above water communications offers, allowing for
   real time transmission of data to the unit controlling the vehicle.
   Improvements in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and wave
   power have meant that it is possible to operate an ASV for extended
   periods of time, and the decrease in platform cost has allowed for
   several units to be used in unison to gather intelligence over a large
   area.
   The increased use of autonomous survey platforms has resulted in the
   ratio of acquisition to processing time has becoming a mission limiting
   factor again. Without human interaction in the real-time feedback loop,
   the platform must gather the data and await post-processing when it is
   recovered. This method has significant disadvantages, most notably a
   lack of assurance that the data collected is within the required
   specification and an increased turnaround time before the platform can
   be re-deployed.
   On manned survey platforms significant time is often spent at the end of
   the survey conducting batch processing tasks such as conversion of data
   and running automated data cleaning algorithms. By performing these
   tasks at the end of the survey on a complete and large dataset, the
   processing times can be lengthy and this impedes the
   surveyor-in-charge's ability to make decisions for the subsequent survey
   plan.
   This paper will describe a new software based method of acquiring and
   processing data autonomously in near real time whilst the survey is
   underway and look at the benefits that can be gained from using this
   method.},

Abstract = {With decreasing fossil fuels and rising environmental issues, harvesting
   energy in a large amount and in a clean way has been a great challenge
   for the whole world. Developing the efficient electrocatalysts with less
   expense and achieving the better electrocatalytic behavior for oxygen
   evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen
   evolution reaction (HER) is very essential for extensive
   commercialization of fuel cells, water electrolyzers and metal air
   batteries. In the same pursuit, herein, we report a bifunctional
   coral-like NiCo2O4 nanostructure supported on reduced graphene oxide
   (rGO) sheets, which was prepared by a facile, controlled hydrothermal
   reaction protocol. The structural, morphological and electrochemical
   characterizations have been carried out to explore the properties of
   this nanocomposite. The unique morphology, large electroactive surface
   area and the synergistic effect of the metal ions on the
   electrocatalytic activity makes this material a suitable candidate for
   electrochemical water splitting. The low onset potential, high current
   density, lower Tafel slope and long-term stability in both HER and OER
   has been shown by rGO-NiCo2O4 coral like nanostructure, which reveals
   the high catalytic activity of this material, underlying the finding and
   importance of current work. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems: concepts, temporal scales

Abstract = {The Pleistocene Earth history has been characterized by major climatic
   fluctuations. During glacial periods, ice may have covered around 30 per
   cent of the Earth surface compared to approximately 10 per cent
   nowadays. With global change, polar environments and other montainous
   glacial environments of the world are presently undergoing the most
   important changes since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and are
   experiencing paraglacial and paraperiglacial geomorphological
   readjustments. Paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems consist of
   several subsystems including gravitational, fluvial, coastal, aeolian
   and lacustrine environments. Paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems
   can be analysed as open and complex landsystems characterized by energy,
   water and sediment fluxes and exchange with surrounding environments,
   especially with glacial and periglacial landsystems as inputs. Those
   cascading landsystems are likely to react to climate change because they
   rely on an ice-cold water stock (glacier and permafrost) that developed
   during a previous cold sequence (glaciation). The response of
   paraglacial and paraperiglacial systems to climatic forcing takes place
   over a long time span ranging from an immediate reaction to several
   millennia. The spatial limits of paraglacial and paraperiglacial
   landsystems are inherently dependant on the time scale over which the
   system is analyzed. During the Pleistocene, glaciations widely affected
   the high latitudes and the high altitudes of the Earth and were followed
   by inherited paraglacial sequences. Glacier forelands in Arctic and
   alpine areas experience paraglacial processes with the present warming.
   The expected global warming for the twenty-first century will result in
   significant impacts on present glacier areas in mountains and could
   result in the appearance of new areas for paraglacial dynamics. In
   permafrost terrain, landscapes underwent a similar paraperiglacial
   geomorphological adjustment in mountainous, continental and coastal
   areas, with permafrost thaw-degradation and thermokarst processes.},

Title = {Sensitivity and Acclimation of Three Canopy-Forming Seaweeds to UVB
   Radiation and Warming},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Canopy-forming seaweeds, as primary producers and foundation species,
   provide key ecological services. Their responses to multiple stressors
   associated with climate change could therefore have important knock-on
   effects on the functioning of coastal ecosystems. We examined
   interactive effects of UVB radiation and warming on juveniles of three
   habitat-forming subtidal seaweeds from Western Australia-Ecklonia
   radiata, Scytothalia dorycarpa and Sargassum sp. Fronds were incubated
   for 14 days at 16-30 degrees C with or without UVB radiation and growth,
   health status, photosynthetic performance, and light absorbance
   measured. Furthermore, we used empirical models from the metabolic
   theory of ecology to evaluate the sensitivity of these important
   seaweeds to ocean warming. Results indicated that responses to UVB and
   warming were species specific, with Sargassum showing highest tolerance
   to a broad range of temperatures. Scytothalia was most sensitive to
   elevated temperature based on the reduced maximum quantum yields of
   PSII; however, Ecklonia was most sensitive, according to the comparison
   of activation energy calculated from Arrhenius' model. UVB radiation
   caused reduction in the growth, physiological responses and thallus
   health in all three species. Our findings indicate that Scytothalia was
   capable of acclimating in response to UVB and increasing its light
   absorption efficiency in the UV bands, probably by up-regulating
   synthesis of photoprotective compounds. The other two species did not
   acclimate over the two weeks of exposure to UVB. Overall, UVB and
   warming would severely inhibit the growth and photosynthesis of these
   canopy-forming seaweeds and decrease their coverage. Differences in the
   sensitivity and acclimation of major seaweed species to temperature and
   UVB may alter the balance between species in future seaweed communities
   under climate change.},

Title = {Reconstruction of global surface ocean pCO(2) using region-specific

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Various machine learning methods were attempted in the global mapping of
   surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) to reduce the uncertainty
   of the global ocean CO2 sink estimate due to undersampling of pCO(2). In
   previous research, the predictors of pCO(2) were usually selected
   empirically based on theoretic drivers of surface ocean pCO(2), and the
   same combination of predictors was applied in all areas except where
   there was a lack of coverage. However, the differences between the
   drivers of surface ocean pCO(2) in different regions were not
   considered. In this work, we combined the stepwise regression algorithm
   and a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to select predictors of pCO(2)
   based on the mean absolute error in each of the 11 biogeochemical
   provinces defined by the self-organizing map (SOM) method. Based on the
   predictors selected, a monthly global 1 circle x 1 circle surface ocean
   pCO(2) product from January 1992 to August 2019 was constructed.
   Validation of different combinations of predictors based on the Surface
   Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) dataset version 2020 and independent
   observations from time series stations was carried out. The prediction
   of pCO(2) based on region-specific predictors selected by the stepwise
   FFNN algorithm was more precise than that based on predictors from
   previous research. Applying the FFNN size-improving algorithm in each
   province decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of the global estimate
   to 11.32 mu atm and the root mean square error (RMSE) to 17.99 mu atm.
   The script file of the stepwise FFNN algorithm and pCO(2) product are
   distributed through the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy

Title = {Porewater flow patterns in surficial cold seep sediments inferred from
   conservative tracer profiles and early diagenetic modeling},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {536},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Porewater flow at cold seeps controls methane oxidation and carbonate
   precipitation rates, and also plays an important role in gas hydrate
   dynamics. We constrain the porewater flow rates in the upper sediment of
   Gulf of Mexico cold seeps by fitting measured Ra-226 and Cl- profiles.
   The approach exploits their natural increase with depth through shallow
   sediments at non-brine (Ra-226) and brine (Cl-) seeps. Vertical flow
   velocities at non-brine and brine seeps are found to be similar in
   magnitude, typically on the order of 0.1 m y(-1). The accuracy of the
   flow estimates is assessed and shown to depend substantially on
   uncertainties in both concentrations and sediment tortuosity. Model
   simulations further reveal that the natural heterogeneity of sediment
   permeability can cause considerable lateral variability in vertical flow
   at the scale of a sediment core, which implies that the coring location
   and core size can have a substantial effect on the estimated porewater
   velocities. The formation of gas hydrates and calcium carbonates reduce
   sediment permeability, and decrease the spatial variability in flow over
   time, as the formation rates are higher along preferential flow paths.
   This analysis of the effect of spatiotemporal variability on chemical
   profiles improves the assessment of uncertainties in the estimated
   magnitude of flow, and is important for the evaluation of
   benthic-pelagic coupling at seeps.},

Title = {Reduction in Body Mass and Blubber Thickness of Harbor Porpoises
   (Phocoena phocoena) Due to Near-Fasting for 24 Hours in Four Seasons},
Journal = {AQUATIC MAMMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-47},
Abstract = {When wild harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) are disturbed by (and
   perhaps flee from) anthropogenic sound, they probably do not forage, and
   thus they fast for a period of time. The rate of body mass loss during
   fasting is probably related to internal parameters such as initial body
   mass and blubber thickness, hormonal and reproductive state, and anxiety
   and activity levels, as well as to environmental parameters such as
   water and air temperature. Reduced blubber thickness causes reduced
   insulation which, in turn, increases heat loss to the environment. If
   blubber cannot be replenished by eating extra food, porpoises' fitness
   may decline, which may eventually result in hypothermia and pneumonia To
   increase understanding of the effects of fasting, the body condition of
   two captive porpoises was quantified while they were kept under ambient
   temperature conditions similar to those experienced by wild conspecifics
   in the North Sea, and while they were near-fasting (i.e., almost
   fasting) for 24 hours (consuming 3 to 10\% of the average daily food
   intake of their normal ration in each period). Replicated near-fasting
   periods took place during each of the four seasons of the year, and body
   mass (an indicator of body condition) declined in all 30 near-fasting
   periods (15 for each animal). For both porpoises in all seasons, body
   mass loss represented approximately 4\% of initial body mass (of which
   -0.7\% was due to loss of food in the alimentary canal). Blubber
   thickness was difficult to quantify due to low measurement accuracy in
   relation to loss, but small decreases in blubber thickness (0 to 3 mm)
   occurred. A linear mixed-effects model showed that mass loss was
   greatest overall in autumn, lowest in summer, and intermediate in winter
   and spring. Harbor porpoises, therefore, appear to be most vulnerable to
   the effects of fasting due to disturbance in autumn, perhaps because
   their blubber layer has to increase in autumn to cope with the
   decreasing water temperature.},

   migration phenologies and environmental constraints oil predation. Here
   we investigate the relative contribution of seasonality in irradiance

   of a migrating predator searching visually for its prey: the Norwegian

   Calanus finmarchicus. Two main seasonal pulses of prey are available to
   herring: (1) the parent generation of C. finmarchicus, with peak
   abundance in March-April, which appear too early to cause the main
   increase in herring condition; and (2) the abundant offspring generation
   of C. finmarchicus, with peak abundance in June-July, too late to
   explain the main increase in body condition. However, a mechanistic
   model of ingestion rate, including both solar irradiance and prey
   abundance, predicted seasonal food intake in good accordance with
   observed herring body condition. This suggests that the seasonality in

Abstract = {The organic sulfur content of suspended and sinking particulate matter
   was examined in the upper 1000 m of the water column in the Southern
   California Bight. Depth distributions of suspended particulate organic
   sulfur (POS) showed a subsurface maximum in most stations that deepened
   offshore. POS concentrations in suspended matter averaged 1.26 +/- 0.50
   mu g S L-1 within the euphotic zone during the two cruises analyzed
   (August and October, 1987). The downward fluxes of mass, carbon,
   nitrogen and sulfur of sinking particulate matter increased with
   increasing sample depth to 350 m in the water column. Fluxes were
   similar during the three deployments. POS was correlated with and
   directly proportional to POC, PON, and chlorophyll a in the suspended
   material. Similar correlations were obtained in the trap material
   although a positive POC intercept value suggested the presence of more
   refractory material, with sulfur being selectively removed relative to
   carbon. The average molar ratios were C:N:S = 224: 27: 1 in suspended
   and 119: 17: 1 in sinking particulate organic matter. Particulate
   organic sulfur appeared to have a biological origin, most likely

Abstract = {The paper addresses the issue of the transition from a traditional
   electrical system without automation to a newer active and smart system
   allowing the possibility of implementing Demand Side Management
   policies, for little islands not supplied by the main grid. In
   particular, the paper focuses on two main topics related to the
   definition of:
   an effective control, monitoring and communication system as a tool for
   the full exploitation of the opportunities given by Demand Response
   policies;.
   some solutions for the automation of the end-users' electrical
   installations, in order to offer to the utility flexibility to be used
   for the improvement of the generation and distribution efficiency.
   After a brief discussion on the international regulatory framework on
   automation and ICT applications for power systems, the paper presents a
   feasibility study, based on the characteristics of the island of
   Lampedusa, of a hierarchical architecture of a suitable control system
   and of some DSM enabling solutions for residential end-users. The
   proposed solutions are defined taking into account some main elements:
   distribution grids in small islands are generally equipped with outdated
   and hardly automatable devices;
   utilities in small islands have reduced budget for new investments;
   not less important, the most of the inhabitants has low income and
   unfamiliarity with automation.
   Therefore, main features of the proposed DSM enabling technologies are
   low cost and ease of use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A model simulation of the climate during Maunder Minimum (MM)
   (1645-1715) was performed using the Freie Universitat Berlin Climate
   Middle Atmosphere Model (FUB-CMAM). A multi-year equilibrium integration
   with prescribed solar insolation, atmospheric composition and sea
   surface temperatures (SSTs) for MM conditions was compared with a
   present-day (PD) simulation. We find that during MM the stratosphere was
   significantly warmer (up to 3 K) than during PD, and dynamically more
   disturbed in winter. The warming is due to the dominant effect of be
   lower atmospheric CO2 concentration during MM which leads to a reduced
   emission of long-wave radiation. and compensates the cooling due to the
   reduced solar irradiance. The troposphere was about 1-1.5 K cooler in
   the annual mean during MM. The global mean surface air temperature
   decreased by 0.86 K. Northern hemisphere winters were on average
   characterized by cooler and drier weather over the northern parts of the
   continents. with an increase in precipitation in the southern parts.
   These climate anomalies are shown to be related to a shift in the North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) towards a predominantly low phase during MM.
   The simulated climate anomalies are in very good agreement with
   reconstructions from proxy-data. Changes in the dynamical coupling
   between the troposphere and stratosphere were found in the MM
   simulation, indicating the importance of the stratosphere for climate
   change. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   and wind direction were measured simultaneously by two sonic, two
   propeller and four NRG symphonie anemometers on a 70m height tower
   located at the seashore of Wuchuan city, Guangdong. The measured wind
   data are analyzed to obtain the information on mean wind speed and
   direction, wind profile, turbulence intensity, gust factor, turbulence
   integral scale and wind spectra of wind speed fluctuations. Offshore
   wind profiles coincide with power law when mean wind speeds become high,
   and onshore wind speed increases with height from 10m to 50m height, and
   then keep constant to 70m height even a litter decrease. Turbulence
   intensity also remains almost constant when wind speed becomes high. The
   average values of gust factor are 1.32 and 1.33 respectively by sonic
   and propeller anemometer at 11 m height. Turbulence integral scales are
   also almost unchanged with mean wind speed when wind speed bigger than

Abstract = {Spatial genetic structure (SGS) is important to a population's ability
   to adapt to environmental change. For species that reproduce both
   sexually and asexually, the relative contribution of each reproductive
   mode has important ecological and evolutionary implications because
   asexual reproduction can have a strong effect on SGS. Reef-building
   corals reproduce sexually, but many species also propagate asexually
   under certain conditions. To understand SGS and the relative importance
   of reproductive mode across environmental gradients, we evaluated
   genetic relatedness in almost 600 colonies of Montipora capitata across
   30 environmentally characterized sites in KaneModified Letter Turned
   Commaohe Bay, OModified Letter Turned Commaahu, Hawaii, using low-depth
   restriction digest-associated sequencing. Clonal colonies were
   relatively rare overall but influenced SGS. Clones were located
   significantly closer to one another spatially than average colonies and
   were more frequent on sites where wave energy was relatively high,
   suggesting a strong role of mechanical breakage in their formation.
   Excluding clones, we found no evidence of isolation by distance within
   sites or across the bay. Several environmental characteristics were
   significant predictors of the underlying genetic variation (including
   degree heating weeks, time spent above 30 degrees C, depth,
   sedimentation rate and wave height); however, they only explained 5\% of
   this genetic variation. Our results show that asexual fragmentation
   contributes to the ecology of branching corals at local scales and that
   genetic diversity is maintained despite strong environmental gradients
   in a highly impacted ecosystem, suggesting potential for broad
   adaptation or acclimatization in this population.},

Journal = {OCEANOLOGIA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Short sediment cores from the eastern Gotland Basin were investigated
   using a multi-proxy approach in order to reconstruct the environmental
   conditions of the area during the past 1000 years. Sediment data and
   facies were discussed in relation to hydrographic features (salinity,
   oxygen) and climate change. During the medieval warm period (MWP), from
   about 900 to 1250 AD, the hydrographic and environmental conditions were
   similar to those of the present time (modern warm period, since about
   1850): a temporally stable halocline, caused by regular saline water
   inflows from the North Sea, prevents vertical mixing and leads to bottom
   water anoxia and the deposition of laminated, organic-rich sapropels.
   During the period from about 1250 to 1850, referred to as the cold phase
   (including the Little Ice Age), the environmental conditions of the
   central Baltic Sea were distinctly different: the lower salinity,
   resulting from reduced North Sea water inflows, allowed vertical
   convection of the water column and long-term stable ventilation of the
   sea bed (oxic stage). Both the productivity of the planktonic ecosystem
   as well as the preservation of organic matter in the sediments improved
   during the warm periods. The anthropogenic impact can be identified
   within the recent laminated sequence by a temporal reconstruction of
   pollutant deposition. Our findings imply a climate-change driven shift
   in the environmental conditions and the ecosystem of the Baltic from the
   north to the south and back to the north.},

Abstract = {Carolina Bay wetlands are common in the southeastern US Coastal Plain
   and important to water quality, carbon sequestration, and habitat. Only
   South Carolina and Georgia have statewide inventories. We developed and
   evaluated a novel way to identify and delineate Bays using Bay-dense
   Bladen County, NC as a testbed. We posited that Bay land use had changed
   in the past 40 years and that Bays comprise a small subset of their
   surrounding soils. We classified decadal Landsat images as forest,
   agriculture, urban, and water. We used 812 previously delineated Bays to
   identify common Bay soils. From areas with common Bay soils and land-use
   change, we identified 548 new Bays and delineated them using a
   semi-automated on-line digitization tool. We saved new Bays to a Google
   Fusion Table for download and integration within a GIS. To gauge
   accuracy, Bays were scored on soils, land-use change, wetland
   delineation, and landscape position. Potential errors included omission
   of some small Bays (3.3-14.6 \% of total Bay area) and commission of
   misclassified Bays (11 \% of 1360 Bays), an estimated overall accuracy
   of 74 to 86 \%. With 1360 delineated Bays, we estimated that as many as
   478 have not yet been identified. These are most likely < 5.76 ha.},

Abstract = {Sparse monitoring of New Brunswick (Canada) lakes creates challenges for
   understanding mechanisms of deteriorating water quality, such as recent
   instances of increased cyanobacterial biomass in low-nutrient systems.
   To assess long-term environmental change experienced by low-nutrient,
   dimictic New Brunswick lakes we use sedimentary remains of algal
   pigments and Cladocera in dated cores from impact (prone to late-summer
   algal blooms, Lac Unique) and reference (no observed algal blooms, First
   and States) lakes. Overall, all three lakes now exhibit greater bosminid
   abundance and fewer daphniids, lower Cladocera richness, and smaller
   average cladoceran body size, although some lake-specific differences in
   assemblage response exist that cannot be related solely to top-down or
   bottom-up forces. Zooplankton trends are most pronounced at Lac Unique
   and First Lake, where algal production is generally greater. Across all
   three lakes, the only significant (IndVal: p < 0.05) cladoceran
   bioindicator of the post-1990 period is the pelagic bosminid group,
   whereas prior to 1990, Daphnia longispina-complex and several littoral
   taxa were significant (IndVal: p < 0.05) bioindicators. These temporal
   shifts suggest that the smaller-bodied bosminid group may now be favored
   over its larger-bodied pelagic competitor Daphnia sp. in these lakes,
   irrespective of heterogeneous long-term algal patterns inferred from
   stable sedimentary pigments. We suggest that the indirect effects of
   climate change, principally during the spring and summer quarters in New
   Brunswick, may be associated with marked shifts in limnological
   structure, as evidenced by changes in dominant zooplankton of the
   pelagic zone. However, further research is needed to rule out whether or
   not size-selective predation, and its potential interactions with
   climate change and other stressors, are key mechanisms favoring
   increased bosminids in low-nutrient, dimictic lakes.},

Title = {Removal of boron from aqueous solution by modified cellulose},
Journal = {BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY},
Abstract = {Cellulose is a promising alternative material as a sorbent for the
   removal of pollutants. The availability of hydroxyl groups on cellulose
   allows for the application of various modification reactions for the
   development of novel sorbents with different functional groups. In this
   work, a cellulose sorbent modified with N-methyl-glucamine was prepared
   and tested for the removal of boron. A batch adsorption process was used
   to further explore the boron sorption kinetics, isotherms,
   thermodynamics, mechanism, and reuse of the prepared sorbent. It was
   found that the optimum sorbent dose for boron removal was 0.2 g/25 mL.
   Moreover, the initial pH of the solution was found to affect the removal
   rate and was found to be >= 4. The sorption of boron reached equilibrium
   within 60 min. The maximum sorption capacity was calculated to be 4.7 mg
   B/g sorbent. The sorption process was found to be exothermic and the
   negative value of increment S in the range of 30-60 degrees C is related
   to a decrease in randomness at the solid/solution interface during the
   sorption of boron on the sorbent. The sorption/regeneration experiments
   have shown that the removal rate of the sorbent remains the same over 5
   cycles.},

Title = {Combined effects of a simulated marine heatwave and an algal toxin on a

Journal = {AQUACULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {51},
Number = {6},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ongoing global warming is one of the major challenges for the
   development of aquaculture in the tropical regions where species are
   already cultured in the water temperature close to their upper
   physiological thresholds. Furthermore, warming can trigger blooms of
   toxic algae, yet we do not know how extreme warming such as a marine
   heatwave (MHW) and algal toxins may affect marine aquaculture species.
   To address this issue, we investigated the effects of a simulated MHW in
   combination with exposure to trans-4-trans-decadienal (PUA), a
   diatom-derived toxin, on survival, growth, development and biochemical
   composition of cobia larvae and juveniles. Cobia larvae were exposed for
   48 hr to one of two temperatures (29 vs. 34 degrees C) and two PUA
   treatments (0 vs. 0.5 mu M). Surviving larvae from each treatment were
   divided into two subsets: three replicates were used for the feeding
   test and five replicates were used for the recovery test in a
   non-contaminated environment at the respective temperatures of 29 or 34
   degrees C. Survival of cobia larvae was reduced by 16\% in either MHW or
   PUA, but it dropped by 60\% when both stressors were present, indicating
   a synergistic effect. MHW, but not PUA, reduced the feeding of cobia
   larvae. PUA had no delayed effects on growth rate and biochemical
   composition of the fish. MHW strongly reduced specific growth rate, body
   protein and lipid contents in cobia. Our results provide the first
   empirical evidence of how MHW and toxic algae may interact and challenge
   cobia and marine aquaculture production in tropical countries.},

Abstract = {The raw analytical concentration values of semi-volatile organic
   compounds (SVOCs) in ocean sediments do not necessarily reflect the
   bioavailable fractions of SVOCs in the sediments due to factors such as
   the total organic carbon content of sediments (TOC) and the percentage
   of fine particles in sediments (\% fines) as they are believed to affect
   the extraction efficiency of SVOCs from sediments. Corrective actions
   are therefore taken to minimize their influence on measurements. In
   doing so, a broad and uniform correlation is assumed to exist between
   the `native' levels of SVOCs and TOC or \% fines across ocean strata.
   However, the validity of this blanket assumption is not yet verified. In
   this study, we examined the strength of the assumption using DDTs, PAHs
   and PCBs levels in sediments from Santa Monica Bay (SMB), California,
   USA. (The distribution patterns of these SVOCs in SMB are known and
   reproducible for quality assurance.) As our results show, a uniform
   correlation between SVOC levels and TOC or \% fines across strata is
   mostly absent. For example, PAH and PCB levels show negative correlation
   with TOC or \% fines, and only in canyon sediments, DDT levels correlate
   positively with both TOC and \% fines across at least three strata.
   Furthermore, the distribution of PAH molecules appears to be controlled
   by molecular size with smaller PAHs being found almost exclusively in
   the canyons. Our finding here, being the first of its kind, suggests
   that more work is needed to clarify the reporting of SVOC levels in
   ocean sediments.},

Title = {Finding safe and efficient shipping routes in ice-covered waters: A
   framework and a model},
Journal = {COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {165},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Safety for conventional and autonomous navigation in ice-covered waters
   is a topic of rising importance. Here, we propose a generic extendable
   framework to provide the optimal route from multiple route planning
   objectives. These objectives are attained by an evaluation of
   mull-source input data, including state-of-the-art model data for ice
   conditions, for bathymetric knowledge, and for ship-ice interaction.
   Additionally, we model the ship-ship interactions statistically using a
   mean-field, to account for ships (indirectly) assisting each other via
   artificial ice channels. For the subsequent pathfinding problem, we
   propose a new A{*}-based algorithm that yields output which is not
   dependent on the grid format of the input data but instead consists of a
   path that follows the Earth's curvature. The outputs of the algorithm
   are a set of waypoints (representing the optimal route), the travel
   costs (expressed in time), and the additional travel cost estimates
   caused by route deviation, should the optimal route be altered in any
   way. The steaming speeds, the optimal route, and the deviation times are
   represented with two-dimensional (2D) maps. Finally, we provide a model
   implementation of our framework as a Matlab-package, ICEPATHFINDER, that
   is suitable for both operational and strategic ship route optimization.},

Title = {Seasonal Regional Differentiation of Human Thermal Comfort Conditions in
   Algeria},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {The thermal conditions of the bioclimate of Algeria are investigated
   applying especially the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET)
   seasonal variability of five main Algerian cities representing different
   climate and geographical conditions: coastal region, highland region,
   and Sahara zone. The physiologically equivalent temperature (PET)
   calculated for this study at 12.00UTC (13.00 local time) is used to
   emphasize the impacts of climate on human heat stress in different
   seasonal and regional regimes. This study is important since it is
   performed for the first time in Algeria using a deterministic approach
   through the calculation of PET based on the body-atmosphere energy
   balance using the Munich Energy-Balance Model for Individuals (MEMI).
   Applying PET is a new feature in assessing the bioclimate of Algeria and
   serves the touristic and the health sector in particular. For touristic
   purposes, it is part of the new internationally introduced climate
   touristic/transfer information scheme (CTIS) enabling the Algerian
   results to be paled in comparison to other countries. Considering
   climate change, the study shows as a new feature a significant increase
   in the number of days with strong and extreme heat stress within the
   last three decades and discusses the risks and advantages for future
   tourism in Algeria.},

Title = {The Characteristics of Lipid Biomarkers from the Abyssal and Hadal
   Sediments of the Yap Trench and the Influence of V-Shape Topography},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Lipid biomarkers from deep-sea sediments have been observed in several
   studies, but little is known about their occurrence in trench system
   sediments. Here, we determined the concentrations of lipid biomarkers
   (fatty acids and neutral lipids) in sediments from the north Yap Trench.
   Our results showed that short-chain (C12-20) saturated fatty acids
   (SFAs) contributed more than (C12:1-23:1) monounsaturated fatty acids
   (MUFAs), and (C16:3-24:4) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Most
   fatty acids (FAs) suggest that bacteria and algae were the main
   contributors to marine organic matter. In contrast, terrestrial organic
   matter (OM) was a minor contributor to long carbon chain fatty acids
   greater than C20. On the other side, the observed neutral lipids such as
   alkanes (C14-C27), alkanols (C12-C20), alkenes (C17:1-C26:1), phytol and
   sterol (C27-29) indicate that phytoplankton and bacteria were the main
   contributors of organic materials in the sediments, and the carbon chain
   of neutral lipids C20-29 offering the sources of terrestrial organic
   matter. The extremely depleted delta C-13 values of fatty acids give the
   sources of organic carbon in the sediments from bacteria, algae, and
   methane-related microbes. This study is important for understanding the
   biogeochemical activities in deep-sea environments, particularly in the
   abyss and hadal zones. It will be helpful to understand the sources,
   transfer, and deposition of organic matter in marine trenches.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Changes in Earth's orbit set the pace of glacial cycles, but the role of
   spatial variability in the insolation forcing of global ice volume
   remains unknown. Here, we leverage the intrinsic dynamical information
   in empirical records to show that ice volume responded to summer energy
   at high northern latitudes, as predicted by Milankovitch theory.
   However, the external forcing of ice volume encompasses insolation
   signals with a wide range of orbital frequency content, and cannot be
   fully accounted for by a unique time series. Southern mid-latitude
   insolation forcing coincides with the position of the subtropical front
   and the westerlies, which have been implicated in Quaternary climate
   changes. Dominant forcing modes at northern mid-latitudes are
   anti-phased with the canonical Milankovitch forcing, consistent with ice
   volume sensitivity to latitudinal insolation gradients.},

Title = {A bioenergetics model to evaluate demographic consequences of
   disturbance in marine mammals applied to gray whales},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {While sophisticated tools are used to monitor behavioral changes of
   large marine vertebrates, determining whether these changes are
   meaningful for management and conservation is challenging. The
   Population Consequences of Disturbance model proposed a bioenergetics
   model to detect biologically meaningful population responses, where
   disturbance costs are linked to lost energy. The model assumes that
   changes in behavior, caused by disturbance, compromise maternal
   condition, reducing energy delivery to offspring, leading to reduced
   reproduction, increased offspring mortality, and eventually increased
   adult mortality. Given its coastal habits and past whaling history, gray
   whales' (Eschrichtius robustus) life history and ecology are better
   known than for many other baleen whales. However, their preference for
   coastal habitat increases their exposure to human disturbance. We
   created a female gray whale bioenergetics model to determine energy
   requirements for a two-year reproductive cycle and determined the
   consequences of lost energy under three possible disturbance scenarios.
   An annual energetic loss of 4\% during the year in which she is
   pregnant, would prevent a female from successfully producing/weaning a
   calf. For this reason, gray whale reproduction is particularly sensitive
   to disturbance during pregnancy. During the year in which she is
   lactating, she would wean her calf at a lower mass with a 37\% energetic
   loss. A female would lack the energy to become pregnant during a year
   with a 30-35\% energetic loss, and female mortality would likely occur
   at 40-42\% annual energetic loss. Our model can be used for assessing
   disturbance costs or other effects associated with climate change and/or
   anthropogenic activities and can be applied to other species with
   similar life histories.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are suffering a major decline due to the environmental
   constraints imposed by climate change. Over the last 20 years, three
   major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous
   heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The
   conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented
   now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers
   are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral
   adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is
   that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the
   scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between
   genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea
   (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to
   investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the
   Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with
   descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six
   genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance
   against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions
   were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses.
   Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances
   between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The
   combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this
   population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat
   stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to
   neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective,
   quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can
   be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation
   planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any
   reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering
   preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in
   warming oceans.},

Abstract = {Aim Thirty white spruce {[}Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] islands were
   sampled to study the temporal and spatial pattern of white spruce
   regeneration at its southern limit of distribution.
   Location The study was conducted within three mixed-grass prairies in
   the Spruce Woods Provincial Park (SWPP) of south-western Manitoba.
   Methods White spruce seedlings, saplings and trees were mapped and
   measured in relation to eight sectors and five zones delimited by four
   transect lines extending through the centre of each island oriented
   north to south, west to east, north-west to south-east and north-east to
   south-west.
   Results Temporal patterns of regeneration were negatively correlated
   with July temperature at the time of establishment and up to 30 years
   after establishment. Height growth of seedlings and saplings were also
   negatively correlated with July temperature. Seedlings, saplings and
   trees were concentrated on the north vs. south aspect and within 4-12 m
   from the island centre. Seedlings grew almost exclusively in association
   with creeping juniper (Juniperus horizontalis Moench).
   Main conclusions Results of the study suggest that white spruce
   recruitment and growth reflect past climatic variation, and
   microclimatic and microsite conditions promoting soil moisture retention
   and/or fire risk reduction facilitate white spruce germination and
   establishment.},

Abstract = {Using an ocean carbon cycle model embedded in an ocean general
   circulation model, we examine how the budget of anthropogenic CO2
   (C-ant) is controlled by ocean dynamics. To complement recent studies
   showing only vertically integrated budgets, we provide a step-by-step
   description by making use of three different coarse grainings of the
   full vertical resolution of the ocean model in our budget analysis. For
   the 11 subdomains of the global ocean, these coarse grainings are (1) a
   one-layer (vertically integrated) budget, (2) a three-layer budget, and
   (3) an 11-layer budget. We largely focus on the Pacific circulation. We
   identify and quantify substantial carbon transport associated with the
   subtropical cells (STCs), which are dominant contributors to the
   meridional overturning circulation in the upper ocean in the tropics and
   subtropics, as playing a fundamental role in governing the ocean
   interior distribution of C-ant. The upper branch of the STCs transports
   C-ant-rich water from the tropics to the subtropics, contributing to the
   precondition for the high C-ant inventory in mode waters. The lower
   branch of the STCs carries about two thirds of the transported C-ant
   back to the tropics, while it largely excludes Subtropical Mode Waters.
   This work implies that the reemergence of C-ant through recirculation
   within the STCs may lead to a reduced capacity for further C-ant uptake
   via gas exchange into the surface ocean, potentially contributing to a
   positive carbon-climate feedback.},

Title = {Comparison of face mask, head hood, and canopy for breath sampling in
   flow-through indirect calorimetry to measure oxygen consumption and

Abstract = {Complete sampling of expired air is essential for accurate O-2
   consumption(CO2 production) {[}VO2VCO2)]] measurements with flow-through
   indirect calorimetry. In preterm infants complete sampling is critical,
   because only low sampling flows can be used. The accuracy of the various
   breath sampling systems at low flows and their patient compatibility is
   untested. We therefore measured 1) the accuracy of VO2(VCO2)
   measurements with a face mask, a head hood, and a canopy in vitro at low
   sampling flows; 2) the effect of breathing on measurements with the face
   mask; and 3) the effect of breath sampling systems on activity and body
   temperature of preterm infants. VO2(VCO2) were measured with a Deltatrac
   II(TM). I, vitro we used a methanol miniburner incorporated into a doll,
   which could simulate low VO2(VCO2) and tidal breathing. In vivo we
   studied seven pre term infants <1500 g. With the face mask VO2(VCO2)
   measurements were accurate at a flow of 3 L/min (error -1 +/- 0.8\%),
   when tidal volume was <15 mL/breath and the distance between mask and
   manikin <1 cm. With hood and canopy VO2(VCO2) were underestimated at a
   flow of 3 L/min (error - 13 +/- 1\% and - 14 +/- 5\%), and results were
   markedly influenced by body position. For accurate measurements, the
   hood needed a flow of 4.5 L/min, the canopy 8.3 L/min. In vivo the face
   mask did not increase heart rate, respiration, activity, or rectal
   temperature, but hood and canopy increased rectal temperature by 0.3-0.4
   degrees C. For VO2(VCO2) measurements in infants <1500 g, a face mask
   should be used, which is accurate at low flows and does not change body
   temperature. Accuracy at low flows and patient compatibility of breath
   sampling systems should be evaluated and reported for VO2(VCO2)
   measurements in preterm infants.},

Abstract = {Chaetoceros sp. was kept in 101 semicontinuous cultures, compatible with
   pilot-scale commercial production, with 50\% daily dilutions. Lighting
   was continuous, with Cool white, or blue-green fluorescent lamps, alone
   or with 6.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) of white light. For each type of light,
   cultures were stabilized at different photon fluence rates and sampled
   three to five times for biomass analysis. Cell yields increased with
   photon fluence rates, up to 432-498 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for white and
   between 498-565 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for both types of blue-green light.
   Above these fluxes, yields were light-saturated or even photoinhibited.
   For equal photon fluence rates cell concentrations were higher in white
   light, but biomass yields better in mixed blue-green. Chlorophylls a and
   c decreased with increasing light, while carotenoids showed an opposite
   trend. Carbon sinks were not different at low photon fluence rates of
   white and blue-green light, but the mixture of blue green light and
   white favoured lipogenesis over glycogenesis. At high photon fluence
   rates of blue-green light, proteogenesis increased dramatically at the
   expense of lipogenesis and glycogenesis in pure and mixed blue-green
   light respectively.},

Volume = {4},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {388-404},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Limited information exists regarding contemporary and historical
   emissions for many anthropogenic chemicals, especially for contaminants
   of emerging concern (CECs). This study examined temporal trends of
   several perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), polybrominated diphenyl
   ethers (PBDEs), and hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) in three beluga
   whale (Delphinapterus leucas) populations from the Canadian Arctic
   (Hendrickson Island (HI), NT; Pangnirtung (PG), NU; and Sanikiluaq (SQ),
   NU) collected from 1982-2013. The confounding factors of animal size,
   age, and sex were included in the analyses, but were only significant
   for some CECs. The strongest temporal resolution was obtained from HI,
   which showed increasing trends in PBDEs (4.8\%/yr) and HBCDs (2.9\%/yr),
   and decreases in perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acids (PFCAs, -6.0\%/yr).
   Concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) were relatively stable
   between 1984-2010, increasing substantially in 2011; trends in
   perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) concentrations were not strictly
   linear over the study period. PBDE, HBCD, and PFCA trends in the HI
   population were opposite/different to that of many other arctic animals
   (e.g. polar bears) for the same time-period. Trends were inconsistent
   among locations, suggesting that regional differences in dietary
   exposure and/or sources may also impact these trends. The effects of
   climate change-driven processes on the exposure and distribution of CECs
   are currently not well understood, highlighting a need for ongoing
   contaminant monitoring.},

Title = {In Situ Sediment Treatment Using Activated Carbon: A Demonstrated
   Sediment Cleanup Technology},

Abstract = {This paper reviews general approaches for applying activated carbon (AC)
   amendments as an in situ sediment treatment remedy. In situ sediment
   treatment involves targeted placement of amendments using installation
   options that fall into two general approaches: 1) directly applying a
   thin layer of amendments (which potentially incorporates weighting or
   binding materials) to surface sediment, with or without initial mixing;
   and 2) incorporating amendments into a premixed, blended cover material
   of clean sand or sediment, which is also applied to the sediment
   surface. Over the past decade, pilot-or full-scale field sediment
   treatment projects using AC-globally recognized as one of the most
   effective sorbents for organic contaminants-were completed or were
   underway at more than 25 field sites in the United States, Norway, and
   the Netherlands. Collectively, these field projects (along with numerous
   laboratory experiments) have demonstrated the efficacy of AC for in situ
   treatment in a range of contaminated sediment conditions. Results from
   experimental studies and field applications indicate that in situ
   sequestration and immobilization treatment of hydrophobic organic
   compounds using either installation approach can reduce porewater
   concentrations and biouptake significantly, often becoming more
   effective over time due to progressive mass transfer. Certain
   conditions, such as use in unstable sediment environments, should be
   taken into account to maximize AC effectiveness over long time periods.
   In situ treatment is generally less disruptive and less expensive than
   traditional sediment cleanup technologies such as dredging or isolation
   capping. Proper site-specific balancing of the potential benefits,
   risks, ecological effects, and costs of in situ treatment technologies
   (in this case, AC) relative to other sediment cleanup technologies is
   important to successful full-scale field application. Extensive
   experimental studies and field trials have shown that when applied
   correctly, in situ treatment via contaminant sequestration and
   immobilization using a sorbent material such as AC has progressed from
   an innovative sediment remediation approach to a proven, reliable
   technology. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published 2014 SETAC.},

Title = {Urban managed realignment: Application to the Thames Estuary, London},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1525-1534},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Over the centuries, London has progressively encroached into the tidal
   Thames River as it has developed into a ``World City{''}. This
   encroachment has exacerbated the flood risk to new and adjacent land,
   despite continual upgrading of flood defences. The pressure for further
   encroachment remains, despite the new threat of human-induced climate
   change-that is, the combined effect of (1) increased peak river flow in
   the winter, (2) more intense precipitation events, (3) accelerated
   sea-level rise, and possibly (4) more severe storms and resulting storm
   surges. Costly upgrade of defences is inevitable to manage the increased
   flood risk, and this has caused a re-evaluation of the Thames Estuary's
   flood defence program. For the first time, managed realignment in urban
   areas is being considered as a flood management tool. This offers a
   range of potential benefits including (1) increasing storage for
   floodwater, (2) improving ecological functioning, (3) improving
   riverside access for people, and (4) reversing the long-term trend of
   encroachment into the river. Planned managed realignment can widen the
   scope for future defence upgrade, but has been limited in urbanised
   areas. Several projects in London (e.g., Tate Modern and Millennium
   Dome) have shown that realignment can achieve the benefits described
   above, which supports the government's recent ``Making Space for
   Water{''} policy.
   This study investigates the feasibility of managed realignment in the
   Thames Estuary. Fragmentation between flood defence and spatial
   development policies, lack of political support, and riverside
   encroachment continue to delay urban realignment projects. Successful
   application will require long-term planning (over decades) that exploits
   all opportunities for landward realignment offered by redevelopment.
   With the uncertainties behind climate change and more development in the
   ``Thames Gateway{''}, further research is needed to understand the
   contribution of urban realignment to any flood management strategy that
   may be applied to other coastal urban areas.},

Title = {An ecosystem-based fisheries assessment approach and management system
   for the Red Sea},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {227},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Fish captures from the Red Sea in the Egyptian waters have sharply
   declined from 73,549 metric tons in 2001 to 44,000 metric tons in 2010.
   Our research was conducted using an ecosystem-based fisheries assessment
   (EBFA) approach and a Tier 2 qualitative assessment. The periods 2002
   and 2012 were targeted for assessment the status of fish stocks. Nested
   risk indices, such as objectives risk index(ORI), species risk
   index(SRI), fishery risk index (FRI)-and ecosystem risk index (ERI)were
   also implemented.The results of the reference point indicators were
   compared with those from 2002 and 2012 to show the assessment of
   species, fisheries and ecosystems in both years.Management status for
   year 2012 exhibited significant negative change compared that in 2002
   regarding attributes such as sustainability, biodiversity, habitat
   quality and socio-economics. Seven fish species were chosen as the
   target species and SRI was assessed by the Tier 2 approach. The results
   showed that 80 \% of indicators are found in the safe zone with green
   colour; 18.1 \% are located in the limited range or yellow zone; 1.9
   \%arelocated beyond the safety limits or in the red zone in 2002. For
   2012, 27.6 \% of indicators in safe zone with green colour were
   recorded, with 48.6 \% in the limited range or yellow zone and 23.8 \%
   in out of safety limits or red zone. Purse seine, trawl and longline
   nets accounted for 89.43 \% in 2002 and 80.3 \%in 2012. FRI values were
   recorded at 0.44, 0.79 and 0.46 respectively in 2002 and located in the
   safe zone with green colour. Furthermore, in 2012, FRI values were
   recorded at 1.78, 1.85 and 1.24 respectively and moved to limited range
   or the yellow zone.ERI was recorded at 0.70 in 2002 (safe zone with
   green colour) but in 2012 it was recorded at 1.69 (limited range or
   yellow zone). The results showed significant negative changes in 2012
   compared to that in 2002 based on sustainability of fish stock, catch
   biodiversity, habitat quality and socio-economics. Four management
   objectives are recommended for reducing risk indices and improve the
   ecosystem of the Red Sea.},

Title = {Disturbance, colonization and development of Antarctic benthic

Year = {2007},
Volume = {362},

Abstract = {A decade has yielded much progress in understanding polar disturbance
   and community recovery-mainly through quantifying ice scour rates, other
   disturbance levels, larval abundance and diversity, colonization rates
   and response of benthos to predicted climate change. The continental
   shelf around Antarctica is clearly subject to massive disturbance, but
   remarkably across so many scales. In summer, millions of icebergs from
   sizes smaller than cars to larger than countries ground out and gouge
   the sea floor and crush the benthic communities there, while the highest
   wind speeds create the highest waves to pound the coast. In winter, the
   calm associated with the sea surface freezing creates the clearest
   marine water in the world. But in winter, an ice foot encases coastal
   life and anchor ice rips benthos from the sea floor. Over tens and
   hundreds of thousands of years, glaciations have done the same on
   continental scales-ice sheets have bulldozed the seabed and the
   zoobenthos to edge of shelves. We detail and rank modern disturbance
   levels (from most to least): ice; asteroid impacts; sediment
   instability; wind/wave action; pollution; UV irradiation; volcanism;
   trawling; non-indigenous species; freshwater inundation; and temperature
   stress. Benthic organisms have had to recolonize local scourings and
   continental shelves repeatedly, yet a decade of studies have
   demonstrated that they have (compared with lower latitudes) slow tempos
   of reproduction, colonization and growth. Despite massive disturbance
   levels and slow recolonization potential, the Antarctic shelf has a much
   richer fauna than would be expected for its area. Now, West Antarctica
   is among the fastest warming regions and its organisms face new rapid
   changes. In the next century, temperature stress and non-indigenous
   species will drastically rise to become dominant disturbances to the
   Antarctic life. Here, we describe the potential for benthic organisms to
   respond to disturbance, focusing particularly on what we know now that
   we did not a decade ago.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {10},
Pages = {85355-85367},
Abstract = {Renewable energy hydrogen production technology is an effective way to
   improve the utilization of renewable energy and alleviate the problem of
   wind and light abandonment. However, there are many challenges in the
   system structure design and ``Source-Load-Storage{''} coordination
   control strategy for large-scale, megawatt-scale renewable energy
   hydrogen production. In this paper, a hybrid wind-solar-energy storage
   hydrogen production system based on Medium Voltage Direct Current (MVDC)
   structure is proposed. HOMER software is used to plan and study the
   storage capacity to achieve long-term power balance and matching of the
   system. In addition, A decentralized coordinated control energy
   management system with active power following and state of charge (SOC)
   recovery capability is proposed and implemented for transient power
   regulation. An electromagnetic transient simulation was established in
   PSCAD/EMTDC, and semi-physical experiments were designed using StarSim
   to verify the effectiveness of the control strategy. Theoretical
   analysis and experiments show that the island MVDC network with
   decentralized coordinated control has technical feasibility in realizing
   hydrogen production from renewable energy in the 20MW level class. In
   addition, the power consumed by the load can realize the seconds level
   tracking of the output power of renewable energy.},

Abstract = {Life Buoy, also known as a life preserver, is a crucial safety tool on
   board any marine ships. The most common and conventional lifesaver is
   operated manually to save people from drowning, yet this method poses a
   risk for both the victim and rescuer. Hence, with the help of current
   technology, a smart lifebuoy has been developed, whereby the rescuer
   just operates the lifebuoy using remote control. Yet, the existing smart
   life buoy system has been found heavy and hard to be operated,
   especially for women, children, and other people with disabilities. This
   paper focuses on the development of a lightweight smart life buoy system
   and its characteristics. Arduino Uno R3, Arduino Nano, DC motor 775,
   Transmitter and Receiver kit were the main components used in the
   development of the lightweight smart life buoy system (LWSLB). The
   developed LWSLB system was tested at the National Defence University of
   Malaysia' swimming pool due to Covid-19 lockdown, and data such as
   speed, range of remote connection and battery endurance were obtained.
   It has been found out that the developed LWSLB weighs just 3.5kg overall
   compared to Brand S which weighs 13.75kg. However, in terms of speed,
   Brand S proves to be faster at 4.17m/s compared to LWSLB which exhibits
   a speed of 1.25m/s.},

Abstract = {Nipa palm (Nypa fruticans) was one kind of important, abundant and
   underutilized tree in estuarine conditions akin to mangroves. There were
   increasing demand from health-conscious consumers for better food
   quality, improved food safety, nutritional value, freshness, and
   flavors. Non-thermal process attracted widespread attention from food
   industry practitioners. High pressure treatment was effectively
   commercialized as minimal non-thermal processing technology. This
   research evaluated the impact of holding duration and high pressure on
   physical, phytochemical and enzymatic attributes of nipa palm endosperm.
   Different values of pressure (250 divided by 450 MPa) and holding
   duration (4 divided by 20 min) were verified. Results showed that high
   pressure and holding time significantly improved firmness and chewiness,
   maintained phenolic and flavonoid content while they decreased
   polygalacturonase and pectinesterase content of nipa palm endosperm.
   High pressure treatment could be effectively utilized to enhance
   functional attributes of nipa palm endosperm.},

Abstract = {Seismic analysis of an offshore platform requires an integral model
   combining all its elements: foundation, substructure, deck, modules,
   appurtenances, and even pipeline and riser tie-ins. With typical
   breakdown of project scope amongst several EPC contractors, the task of
   creating a seismic model and ensuring proper input, output and updates
   for EPC contractors' design always rests with the operator's engineering
   team. This model is complicated by the nature of dynamic
   soil-structure-interaction characterized by radiation of earthquake wave
   and energy to the far field. This radiation of energy is significant for
   short squatty gravity-base structures while most structural software
   lack this capability. This problem has been worked by the nuclear
   industry, but in this paper we summarize ExxonMobil practice for
   carrying this task in this scope breakdown environment. The need for
   this practice emerged during the engineering of Orlan (Sakhalin), was
   first used on the Adriatic LNG Terminal (Italy) and applied since on
   Berkut (Sakhalin) and Hebron (Canada).},

Abstract = {Joint reliability importance (JRI) evaluates the interaction of two
   components in contributing to the system reliability in a system.
   Traditional JRI measures mainly concern the change of the system
   reliability caused by the interactive change of the reliabilities of the
   two components and seldom consider the probability distributions,
   transition rates of the object component states, and system performance.
   This article extends the JRI concept of two components from multi-state
   systems to multi-state transition systems and mainly focuses on the
   joint integrated importance measure (JIIM) which considers the
   transition rates of component states. Firstly, the concept and physical
   meaning of JIIM in binary systems are described. Secondly, the JIIM for
   deterioration process (JIIMDP) and the JIIM for maintenance process
   (JIIMMP) in multi-state systems are studied respectively. The
   corresponding characteristics of JIIMDP and JIIMMP for series and
   parallel systems are also analyzed. Finally, an application to an
   offshore electrical power generation system is given to demonstrate the
   proposed JIIM.},

Title = {Chemistry of springs across the Mariana forearc shows progressive
   devolatilization of the subducting plate},

Abstract = {Cold springs upwelling through large serpentinite mud volcanoes in the
   outer half of the Mariana forearc provide a unique window into processes
   of devolatilization of the subducting Pacific Plate. We have sampled
   upwelling pore waters with lower chlorinity than seawater from six sites
   oil five serpentinite mud Volcanoes. by conventional gravity and piston
   coring, by push coring from the ROV Jason, by drilling on ODP Legs 125
   and 195, and by manned Submersible. The sites range from 13degrees47'N
   to 19degrees33'N and 52 to 90 km from the Mariana trench axis,
   corresponding to approximate depths to the top of the downgoing plate of
   16 to 29 km. The composition of the springs varies systematically over
   this distance: nearer the trench the upwelling waters have much higher
   Ca and Sr than seawater and much lower carbonate alkalinity, sulfate,
   Na/Cl, K, Rb, and B. Farther from the trench the waters show the
   opposite trends relative to seawater. Chlorinity is consistently lower
   than in seawater and shows large variations that are not systematic with
   distance from the trench. Cs is consistently higher than in seawater and
   increases with distance from the trench. All of the waters have high pH
   and are heavily depleted in Mg, Si, Li, F, and (87)Sr/(86)Sr relative to
   seawater. They tend to be enriched in O(18)/O(16). Except for ODP
   drilling, none of the cores was long enough to produce an asymptotic
   compositional trend with depth. We have inferred the end-member
   compositions of the upwelling waters by extrapolation against Mg. At two
   sites we were able to compare data from gravity cores with data from
   drill cores or push cores collected at springs to estimate the effects
   of reactions that occur at shallow depth below the seafloor, on mixing
   of the upwelling waters with seawater. These effects are different for
   sites high in dissolved Ca, nearer the trench, vs. those high in
   alkalinity, farther from the trench. Common to both are large losses
   from solution of 1) Ca, as CaCO(3) and in exchange for Na; 2) Mg, in
   exchange for Na or Ca and as brucite; 3) sulfate, probably reduced by
   microbes or possibly precipitated as gypsum: 4) Sr, Ba, Si, and F. Na is
   consistently leached from the solids into solution, whereas K and
   O(18)/O(16) are relatively unreactive.
   We infer that the upwelling waters are uniformly saturated with CaCO(3)
   and that the excess H(2)O and the trends in Ca, Sr, alkalinity, and
   sulfate with distance from the trench result from introduction of H(2)O
   and dissolved carbonate and sulfate from an external Source, the
   sediment and altered basalt at the top of the subducting plate. The
   concurrent trends in Na/Cl, B, Cs, and especially K and Rb indicate that
   these species originate from the top of the subducting plate in response
   to increasing temperature. These systematic variations across the Outer
   forearc imply that the solutions ascend more or less vertically from the
   Source region and do not travel long distances laterally along the
   decollement before ascending. Based on leaching of K, the 150degreesC
   isotherm is crossed approximately beneath Big Blue Seamount at a depth
   of similar to22 km below the seafloor, 70 km behind the trench. By this
   point it appears that carbonate dissolution has joined dehydration as a
   significant process at the top of the subducting plate. Copyright (C)

   practitioners. Only within the context of the third category does animal

Abstract = {Seafloor flow induced processes are generally studied from rigid
   structures. Where undisturbed flow is important, open structures are
   used, tripods being the choice for omnidirectional flow. Stiffness as
   well as openness is important to delay excitation of vibrations that can
   contaminate velocity measurements, masking turbulence in the flow.
   SuperBASS, measuring velocity and turbulence at seven heights from 0.3
   to 7 m above bottom, is 8 m tall, 4,m between footpads, weighs 530 kg,
   and is stable to overturning to 1 m/s flow velocity. A `'Y'' channel of
   rectangular cross section from the bottom of the legs supports the base
   of the acoustic current meter array, eliminating the need for stiffener
   struts on the faces of the tripod. While this design reduces turbulence
   at all sensor heights that would have come from the wake of upstream
   stiffening struts, a mean upward component of flow is observed on the
   lower sensors from separation of the flow over the `'Y'' channel near
   the seabed.},

Abstract = {The question of how smallholders of the Amazon estuary, locally known as
   cabolcos, have adapted their land use systems to produce resources
   during booms and busts is analyzed in this article. We draw upon more
   than 50 years of census data and more than 30 years of remotely sensed
   land-cover data to reconstruct these dynamics from World War II to the
   present. We found that smallholders are highly flexible in their land
   use decisions and livelihood strategies and that such flexibility has
   helped them to adapt their land-use systems to produce resources in
   demand during market booms and conserve forests. Smallholder mosaic
   landscapes contain forest fragments that enhance socioecological
   resilience to floods and other events produced by changes in the local
   hydro-climatic regimes due to sea-level rise and other climate-related
   changes. We argue that flexibility is a tool to reduce livelihood
   vulnerability by facilitating adaptation to global market and climate
   driven changes over the long term.},

Abstract = {In human-impacted coastal ecosystems, living shorelines are becoming a
   common restoration technique. However, we lack a comprehensive
   understanding of the ecological and physical benefits, and how they
   could inform management needs. To address this, we studied effectiveness
   of living shorelines at a broad spatial scale within the Washington
   State boundaries of the Salish Sea, USA, with restored site ages
   spanning 1-11 years. We surveyed 30 beaches at ten locations, each with
   three strata of: (1) living shoreline beaches with armor removed, (2)
   armored control beaches altered by seawalls or riprap, and (3)
   un-armored reference beaches with natural conditions. We sampled eight
   physical and biological attributes: beach wrack, wrack invertebrates,
   sediments, terrestrial insects, riparian vegetation, logs, beach
   profiles, and stable isotope signatures of talitrid amphipods -
   generating 27 metrics focusing on upper intertidal and supratidal
   elevations affected by armoring and targeted by living shoreline
   actions. These metrics spanned the functions of beach stability,
   ecological diversity, and food web support for juvenile salmon.
   Statistical tests showed that 19 of the 27 metrics had significant
   strata differences, indicating that some beach metrics restore quickly
   (e.g., wrack accumulation), while others take longer (e.g., log
   accumulation). Terrestrial-associated metrics were higher at reference
   beaches, but insect taxa richness and logs with plant growth increased
   at beaches restored for four or more years (the average age of the
   living shoreline sites). This implies that certain living shoreline
   functions increase through time, providing improved food web support.
   Globally, trajectories of restoration have shown a range of functional
   improvement with time, and will be important to monitor for nature-based
   solutions to coastal defense given the increasing rate of shoreline
   stressors from global change and sea level rise.},

Abstract = {Polylactic acid fiber(PLA) is a kind of novel synthetic fiber which is
   completely bio-degradable and can be abstracted from grains like maize.
   The polylactic acid fiber discarded can be decomposed into carbon
   dioxide and water by microorganism in the soil or seawater. It is widely
   applied to the textile and medical material domain because of its
   preferable performances. According to its chemical performances, we
   carry on the thorough discussion to the influence of PLA fiber during
   pretreating it in dyeing and finishing through some parameters such as
   SEM loss of weight rate, yarn tensile strength. The experiments
   indicated that: at the common demand of refining, the dosage of
   alkalescence has little influence on PLA performance; it shouldn't adopt
   alkali desizing for it brings heavy damage to PLA; the diameter of fiber
   bunch change smaller, single fiber shape morphogenesis furcation hollows
   out and until breaks. Textile fiber surface bumpy proves that the
   textile fiber ester chain has already experienced varying degrees of
   hydrolysis. Enzymatic desizing in one bath results in small rate of
   weight loss, with an average of 0.42\% and high tensile strength, with
   an average of 170cN. High frequency is found in the treatment results.},

Title = {Preliminary conceptual model of the Cerro Blanco caldera-hosted
   geothermal system (Southern Puna, Argentina): Inferences from
   geochemical investigations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {94},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Cerro Blanco Caldera (CBC) is the youngest collapse caldera system
   in the Southern Central Andes (Southern Puna, Argentina). The CBC is
   subsiding with at an average velocity of 0.87 cm/year and hosts an
   active geothermal system. A geochemical characterization of emitted
   fluids was carried out based on the chemical and isotopic compositions
   of fumaroles, and thermal and cold springs discharged in this volcanic
   area with the aim of constructing the first hydrogeochemical conceptual
   model and preliminary estimate the geothermal potential. The main
   hydrothermal reservoir, likely hosted within the pre-caldera basement
   rocks, has a Na+-Cl-(HCO3)(-) composition with estimated temperatures >=
   135 degrees C. The unconsolidated, fine-grained Cerro Blanco ignimbrite
   likely acts as the cap-rock of the hydrothermal system. The presence of
   phreatic eruption breccias in the surrounding area of the geothermal
   fumaroles supports the effectiveness of the pyroclastic deposit as
   sealing rocks. The isotopic data of water (delta O-18 and delta D)
   indicate a meteoric recharge of the hydrothermal reservoir, suggesting
   as recharge areas the sectors surrounding the CBC, mainly towards the W
   and NW where large outcrops of the pre-caldera basement exist. A
   fault-controlled hydraulic connection between the hot springs and the
   hydro thermal reservoir is proposed for the Los Hornitos area. The
   fumaroles show the typical compositional features of hydrothermal
   fluids, being dominated by water vapor with significant concentrations
   of H2S, CH4 and H-2. Considering the high geothermal gradient of this
   area (similar to 104 degrees C/km) and the relatively high fraction of
   mantle He (similar to 39\%) calculated on the basis of the measured R/Ra
   values, the hydrothermal aquifer likely receives inputs of magmatic
   fluids from the degassing magma chamber. The preliminary geothermal
   potential at CBC was evaluated with the Volume Method, calculating up to
   E = 11.4{*}10(18) J. Both the scarce presence of superficial thermal
   manifestations and the occurrence of an efficient cap-rock likely
   contribute to minimize the loss of thermal energy from the reservoir.
   The results here presented constitute the necessary base of knowledge
   for further accurate assessment of the geothermal potential and
   ultimately the implementation of the geothermal resource as a viable
   energy alternative for small localities or mining facilities isolated
   from the National Interconnected System due to their remote
   localization.},

Title = {Adventive hydrothermal circulation on Stromboli volcano (Aeolian
   Islands, Italy) revealed by geophysical and geochemical approaches:
   Implications for general fluid flow models on volcanoes},

Abstract = {On March 15th 2007 a paroxysmal explosion occurred at the Stromboli
   volcano. This event generated a large amount of products, mostly lithic
   blocks, some of which impacted the ground as far as down to 200 m
   a.s.l., about 1.5 km far away from the active vents.Two days after the
   explosion, a new vapour emission was discovered on the north-eastern
   flank of the volcanic edifice, at 560 m a.s.l., just above the area
   called ``Nel Cannestra{''}. This new vapour emission was due to a block
   impact. In order to investigate the block impact area to understand the
   appearance of the vapour emission, we conducted on May 2008 a
   multidisciplinary study involving Electrical Resistivity Tomography
   (ERT), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Self-Potential (SP), CO2 soil
   diffuse degassing and soil temperature surveys. This complementary data
   set revealed the presence of an anomalous conductive body, probably
   related to a shallow hydrothermal level, at about 10-15 m depth, more or
   less parallel to the topography. It is the first time that such a
   hydrothermal fluid flow, with a temperature close to the water boiling
   point (76 degrees C) has been evidenced at Stromboli at this low
   elevation on the flank of the edifice. The ERT results suggest a
   possible link between (1) the main central hydrothermal system of
   Stromboli, located just above the plumbing system feeding the active
   vents, with a maximum of subsurface soil temperature close to 90 degrees
   C and limited by the NeoStromboli summit crater boundary and (2) the
   investigated area of Nel Cannestra, at similar to 500 m a.s.l., a buried
   eruptive fissure active 9 ka ago. In parallel, SP and CO2 soil diffuse
   degassing measurements suggest in this sector at slightly lower
   elevation from the block impact crater a magmatic and hydrothermal fluid
   rising system along the N41 degrees regional fault. A complementary ERT
   profile, on May 2009, carried out from the NeoStromboli crater boundary
   down to the block impact crater displayed a flank fluid flow apparently
   connected to a deeper system. The concept of shallow hydrothermal level
   have been compared to similar ERT results recently obtained on Mount
   Etna and La Fossa cone of Vulcano. This information needs to be taken
   into account in general fluid flow models on volcanoes. In particular,
   peripheral thermal waters (as those bordering the northeastern coast of
   Stromboli) could be contaminated by hydrothermal and magmatic fluids
   coming from regional faults but also from the summit. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {Cathodoluminescence wavelength imaging (CLWI) of InAs/GaAs
   self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) was performed to study the spatial
   variation in the spectral lineshape of the broadened quantum dot (QD)
   ensemble. The lineshape was found to vary on a scale of similar to mum,
   revealing attendant variations in the size distribution of SAQD clusters
   on this spatial scale. Energy variations in clusters of SAQDs are found
   to exhibit a spatial correlation with the efficiency of luminescence and
   the activation energy for thermal re-emission of carriers. A reduction
   in the energy variation of the QD clusters occurs when the thickness of

Abstract = {Fish (finfish or shellfish) has been classified as healthy by health
   professionals despite containing contaminants, since fish is high in
   long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which have Multiple
   beneficial health effects such as decreased risk of stroke via
   anti-thrombotic and vasodilative effects, increased heart rate
   variability, reducing serum triacylglycerol and blood pressure,
   anti-inflammatory activities, improving visual function, improving
   attention-deficit conditions/ hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenic and
   dementia; and may be effective in managing depression in adults. All
   these beneficial effects are thought to be mediated through altering
   cell membrane composition, fluidity, receptors and membrane-bound
   enzymes, gene expression and eicosanoid production. However, natural
   marine and freshwater fish populations are declining as a result of
   over-fishing, temperature and climate changes etc. To re-establish and
   maintain the fish population in China, fishing has been banned for 2-3
   months during specified periods of the year, which differs depending on
   the area, since 1995. The fish population has recovered since
   implementation of these banned fishing periods, and thereby maintaining
   the sustainability and affordability of fish. Aquaculture products have
   had a significant contribution to China's food system, with significant
   increase in output over the past few decades, from one million tons in
   1978 to 32 million tons in 2007. Aquaculture fish represents a higher
   portion of total aquatic products compared with natural marine and
   freshwater fish, which has only been achieved in China, and this has
   contributed greatly to food and health security. China's success in this
   area is a good model for other developing countries.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for the identification and selection of
   a set of indicators for Integrated Coastal Zone Management. A structured
   approach to Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) calls for
   indicators to measure progress in, and effects of, ICZM policies. In the
   context of the EU FP7 funded project People for Ecosystem-based
   Goverance in Assessing Sustainable development of Ocean and coast
   (PEGASO) a set of indicators to primarily support the implementation of
   the ICZM Protocol for the Mediterranean has been developed. More
   generally, the aim was to provide a suite of indicators that can be
   applied at different scales, both in the Mediterranean and Black sea, as
   sustainability assessment tool, and as tool to measure the
   implementation of ICZM policies and programmes. In order to define a set
   of indictors able to respond to the needs of the ICZM Protocol and in
   order to promote an integrated approach to overcome the traditional
   sectorial (e. g. fishery, tourism, energy) one, it has been decided to
   link the PEGASO set of indicators to 10 ICZM policy objectives. These
   policy objectives reflect the principles of ICZM which can be found in
   Article 6 of the Protocol. The PEGASO set of ICZM indicators should not
   only serve as a descriptive tool but mainly as an analytical one for the
   understanding of the coastal system, being it a region (the
   Mediterranean or the Black Sea), a country or a local coastal area.},

Title = {Geochemical Equilibrium and Processes in Seawater},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The geochemical equilibrium in seawater must be observed taking into
   account the chemical and geological, as well as biological, processes.
   The concept of equilibrium takes into account the composition of the
   system and the kinetics of the reactions taking place therein. In
   coastal waters, nutrients and trace elements can be delivered not only
   through rivers but also through atmospheric input and submarine
   groundwater discharges. In addition to natural sources, levels of
   different elements can also be influenced by growing and diverse human
   activities along coasts. Consequently, the pathways and fate of
   different environmental chemicals in coastal areas are governed by
   various factors. The multiparameter approach, combined with different
   statistical tools, is a well-established way of interpreting their
   inputs and behaviour in marine systems. Nevertheless, the data for the
   karst regions, as found in the Mediterranean, are particularly scarce.
   This Special IssueGeochemical Equilibrium and Processes in Seawaterof
   Geosciences gathers five articles on different topics related to water
   and sediment geochemistry of the coastal karst areas of the
   Mediterranean, including Slovenia, Croatia and Egypt. The topics
   included in this Issue refer to (1) geochemistry of sediments in the
   area of intensive anthropogenic activity; (2) the geochemistry of
   sediment and biota in a protected area under increasing pressure due to
   tourist activity; (3) the influence of a thermal power plant on the
   geochemistry of the surrounding area; (4) the influence of underground
   water discharges on water quality; and (5) the possibility of monitoring
   natural and anthropogenic processes in karst systems by using a specific
   group of elements.},

Title = {The shallow porosity structure of the Eel shelf, northern California.
   results of a towed electromagnetic survey},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {154},
Number = {1-4},
Pages = {211-226},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A towed electromagnetic survey, mapping the electrical resistivity of
   the seafloor, was conducted over an area of the Eel shelf off Humboldt
   Bay, California. Continuous resistivity profiles to 20 m below the
   seafloor were measured along 120 km of track line, from water depths of
   100 m to around 30 m. The shallow structure along the shelf is highly
   variable and we identify three distinct environments based on the
   recorded resistivities and the porosities inferred from them. The first
   region is a mid-shelf depocenter, characterized by a thin (similar to 2
   m), moderately high-porosity (45-60\%) surface layer, which overlies a
   less porous (35-45\%) and homogeneous substrate, uniform both laterally
   and vertically. This region is found to the northwest of the Humboldt
   Bay entrance, from water depths of about 65 m to at least 100 m, and is
   roughly coincident with recent flood deposits. The second region is
   located closer to shore and contains extremely high resistivities for a
   shallow sedimentary environment, It reveals a high degree of spatial
   variability on length scales of several hundred meters. Several
   possibilities exist to explain such high resistivities and these
   include: upwelling fresh water channeled to the seafloor through local
   fault and anticline systems; a significant volume of natural gas within
   the sediments; or a continuous process of carbonate precipitation
   through oxidation of methane near the seafloor, which, over time, builds
   a substantial thickness of lithified material. None of the above
   explanations are mutually exclusive, and all could act in concert to
   increase resistivities. The third region roughly coincides with the Eel
   River delta and features a buried layer of moderately low porosity
   (30-35\%) at a depth of about 5 m and with a thickness of between 5 and
   10 m. This layer extends from near the entrance to Humboldt Bay in a
   southwesterly direction across the shelf. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},

Volume = {2},

Pages = {27-31},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The frequency and severity of coral bleaching events have increased in
   recent decades. Regionally, human-attributed nutrient pollution,
   particularly nitrate, has increased in coastal areas due to inflow from
   rivers and groundwater. The combined effects of increased nitrate
   concentrations with high temperature or high light on bleaching events
   and reactive oxygen species levels (ROS) were tested. Coral fragments of
   Montipora digitata were incubated for 3 and 6 days at different light
   intensities (200 and 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), temperatures (27 and 32
   degrees C), and nitrate concentrations (< 1 and 10 mu M). Quantum yields
   of the photosynthetic electron transport system were significantly
   decreased under high-temperature conditions. Because there were strong
   correlations between zooxanthellae density and antioxidant enzyme
   activities (superoxide dismutase and catalase), we hypothesized that a
   decrease in zooxanthellae occurred due to oxidative stresses. Our
   results show that enrichment of nitrate can accelerate coral bleaching
   under high light or high temperature conditions compared with single
   stress conditions. If the concentration of nitrate increases damage to
   coral reefs in coastal areas could significantly increase under high
   temperature or high light stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Hybridisation on coral reefs and the conservation of evolutionary

Journal = {CURRENT ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {132-145},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Hybridisation was traditionally considered rare on coral reefs. However,
   a rapid increase in hybrid studies over the last 20 years has revealed
   that hybridisation on coral reefs is common and widespread. In this
   review, we summarise the growing body of evidence arising from studies
   on stony corals and reef fishes to verify the occurrence of
   hybridisation, and we examine the influence hybridisation has had on the
   enormous level of biodiversity present on coral reefs. We discuss the
   challenges of distinguishing hybridisation from alternative hypotheses (
   e.g. incomplete lineage sorting). This review also explores the
   evolutionary consequences of hybridisation, which range from increasing
   genetic diversity and the production of novel lineages that may
   outperform the parent species, to reverse speciation and extinction by
   genetic swamping. Instances of hybridisation can be natural or occur as
   a result of human impacts ( e.g. habitat degradation) and distinguishing
   between these two very different causal mechanisms is important for
   management. Currently, the legislative status of hybrids is unclear and
   hybrids are rarely protected in conservation programs. Failing to
   adequately manage hybridisation and hybrid lineages may lead to
   potential losses of evolutionary novelty, declines in phylogenetic
   diversity or species extinctions. To conserve existing coral reef
   biodiversity, and the processes that generate biodiversity, conservation
   policies must be re-defined and instances of hybridisation must be
   assessed and managed on a case-by-case basis},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Abstract = {The use of rootstocks particularly for sweet cherry cultivars is of
   great importance for successful and sustainable production. Choosing the
   right cherry rootstocks is just as important as choosing the right
   cultivar. In this study, 110 sweet cherry, 30 sour cherry, and 41
   mahaleb types displaying rootstock potential for sweet cherry cultivars
   were selected from Central and East Black Sea Regions in Turkey. The
   morphologic characteristics of the studied genotypes were compared with
   the standard clonal rootstocks PHL-A, MaxMa 14, Montmorency, Weiroot
   158, Gisela 5, Gisela 6, and SL64. A total of 42morphological UPOV
   characteristics were evaluated in the selected genotypes and clonal
   rootstocks. The obtained data were analyzed by using principal component
   analysis and it revealed that eigenvalues of the first 3 components were
   able to represent 36.43\% of total variance. The most significant
   positive correlations of the plant vigor were determined with leaf blade
   length and petiole thickness. According to the diversity analysis of
   coefficients, the 05 C 002 and 08 C 039 genotypes were identified as
   being similar (6.66), while the 05 C 002 and 55 S 012 genotypes were
   determined as the most distant genotypes (325.84) in terms of

Title = {Accessibility and Public Transport Mobility for a Smart(er) Island:
   Evidence from Sardinia (Italy)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {87},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to highlight the critical aspects of
   islands context transportation accessibility by suggesting a more
   innovative, safer, and more sustainable framework for public transport
   service (PTS) and place-based organisation, as well as by integrating
   the latest tendencies in mobility. Specifically, this research focuses
   on multimodal integration models for PTS that consider the existing
   infrastructure system and the so-cioeconomic issues typical of an island
   environment. This topic has received inadequate consideration in the
   scientific literature on islands. To achieve these aims, an
   analytical-numerical approach is adopted. Starting from initial
   origin-destination matrices (O/D) surveyed by the National Institute of
   Statistics (ISTAT), a methodology was implemented to compute the
   geographical distribution of trips, and thereafter, the values
   distributed over the whole region were interpolated by Surfer software
   with the Kriging method. This methodology was applied to the Sardinia
   case study particularly emblematic because it has seen a tremendous
   transition over the previous decades, resulting in a massive
   socio-economic gap between inland and coastal areas, that led to an
   increase in private vehicles for transportation purposes, primarily for
   business and pleasure. The application, replicable in other islands that
   have highlighted the same socio-economic problems linked to poor
   mobility planning, shows an accessible spatial planning approach,
   combining PTS and rental for driver services, by considering the
   principles and issues of island contexts. This research gives an
   important scientific contribution by emphasising the quality of
   transport infrastructures, place-based organisation, population
   distribution, and physical config-uration of the Insular Region, as well
   as by considering the most pressing issues of island contexts. Findings
   could help island governments in revising their policy and practice of
   transport, accordingly.},

Abstract = {This study presents results from a downscaling simulation of the impact
   of a doubling of CO2 concentration. A multidecadal coupled simulation of
   a 1\% per year increase of CO2 concentration with the Hadley Centre
   ocean-atmosphere model provides its sea-surface temperatures and deep
   soil climatological temperatures as a boundary condition to two 10-year
   integrations with a version of the ARPEGE-IFS atmosphere model. This
   global spectral model has a horizontal resolution varying between 60 km
   in the Mediterranean Sea and 700 km in the southern Pacific. The global
   impact as well as the regional impact over Europe in this time slice are
   examined and compared with results from other studies. Over Europe, our
   main focus, the model impact consists of a warming of about 2 degrees C,
   relatively uniform and with little seasonal dependence. There are
   precipitation increases of about 10\% over the northern part in winter
   and spring, and 30\% over the southern part in winter only.
   Precipitation decreases by 20\% in the southern part in autumn. The
   day-to-day variability of the precipitation increases, except over the
   southern area in summer. No strong impact is found on the soil moisture.
   Budgets of physical fluxes are examined at the top of the atmosphere and
   at the land-atmosphere interface.},

Title = {Sensitivity of modeled NEP to climate forcing and soil at site and
   regional scales: Implications for upscaling ecosystem models},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {320},
Pages = {241-257},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {The quality of gridded weather and soil datasets is one of the main
   sources of uncertainty in modeling regional scale land-atmosphere carbon
   exchange. This uncertainty may be assessed by comparing net ecosystem
   productivity (NEP) modeled for selected grid cells with these datasets
   against NEP modeled at representative sites within that grid cell for
   which detailed site scale measurements of weather and soil are
   available. In this study, a comprehensive mathematical ecosystem model,
   ecosys, was used to simulate differences in NEP at six eddy covariance
   (EC) flux tower sites across North America caused by using inputs for
   weather and soil extracted from 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees gridded
   datasets for the grid cells within which the towers were located vs.
   those measured at each tower site during years with contrasting weather
   (cool vs. warm and wet vs. dry). NEP differences attributed to gridded
   vs. measured model inputs varied among sites when tested against
   EC-derived values. At some sites (e.g. coastal coniferous site in
   British Columbia), adverse impacts of summer warming on NEP under
   contrasting weather in 2001 (cooler) vs. 2004 (warmer) were accurately
   modeled with both inputs, giving R-2 with EC NEP values >0.80. At other
   sites, reduced accuracy in NEP modeled with gridded vs. measured inputs
   was attributed to shallower soil depth in the gridded soil database.
   This shallower depth caused site NEP in a boreal deciduous stand in
   Saskatchewan not to be well simulated in 2001 and 2003, the first and
   third years of a major drought in central North America, due to early
   soil drying. At yet other sites, reduced accuracy was attributed to
   overestimates of soil organic nitrogen (SON) calculated from general
   soil organic carbon (SOC):SON relationships used in the absence of SON
   values in the gridded soil database. These overestimates caused
   excessive productivity to be modeled with gridded inputs at a boreal
   black spruce site in Quebec with unusually large SOC:SON. Gridded
   weather and soil inputs that caused such differences in NEP would
   certainly affect regional and global carbon budget model estimates, and
   so need to be improved in future large scale model input datasets. (C)

Abstract = {The high boron (B) content in desalinated seawater is a concern for crop
   development. However, in spite of the importance of the soil microbial
   community in soil fertility, the below-ground impacts of B are still
   unknown. Here, in a soil-ryegrass model system, the activity, biomass
   and diversity of the soil microbial community were evaluated in response
   to irrigation with: i) 0.3 mg B L-1; ii) 1 mg B L-1; and 50 mg B L-1. We
   assessed two different compounds of boron: boric add (H3BO3) and
   disodium tetraborate decahydrate (Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O). Overall,
   the 1 mg B L-1 dose was identified as the threshold limit that did not
   irreversibly harm soil sustainability. In contrast, the highest B dose
   had a noticeable impact on the nitrogen (N) cycle of the soil, as
   demonstrated by an increase in the water-soluble N content and a
   decrease in urease activity. Analysis of the phospholipid fatty adds
   (PLFAs) revealed that the effect of B on the soil microbial biomass was
   dependent on the chemical form used. High B doses reduced soil microbial
   respiration and influenced the composition of the bacterial and fungal
   communities, with fungal diversity being diminished, as revealed by
   sequencing approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Coastal Area of Gunungkidul Regency has beautiful beaches supported
   by small scale fisheries activities that can attract tourists to visit.
   The problem of coastal management are waste overload and sectoral ego.
   The aims of this study are to identify socio-economics characteristics
   of tourists, the factors of push-pull tourists to visit, and estimate
   the economic value of coastal areas. Criteria of push factors tourist
   based on self motivation, while the pull factors based on the perception
   of tourists. Estimation of economic value using travel cost method. The
   research was conducted by survey technique. The main tourist
   destinations to go are to enjoy the beauty of the beach (81\%),
   observation of natural resources (11\%), and school assignment (8\%),
   with self motivation are potential of natural resources (62\%), closed
   distance from home (24) \%), and low cost (14\%). The perception of the
   tourists associated with the beach is quite beautiful (77\%) with clean
   and well maintained condition (72\%), but needs public facilities
   (38\%). Estimated economic value of coastal tourism is IDR 3.1 billion
   per year showed that coastal areas need to be maintained for future
   generations. Collaborative and transparent management of coastal
   resources between community and government is essential to maintain
   coastal tourism sustainability.},

Title = {Water level fluctuations may decrease phosphate adsorption capacity of

Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {651},
Number = {1},
Pages = {253-264},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The effect of sediment desiccation and re-wetting on phosphate
   adsorption and desorption properties was examined in two oligotrophic
   high mountain lakes (La Caldera and Rio Seco, altitude similar to 3000
   m) in the Sierra Nevada National Park, Spain. Decrease in phosphate
   sorption properties was observed in transects from the littoral zone to
   dry land (up to the high water mark) in both lakes concomitantly with
   loss of amorphous oxides of iron and aluminum as revealed by oxalate and
   dithionite extractions. X-ray diffraction did not indicate increased
   amounts of crystalline metal oxides, but there was a loss of fine
   particles (< 20 mu m) with distance from the shore, probably due to wind
   erosion. Likely this explains the loss of amorphous metal oxides as they
   are often enriched in the fine sediment fraction. Changes in
   P-speciation toward less available pools were also observed as a result
   of desiccation. When re-wetted under oxic conditions, the sediments,
   especially those closest to the shore, released phosphate to the
   overlying water. The loss of adsorption capacity for phosphate upon
   re-wetting was associated with loss of amorphous iron oxides, and the
   changes appear to be non-reversible. Thus, both desiccation and
   re-wetting will lead to a decrease in sediment phosphate sorption
   capacity and increased water level fluctuations, a possible scenario in
   climate change, can therefore increase P availability in the water
   column of these oligotrophic systems.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the implementation and subsequent performance of an
   over-the-horizon microwave link operating over seventy kilometres of
   ocean between the Australian mainland and Davies Reef, an offshore site
   within the Australian Great Barrier Reef. The outer sections of the
   Great Barrier Reef are not widely covered by cellular mobile networks
   with the only alternative being satellite telemetry, which becomes
   prohibitively expensive with high volume data such as images and video.
   A microwave radio link operating at a frequency of 10.5 GHz uses the
   ocean evaporation duct to propagate radio signals far beyond the optical
   line-of-sight limitation. While a ducted microwave link had previously
   been established at this site using commercial microwave equipment, the
   power requirements of this system proved to be unsustainable in the
   long-term. Advancements in technology for low-cost, Wireless Internet
   Service Provider equipment have allowed a system to be deployed which is
   both economical and has low power consumption, making it ideally suited
   for remote sites operating on solar power. Due to the lower cost of both
   the telecommunications equipment and the power system required, it now
   becomes feasible to deploy networks of monitoring stations linked by
   microwave systems taking advantage of evaporation duct propagation. The
   success of this link will open opportunities for high bandwidth linkages
   supporting a range of remote observation systems, including video, which
   will improve our understanding of this large complex eco-system.},

Title = {Storm influence on the burial of objects in a shallow sandy shelf
   environment},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},

Volume = {349},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {For rapid assessments of occurrences of sea mines or objects, and
   probability modelling of object burial mechanisms, knowledge is needed
   on sediment processes under a variety of hydro-meteorological
   conditions. One approach is to use test mines that record burial
   mechanisms over longer time periods.
   A Burial Recording Mine (BRM) was deployed in the Belgian part of the
   North Sea, in water depths of 7 to 12 m. The area is predominantly
   sandy, with a continuous spectrum of small to medium and large dunes.
   Three months of data were recorded and allowed monitoring of small-scale
   seabed variation; this was correlated to ruling current and wave
   conditions.
   During the recording period, two short intense storms affected the area.
   The burial behaviour of the cylindrical object revealed that the
   depth-related wave energy decay rate, immediately after the storm, was
   the main factor causing sedimentation. Moreover, sequential storms
   caused a ``cascade effect{''} with the object being vertically relocated
   in a deeper position.
   The results gave insight into the processes and the timing of erosion
   and sedimentation during and post-storm, providing more efficient
   strategies for the detection of missing objects. Results are relevant to
   assess storm impact on any man-made object at sea. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {The stable carbon isotopic compositions of free and sulfur (S)-bound
   biomarkers derived from algae, (cyano)bacteria, archaea and higher
   plants and total organic carbon (TOC) during the first phase of the late
   Cenomanian/Turonian oceanic anoxic event (OAE) were measured in black
   shales deposited in the southern proto-Atlantic Ocean in the Cape Verde
   basin (I)SI)P Site 367) to determine the response of these organisms to
   this major perturbation of the global carbon cycle resulting from
   widespread burial of marine organic matter. The average positive isotope
   excursions of TOC and biomarkers varied from 5.1\% to 8.3\%. The delta
   C-13 values were cross correlated to infer potential common sources of
   biomarkers. This revealed common sources for C-31 and C-32 hopanes but
   no 1:1 relationship for pristane and phytane. The correlation Of delta
   C-13(TOC) with the delta C-13 value of sulfur (S)-bound phytane is the
   strongest. This is because S-bound phytane is derived from phytol that
   originates from all marine primary producers (algae and cyanobacteria)
   and thus represents a weighted average of their carbon isotopic
   compositions. The delta C-13 values of S-bound phytane and C-35 hopane
   were also used to estimate pCO(2) levels. Before the OAE burial event,
   PCO2 levels are estimated to be ca. 1300 ppmv using both biomarkers and
   the independent maximum Rubisco fractionation factors. At times of
   maximum organic carbon burial rates during the OAE, reconstructed pCO(2)
   levels are estimated to be ca. 700 ppmv. However, compared to other C/T
   OAE sections the positive isotope excursion of S-bound phytane is also
   affected by an increased production during the OAE. When we compensate
   for this, we arrive at pCO(2) levels around 1000 ppmv, a reduction of
   ca. 25\%. This indicates that burial of organic matter can have a large
   effect on atmospheric CO2 levels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Asgard archaea are widely distributed in anaerobic environments.
   Previous studies revealed the potential capability of Asgard archaea to
   utilize various organic substrates including proteins, carbohydrates,
   fatty acids, amino acids and hydrocarbons, suggesting that Asgard
   archaea play an important role in sediment carbon cycling. Here, we
   describe a previously unrecognized archaeal phylum, Hermodarchaeota,
   affiliated with the Asgard superphylum. The genomes of these archaea
   were recovered from metagenomes generated from mangrove sediments, and
   were found to encode alkyl/benzyl-succinate synthases and their
   activating enzymes that are similar to those identified in
   alkane-degrading sulfate-reducing bacteria. Hermodarchaeota also encode
   enzymes potentially involved in alkyl-coenzyme A and benzoyl-coenzyme A
   oxidation, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and nitrate reduction. These
   results indicate that members of this phylum have the potential to
   strictly anaerobically degrade alkanes and aromatic compounds, coupling
   the reduction of nitrate. By screening Sequence Read Archive, additional
   genes encoding 16S rRNA and alkyl/benzyl-succinate synthases analogous
   to those in Hermodarchaeota were identified in metagenomic datasets from
   a wide range of marine and freshwater sediments. These findings suggest
   that Asgard archaea capable of degrading alkanes and aromatics via
   formation of alkyl/benzyl-substituted succinates are ubiquitous in
   sediments.},

Title = {Shorebirds Affect Ecosystem Functioning on an Intertidal Mudflat},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Ecosystem functioning and services have provided a rationale for
   conservation over the past decades. Intertidal muddy sediments, and the
   microphytobenthic biofilms that inhabit them, perform crucial ecosystem
   functions including erosion protection, nutrient cycling and carbon
   sequestration. It has been suggested that predation on sediment
   macrofauna by shorebirds may impact biofilms, and shorebirds are known
   to consume biofilm, potentially causing significant top-down effects on
   mudflat ecosystem functioning. We carried out an exclusion experiment on
   the Colne Estuary, Essex, to examine whether shorebird presence
   significantly affects sediment erodibility measured with a Cohesive
   Strength Meter (CSM) and microphytobenthos biomass measured using PAM
   fluorescence (Fo) and chlorophyll a content. We also tested for
   treatment effects on sediment-water nutrient fluxes {[}nitrate, nitrite,
   ammonia, phosphate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] during periods of
   both dark and light incubation. Excluding shorebirds caused
   statistically significant changes in regulating and provisioning
   ecosystem functions, including mudflat erodibility and nutrient fluxes.
   The presence of shorebirds lowered the sediment critical erosion
   threshold tcr, reduced nitrate fluxes into the sediment under
   illumination, lowered nitrate efflux, and reduced phosphate uptake,
   compared to sediments where birds were excluded. There were no
   significant differences in macrofauna community composition within the
   sediment between treatments after 45 days of bird exclusion, suggesting
   a direct link between shorebird presence or absence and the significant
   differences in biofilm-related variables. This study introduces
   previously unknown effects of shorebird presence on ecosystem functions
   within this system and highlights an area of shorebird science that
   could aid joint conservation and human provisioning action.},

Abstract = {The northern Bering Sea shelf is dominated by soft-bottom infauna and
   ecologically significant epifauna that are matched by few other marine
   ecosystems in biomass. The likely basis for this high benthic biomass is
   the intense spring bloom, but few studies have followed the direct
   sedimentation of organic material during the bloom peak in May.
   Satellite imagery, water column chlorophyll concentrations and surface
   sediment chlorophyll inventories were used to document the dynamics of
   sedimentation to the sea floor in both 2006 and 2007, as well as to
   compare to existing data from the spring bloom in 1994. An
   atmospherically-derived radionuclide, Be-7, that is deposited in surface
   sediments as ice cover retreats was used to supplement these
   observations, as were studies of light penetration and nutrient
   depletion in the water column as the bloom progressed. Chlorophyll
   biomass as sea ice melted differed significantly among the three years
   studied (1994, 2006, 2007). The lowest chlorophyll biomass was observed
   in 2006, after strong northerly and easterly winds had distributed
   relatively low nutrient water from near the Alaskan coast westward
   across the shelf prior to ice retreat. By contrast, in 1994 and 2007,
   northerly winds had less northeasterly vectors prior to sea ice retreat,
   which reduced the westward extent of low-nutrient waters across the
   shelf. Additional possible impacts on chlorophyll biomass include the
   timing of sea-ice retreat in 1994 and 2007, which occurred several weeks
   earlier than in 2006 in waters with the highest nutrient content. Late
   winter brine formation and associated water column mixing may also have
   impacts on productivity that have not been previously recognized. These
   observations suggest that interconnected complexities will prevent
   straightforward predictions of the influence of earlier ice retreat in
   the northern Bering Sea upon water column productivity and any resulting
   benthic ecosystem re-structuring as seasonal sea ice retreats in the
   northern Bering Sea. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Carbon Dioxide Emissions along the Lower Amazon River},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {A large fraction of the organic carbon derived from land that is
   transported through inland waters is decomposed along river systems and
   emitted to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). The Amazon River
   outgasses nearly as much CO2 as the rainforest sequesters on an annual
   basis, representing similar to 25\% of global CO2 emissions from inland
   waters. However, current estimates of CO2 outgassing from the Amazon
   basin are based on a conservative upscaling of measurements made in the
   central Amazon, meaning both basin and global scale budgets are likely
   underestimated. The lower Amazon River, from Obidos to the river mouth,
   represents similar to 13\% of the total drainage basin area, and is not
   included in current basin-scale estimates. Here, we assessed the
   concentration and evasion rate of CO2 along the lower Amazon River
   corridor and its major tributaries, the Tapajos and Xingu Rivers.
   Evasive CO2 fluxes were directly measured using floating chambers and
   gas transfer coefficients (k600) were calculated for different
   hydrological seasons. Temporal variations in pCO(2) and CO2 emissions
   were similar to previous observations throughout the Amazon (e.g., peak
   concentrations at high water) and CO2 outgassing was lower in the
   clearwater tributaries compared to the mainstem. However, k(600)-values
   were higher than previously reported upstream likely due to the
   generally windier conditions, turbulence caused by tidal forces, and an
   amplification of these factors in the wider channels with a longer
   fetch. We estimate that the lower Amazon River mainstem emits 0.2 Pg C
   year(-1) within our study boundaries, or as much as 0.48 Pg C year(-1)
   if the entire spatial extent to the geographical mouth is considered.
   Including these values with updated basin scale estimates and estimates
   of CO2 outgassing from small streams we estimate that the Amazon running
   waters outgasses as much as 1.39 Pg C year(-1) increasing the global
   emissions from inland waters by 43\% for a total of 2.9 Pg C year(-1).
   These results highlight a large missing gap in basin-scale carbon
   budgets along the complete continuum of the Amazon River, and likely
   most other large river systems, that could drastically alter global
   scale carbon budgets.},

Abstract = {One of the milestones in the roadmap of accelerator-driven transmutation
   of waste (ATW) of the U.S. Department of Energy is the design and
   construction of an accelerator-driven test facility (ADTF) with a
   thermal power of 100 MW. Analysis of the dynamic behavior of the ADTF
   has been carried out in the frame of a bilateral collaboration between
   the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe and the Argonne National Laboratory
   (ANL). In the present study five different system configurations with
   various types of fuel and different types of coolant have been taken
   into consideration.
   In the systems with sodium as coolant, the transient behavior under the
   unprotected loss-of-flow scenario shows the most serious safety concern.
   As long as the external source is switched on, loss-of-flow will lead to
   an overheating of coolant, cladding and fuel. Boiling of coolant,
   cladding failure and molten fuel injection take place just in several
   seconds after the coast-down of the pump. Safety measures have to be
   designed for switching off the proton beam.
   In the system with liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) as coolant, the
   buoyancy effect is much stronger. Due to its high boiling point, coolant
   boiling and, subsequently, flow oscillation in fuel assemblies can be
   avoided. By a proper design of the heat removal system, the
   buoyancy-driven convection would provide a sufficiently high cooling
   capability of the reactor core, to keep the integrity of the fuel pins.

Year = {2010},
Volume = {56},
Number = {5},
Pages = {231-242},
Abstract = {Along with the rapid economic growth, there has been a booming demand
   for agricultural products in china, but the increased land usage for the
   manufacturing sector has caused a decrease in the total cultivated land.
   Through the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, this study first
   constructs the index of the total-factor cultivated land efficiency
   (TFCLE) by taking the ratio of the actual cultivated land input to
   target the cultivated land input. next, we examine the determinants of
   inefficiency on the cultivated land use. Based on a province-level panel
   data over 1997-2006, the empirical estimates indicate that the TFCLE is
   moderate and fluctuates during the sample period, ranging from 0.601 to
   0.713, suggesting room for efficiency improvement in chinese farmland
   use. The coastal regions are found to experience a significantly higher
   degree of the TFCLE compared with non-coastal regions. overall, there is
   no significant competition effect brought on by the WTO entry on
   promoting TFCLE, though this effect differs between the coastal and
   non-coastal regions. The second-stage regression results show that the
   natural and artificial disasters, flood, drought, and pollution are the
   the main causes of inefficiency. innovative activity and the FDI are
   evidenced to have a significantly positive relation with the TFCLE in
   chinese agriculture. We also find the positive TFCLE-enhancing the
   effects of production diversification and import competition.},

Title = {Massive barite deposits and carbonate mineralization in the Derugin
   Basin, Sea of Okhotsk: precipitation processes at cold seep sites},

Volume = {203},

Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {An area of massive barite precipitations was studied at a tectonic horst
   in 1500 m water depth in the Derugin Basin, Sea of Okhotsk. Seafloor
   observations and dredge samples showed irregular, block- to
   column-shaped barite build-ups up to 10 m high which were scattered over
   the seafloor along an observation track 3.5 km long. High methane
   concentrations in the water column show that methane expulsion and
   probably carbonate precipitation is a recently active process. Small
   fields of chemoautotrophic clams (Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp.) at the
   seafloor provide additional evidence for active fluid venting. The white
   to yellow barites show a very porous and often layered internal fabric,
   and are typically covered by dark-brown Mn-rich sediment; electron
   microprobe spectroscopy measurements of barite sub-samples show a Ba
   substitution of up to 10.5 mol\% of Sr. Rare idiomorphic pyrite crystals
   (similar to1\%) in the barite fabric imply the presence of H2S. This was
   confirmed by clusters of living chemoautotrophic, tube worms (I mm in
   diameter) found in pores and channels within the barite. Microscopic
   examination showed that micritic aragonite and Mg-calcite aggregates or
   crusts are common authigenic precipitations within the barite fabric.
   Equivalent micritic carbonates and barite carbonate cemented worm tubes
   were recovered from sediment cores taken in the vicinity of the barite
   build-up area. Negative delta(13)C values of these carbonates (> -43.5
   parts per thousand PDB) indicate methane as major carbon source;
   delta(18)O values between 4.04 and 5.88 parts per thousand PDB
   correspond to formation temperatures, which are certainly below
   5degreesC. One core also contained shells of Calyptogena sp. at
   different core depths with C-14-ages ranging from 20 680 to > 49 080 yr.
   Pore water analyses revealed that fluids also contain high amounts of
   Ba; they also show decreasing SO42- concentrations and a parallel
   increase of H2S with depth. Additionally, S and 0 isotope data of barite
   sulfate (delta(34)S: 21.0-38.6parts per thousand CDT; delta(18)O:
   9.0-17.6parts per thousand SMOW) strongly point to biological sulfate
   reduction processes. The isotope ranges of both S and 0 can be
   exclusively explained as the result of a mixture of residual sulfate
   after a biological sulfate reduction and isotopic fractionation with
   `normal' seawater sulfate. While massive barite deposits are commonly
   assumed to be of hydrothermal origin, the assemblage of cheomautotrophic
   clams, methane-derived carbonates, and non-thermally equilibrated barite
   sulfate strongly implies that these barites have formed at ambient
   bottom water temperatures and form the features of a Giant Cold Seep
   setting that has been active for at least 49 000 yr. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {The revised FLORIDyn model: implementation of heterogeneous flow and the
   Gaussian wake},
Journal = {WIND ENERGY SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2163-2179},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In this paper, a new version of the FLOw Redirection and Induction
   Dynamics (FLORIDyn) model is presented. The new model uses the
   three-dimensional parametric Gaussian FLORIS model and can provide
   dynamic wind farm simulations at a low computational cost under
   heterogeneous and changing wind conditions.
   Both FLORIS and FLORIDyn are parametric models which can be used to
   simulate wind farms, evaluate controller performance and can serve as a
   control-oriented model. One central element in which they differ is in
   their representation of flow dynamics: FLORIS neglects these and
   provides a computationally very cheap approximation of the mean wind
   farm flow. FLORIDyn defines a framework which utilizes this low
   computational cost of FLORIS to simulate basic wake dynamics. This is
   achieved by creating so-called observation points (OPs) at each time
   step at the rotor plane which inherit the turbine state.
   In this work, we develop the initial FLORIDyn framework further
   considering multiple aspects. The underlying FLORIS wake model is
   replaced by a Gaussian wake model. The distribution and characteristics
   of the OPs are adapted to account for the new parametric model but also
   to take complex flow conditions into account. To achieve this, a
   mathematical approach is developed to combine the parametric model and
   the changing, heterogeneous world conditions and link them with each OP.
   We also present a computationally lightweight wind field model to allow
   for a simulation environment in which heterogeneous flow conditions are
   possible.
   FLORIDyn is compared to Simulator for Offshore Wind Farm Applications
   (SOWFA) simulations in three- and nine-turbine cases under static and
   changing environmental conditions. The results show a good agreement
   with the timing of the impact of upstream state changes on downstream
   turbines. They also show a good agreement in terms of how wakes are
   displaced by wind direction changes and when the resulting velocity
   deficit is experienced by downstream turbines. A good fit of the mean
   generated power is ensured by the underlying FLORIS model. In the
   three-turbine case, FLORIDyn simulates 4 s simulation time in 24.49 ms
   computational time. The resulting new FLORIDyn model proves to be a

Abstract = {Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) on a structured grid over the
   Louisiana shelf in the northern Gulf of Mexico is used to evaluate the
   performance of three different classes of formulations for quantifying
   wind input and whitecapping dissipation. The formulations include Komen
   based on the mean spectral parameters, Westhuysen based on the
   saturation concept of the wave groups, and the most recent
   observation-based physics package ST6. The evaluation was implemented
   for two summer months (July and August 2015) to assess these
   formulations for a low wave energy period. The modeling area consists of
   the Louisiana inner shelf with the offshore open boundary located beyond
   the continental shelf. The model was forced using the spatially variable
   Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) wind field and wave parameters
   obtained from the NOAA's WAVEWATCH-III (WWIII) model along the open
   boundaries. Simulated wave parameters and spectra regarding each
   formulation were evaluated and compared with measured wave data at NDBC
   stations; comparisons showed that the most appropriate formulation for
   the simulation of low energy waves for the study area to be ST6. The e
   performance of each whitecapping formulation was described by examining
   1D/2D spectra and the source term balance at different met-ocean
   conditions during the simulation period. It was also shown that the
   inaccuracies in the input wind field and boundary conditions can
   substantially contribute to the model inaccuracy.},

Abstract = {Biocatalysts are the backbone of bioprocessing industries that are going
   through a phase of transition with reference to the requirement of
   extraordinary enzymes for various biochemical processes. This transition
   is well reported and documented by various researchers through
   elucidation of different features and applications of mesophilic and
   thermophilic enzymes. However, there is little information available
   about psychrophilic enzymes and their involvement in industrial
   processes. Therefore, understanding the features and functions of
   psychrophilic enzymes could suggest some of their novel applications in
   various industries such as food, agriculture, chemicals,
   pharmaceuticals, and waste management etc. Currently, different
   industries are looking for such novel psychrophilic enzymes to develop
   efficient biochemical processes that will help to reduce the reaction
   time, lower the energy inputs and as well as be eco-friendly. These
   bioprocesses will help to increase the profit margin by reducing the
   overall cost of the final products. This review article will provide new
   insights in technical and scientific analysis of psychrophilic microbes,
   their enzymes and low energy biochemical processes that are useful in
   various industries for the production of valuable products. It will also
   further strengthen the understanding of academia and industry about
   these ubiquitous biocatalysts.},

Abstract = {Wind has been one of the fastest growing renewable energy technologies
   with large utility scale installations both onshore and offshore.
   Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are considered for co-location
   with large wind farms to make them dispatchable. As many of the best
   quality wind resources are remote, compensating AC lines is a
   cost-effective solution for long distance power transmission. However,
   Type-3 (doubly fed induction generator) wind turbines are known to
   interact with fixed series compensation in the form of Subsynchronous
   Control Interactions (SSCI) exposing the converters to dangerously high
   voltages and currents often leading to plant disconnection. With the
   ever-increasing sizes of wind farms, this disconnection can materially
   impact system security. This paper demonstrates how an existing BESS
   installation at a wind farm can be exploited to provide SSCI damping.
   Studies are performed in MATLAB/Simulink with average models for the
   converters (using vector control) and a GE wind turbine model.},

Abstract = {Ever-increasing freshwater scarcity and energy crisis problems require
   efficient seawater desalination and energy storage technologies;
   however, each target is generally considered separately. Herein, a
   hybrid sodium-ion supercapacitor, involving a carbon-coated
   nano-NaTi2(PO4)(3)-based battery anode and an activated-carbon-based
   capacitive cathode, is developed to combine desalination and energy
   storage in one device. On charge, the supercapacitor removes salt in a
   flowing saltwater electrolyte through Cl- electrochemical adsorption at
   the cathode and Na+ intercalation at the anode. Discharge delivers
   useful electric energy and regenerates the electrodes. This
   supercapacitor can be used not only for energy storage with promising
   electrochemical performance (i.e., high power, high efficiency, and long
   cycle life), but also as a desalination device with desalination
   capacity of 146.8 mg g(-1), much higher than most reported capacitive
   and battery desalination devices. Finally, we demonstrate renewables to
   usable electric energy and desalted water through combining commercial
   photovoltaics and this hybrid supercapacitor.},

Abstract = {Geothermal resources have become an increasingly important source of
   renewable energy for electrical power generation worldwide. Combined
   Three Dimension (3D) Subsurface Temperature (SST) and Land Surface
   Temperature (LST) measurements are essential for accurate assessment of
   geothermal resources. In this study, subsurface and surface temperature
   distributions were combined using a dataset comprised of well logs and
   Thermal Infrared Remote sensing (TIR) images from Hokkaido island,
   northern Japan. Using 28,476 temperature data points from 433 boreholes
   sites and a method of Kriging with External Drift or trend (KED), SST
   distribution model from depths of 100 to 1500 m was produced. Regional
   LST was estimated from 13 scenes of Landsat 8 images. Resultant SST
   ranged from around 50 degrees C to 300 degrees C at a depth of 1500 m.
   Most of western and part of the eastern Hokkaido are characterized by
   high temperature gradients, while low temperatures were found in the
   central region. Higher temperatures in shallower crust imply the western
   region and part of the eastern region have high geothermal potential.
   Moreover, several LST zones considered to have high geothermal potential
   were identified upon clarification of the underground heat distribution
   according to 3D SST. LST in these zones showed the anomalies, 3 to 9
   degrees C higher than the surrounding areas. These results demonstrate
   that our combination of TIR and 3D temperature modeling using well
   logging and geostatistics is an efficient and promising approach to
   geothermal resource exploration.},

Abstract = {A simple device to simulate circulating cooling water was used to study
   the dynamic reactions of two scale types. Water velocity, which ranged
   from 0.401 to 1.338 m/s, was adopted to study the effects on crystal
   size and interplanar spacing of adherent and non-adherent scale. The
   adherent scale was deposited on copper pipe surface. By using X-ray
   diffraction, the results suggest that the crystal size of calcite and
   aragonite in adherent scale increased by ca. 200-300 angstrom and
   100-200 angstrom, respectively, when compared with that of corresponding
   non-adherent scale. As water velocity increased, the crystal size of
   adherent scale increased, while the crystal size of non-adherent scale
   remained essentially unchanged. Analysis of the change of crystal size
   and mass fraction showed that stronger hydraulic force was needed to
   remove calcite, as compared with the removal of aragonite. The data also
   confirmed that the interplanar spacing of adherent scale was smaller
   than that of non-adherent scale, as a result of saturation and
   temperature.},

   interval from where the operation has to stop at high winds to where a
   lower wind speed allows the operation to resume. For inland wind
   turbines the fractional loss is less than 0.25\%. For offshore wind
   turbines it may be as high as about 1.5\%. To facilitate the estimation
   of `dead zone' power loss for offshore wind turbines, an engineering
   model for the sea surface state has been developed on the basis of a
   generalization of Charnock's roughness model and the geostrophic drag
   low. This model predicts the surface friction velocity and the surface
   roughness as functions of the geostrophic wind speed and the length of
   the water fetch. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {A real-time inspection and opportunistic maintenance strategies for
   floating offshore wind turbines},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {256},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an FMEA-BN model to determine the inspection and
   opportunistic maintenance strategies of floating offshore wind turbines.
   A mapping algorithm is proposed to establish a mirrored Bayesian Network
   (BN) model from a given failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)
   structure to realize the FMEA-BN modelling, which is efficient to
   consider common cause failures. The failure probabilities of items of
   floating offshore wind turbines are first updated by the BN sub-model,
   in which, various operation scenarios are considered. The updated
   failure probabilities are then imported to the FMEA sub-model to
   determine the items of the floating offshore wind turbines that are to
   be inspected and to which the opportunistic maintenance action would be
   applied. With the FMEA-BN model, inspection and opportunistic
   maintenance strategies for a floating offshore wind turbine are
   suggested under several commonly occurring operation scenarios. The
   validation of the results is illustrated by the failure rate of the
   floating offshore wind turbine predicted by the BN sub-model, the
   uncertainty of which is lower than 3\%. Overall, the presented FMEA-BN
   model supports real-time inspection and opportunistic main-tenance
   strategies determination of complicated systems like floating offshore
   wind turbines.},

Abstract = {Understanding the cryptic lives of wide-ranging wild animals such as
   seals can be challenging, but with the advent of miniaturised telemetry
   and data-logging devices this is now possible and relatively
   straightforward. However, because marine animals have streamline bodies
   to reduce drag in their aquatic habitats, attaching external devices to
   their back or head may affect swimming performance, prey capture
   efficiency and ultimately, fitness. Given this, and allied welfare
   concerns, we assessed the short- and long-term consequences of external
   devices attached to southern elephant seal juveniles and adults under
   varying environmental conditions. We also assessed the effects of
   multiple deployments on individuals. There was no evidence for
   short-term differences in at-sea mass gain (measured as mass on arrival
   from a foraging trip) or long-term survival rate. The number of times
   that a seal carried a tracking device (ranging from I to 8 times) did
   not affect mass or estimated survival. Further, there were no tracking
   device effects in years of contrasting environmental conditions measured
   as ENSO anomalies. Consequently, we conclude that the current tracking
   devices available to researchers are valuable conservation tools that do
   not adversely affect the performance of a large marine mammal in terms
   of mass gain or survival probability over short (seasonal) or long
   (years) temporal scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Origin of phosphatic stromatolites in the Upper Cretaceous condensed
   sequence of the Polish Jura Chain},
Journal = {SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {136},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {89-112},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Turonian stromatolite-bearing condensed sequence in the Polish Jura
   Chain (the European epicontinental basin) provides good insight into the
   environment of formation of Cretaceous phosphatic stromatolites, owing
   to their purely phosphatic development and negligible post-depositional
   alteration. The sequence developed as a result of slow pelagic
   sedimentation and microbial mat phosphatization on a submarine swell
   surrounded by local basins with non-condensed carbonate deposition.
   Diagenesis of organic matter and dissolution of biogenic apatite were
   the major sources of reactive phosphorus for the microbial mat
   phosphatization. Stromatolite growth occurred due to pulses of amorphous
   or poorly ordered calcium phosphate precipitation followed by
   crystallization of carbonate fluorapatite (CFA). The phosphogenic
   environment left an imprint on the isotopic composition of limestone
   carbon and lattice-bound carbon and sulphur in CFA, and on the light
   rare-earth element (LREE) distribution in CFA. The delta(13)C of the
   stromatolite-bearing sequence shows a negative excursion (-1 to -3 parts
   per thousand), standing in marked contrast to positive carbon values of
   the surrounding basinal carbonate. Most of the delta(34)S values of CFA
   (+20 to +21 parts per thousand) fit the value range of the coeval
   seawater sulphate, and the LREE distribution shows a well-defined
   seawater pattern. This geochemical signature is indicative of intense
   diagenesis of organic matter at the seafloor, pelagic carbonate
   dissolution, and prolonged exposure of the deposited phosphate towards
   the water column. The enhanced deposition and diagenesis of organic
   phosphorus in the stromatolitic environment reflects elevated levels of
   the epicontinental basin nutrification related to sea-level rises and
   the associated oceanographic and geochemical changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Title = {Location selection of seawater pumped hydro storage station in China

Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},

Abstract = {With the urgent need for energy conservation and intrinsic intermittence
   optimization, seawater pumped hydro energy storage (SPHS) is developing
   rapidly in the foreign countries but no one has been built in China.
   Nevertheless, with vast resources, our country pays much attention on
   SPHS site selection lately since its superiority and the need for
   long-term energy development. To select the most ideal SPHS site from
   numerous candidate alternatives, 18 evaluation criteria are set in this
   paper. Due to vague relevance among criteria, lambda-fuzzy measure
   combining Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and entropy weight method are
   proposed to determine criteria weights. Later, fuzzy Vlsekriterijumska
   Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method is applied to sort an
   optimal solution for the SPHS construction. Simultaneously, the
   published data from National Energy Administration (NEA) combining
   experts' scoring and public opinions are calculated as a case and the Fu
   Ying Island in Ning De is proved to be the best. In order to ensure the
   validity and stability of the result, comparative and sensitive analysis
   are proposed. Overall, the proposed model can provide a reference to the
   government and electricity grid for further evaluation since SPHS site
   selection has not been deeply studied in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Along the hyper-arid Chilean coastal desert between 30 S and 18 S the
   Loma vegetation undergoes a gradual transition from open shrubland to
   small isolated areas of a scarce plant cover. Floristic and physiognomic
   features allow a differentiation of five Loma formations, each of them
   characterized by a distinctive spectrum of plant communities. However,
   particularly in the northern section of the investigation area, numerous
   indications point to a strong vegetation decline including a
   deterioration of plant cover, reduction of the vitality of various taxa,
   probably also a local loss of some perennial species, and even a dieback
   of specific populations. These signs of a retrogression, which coincide
   with a regional disappearance of Guanaco herds in the coastal area
   between 20 degrees S and 23 degrees 30'S, became apparent in the second
   half of the past century and were most likely provoked by recent climate
   change in the arid coastal region. Especially the decrease of rainfall
   frequency might have negative implications for the regeneration and
   preservation of plants. In addition, a strong reduction of cloudiness in
   the northernmost section affects plant growth due to further limitations
   in the water disposability. A projected sustained decline of rainfall is
   expected to continue endangering the surprisingly high floristic
   diversity of the sensitive ecosystem complexes in the coastal desert.},

Title = {Interfacial solar evaporator for clean water production and beyond: From
   design to application},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {299},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, interfacial solar evaporation technology has shown
   great prospects in many applications such as seawater desalination,
   wastewater treatment, sterilization, and other fields. The efficiency of
   interfacial solar evaporators (ISEs) has approached 100\%, benefitting
   from photothermal material development and advanced structural design.
   Herein, we have summarized the strategies to enhance the evaporation
   performance of ISEs from photothermal materials to evaporation systems.
   In addition, the available strategies for long-term stable desalination
   are reviewed. Finally, the potential applications, difficulties,
   challenges, and opportunities for the future are discussed. We hope that
   this review can provide some insights into the design of high-efficiency
   ISEs, development of novel ISEs for stable desalination, acceleration of
   the practical applications of ISEs, and exploration of other potential
   applications of ISEs simultaneously.},

Abstract = {Highly efficient thermal transport between graphene and water is crucial
   in applications such as microscopic heat dissipation, solar steam
   generation, sea-water desalination, and thermally conductive composites.
   However, a practical approach for enhancing thermal transport across
   graphene-water interfaces is lacking. We propose an effective and
   universal method to improve thermal-transport properties at the
   interface between multilayer graphene and water by a factor of similar
   to 4 by grafting functionalized groups onto graphene. The most improved
   interfacial thermal conductance was 121.0 +/- 11.4 MW m(-2) K-1. This
   design is compatible with industrial processes. We also undertook
   molecular-level analyses to unveil the underlying mechanism for
   heat-transport enhancement. This study could provide new approaches for
   engineering heat transport across two-dimensional materials and water
   interfaces.},

Journal = {PHYSICS-USPEKHI},

Volume = {63},

Pages = {365-387},
Abstract = {We discuss the experimental conditions responsible for a drastic
   decrease in the power threshold of parametric decay instabilities under
   auxiliary electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) in toroidal
   magnetic fusion devices when the upper hybrid (UH) resonance for the
   pump wave is absent. We show that for a finite-width pump in the
   presence of a nonmonotonic (hollow) density profile occurring due to
   plasma equilibrium in the magnetic islands or anomalous particle fluxes
   from the ECR layer, 3D localization of one or both daughter waves is
   possible. This localization leads to the full suppression of daughter
   wave energy losses from the decay layer and a substantial increase in
   the nonlinear pumping efficiency. This decreases the power threshold of
   nonlinear excitation, which can be easily overcome in current ECRH
   experiments utilizing 1 MW microwave beams. Different scenarios of
   extraordinary and ordinary wave decays are investigated. The secondary
   decays of primary daughter waves and pump wave depletion are considered
   as the most effective mechanisms leading to the transition of primary
   instability to the saturation regime. The proposed theoretical model was
   shown to be able to describe the anomalous phenomena discovered in ECRH
   experiments in different toroidal fusion devices all over the world.},

Title = {Regional sustainability assessment framework for integrated coastal zone

Abstract = {This study proposes a novel regional sustainability assessment framework
   for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). Various ICZM indicators
   have been developed, but their management insights are not always clear.
   Our framework integrates three separately developed approaches with an
   explicit reflection of stakeholders' values: Satoumi (a Japanese concept
   of socio-ecological production landscapes, SEPLs), ecosystem services
   approach (ESA), and inclusive wealth (IW). We suggest that the
   integration of Satoumi, a uniquely Japanese concept, with the ESA and IW
   complements each other and increases the effectiveness of all three
   approaches when applied to ICZM and decision making. Satoumi describes
   the desired state of a coastal zone. The ESA translates Satoumi into IW
   and helps explain which changes to ecosystems contribute to the asset
   quality (i.e., shadow prices). As a sustainability indicator, IW differs
   from other ecological indicators because it comprises human, natural,
   and manufactured capital assets and incorporates shadow prices to weigh
   the contribution of each asset to the present value of social welfare.
   Shadow prices may capture the quality of capital assets in terms of how
   much people value them, and can therefore be a direct management target
   for realizing a desired coastal zone. We propose adding two
   sustainability criteria, desired state and strong sustainability, to the
   original IW to make it operational. The framework was tested in Japan's
   Seto Inland Sea, and the results were analyzed in depth. Based on the
   outcomes, we discuss the insights for ICZM and future research. While
   Satoumi is a Japanese concept, the framework could be applied to other
   countries where similar SEPLs exist. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {China in global wind power development: Role, status and impact},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {127},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {China is the largest power producer and consumer and has the largest
   installed capacity of wind turbines (WTs) worldwide. In the last two
   decades, China's installed capacity of WTs has exploded, significantly
   impacting its wind power (WP) industry and promoting the development of
   the industry globally. This paper examines China as one part of the
   world and elucidates its role, status, and impact on global WP
   development from a global perspective. Research indicates that China has
   become the global leader in WP, its WP development has greatly promoted
   the growth rate of global WP, and it has become an indispensable force
   in global WP development. However, the comprehensive capability of
   China's WP generation is not only lower than that of other major WP
   countries but also lower than the global average. China's WTs have low
   global recognition and are difficult to export. In addition, the
   proportion of WP in China's power structure is lower than that of most
   other major WP countries. Fortunately, these gaps between China and
   other major WP countries are gradually narrowing. The goal of this paper
   is to help researchers and investors better understand China's situation
   and to provide a reference for the rational investment in and
   development of China's WP.},

Abstract = {Aquatic photosynthetic organisms are exposed to solar ultraviolet (UV)
   radiation while they harvest longer wavelength radiation for energetic
   reasons. Solar UV-B radiation (280 - 315 mn) affects motility and
   orientation in motile organisms and impairs photosynthesis in
   cyanobacteria, phytoplankton and macroalgae as measured by monitoring
   oxygen production or pulse amplitude modulated fluorescence analysis.
   Upon moderate UV stress most organisms respond by photoinhibition which
   is an active downregulation of the photosynthetic electron transport in
   photosystem II by degradation of UV-damaged D1 protein. Photoinhibition
   is readily reversible during recovery in shaded conditions. Excessive UV
   stress causes photodamage which is not easily reversible. Another major
   target is the DNA where UV-B mainly induces thymine dimers.
   Cyanobacteria, phytoplankton and macroalgae produce scytonemin,
   mycosporine-like amino acids and other UV-absorbing substances to
   protect themselves from short wavelength solar radiation. (C) 2002

Title = {Mixed CFD-1D wind turbine diffuser design optimization},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {386-399},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A method to design a diffuser augmented wind turbine (DAWT) is proposed,
   using as a guiding point the optimal pressure drop at the turbine. The
   use of concepts and expressions derived from a 1D analytic model helped
   to reduce the number of computational fluid dynamics simulations needed
   to find the optimal configuration. The proposed configuration can
   extract energy from the flow with the same efficiency as the
   state-of-the-art shrouded wind turbine (SWT) configurations but
   generating a significantly smaller wake, which makes this configuration
   a good candidate for wind farms or tidal applications. Furthermore, as a
   product of the 1D model, universal curves for the power coefficient have
   been obtained, as a function of the thrust coefficient, or disk loading,
   which have been compared with numerical and experimental results,
   showing a good agreement. Finally, the maximum ideal power coefficient
   has been found for a given configuration, which helps to estimate the
   margin for improvement of an actual design. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Global patterns and impacts of El Nino events on coral reefs: A
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Impacts of global climate change on coral reefs are being amplified by
   pulse heat stress events, including El Nino, the warm phase of the El
   Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Despite reports of extensive coral
   bleaching and up to 97\% coral mortality induced by El Nino events, a
   quantitative synthesis of the nature, intensity, and drivers of El Nino
   and La Nina impacts on corals is lacking. Herein, we first present a
   global meta-analysis of studies quantifying the effects of El Nino/La
   Nina-warming on corals, surveying studies from both the primary
   literature and International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) Proceedings.
   Overall, the strongest signal for El Nino/La Nina-associated coral
   bleaching was long-term mean temperature; bleaching decreased with
   decreasing long-term mean temperature (n = 20 studies). Additionally,
   coral cover losses during El Nino/La Nina were shaped by localized
   maximum heat stress and long-term mean temperature (n = 28 studies).
   Second, we present a method for quantifying coral heat stress which, for
   any coral reef location in the world, allows extraction of
   remotely-sensed degree heating weeks (DHW) for any date (since 1982),
   quantification of the maximum DHW, and the time lag since the maximum
   DHW. Using this method, we show that the 2015/16 El Nino event
   instigated unprecedented global coral heat stress across the world's
   oceans. With El Nino events expected to increase in frequency and
   severity this century, it is imperative that we gain a clear
   understanding of how these thermal stress anomalies impact different
   coral species and coral reef regions. We therefore finish with
   recommendations for future coral bleaching studies that will foster
   improved syntheses, as well as predictive and adaptive capacity to
   extreme warming events.},

Title = {Cross-scale environmental influences on migratory stopover behaviour},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {744-759},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Migratory species may be especially sensitive to climate change because
   their lifecycles are affected by dynamic ecological processes operating
   at global spatial scales. Insight into environmental effects upon en
   route decisions by migrants can therefore be a critical first step
   toward assessing their vulnerability to future climatic shifts. We
   extracted behaviour-related parameters from a recent formulation of
   multistate mark-recapture models, and used them to evaluate the
   importance of variation in local weather and broad-scale climate to
   decisions made by autumn passerine migrants at a coastal stopover site
   in Atlantic Canada. We found dramatic interannual fluctuations in the
   proportion of migrants that were transient (departing within a day of
   arrival), with annual average values ranging from 24\% to 96\% over the
   years 1996-2007. However, the relationships of stopover behaviour
   (transience and departure probability) to local weather (wind and
   precipitation) and to regional climatic fluctuations were similar across
   three distinct species groups and for birds of different fuel-loads,
   indicating the potential for both immediate (day-to-day) and long-term
   environmental influences (spanning several seasons). This cross-scale
   approach contributes valuable information toward the conservation of
   migrants in the face of a changing climate by (i) quantifying
   environmental influences on stopover behaviour in broad temporal and
   geographic contexts, and (ii) demonstrating largely parallel interannual
   variation in stopover site-use among birds with contrasting migratory
   timing and strategies.},

Title = {Six sigma with the blue economy fundamentals to assess the economic and

Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The fundamentals of the blue economy promoting sustainable development
   by minimizing the consumption of fresh water, organic pollution and
   chemical contamination. On the other hand, the six sigma tool enables
   companies to improve the performance of their processes by reducing
   waste and statistical techniques. Not many works have been identified
   that related these two approaches, therefore, the objective of this work
   is to apply the six sigma tool with the blue economy fundamentals to
   assess the economic and environmental performance in the aircraft
   refueling process. The methods used were Return of Investment (ROI) and
   Mass Intensity Factor (MIF). A multiple case study was carried out
   involving two largest Brazilian airlines and the fuel distributor. The
   main results show the reduction of flight delays and, consequently, a
   decrease in the diesel consumption by trucks and energy generators, and
   water. The calculated economic gains were 52.9 million dollars annually
   and the environmental gains were the non-generation of 150 thousand tons
   annually. This work contributed to the theory for being the first to
   link SS in Aviation with measuring environmental benefits, even more so
   through the Blue Economy and to the practice for presenting to managers
   the possibility of obtaining economic and environmental benefits in the
   aircraft refueling process with no investment.},

Abstract = {Graphene containing Co and Mn co-doped NiOnanocrystallinematerials (with
   composition graphene - Ni0.95Co0.025Mn0.025O1-delta) were synthesized by
   chemical synthesis route and studied for potential application as
   electrode material for supercapacitors. The phase structure of the
   materials was characterized by XRD technique and the crystallographic
   parameters were found out and reported. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed the
   presence of M-O bond in the materials. The morphological phenomenon of
   the materials was studied by SEA/I and the particles were found to be
   spherical with an average grain size of 14 - 28 nm. EDAX analysis
   confirmed the presence of appropriate levels of elements in the samples.
   The in-depth morphological characteristics were also studied by HR-TEM
   (High-Resolution Tunneling Electron Microscopy). Cyclic Voltammetry (CT,
   charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance measurements were
   carried out in an aqueous electrolyte (6 mol/L KOH) to investigate the
   electrochemical performance of the graphene containing Co and Mn
   co-doped NiOnanocrystallinebased electrode materials and the material
   found to exhibit a specific capacitance of 1243 F/g at a current density
   of 0.5 A/g and hence these electrode materials can be used in
   electrochemical supercapacitors.},

Title = {Beyond urban-rural dichotomy: Exploring socioeconomic and land-use
   processes of change in Spain (1991-2011)},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {71-81},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the last decades, the process of land-use intensification linked to
   human activity has changed considerably causing important modifications
   in the traditional dichotomized urban-rural relationships. Given their
   more complex dynamics, alternative methodologies for analysing the
   spatial consequences of changes are required. The present study
   investigates the variables shaping the urban-rural relationship in Spain
   over the last 20 years using a synthesizing methodology based on
   statistical and cartographic techniques that take into account a large
   number of variables and cases. The study was carried out at the level of
   local municipalities (nearly 8000 spatial units), fitting 36
   socioeconomic and geographical indicators into a multivariate
   statistical framework. Indicators were selected to describe processes of
   intensification, extensification, or abandonment implying both land-use
   changes and important transformations in the local socioeconomic
   structure. Multivariate analysis identified seven processes contributing
   to the change in the urban-rural relationship in Spain: urban
   intensification and sprawl, coastalization, naturbanization, expansion
   of irrigated crop systems, livestock and pasture expansion,
   afforestation and reforestation, and depopulation. An in-depth
   understanding of recent spatial dynamics in Mediterranean countries may
   inform sustainable land management with the final aim to mitigate or
   re-balance the impact of these processes in land degradation or in an
   excessive human pressure along the coastal rim between other undesirable
   consequences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Slow recovery of previously depleted demersal fish at the South Shetland
   Islands, 1983-2010},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {206-213},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Following seals and baleen whales prior to the 1970s. demersal fish
   stocks were depleted off the South Shetland Islands by intensive
   industrial fishing during the late 1970s to early 1980s. Little has been
   reported since about how these stocks have fared, after international
   agreement closed this fishery in 1990. We report changes in size and
   abundance of the commercially exploited Notothenia rossii and
   Gobionotothen gibberifrons relative to the ecologically similar but
   unexploited Notothenia coriiceps at Potter Cove, South Shetland Islands,
   over a 28-yr period, 1983-2010. N. rossii abundance declined from 1983
   to 1991, and an increase in mean size during 1983-1984 is consistent
   with weak cohorts during preceding years. Modal age changed from 2-3 to
   6-7 yr. Length data of G. gibberifrons, available from 1986, exhibited a
   similar pattern, showing a decrease until 1991-1992. After a period of
   relative stability (1992-1994), a sharp increase in length and a
   continued decline in relative abundance indicated low recruitment. The
   length-frequency distribution of unexploited N. coriiceps throughout the
   whole period showed no change in modal size or mean length of the fish.
   We relate these patterns to the fishery and suggest that a further two
   decades will lapse before these stocks recover. Using the South Shetland

Abstract = {The shelf sediments off the Nile delta are of heterogeneous origin and
   include sediments of marine, fluviomarine and fluvial origin. The
   heterogeneity of these sediments is reflected in their mineralogical and
   hence geochemical composition. The mineral association of the Nile
   sediments consists of quartz, feldspars, epidote, monoclinic pyroxenes,
   opaques, mica and hornblende, with minor occurrences of zircon, apatite,
   rutile, sphene and garnets. The clay minerals are predominantly
   represented by the smectite group. The partition of manganese, zinc,
   nickel, copper and cadmium were studied in an operationally defined
   selective extraction scheme to develop predictive geochemical models.
   The models were developed to predict the mode of occurrence and
   behaviour of these elements in the marine environment. The models showed
   that under the prevailing oxidising conditions carbonates, hydroxides,
   oxides and silicate solids control the partition and behaviour of
   metals. Although the terrestrial flux (biotite, chlorite and hornblende)
   contributes significant amounts of manganese, the metal principally
   exists as the amorphous oxide by precipitation from seawater. Zinc,
   nickel and copper are influenced by absorption and complexation of the
   dissolved forms by organic matter and organic detritus transported from
   land-based sources. Cadmium is only enriched in the carbonate fraction
   of the sediment principally as cadmium carbonate by solid solution
   reaction with calcite. Its origin is mainly anthropogenic. The
   deficiency of cadmium in the adsorbed form is the result of its great
   affinity to desorb from the sediment.},

Title = {A dynamic energy budget model to describe the reproduction and growth of

Abstract = {The introduction of alien species is a global phenomenon that alters
   ecosystems structure and functioning. Invasive species are responsible
   for substantial economic and ecological losses. Invasive species impact
   resource availability, outcompeting and even causing extinction of
   native species. The management of invasive species requires knowledge on
   the ecology, physiology and population dynamics of these species. In a
   world where environmental conditions are changing fast due to global
   climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, a more comprehensive
   knowledge of the life history and physiology of these species is
   urgently needed. The DEB theory is unique in capturing the metabolic
   processes of an organism through its entire life cycle, and thus, is a
   useful tool to model lifetime feeding, growth, reproduction, and
   responses to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. In this work, we
   estimated the parameters of a DEB model for Asterias amurensis. This
   starfish was introduced in Tasmania and is considered the most serious
   marine pest in Australia where it has caused local extinctions of
   several species. Asterias amurensis is a major predator and is a
   keystone species exerting top-down control of its prey populations by
   achieving large densities. We determined the influence of biotic and
   abiotic factors on the performance of A. amurensis. The DEB model
   presented here includes energy handling rules to describe gonad and
   pyloric caeca cycles. Model parameters were used to explore population
   dynamics of populations of A. amurensis in Australia. The DEB model
   allowed us to characterise the ecophysiology of A. amurensis, providing
   new insights on the role of food availability and temperature on its
   life cycle and reproduction strategy. Moreover it is a powerful tool for
   risk management of already established invasive populations and of
   regions with a high invasion risk.},

Abstract = {Extracting uranium from high salinity seawater at ultralow
   concentrations would beneficially contribute to the sustainable
   utilization of nuclear energy, but it poses a significant challenge.
   Here we report a sunlight-driven photocatalysis-assisted extraction
   (SUPER) method by utilizing a bifunctional carbon nitride material,
   CN550, which has shown about a tenfold improvement in both adsorption
   capacity and photocatalytic activity compared to g-C3N4. Uranyl ions
   could be captured on the surface of CN550, and then deposited as
   metastudtite nano-particles with light illumination. Compared with the
   pure physicochemical adsorption (PA) method, a tenfold higher uranium
   extraction capacity, up to 1556 mg g(-1), has been attained.
   Additionally, a 25 times improvement of the partition coefficient (PC),
   from 0.312 to 7.778 L g(-1), has also been achieved. In spiked real
   seawater, the extraction capacity can still achieve more than 1000 mg
   g(-1), and the SUPER method has been found to work under natural

Abstract = {In recent, microgrids have been considered as an economic and efficient
   way to integrate distributed renewable resources on the community level.
   However, the current and power sharing between each distributed
   generations, especially under heavy power demands and casualty
   conditions, is still an important issue. This paper presents a model
   predictive control approach for parallel-connected inverter-based
   distributed generators in micro-grid system under islanded operation
   mode. The dynamic system model is developed and used to predict future
   system behaviors based on the candidate control input sequences and the
   current states. The desired cost function is build and by minimizing the
   cost function designed controller chooses the optimal control solution
   and applied as the current control input. The proposed control scheme
   provides automatic and fast regulation to ensure the resultant output
   voltage tracks the reference waveform and minimize the circulating
   current between parallel-connected inverters. Several simulation
   scenarios are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed
   controller using PLECS software.},

Abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) power conditioning system (PCS) has been increased
   around the world since PV is becoming widespread as a clean and gentle
   energy source for earth. As a result, high-density grid-connected PV PCS

   islanding phenomenon becomes most important issues for the safety and
   stability. Many methods to prevent islanding phenomenon have been
   proposed and analyzed. Especially, active frequency drift positive
   feedback (AFDPF) method is to process output current waveform of PV PCS

Abstract = {Microalgae are being considered as a promising raw material for biofuel
   production. However, rapid, efficient, and economic technologies for
   harvesting microalgae are essential for successful applications. In this
   study, the high-pH-induced flocculation method was applied to harvest
   marine Chlorella sp. strains. These algae could be concentrated up to
   approximately 20-fold by increasing pH using NaOH, with a flocculation
   efficiency of 90 \%. When NaOH dosage was low (1 or 3 mM), the
   flocculation efficiency decreased considerably with the increase of
   biomass concentration. At higher NaOH dosage tested (5 or 7 mM),
   flocculation occurred quickly and efficiently, which tended to be
   independent of biomass concentration. In larger volumes, all strains
   were flocculated with similar efficiencies (approximately 90 \%) after
   adding 5 mM NaOH. After flocculation, the flocculated algae cells could
   be re-cultured as inoculum, and the growth yields in flocculated medium
   were slightly higher than those from fresh medium. Additionally, for
   each strain, there were no significant differences in lipid extraction
   yield and fatty acid composition according to different harvesting
   methods. These results showed that the high-pH-induced flocculation
   method could be used to harvest marine Chlorella sp. for biofuel
   production successfully.},

Abstract = {The ocean's thermal inertia is a major contributor to irreversible ocean
   changes exceeding time scales that matter to human society. This fact is
   a challenge to societies as they prepare for the consequences of climate
   change, especially with respect to the ocean. Here the authors review
   the requirements for human actions from the ocean's perspective. In the
   near term (similar to 2030), goals such as the United Nations
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be critical. Over longer times
   (similar to 2050-2060 and beyond), global carbon neutrality targets may
   be met as countries continue to work toward reducing emissions. Both
   adaptation and mitigation plans need to be fully implemented in the
   interim, and the Global Ocean Observation System should be sustained so
   that changes can be continuously monitored. In the longer-term (after
   similar to 2060), slow emerging changes such as deep ocean warming and
   sea level rise are committed to continue even in the scenario where net
   zero emissions are reached. Thus, climate actions have to extend to time

Abstract = {The conservation of marine biological diversity has been identified as a
   crucial issue in need of legal regulation. The UNCLOS does not
   sufficiently address all issues relevant to viably conserve biological
   diversity. Legal developments concerning marine genetic resources,
   area-based management tools such as marine protected areas,
   environmental impact assessment and capacity building are being
   discussed as elements of a new implementing agreement. In particular,
   more precise legal rules concerning marine protected areas beyond
   national jurisdiction are needed to supplement the frame left by UNCLOS.
   As concerns the issue of access to genetic resources and the sharing of
   benefits the UNCLOS regime has gaps because the relevant activities had
   not been foreseen at the time of the convention's adoption. Divergent
   views exist as to whether the concept of the common heritage of mankind
   should be extended to genetic resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This manuscript proposes an Adaptive Linear Neural Network (ADALINE)
   based control for the unified power quality conditioner to protect the
   critical loads from voltage related power quality problems and mitigate
   the current related power quality problems produced by nonlinear loads.
   Due to parallel computing feature and simple algorithm, ADALINE is
   utilized widely in parameter estimation. In this manuscript, unified
   ADALINEs based current harmonic extractor for the shunt active power
   filter is utilized, and an ADALINE based control technique is utilized
   to produce reference voltages for load voltage compensation. Due to
   ADALINE control, the necessity of a phase locked loop and conventional
   filters are omitted, therefore, enabling the system to extract the
   fundamental components more accurately. Besides, the ability of
   self-regulating transition from islanded mode to grid-connected mode has
   ensured that uninterrupted power supply is provided to the critical
   loads. The system performance is validated through simulation results
   utilizing MATLAB-Simulink software considering several dynamic
   conditions, namely unbalanced grid voltage, self-regulating transition,
   and grid unavailability. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Title = {The water and biology on a small Karstic island: the Island of Brac
   (Croatia) as one example},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {79},
Number = {5},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {The objective of this paper was to stress the significance of a holistic
   interdisciplinary approach to analyses of a small karst island valuable
   and vulnerable ecosystem. To reach that aim, this paper presents
   ecohydrological data and standard methods of biological surveying in
   subterranean habitats. The Island of Brac, with a total area of 394.57
   km(2), is the third largest Croatian island in the Adriatic Sea. The
   island stretches east-west direction between 43 degrees 16 ` and 43
   degrees 23 ` N and 16 degrees 25 ` and 16 degrees 54 ` E. The
   penetration of surface water through calcareous substrate into the
   underground and the sea water from the Adriatic side has created a
   system of caves, and this study investigated 225 pits and caves of such
   a nature. An overview of karst ecohydrological characteristics on the
   island of Brac through its geology, climatology, geography, speleology
   and biology is given. A decrease in rainfall and increasing air
   temperature were observed. If these processes continue, this vulnerable
   island ecosystem can be endangered. This paper also includes an analysis
   of the physicochemical parameters and faunal composition of six
   groundwater habitats: the spring ``Martinica{''}, the mine
   ``Minjera{''}, the pit ``Jama u Kotlicu{''}, the pit ``Jama na
   Bijaki{''}, the pit ``Jama u Podstraziscu{''} and the well
   ``Studenac{''}. Based on salinity, the groundwaters are limnic and
   anchihaline. The subterranean macroinvertebrate fauna consists of
   Gastropods and Crustaceans. Two records confirm the new gastropod genus
   and species Semisalsa n.sp.? and Hydrobiidae n.g. et n.sp. Preliminary
   anatomical data on Balkanostenasellus specimens show significant
   differences between the described Balkanostenasellus species. Other
   crustacean representatives are Niphargus hebereri and Titanethes sp. All
   faunistic results are the subject of further taxonomic surveys and
   provide a significant contribution to increasing knowledge about
   subterranean fauna in Croatia, as well as their protection.},

Title = {A multiple habitat restoration strategy in a semi-enclosed Florida
   embayment, combining hydrologic restoration, mangrove propagule
   plantings and oyster substrate additions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {394-404},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Habitat loss and disturbance are ranked globally as the greatest threats
   to biodiversity. Development and coastal population growth are the
   leading causes for habitat losses. Recently, the restoration of marine
   habitats has increased, especially with the goal of increasing
   non-consumptive ecosystem services derived from mangrove and submerged
   aquatic vegetation (SAV) along with biogenic oyster reefs. Habitats
   reside in landscapes dominated by multiple species. Rather than focusing
   on a single habitat such as oysters or mangroves or SAV, we took an
   approach restoring multiple adjacent habitats to accelerate restoration
   in a Florida embayment that had been significantly degraded prior to the
   restoration of natural tidally generated flows. After a multiple habitat
   die-off, a project was initiated in 2006 to reintroduce tidal flushing.
   The re-introduction of tidal flushing, however, did not result in
   immediate recovery of mangrove shorelines or oyster-dominated reefs.
   There was a lack of mangrove propagule production and significant
   substrate limitation in areas with appropriate salinity, sediment and
   tidal flows. From 2009-2012, red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) propagules
   were collected (over 500,000) and planted for a total area of 3.24 ha.
   From 2009-2010, five intertidal reefs were constructed by adding bagged
   and fossil shell (54 MT) for Crassostrea virginica larvae to recruit
   onto totaling over 779 m(2). Monitoring of planted mangrove versus
   unplanted shorelines demonstrated that prop root and drop root densities
   were higher where propagules were planted (28 m(-2)) versus unplanted
   (2.3 m(-2)). Oyster densities and mean sizes (multiple year classes) at
   new and natural reefs were measured after 8, 12, and 24, and 36 months.
   An initial settlement pulse was observed in the first 8 months followed
   by an increase in the density of greater than 1-year old oysters.
   Xanthid crab densities (Eurypanopeus depressus and Panopeus spp.) in
   restored reefs and natural reefs were similar, while Petrolisthes
   armatus densities were lower in restored reefs. Whole reef seston
   filtration rates over restored reefs were -26 to 157 L m(-2) h(-1) when
   measured at 4,15, 28, and 40 months. A multiple habitat approach may be
   useful in accelerating the natural ecological succession, especially if
   the project site has reached a degraded, alternate ecological state.
   These results suggest a multiple habitat approach can be useful in
   providing non-provisioning ecosystem services to a Florida embayment.

Abstract = {Since the discovery of oil well drilling, energy policy (particularly
   offshore petroleum policy over the past three decades) has led the
   United States, and indeed the industrialized world, into a cycle of
   dependency, profit, and risk taking that made a Macondo-like blowout
   likely, if not inevitable. This article examines the broad political,
   economic, technological, and environmental contexts surrounding the
   growth and development of both our ability to obtain petroleum and our
   dependency on it. The authors use the tools of environmental sociology,
   environmental history, and political ecology to trace the path to the
   current situation in which the myth of ``energy independence{''} is used
   to justify practices that are counter to the very concept.},

Abstract = {Coarse, global-scale, satellite remotely sensed observations are
   compared with ground measurements collected during the OTTER study. The
   objective was derivation of ecological and environmental variables from
   the satellite data needed to define primary production in western
   Oregon. Observations from the TOMS sensor and the AVHRR sensor provide
   estimates of incident PAR radiation, intercepted PAR, atmospheric
   humidity, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and drought. The
   satellite observations compared favorably with the coincident ground
   measurements, but the strength of the relation was modest in some cases.
   Atmospheric attenuation of the remotely sensed measurements and ground
   measurement quality both limit stronger relations. This study
   demonstrates that satellite remote sensing is capable of providing
   information needed for macroscale ecological monitoring. Currently, it
   appears possible, from AVHRR and TOMS observations, to derive periodic
   approximations of ecological conditions sufficient to drive a
   simple-production-efficiency-type model. More refined remote-sensing
   methods will be needed to provide the type of measurement precision
   required by more refined ecosystem models.},

Title = {Effects of structural marsh management and salinity on invertebrate prey
   of waterbirds in marsh ponds during winter on the Gulf Coast Chenier
   Plain},

Abstract = {Aquatic invertebrates are important food resources for wintering
   waterbirds, and prey selection generally is limited by prey size.
   Aquatic invertebrate communities are influenced by sediments and
   hydrologic characteristics of wetlands, which were affected by
   structural marsh management (levees, water-control structures and
   impoundments; SMM) and salinity on the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain of North
   America. Based on previous research, we tested general predictions that
   SMM reduces biomass of infaunal invertebrates and increases that of
   epifaunal invertebrates and those that tolerate low levels of dissolved
   oxygen (O-2) and salinity. We also tested the general prediction that
   invertebrate biomass in freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline marshes
   are similar, except for taxa adapted to specific ranges of salinity.
   Finally, we investigated relationships among invertebrate biomass and
   sizes, sediment and hydrologic variables, and marsh types. Accordingly,
   we measured biomass of common invertebrate by three size classes (63 to
   199 mum, 200 to 999 mum, and greater than or equal to1000 mum), sediment
   variables (carbon content, C:N ratio, hardness, particle size, and O-2
   penetration), and hydrologic variables (salinity, water depth,
   temperature, O-2, and turbidity) in ponds of impounded freshwater (IF),
   oligohaline (IO), mesohaline (IM), and unimpounded mesohaline (UM)
   marshes during winters 1997-1998 to 1999-2000 on Rockefeller State
   Wildlife Refuge, near Grand Chenier, Louisiana, USA. As predicted, an a
   priori multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) contrast indicated
   that biomass of an infaunal class of invertebrates (Nematoda, 63 to 199
   mum) was greater in UM marsh ponds than in those of IM marshes, and
   biomass of an epifaunal class of invertebrates (Ostracoda, 200 to 999
   mum) was greater in IM marsh ponds than in those of UM marshes. The
   observed reduction in Nematoda due to SMM also was consistent with the
   prediction that SMM reduces invertebrates that do not tolerate low
   salinity. Furthermore, as predicted, an a priori MANOVA contrast
   indicated that biomass of a single invertebrate class adapted to low
   salinity (Oligochaeta, 200 to 999 mum) was greater in ponds of IF
   marshes than in those of 10 and IM marshes. A canonical correspondence
   analysis indicated that variation in salinity and O-2 penetration best
   explained differences among sites that maximized biomass of the common
   invertebrate classes. Salinity was positively correlated with the
   silt-clay fraction, O-2, and O-2 penetration, and negatively correlated
   with water depth, sediment hardness, carbon, and C:N. Nematoda,
   Foraminifera, and Copepoda generally were associated with UM marsh ponds
   and high salinity, whereas other invertebrate classes were distributed
   among impounded marsh ponds and associated with lower salinity. Our
   results suggest that SMM and salinity have relatively small effects on
   invertebrate prey of wintering waterbirds in marsh ponds because they
   affect biomass of Nematoda and Oligochaeta, and few waterbirds consume
   these invertebrates.},

Title = {Annelid Fauna of the Prince Gustav Channel, a Previously Ice-Covered
   Seaway on the Northeastern Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The Prince Gustav Channel is a narrow seaway located in the western
   Weddell Sea on the northeastern-most tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The
   channel is notable for both its deep (> 1200 m) basins, and a dynamic
   glacial history that most recently includes the break-up of the Prince
   Gustav Ice Shelf, which covered the southern portion of the channel
   until its collapse in 1995. However, the channel remains mostly
   unsampled, with very little known about its benthic biology. We present
   a preliminary account of the benthic annelid fauna of the Prince Gustav
   Channel in addition to samples from Duse Bay, a sheltered,
   glacier-influenced embayment in the northwestern portion of the channel.
   Samples were collected using an Agassiz Trawl, targeting megafaunal and
   large macrofaunal sized animals at depths ranging between 200-1200 m;
   the seafloor and associated fauna were also documented in situ using a
   Shallow Underwater Camera System (SUCS). Sample sites varied in terms of
   depth, substrate type, and current regime, and communities were locally
   variable across sites in terms of richness, abundance, and both
   taxonomic and functional composition. The most diverse family included
   the motile predator/scavenger Polynoidae, with 105 individuals in at
   least 12 morphospecies, primarily from a single site. This study
   provides first insights into diverse and spatially heterogeneous benthic
   communities in a dynamic habitat with continuing glacial influence,
   filling sampling gaps in a poorly studied region of the Southern Ocean
   at direct risk from climate change. These specimens will also be
   utilized in future molecular investigations, both in terms of describing
   the genetic biodiversity of this site and as part of wider
   phylogeographic and population genetic analyses assessing the
   connectivity, evolutionary origins, and demographic history of annelid
   fauna in the region.},

Title = {Integrated emergy and economic evaluation of an ecological engineering
   system for the utilization of Spartina alterniflora},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {247},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {An integrated emergy and economic evaluation of a 7-step ecological
   engineering system (7-step EES) located in Jiangsu Province, China was
   carried out. This 7-step EES was constructed to fully utilize existing
   S. alterniflora production through a low waste, clean production process
   and to help control the expansion of this invasive grass. First, the
   above ground S. alterniflora biomass removed for invasion control is
   used as the feedstock for the extraction of a bio-mineral liquid and its
   encapsulation, both of which provide a health supplement to treat gout
   and angiocardiopathy patients. Next, the residues left after extraction
   are used as a medium for mushroom cultivation, and then for raising
   earthworms. Finally, the remaining residues become the main component of
   a microbe enriched organic fertilizer, which is then returned to the
   soil. A suite of emergy indices were constructed on multiple temporal
   and spatial scales to examine the operation of the whole system and its
   subsystems. The results showed that the temporal sustainability of the
   7-step EES was relatively high at different spatial scales, especially
   at the local scale as indicated by its EISDB (1.55E+03). Full
   implementation of the 7-step EES for S. alterniflora currently residing
   on the coast of China can result in a potential economic output that is
   greater than 2\% of the national GDP, with an economic output/input
   ratio over 29. In addition, the 7-step EES had an environmental loading
   ratio lower than that of the regional system. Sensitivity analysis
   showed that decreasing the cost of the purchased inputs needed to make
   the capsules is the key problem that needs to be solved to optimize the
   system, both for its sustainability and economic viability, on all
   spatial and temporal scales. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A modified design vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) system with high

   (sustainable low feed temperature and flow velocity). At high salinity,
   a permeate flux of 13.9 to 15.8 L m(-2) h(-1) was achieved. Increasing
   the salinity from 1 to 3M NaCl reduced the permeate flux by 18-20\%. An
   increase in bulk feed temperature (310.2-319.2 K) significantly
   increased the permeate flux by 64\%. The increase in flow velocity (1.1
   to 2.2 m s(-1)) in turn increased the permeate flux by 14-20\%. Model
   fluxes predicted was a good fit to experimental fluxes (R-2 >= 0.94).

Abstract = {Solar steam generation has been considered one of the most promising
   approaches for dealing with the energy and freshwater resource crises in
   recent years. However, achieving high efficiency in photothermal
   conversion remains a considerable challenge. Here, a series of
   hierarchical Ti3C2/MoS2 nanocomposites were designed for steam
   generation by a hydrothermal method. When the mass fraction of MoS2
   reached 65 wt\% (TM-3), the Ti3C2/MoS2 nanocomposite presented a strong
   broad-band light absorption of 92.4\% from the UV to NIR region because
   of the accordion-like layered structure. The evaporation rate and
   solar-thermal conversion efficiency of the TM-3 with as-fabricated
   evaporator could reach 1.36 kg.m(-2)-h(-1) and 87.2\% under 1 kW/m(2),
   due to the excellent light absorption ability of TM-3 and the low
   thermal energy loss (8.8\%) of the evaporator. Meanwhile, TM-3 permits
   the evaporator to have remarkable cycle stability because of its
   hydrophobic properties. Moreover, TM-3 showed excellent seawater
   desalination and wastewater treatment abilities. Thus, the excellent
   light absorption ability, photo-thermal conversion efficiency, and
   stability of the overall system suggested that these nanocomposites show
   great potential applications in synergetic solar desalination and sewage
   treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   were measured at an age of 6 years in 16 longleaf pine families
   representing a large portion of the species' range. Families were grown
   in common garden tests in North Carolina and Mississippi and grouped for
   analysis into six provenances based on climate, soils, and
   discontinuities in the species' range. No genetic by environment
   interactions were observed. Greater foliar C-13 was observed in trees
   from the provenance consisting of the Piedmont and Montane Uplands than
   from the provenances representing the western and eastern Gulf Coastal
   Plains. Foliar C-13 was not significantly correlated to height at age 6,
   suggesting that it may be possible to select for improved foliar C-13
   without sacrificing growth. These results represent a first step in
   identifying potential genetic variation in leaf water use efficiency and
   drought tolerance of longleaf pine.},

Abstract = {The green marine macroalga Ulva lactuca L. was found to be able to
   utilize HCO3- from sea water in two ways, When grown in flowing natural
   sea water at 16 degrees C under constant dim irradiance, photosynthesis
   at pH 8.4 was suppressed by acetazolamide but unaffected by
   4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonate. These responses indicate
   that photosynthetic HCO3- utilization was via extracellular carbonic
   anhydrase (CA) -mediated dehydration followed by CO2 uptake, The algae
   were therefore described as being in a `CA state'. If treated for more
   than 10h in a sea water flow-through system at pH 9.8, these thalli
   became insensitive to acetazolamide but sensitive to
   4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonate. This suggests the
   involvement of an anion exchanger (AE) in the direct uptake of HCO3-,
   and these plants were accordingly described as being in an `AE state',
   Such thalli showed an approximately 10-fold higher apparent affinity for
   HCO3- (at pH 9.4) than those in the `CA state', while thalli of both
   states showed a very high apparent affinity for CO2. These results
   suggest that the two modes of HCO3- utilization constitute two ways in
   which inorganic carbon may enter the Ulva lactuca cells, with the direct
   entry of HCO3-, characterizing the `AE state', being inducible and
   possibly functioning as a complementary uptake system at high external
   pH values (e.g. under conditions conducive to high photosynthetic
   rates), Both mechanisms of entry appear to be connected to concentrating
   CO2 inside the cell, probably via a separate mechanism operating
   intracellularly.},

Title = {Proton-pumping rhodopsins are abundantly expressed by microbial
   eukaryotes in a high-Arctic fjord},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Proton-pumping rhodopsins provide an alternative pathway to
   photosynthesis by which solar energy can enter the marine food web.
   Rhodopsin genes are widely found in marine bacteria, also in the Arctic,
   and were recently reported from several eukaryotic lineages. So far,
   little is known about rhodopsin expression in Arctic eukaryotes. In this
   study, we used metatranscriptomics and 18S rDNA tag sequencing to
   examine the mid-summer function and composition of marine protists (size
   0.45-10 mu m) in the high-Arctic Billefjorden (Spitsbergen), especially
   focussing on the expression of microbial proton-pumping rhodopsins.
   Rhodopsin transcripts were highly abundant, at a level similar to that
   of genes involved in photosynthesis. Phylogenetic analyses placed the
   environmental rhodopsins within disparate eukaryotic lineages, including
   dinoflagellates, stramenopiles, haptophytes and cryptophytes. Sequence
   comparison indicated the presence of several functional types, including
   xanthorhodopsins and a eukaryotic clade of proteorhodopsin. Transcripts
   belonging to the proteorhodopsin clade were also abundant in published
   metatranscriptomes from other oceanic regions, suggesting a global
   distribution. The diversity and abundance of rhodopsins show that these
   light-driven proton pumps play an important role in Arctic microbial
   eukaryotes. Understanding this role is imperative to predicting the
   future of the Arctic marine ecosystem faced by a changing light climate
   due to diminishing sea-ice.},

Abstract = {The coal transport mode from North to South China is investigated to
   find out how the ocean shipping mode and the north-to-south coal
   transport are susceptible to the Inner Mongolia-Jiangxi railway based on
   the bi-level programming game model. This paper derives the following
   conclusions from the case analysis of the competitive behaviors for the
   Erdos-Wuhan transport service modes: (1) The inauguration of Inner
   Mongolia-Jiangxi Railway has obvious traffic transfer effect on the
   traditional sea-railway combined transport mode, and will lead the
   freight rate to further reducing; (2) the higher the value of time (VOT)
   in coal transport service, the more apparent the competition effect of
   Inner Mongolia-Jiangxi Railway on sea-railway combined transport service
   mode; (3) the upgrading of sea-railway combined transport service level,
   especially its rapidity and punctuality, has regulation effect on the
   competition of Inner Mongolia-Jiangxi Railway. In the end, this paper
   gives some policy advice on how to improve the transport efficiency of
   coal from north to south China subject to freight rate, service
   upgrading and marketing strategies.},

Abstract = {Surface sediment samples at 4 sites along an offshore transect from
   outer continental shelf off the Pearl River estuary to the shelf slope
   region of the northern South China Sea, have been analyzed for total
   organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), solvent extractable organic
   matter (EOM) and non-aromatic hydrocarbons. TOC, TN and EOM show
   distinct spatial variations. Their highest values are all recorded at
   the shelf slope region. EOM varies from 18.70-33.58 mu g g(-1) dry
   sediment and accounts for 0.20-0.72\% of the TOC contents. The
   non-aromatic hydrocarbons are an important fraction of EOM. Their
   contents range from 3.43-7.06 mu g g(-1) dry sediment. n-Alkanes with
   carbon number ranging from 15-38 are identified. They derive from both
   biogenic and petrogenic sources in different proportions. Results of
   isoprenoid hydrocarbons, hopanes and steranes also suggest possible
   petroleum contamination. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Temperature effects on sinking velocity of different Emiliania huxleyi
   strains},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The sinking properties of three strains of Emiliania huxleyi in response
   to temperature changes were examined. We used a recently proposed
   approach to calculate sinking velocities from coccosphere architecture,
   which has the advantage to be applicable not only to culture samples,
   but also to field samples including fossil material. Our data show that
   temperature in the sub-optimal range impacts sinking velocity of E.
   huxleyi. This response is widespread among strains isolated in different
   locations and moreover comparatively predictable, as indicated by the
   similar slopes of the linear regressions. Sinking velocity was
   positively correlated to temperature as well as individual cell PIC/POC
   over the sub-optimum to optimum temperature range in all strains. In the
   context of climate change our data point to an important influence of
   global warming on sinking velocities. It has recently been shown that
   seawater acidification has no effect on sinking velocity of a
   Mediterranean E. huxleyi strain, while nutrient limitation seems to have
   a small negative effect on sinking velocity. Given that warming,
   acidification, and lowered nutrient availability will occur
   simultaneously under climate change scenarios, the question is what the
   net effect of different influential factors will be. For example, will
   the effects of warming and nutrient limitation cancel? This question
   cannot be answered conclusively but analyses of field samples in
   addition to laboratory culture studies will improve predictions because
   in field samples multi factor influences and even evolutionary changes
   are not excluded. As mentioned above, the approach of determining
   sinking rate followed here is applicable to field samples. Future
   studies could use it to analyse not only seasonal and geographic
   patterns but also changes in sinking velocity over geological time
   scales.},

Abstract = {As a part of an ongoing project on the role of microbes in the
   biogeochemistry of Majorcan caves, the species diversity of microbial
   communities present in cave pools of anchialine waters in the Cova des
   Pas de Vallgornera (Mallorca, Western Mediterranean) is investigated by
   a culture-dependent method. Two-hundred and forty-eight strains isolated
   from this characteristic littoral karst cave environment are identified
   by whole-cell-MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and phylogenetically by 16S
   rRNA gene sequences. Total cell counts and species diversity of the
   bacterial communities decrease with the distance to the entrance of the
   cave and to the sea. Strains are mainly identified as members of the
   Gammaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Around 20\% of the isolates are
   able to precipitate carbonates. Calcite is the predominant phase,
   growing in all the precipitates, although struvite is also found in one
   Pseudomonas and in one Aspergillus cultures. Differences in crystal
   habit and growth are observed according to the bacterial species
   promoting the precipitates. Bacteria associated with multicolored
   ferromanganese deposits, present in several parts of the cave, are also
   studied and are identified as Pseudomonas benzenivorans and Nocardioides
   luteus. The preponderance of Pseudomonas species and the possible
   contribution of bacteria in calcite deposition are discussed.},

Title = {Optimization of a tidal-battery-diesel driven energy-efficient
   standalone microgrid considering the load-curve flattening program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {The diesel generators are usually used for supplying the electrical
   demand of the semi-submersible oil drilling rigs. The specific fuel
   consumption (SFC) of each diesel engine changes nonlinearly with respect
   to its power product. Hence, this paper presents an economic fuel
   dispatch model for diesel engines powered oil rig platforms using the
   cubic spline interpolation curve fitting of the SFC-power non-linear
   dependence. Moreover, the total fuel consumption of the diesel
   generators significantly reduces by shifting a partial part of the
   electricity demand of the offshore drilling rigs from on-peak time
   intervals to off-peak periods. In addition, battery energy storage
   contributes to the load curve smoothing strategy. A mixed-integer
   non-linear programming problem is developed under generalized algebraic
   mathematical modeling system to find the optimum fuel consumption and
   power generation schedules of the diesel producers, the value of demand
   increase/decrease, and the charge/discharge pattern of the battery at
   each operating time interval. A benchmark oil rig with eight diesel
   engines and four tidal turbines is considered to validate the proposed
   methodology. Four cases are studied without and with application of
   battery and load shifting program. It is found that implementation of
   peak-clipping and valley filling to energy demand pattern and battery
   integration with tidal-diesel driven oil rigs cause a significant fuel
   saving. In the presence of battery, 70 g fuel saving is achieved over a
   24-hours study horizon. Moreover, the implementation of time-based load
   shifting program with the capability of 30\% load decreasing (at peak
   hours) and increasing (at off-peak periods) makes it possible to save
   282 g diesel fuel according to the base electrical demand profile.
   Finally, simultaneous integration of battery and demand-side management
   programs (with maximum 10\% load flexibility) causes 216 g fuel saving
   in sample operation day.},

Title = {Changes in reef fish assemblages following multiple bleaching events in
   the world's warmest sea (Kish Island, the Persian Gulf)},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},

Abstract = {Climate change affects the ecology of reef fish through changing their
   habitat, community and their feeding and territorial behavior. The
   corals and their associated reef fish in the Persian Gulf as the world's
   warmest sea suffer from the increasing frequency and severity of mass
   bleaching events. Yet, the effects of climate-induced coral bleaching
   events on reef fish in this sea are poorly understood. Using a time
   series fish count data, this study evaluated the response of reef fish
   to multiple severe coral bleaching events in Kish Island located in the
   central Persian Gulf. The results showed a decline in species richness
   and diversity of reef fish after bleaching events which reduced mean
   coral cover by 85\% following the 2007 bleaching event and by 95\%
   following the 2017 bleaching event. Besides a drop in the number of fish
   species, the total density, and density of trophic groups changed as the
   results of coral loss. The variation in density of different trophic
   groups indicated an overall increase in the abundance of benthic
   invertebrate feeders (21.2-136.3\%), omnivores (32.4-163.4\%) and
   plankton feeders (218.5-488\%). In contrast, the abundance of coral
   polyp feeders (-6.9 to -50\%) and piscivores (-4.9 to -38.9\%)
   significantly decreased after bleaching events. The density of
   herbivorous fish significantly increased by 97.1\% after the bleaching
   event in 2007 and decreased by 10.5\% after the bleaching event in 2017.
   In the present study, we demonstrated how the impact of the multiple
   bleaching events on associated reef fish assemblages sustained for about
   6 years after the disturbance. These results have significant
   implications for our understanding of the response of reef fish to
   global warming and highlight the growing concern about the future of
   coral reef ecosystems and their associated reef fish in the region as
   the warmest sea in the world.},

Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Results of drag coefficient (C (D)) from field observations and
   laboratory wave tank experiments indicate that the operational wave
   model can overestimate wind energy input under high wind conditions. The
   wind-wave interaction source term in WAVEWATCH III has been modified to
   examine its behavior with tropical cyclone wind forcing. Using high
   resolution wind input, numerical experiments under idealized wind field
   and tropical cyclone Bonnie (1998) were designed to evaluate performance
   of the modified models. Both experiments indicate that the modified
   models with reduced C (D) significantly decrease wind energy input into
   the wave model and then simulate lower significant wave height (SWH)
   than the original model. However, the effects on spatial distribution of
   SWH, mean wavelength, mean wave direction, and directional wave spectra
   are insignificant. Due to the reduced wind energy input, the idealized
   experiment shows that the modified models simulate lower SWH than the
   original model in all four quadrants. The decrease in the front
   quadrants is significantly larger than that in the rear quadrants; it is
   larger under higher winds than lower winds. The realistic experiment on
   tropical cyclone Bonnie shows that the modified model with the various
   downward trends of C (D) in high winds creates a simulation that agrees
   best with scanning radar altimeter observations.},

Abstract = {The drastic change in climatic conditions has led to shift towards the
   review of sustainable strategies in the renewable energy sector.
   Hydrokinetic technology has various benefits over the conventional
   methods, which can be helpful in achieving the desired sustainable
   development. In the present study, an outline for the conversion of
   hydrokinetic energy along with its challenges has been discussed. The
   study comprises of three steps involving collection of properties
   required for site characterization followed by selection of the suitable
   hydrokinetic device as per the site characteristics and the
   determination of impact on the flow condition due to device
   installation. The characteristics of the site govern the selection of
   the device, its mooring arrangements, and augmentation. The arrangement
   of devices as a single unit or in an array will have an impact on the
   flow conditions. The altered flow condition will in turn affect and
   change the characteristics of the site. This three-step process is
   interlinked and will have a cumulative impact on the environment. The
   influence of environmental impact and cost of energy, which are the two
   major factors for the success of this technology, are also discussed.
   Further, various challenges faced by hydrokinetic technology in its
   development are explored. It is concluded that only the optimization of
   a hydrokinetic device for its efficiency improvement will not be
   fruitful until its impact on flow condition is considered for
   optimization.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have reported seismic observations of tsunami recorded
   at island broadband stations. Coastal loading by the tsunami can explain
   them. For further quantification, we model tsunami propagation assuming
   an axisymmetric structure: a conical island with a flat ocean floor. The
   total tsunami wavefield can be represented by superposition between an
   incident tsunami wave and the scattering. The ground deformation due to
   the total tsunami wavefield at the center is calculated using static
   Green's functions for elastic half-space with a first-order correction
   for bathymetry. By fitting the modeled displacement to observed seismic
   data, we can infer the incident tsunami wave, which can be interpreted
   as the virtual tsunami amplitude without the conical island. First, we
   apply this new method to three components of seismic data at a volcano
   island, Aogashima, for the 2015 Torishima-Oki tsunami earthquake. The
   estimated tsunami amplitude from the vertical component is consistent
   with the offshore array observation of absolute pressure gauges close to
   the island (1.5-20 mHz). The estimated incident azimuth from the three
   components is also consistent with ray theory. Second, we apply this
   method to seismic data at four island broadband stations in the Indian
   ocean for the 2010 Mentawai tsunami earthquake in Indonesia. Despite the
   limited observed frequency range from 0.5-2.0 mHz, the amplitudes and
   incident azimuths are consistent with past studies. These observations
   can complement offshore tsunami observations. Moreover, this method is
   applicable not only for a tsunami but also for background ocean
   infragravity wave activity.},

Abstract = {Every summer, algal bloom occurs in Chaohu Lake, causing the death of
   large numbers of aquatic animals, water pollution, and environmental
   pollution. Although Chaohu algae (CHA) is a pollutant, it represents a
   possible renewable energy source. This work aims to analyze the
   pyrolysis kinetics of CHA for the production of biochar and show the
   potential of the biochar for electrochemical applications. The thermal
   degradation features of CHA were studied using thermogravimetric and
   TG-FTIR analysis. Meanwhile, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and
   Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose methods were applied for the evaluation of
   kinetic parameters. CHA was then pyrolyzed using the microwave-assisted
   method to obtain biochar. The biochar structure and components were
   characterized by SEM, XRD, and Raman spectra. And the electrocatalytic
   performance was measured via cyclic voltammetry (CV) test with the
   biochar-modified electrode. It was found that the volatile products
   mainly contained water, methane, carboxylic acid, ketones, aldehyde
   groups, and NH3 indicated by the real-time online FTIR spectra. And the
   comprehensive characterization showed that the CHA-derived biochar had
   unique properties as a superior functionalizing material for
   electrochemical applications. To sum up, we innovatively proposed to

Abstract = {In many mountain areas in Southwest China, cascaded run-of-the-river
   hydropower plants and photovoltaic plants with local loads are connected
   by ac network comprise fully renewable microgrids. These microgrids are
   connected to the external large power systems via long-distance
   transmission lines in normal operation mode. However, when the
   transmission line's planned or emergency outage occurs, the microgrids
   are forced to operate in islanded mode. Considering the spatial-temporal
   coupling and limited energy storage of the cascaded hydropower plants
   and the non-Gaussian uncertainty of solar power generation, the
   frequency control and intra-day energy management, i.e., power-sharing
   between the cascaded plants, can be challenging. In this paper, a
   multi-timescale control method is proposed to coordinate the secondary
   frequency control and intraday energy management. Low-dimensional
   polynomial models of the expectation and variance of the response of the
   secondary frequency control over the short timescale are obtained first.
   Incorporating this model and a dynamic river model, the long timescale
   energy management problem is formed as chance-constrained programming.
   The expectational cost function defined over the multiple timescales is
   minimized by solving this model in a receding-horizon manner. The
   proposed method is verified by simulations of a real-life hydro-solar
   system in Sichuan Province, China.},

Title = {Design methodology for the frequency shift method of islanding
   prevention and analysis of its detection capability},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Islanding protection is one of the most important sources of discrepancy
   in grid-connected photovoltaic systems. Even when islanding is not very
   likely to happen, regulations demand the photovoltaic inverters to
   implement effective protection methods. Due to its several advantages,
   the frequency shift method of islanding prevention, commonly known as
   Sandia Frequency Shift, is one of the most important active methods.
   This method implements a positive feedback of the frequency that tends
   to move it outside the trip limits in case of islanding. The method
   shows a very high detection capability, which depends on both the values
   of the method parameters and the characteristics of the load that
   remains in the same power section after islanding.
   This paper develops a mathematical analysis of the Sandia Frequency
   Shift method and proposes a new methodology to design its parameters as
   a trade-off between the detection capability, which is evaluated as a
   function of the load characteristics, and the distortion that the method
   could introduce in the grid as a consequence of transitory frequency
   disturbances. The ability of this methodology to design the method
   parameters and achieve the highest detection capability is
   satisfactorily proved by means of both simulation and experimental
   results on a commercial photovoltaic inverter that implements the method
   once its parameters have been designed with the proposed methodology.

Title = {Common and Antarctic Minke Whales: Conservation Status and Future
   Research Directions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Minke whales comprise some of the most widely distributed species of
   baleen whales, some populations of which are still regularly targeted by
   commercial whaling. Here, we review the conservation status of common
   (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Antarctic (Balaenoptera bonaerensis)
   minke whale populations, against the backdrop of ongoing whaling
   operations and other anthropogenic threats, including climate change,
   entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, and noise pollution.
   Although some coastal minke whale populations have been studied in
   detail, others, which inhabit remote and ecologically sensitive
   locations, such as the Antarctic ice shelf, are among the least
   understood populations of marine mammals. The unresolved taxonomy of
   dwarf minke whales further highlights some of the existing knowledge
   gaps concerning these species. Due to their relatively small size and
   elusive behaviors, large uncertainties exist for almost all minke whale
   populations with respect to behavior, migratory routes and winter
   distributions, hindering effective conservation and management. However,
   recent advances in research technology, such as passive acoustic
   monitoring (PAM), unmanned aerial systems (UAS), multisensor recording
   tags, and machine learning assisted photo-identification, are
   increasingly being applied to study minke whales and their habitat, and
   are starting to open new windows into their life history and ecology. In
   future research, these non- and less-invasive methods should be
   integrated in larger-scale comparative studies aiming to better
   understand minke whale behavior, ecological interactions and their
   varying habitats to drive and support effective species conservation.},

Title = {Contribution to integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) as a solution

Abstract = {The city of Fortaleza has suffered an intense occupation anthropic
   starting from the 19(th) century, causing environmental impacts as
   aquatic pollution and coastal erosion. The solutions presented were
   always punctual, without an integrated environmental vision. The aim of
   this paper is to analyze in an integrated way the environmental problems
   and to suggest solutions to contribute for the installation of a process
   of ICZM in Fortaleza The environmental problems have been identified and
   analyzed using images of the Ikonos satellite and using software Are
   View 3.2. In the study area we checked the information obtained by
   satellite and we took samples of sediments to be analyzed in the
   laboratory. The area has been divided in 5 coherent units of
   environmental management. Their water have been polluted by domestic
   garbage, organic matter and fecal coliformes. They have presented
   embankment in the east coast and important erosive processes in the west
   coast. The solution for the aquatic pollution requests: public
   investments for pollution elimination in the rivers by dragging;
   cleaning of accumulated garbage; expansion of the basic sanitation;
   application of an environmental educational program. To obtain the
   balance between the embankment processes and coastal erosion it is
   necessary a solution that will integrate the elements of the coastal
   dynamics through: the adequate management of the sedimentary stocks of
   the Titanzinho beach; transport of those sediments for 4 reception cells
   located in the west coast; dredge of the harbor basin; construction of
   an artificial reef to dissipation the energy of the waves in the coast.},

Abstract = {The compression process necessary for the liquefaction of natural gas on
   offshore platforms generates large amounts of heat, usually dissipated
   via sea water cooled plate heat exchangers. To date, the corrosive
   nature of sea water has mandated the use of metals, such as titanium, as
   heat exchanger materials, which are costly in terms of life cycle energy
   expenditure. This study investigates the potential of a commercially
   available, thermally conductive polymer material, filled with carbon
   fibers to enhance thermal conductivity by an order of magnitude or more.
   The thermofluid characteristics of a prototype polymer seawater-methane
   heat exchanger that could be used in the liquefaction of natural gas on
   offshore platforms are evaluated based on the total coefficient of
   performance (COP(T)), which incorporates the energy required to
   manufacture a heat exchanger along with the pumping power expended over
   the lifetime of the heat exchanger, and compared with those of
   conventional heat exchangers made of metallic materials. The heat
   exchanger fabricated from a low energy, low thermal conductivity polymer
   is found to perform as well as, or better than, exchangers fabricated
   from conventional materials, over its full lifecycle. The analysis
   suggests that a COP(T) nearly double that of aluminum, and more than ten
   times that of titanium, could be achieved. Of the total lifetime energy
   use, 70\% occurs in manufacturing for a thermally enhanced polymer heat
   exchanger compared with 97\% and 85\% for titanium and aluminum heat
   exchangers, respectively. The study demonstrates the potential of
   thermally enhanced polymer heat exchangers over conventional ones in
   terms of thermal performance and life cycle energy expenditure. {[}DOI:

Title = {Influence of a salt marsh plant (Halimione portulacoides) on the

Abstract = {influence of Halimione portulacoides, commonly found in temperate salt
   marshes, an sediment metal contents, speciation and potential mobility
   in case of sediment re-suspension was evaluated. Both colonized and
   non-colonized sediments were studied for total Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn
   contents and metal fraction exchangeable to water collected in situ.
   Sediment elutriates, prepared with water collected from each site, were
   used to simulate a sediment re-suspension phenomenon. As the
   characteristics and degree of contamination of sediments may influence
   system behaviour, salt marshes of two Portuguese estuaries, Cavado (NW
   coast) and Sado (SW coast), were studied. Cu, Pb and Zn contents higher
   than ERL (quality guideline, effect range-low) were observed, indicating
   potential risks for living organisms. Strong Cu-complexing organic
   ligands, also determined in both water and elutriates, were higher in
   rhizosediment elutriates, at concentrations similar, or even higher, to
   those of Cu. Such ligands condition metals speciation in the water
   column and probably also metal bioavailability. From rhizosediment
   significant amounts of Cu and Zn were transferred to the aqueous phase,
   concentrations 2-8 times higher than concentrations present in water. In
   contrast, elutriates of non-colonized sediment removed metals from
   water, Cu and Zn levels in elutriates being 2-6 times lower than initial
   ones. Cd and Pb levels in water and elutriates were not measurable in
   most cases. Results clearly indicate that metals potential solubility in
   the rhizosphere of plants was markedly higher than that in the
   surrounding sediment. The obtained results indicated that H.
   portulacoides presence (and probably other salt marsh plants) may cause
   a marked increase in metals concentrations in dissolved phase (pore
   water or even water column if rhizosediment is re-suspended). As salt
   marsh plants may be abundant in temperate and subtropical estuaries and
   costal lagoons, this phenomenon should not be disregard in future
   studies towards the sustainable management of such environments. (C)

Title = {Desalination impacts on the coastal environment: Ash Shuqayq, Saudi
   Arabia},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {421},
Pages = {163-172},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Ash Shuqayq (Saudi Red Sea coast) is approximately 28 km long and
   characterised by narrow rocky headlands with intermittent pocket
   beaches. Fifty-two sediment samples from six different environments
   (beach, dune, sabkha, tidal/lagoon, offshore and wadi) were analysed.
   Testing showed that beach and dune sands are mainly medium to fine
   grained, with some very coarse sand (MZ = -0.59empty set). Both beach
   and dune sands are moderately well to moderately sorted, although some
   are poorly sorted due to an influx of wadi sediments. Sediment source
   together with littoral reworking contributed to grain size variation.
   Carbonate content varied between 1.5\% and 23\%, whilst the organic
   content varied between 1.1\% and 13\%. Spatial analysis showed
   increasing southward carbonate and organic content, with both correlated
   (r=0.57). Sabkha sediments had significantly higher carbonate
   percentages (t=2.898: df=18; p<0.01) and results suggested origins are
   similar for both UAE Arabian Sea and Saudi Arabian Red Sea coasts. X-ray
   diffractions show beach and dune sediments are mainly composed of
   detrital quartz and plagioclase feldspar with uncommon amounts of
   chlorites. Analysis of sediment characteristics, composition and
   shoreline distribution alongside coastal processes, indicate that high
   chlorite levels are probably caused by desalination processes. Due to
   human and ecosystem health consequences and the likely increased demand
   for desalination plants, similar analyses should be undertaken
   elsewhere, e.g. the Mediterranean. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Primacy of seascape connectivity effects in structuring coral reef fish
   assemblages},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {462},
Pages = {191-203},
Abstract = {Connectivity has fundamental consequences for the productivity,
   persistence and management of coral reefs. The area and position of
   adjacent mangroves and seagrass can affect the demography of reef fish
   populations and the composition of reefal assemblages. To date, no
   studies have attempted to partition the influences of these habitats on
   reef fish assemblages. We used an exploratory seascape approach to
   separate the effects of connectivity with mangroves and seagrass on reef
   fish in Moreton Bay, Australia. We then compared the performance of
   seascape connectivity and reef complexity (i.e. coral cover, rugosity
   and area) in structuring these assemblages. Our results suggest a
   hierarchy of seascape connectivity effects, with reef fish assemblages
   being primarily distinguished by isolation (i.e. separation distance)
   from mangroves and secondarily by proximity (an index incorporating
   habitat isolation and area) to seagrass. Importantly, measures of reef
   complexity were only useful in separating reef fish assemblages within
   levels of connectivity with mangroves and seagrass. We demonstrate that
   neighbouring mangroves and seagrasses can exert different effects on
   reef fish assemblages, with 25\% of all species being primarily
   influenced by mangroves and a different 25\% being affected by seagrass.
   These findings have important implications for the design of marine
   reserve networks. They show that position in the seascape can be of
   greater significance than reef area or complexity to the composition of
   reef fish assemblages and highlight the value of incorporating seascape
   connectivity into conservation planning.},

   Ice Core Project (GRIP) timescale. The oxygen isotope signal in benthic
   foraminifera (on this GRIP-based timescale) is quite different from the
   planktonic record and resembles the temperature record over Antarctica
   when this is synchronized with Greenland using the record of methane in
   the atmospheric air in the polar ice cores. We interpret the benthic
   record as indicating significant fluctuations in ice volume during

   a function of ice volume.},

   The factors which influence sustainability in coastal management span
   social, economic, institutional, biophysical and legal conditions. There
   is a need to evaluate resource demands of coastal communities and assess
   socio-economic influences on sustainability. This paper addresses these
   issues by comparing two communities within the same administrative
   boundary using ecological footprint questionnaires. Community one, Rest
   Bay, is an affluent coastal area and community two is Caerau, a
   socio-economically deprived area in Wales. Resource demand and lifestyle
   differences were assessed and consequences identified for coastal
   sustainability using the sub-divisions of housing, energy, food,
   purchasing, transportation, and waste. Results demonstrated how and why
   people of varying socio-economic backgrounds impact coastal
   environments. Analysis showed that despite being more environmentally
   aware, Rest Bay residents had a significantly higher ecological
   footprint than Caerau residents at the 99\% confidence level (unpaired t
   test: t = 12.836; df = 198; p < 0.01). This validated the use of
   ecological footprints to benchmark coastal differences and associated
   strategies. Furthermore, it informs policy-makers of the need for
   spatially differentiated coastal management.},

Abstract = {Changes in the eustatic sea level have enhanced the impact of inundation
   events in the coastal zone, ranging in significance from tropical storm
   surges to pervasive nuisance flooding events. The increased frequency of
   these inundation events has stimulated the production of interactive
   web-map tracking tools to cope with changes in our changing coastal
   environment. Tidewatch Maps, developed by the Virginia Institute of
   Marine Science (VIMS), is an effective example of an emerging
   street-level inundation mapping tool. Leveraging the Semi-implicit
   Cross-scale Hydro-science Integrated System Model (SCHISM) as the
   engine, Tidewatch operationally disseminates 36-h inundation forecast
   maps with a 12-h update frequency. SCHISM's storm tide forecasts provide
   surge guidance for the legacy VIMS Tidewatch Charts sensor-based tidal
   prediction platform, while simultaneously providing an interactive and
   operationally functional forecast mapping tool with hourly temporal
   resolution and a 5 m spatial resolution throughout the coastal plain of
   Virginia, USA. This manuscript delves into the hydrodynamic modeling and
   geospatial methods used at VIMS to automate the 36-h street-level flood
   forecasts currently available via Tidewatch Maps, and the
   paradigm-altering efforts involved in validating the spatial, vertical,
   and temporal accuracy of the model.},

Abstract = {The normal functioning of the respiratory system is a leading factor,
   both for the survival of people caught in an aquatic environment in a
   marine casualty and for the effectiveness of the assistance activities.
   In view of this, in 2020 a team of researchers from Varna Medical
   University, the Naval Academy Varna and the Bulgarian Red Cross set out
   to study some physiological respiratory parameters and related
   anthropometric data of 51 individuals, 41 men and 10 women aged between
   17 and 48 years of age. The subjects were divided into two groups: 1)
   trainees in the water rescue courses conducted at BRC-Varna and 2) 1st -
   year students of the Naval Academy. All participants in the study are
   non- smokers. The examination of the respiratory indicators is performed
   according to a standardized methodology with the same spirometer, which
   is able to measure and register over 30 indicators. Of these, three were
   analyzed in the present study: forced expiratory volume for 1 s (FEV1),
   forced vital capacity (FVC), and their FEV1/FVC percentage (Tiffeneau
   index). The results show that, according to anthropometric data, FVC and
   FEV1 are higher in water rescue trainees than in Naval Academy cadets.
   The Tiffeneau index is higher than the reference values of the
   participants in both study groups, but the results are better in the
   group of naval cadets. As far as the functional capabilities of the
   respiratory system are essential for the activity of marine
   professionals, it can be assumed that the high results obtained from the
   spirometric examination of the participants from both groups are a
   prerequisite for higher efficiency of rescue operations and improvement
   of their personal safety. when working in a marine environment. The
   prospect is that after collecting a statistically significant amount of
   data combined with results obtained from other types of functional
   tests, to create better safety practices for people who are
   professionally engaged in maritime activities.
   As far as the functional capabilities of the respiratory system are

   that the high results of the spirometric study in all study participants
   are a prerequisite for improving both their personal safety when working
   in the marine environment and for higher efficiency and success of
   rescue operations. The perspective is, after collecting a statistically
   significant volume of data and in combination with other functional
   studies, to create good practices to improve the safety systems of
   people in contact with the marine environment.},

Abstract = {Blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) primarily inhabit the coastal
   regions of Southeast Asia. This study aimed to examine their population
   genetic structure, phylogeography, and historical demography by applying
   partial sequences to the control region in the mitochondrial DNA. The
   analysis focused on 6 populations comprising 166 individual samples
   collected from Taiwan (Kezailiao Kaohsiung (KK) and Penghu (PH)),
   mainland China (Xiamen (XM) and Hong Kong (HK)), Vietnam (Hanoi (VN)),
   and Singapore (SGP). The estimated nucleotide diversity (pi) for all of
   the samples was 0.062, with values ranging between 0.018 (PH) and 0.045
   (HK). Our study collected 116 haplotypes and classified them into
   lineages A and B. The XM, HK, VN, and SGP populations made up lineage A,
   and the PH and KK populations comprised lineage B. For each lineage, the
   results highlighted indications of demographic expansion. Lineage A can
   be traced back to the second-to-last interglacial period, while lineage
   B possibly originated in the last glacial period. There were significant
   differences in the F-ST values among the six populations, except for the
   pairs HK-XM and PH-KK. In conclusion, the phylogeography and genetic
   structure of P. pelagicus in Southeast Asia were potentially affected by
   the Pleistocene glacial cycles and human introduction. These findings
   further highlight the possible dispersal routes of P. pelagicus
   throughout Southeast Asia.},

Abstract = {A novel concentric type grid nebulizer (CGrid) was developed for sample
   introduction into an inductively coupled plasma optical emission
   spectrometer (ICP-OES). The CGrid has a concentric structure and a grid
   screen (over 350 meshes per inch) that is set inside the nozzle. The
   grid screen acts as both an effective gas-liquid mixing filter and a gas
   flow damper, and then the liquid breaks up into small droplets by
   passing through the grid with low velocity. By this unique nebulizing
   process, the CGrid showed excellent nebulizer performances on comparing
   with commercially available nebulizers, such as Meinhard nebulizer type
   C (MHN), modified high performance concentric nebulizer (m-HPCN), and
   OneNeb. The primary aerosols generated with the CGrid were finer and
   their velocities were lower than those with the other nebulizers. This
   nebulization feature gave a high transport efficiency of aerosols into
   the plasma, resulting in high sensitivity in ICP-OES. In the range of
   the liquid flow rate of 0.25 mL min(-1) to 2.0 mL min(-1) with the
   optimized nebulizer gas flow rate for obtaining the highest Mg(II)/Mg(I)
   signal intensity ratio, the maximum loading amount of aerosols into the
   plasma obtained with the CGrid was higher than those with the MHN
   (2.1-fold) and m-HPCN (1.4-fold), and almost the same as that with the
   OneNeb. The maximum sensitivity in ICP-OES obtained with the CGrid was
   1.8- to 3.7-fold, 1.5- to 1.9-fold, and 1.1- to 1.2-fold higher than
   those with the MHN, m-HPCN, and OneNeb, respectively. The CGrid also
   showed a good tolerance for high total dissolved solid (TDS)
   concentrations. No clogging was observed when saturated NaCl solution
   was continuously nebulized for 5 hours. The limits of detection (LODs)
   obtained with the CGrid were better than those of the MHN, 1.6- to
   5.3-fold improved, except for Cd I 228.802 nm, and similar to those of
   the m-HPCN and OneNeb. The plasma robustness estimated from the
   Mg(II)/Mg(I) signal intensity ratio obtained with the CGrid (10.6) was
   also better than those of the MHN (9.6), and similar to those of the
   m-HPCN (10.2) and OneNeb (10.4). The short-term stability on measuring
   spiked seawater (45 min) was within 3\% of the relative standard
   deviation, and the recoveries of the spiked elements were in the range
   of 99\% to 106\%. The validation of the CGrid was performed by analyzing
   the NMIJ CRM 7531-a brown rice flour. The observed values for the five
   elements Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cd were in good agreement with their
   certified values. It was concluded that the CGrid is very useful for
   ICP-OES with good performance on sensitivity and high TDS solution
   analysis.},

Abstract = {Organic carbon degradation experiments were carried out using
   flow-through reactors with sediments collected from an intertidal
   freshwater marsh of an eutrophic estuary (The Scheldt, Belgium).
   Concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC),
   dissolved organic carbon, methane, dissolved cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+
   and K+), total dissolved Fe, phosphate and alkalinity were measured in
   the outflow solutions from reactors that were supplied with or without
   the terminal electron acceptor nitrate. Organic carbon mineralization
   rates were computed from the release rates of DIC after correcting for
   the contribution of carbonate mineral dissolution. The experiments ran
   for several months until nitrate reducing activity could no longer be
   detected. In the reactors supplied with nitrate, 10-13\% of the bulk
   sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) was mineralized by the end of the
   experiments. In reactors receiving no nitrate, only 3-9\% of the initial
   SOC was mineralized. Organic matter utilization by nitrate reducers
   could be described as the simultaneous degradation of two carbon pools
   with different maximum oxidation rates and half-saturation constants.
   Even when nitrate was supplied in non-limiting concentrations about half
   of the carbon mineralization in the reactors was due to fermentative
   processes, rather than being coupled to nitrate respiration.
   Fermentation may thus be responsible for a large fraction of the DIC
   efflux from organic-rich, nearshore sediments.},

Title = {3D Modeling and Mechanism Analysis of Breaking Wave-Induced Seabed Scour
   around Monopile},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Breaking wave-induced scour is recognized as one of the major causes of
   coastal erosion and offshore structure failure, which involves in the
   full 3D water-air-sand interaction, raising a great challenge for the
   numerical simulation. To better understand this process, a nonlinear 3D
   numerical model based on the open-source CFD platform OpenFOAM (R) was
   self-developed in this study. The Navier-Stokes equations were used to
   compute the two-phase incompressible flow, combining with the finite
   volume method (FVM) to discretize calculation domain, a modified VOF
   method to track the free surface, and a k - epsilon model to closure the
   turbulence. The nearshore sediment transport process is reproduced in
   view of shear stress, suspended load, and bed load, in which the terms
   of shear stress and suspended load were updated by introducing volume
   fraction. The seabed morphology is updated based on Exner equation and
   implemented by dynamic mesh technique. The mass conservative sand slide
   algorithm was employed to avoid the incredible vary of the bed mesh.
   Importantly, a two-way coupling method connecting the hydrodynamic
   module with the beach morphodynamic module is implemented at each
   computation step to ensure the fluid-sediment interaction. The
   capabilities of this model were calibrated by laboratory data from some
   published references, and the advantages/disadvantages, as well as
   proper recommendations, were introduced. Finally, nonbreaking- and
   breaking wave-induced scour around the monopile, as well as breaking
   wave-induced beach evolution, were reproduced and discussed. This study
   would be significantly helpful to understand and evaluate the nearshore
   sediment transport.},

Title = {Numerical Study of the Effect of Thermal Stimulation on Gas Production
   from Marine Hydrate Reservoirs br},
Journal = {ENERGY \& FUELS},
Abstract = {ABSTRACT: The temperature of hydrate reservoirs will decrease in a gas
   production process because gas hydrate dissociation is endothermic,
   leading to a decrease in the gas production rate as sensible heat is
   exhausted. Heat supply should be an effective way to alleviate the
   effect of temperature decrease on the production rate, by thermal
   stimulation, such as hot water injection into a hydrate reservoir.
   However, the feasibility of thermal stimulation combined with
   depressurization is controversial. Hence, to investigate the effect of
   this combined strategy, gas production performance is studied by
   numerical simulation based on a 2D Cartesian hydrate reservoir model
   with a two parallel horizontal well configuration. One of the two
   horizontal wells, at the top of the hydrate-bearing layers, is for gas
   production, and the other at the bottom of the hydrate-bearing layers is
   for hot water injection. The influence of the injection rate,
   temperature of hot water, and permeability of hydrate-bearing layers on
   gas production is investigated. When only the hot water injection is
   applied, the released gas, which originates from the dissociation of
   hydrates around the injection well, tends to be trapped and forms
   hydrates again. When the production strategy of hot water injection
   combined with depressurization is engaged, the hydrate dissociation
   shows a depressurization-dominant feature, and the production is at a
   relatively high rate, but it seems the hot water injection is still a
   negative factor in gas production. Because the hot water injection will
   replenish reservoir pressure and increase the water production rate, the
   feasibility of depressurization will be compromised. Sensitivity
   analyses reveal that the increased permeability of hydratebearing layers
   can enhance gas production almost proportionally. It is also found that
   increasing the temperature of the injected hot water only has a very
   limited effect on gas production.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {Shear-based and/or strain-based fine-scale parameterizations of
   turbulent dissipation rates in the deep ocean become erroneous near
   topographic features where internal wave spectra deviate from
   Garrett-Munk (GM). Although the Gregg-Henyey-Polzin (GHP)
   parameterization incorporates this spectral deviation, the applicability
   remains uncertain. We evaluate ``alpha{''} and ``beta{''} representing
   the local internal wave energy in the high frequency (2f < omega < N)
   and low frequency (f < omega < 2f) bands, respectively, scaled by their
   corresponding values in GM using fine-scale vertical shear and strain
   simultaneously measured near mixing hotspots. The local internal wave
   spectra are biased toward higher frequencies (alpha/beta >> 1) over
   rough bathymetry where high frequency internal waves are generated,
   whereas they are biased toward lower frequencies (alpha/beta << 1) at
   latitudes where high vertical wavenumber, near-inertial shears are
   created by parametric subharmonic instabilities. Compared with the
   shear-based and/or strain-based parameterizations, GHP more accurately
   estimates turbulent dissipation rates by compensating for deviations
   from GM. Citation: Hibiya, T., N. Furuichi, and R. Robertson (2012),

Title = {Inter-annual variation in responses of water chemistry and epilithon to
   Pacific salmon spawners in an Alaskan stream},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {478-490},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {1. Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) deliver salmon-derived nutrients
   (SDN) to the streams in which they spawn. However, many stream
   parameters, such as discharge and spawner abundance, can vary from year
   to year, which could alter the quantity and flux of SDN.
   2. Over six consecutive years, we studied responses in streamwater
   chemistry and epilithon (i.e. the microbial community on submerged
   rocks) to salmon spawners in Fish Creek, southeastern Alaska, U.S.A. The
   lower reach of Fish Creek receives spawners of several salmon species,
   while the upper reach does not receive spawners because of an
   intervening waterfall.
   3. We estimated salmon spawner biomass, analysed water chemistry
   {[}ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC)], and measured epilithon abundance {[}as
   chlorophyll a (chl a) and ash-free dry mass (AFDM)] in Fish Creek.
   Measurements were made in both the upper and lower reaches, before,
   during and after the major salmon runs.
   4. Absolute values and relative differences indicated that the presence
   of salmon spawners consistently increased dissolved ammonium (by 58 mu g
   L-1 on average, 41x over background), SRP (by 6 mu g L-1, 14x),
   epilithon chl a (by 35 mg m(-2), 16x), and epilithon AFDM (by 3 g m(-2),
   8x). Salmon spawners did not increase nitrate or DOC in either absolute
   or relative amounts. The persistence and magnitude of spawner effects
   varied among years and appeared to reflect weather-driven hydrology as
   well as spawner biomass.
   5. Salmon-derived nutrients can stimulate the growth of primary
   producers by increasing streamwater nutrient concentrations, but this
   positive influence may be modulated by other factors, such as water
   temperature and discharge. To better assess the ecological influence of
   SDN on stream biota, future studies should explicitly consider the role
   of key environmental factors and their temporal and spatial dynamics in
   stream ecosystems.},

Title = {Oyster patch reefs as indicators of fossil hydrocarbon seeps induced by
   synsedimentary faults},
Journal = {MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {176-185},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Late Jurassic deposits of the Boulonnais area (N-France) represent
   the proximal lateral-equivalent of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation; they
   accumulated on a clastic-dominated ramp subject to synsedimentary
   faulting as a result of the Atlantic Ocean rifting. In the Gris-Nez Cape
   area, i.e., close to the northern border fault zone of the Jurassic
   basin, the Late Jurassic sequence contains small-dimensioned oyster
   patch reefs (<1 m) that are specifically observed at the base of an
   abrupt deepening trend in the depositional sequence induced by
   well-defined pulses of normal fault activity. Petrographic analysis of
   these patch reefs shows that they are exclusively composed of Nanogyra
   nana embedded in a micro-sparitic calcite matrix. (TM) C-13
   measurements, carried out within both the matrix and the shells, display
   significantly lower values in the matrix compared to the oyster shells
   which suggests that the carbonate matrix precipitation was involving a
   carbon source different from marine dissolved inorganic carbon, most
   probably related to sulfate reduction, which is evidenced by light (TM)
   S-34 in pyrites. Similarities but also differences with lucinid-rich
   bioconstructions, namely, the Late Jurassic pseudo-bioherms of
   Beauvoisin (SE-France) suggest that the patch reefs developed at
   hydrocarbon seeps are related to synsedimentary faults. The extensional
   block-faulting segmentation of the northern margin of the Boulonnais
   Basin in Late Jurassic times is thus believed to have induced a sort of
   small-dimension hydrocarbon seepage field, recorded by the patch reef
   distribution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comment on ``Cosmic-ray-driven reaction and greenhouse effect of
   halogenated molecules: Culprits for atmospheric ozone depletion and
   global climate change{''}},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {13},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Lu's ``cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced reaction (CRE) theory{''} is
   based on the assumption that the CRE reaction of halogenated molecules
   (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCl, ClONO2) adsorbed or trapped in
   polar stratospheric clouds in the winter polar stratosphere is the key
   step in forming photoactive halogen species that are the cause of the
   springtime ozone hole. This theory has been extended to a warming theory
   of halogenated molecules for climate change. In this comment, we discuss
   the chemical and physical foundations of these theories and the
   conclusions derived from the theories. First, it is unclear whether the
   loss rates of halogenated molecules induced by dissociative electron
   attachment (DEA) observed in the laboratory can also be interpreted as
   atmospheric loss rates, but even if this were the case, the impact of
   DEA-induced reactions on polar chlorine activation and ozone loss in the
   stratosphere is limited. Second, we falsify several conclusions that are
   reported on the basis of the CRE theory: There is no polar ozone loss in
   darkness, there is no apparent 11-year periodicity in polar total ozone
   measurements, the age of air in the polar lower stratosphere is much
   older than 1-2 years, and the reported detection of a pronounced
   recovery (by about 20-25\%) in Antarctic total ozone measurements by the
   year 2010 is in error. There are also conclusions about the future
   development of sea ice and global sea level which are fundamentally
   flawed because Archimedes' principle is neglected. Many elements of the
   CRE theory are based solely on correlations between certain datasets
   which are no substitute for providing physical and chemical mechanisms
   causing a particular behavior noticeable in observations. In summary,
   the CRE theory cannot be considered as an independent, alternative
   mechanism for polar stratospheric ozone loss and the conclusions on
   recent and future surface temperature and global sea level change do not
   have a physical basis.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Inland water storage change is a fundamental part of the hydrologic
   cycle, which reflects the impact of climate change and anthropogenic
   activities on water resources. In this study, we used multisatellite
   data (from satellite altimetry, remote sensing, and the Gravity Recovery
   and Climate Experiment (GRACE)) to investigate water storage changes in
   the Aral Sea and its endorheic basin. The water storage depletion rate
   in the Aral Sea from calibrated hypsometric curves (CHCs) created by
   satellite altimetry and image data agrees with the GRACE-derived result
   using the Slepian space domain inverse method (SSDIM). Compared with the
   combined filtering method (CFM) and mascon solutions, the SSDIM was
   shown to be an effective method of reducing the GRACE leakage error and
   restoring the signal attenuation in the Aral Sea. Moreover, we used the
   WaterGAP global hydrology model (WGHM) to qualitatively analyze the
   variations in the water storage components. The results show that the
   groundwater in the Aral Sea affects the change in the interannual water
   storage, especially during the extreme dry and humid periods. However,
   from the long-term water storage trend, the decrease in the surface
   storage dominates the shrinking of the Aral Sea. In addition, more
   details of the water storage change pattern in the endorheic basin were
   revealed by the enhanced GRACE solution. Our findings accentuate the
   severe water storage states of the Aral Sea endorheic basin under the
   impact of climate change and human interventions.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Sediment transport measurements, coastal hydrodynamics and beach
   morphological surveys were undertaken on three sandy barred macrotidal
   beaches of Northern France. Sand trapping took place at several
   locations across the intertidal zone during rising and falling tides in
   order to obtain estimates of both longshore and onshore sediment flux
   from the lower to the upper beach. Results show that intertidal bars are
   responsible for significant wave energy dissipation leading to a
   decrease of sand transport towards the upper beach. Sediment transport
   appeared to be substantially higher on the bars than within the troughs
   due to wave breaking processes that are responsible for intense sand
   remobilization. The comparison of onshore sediment transport with
   longshore transport showed that onshore-directed transport is generally
   higher than the longshore sediment flux, suggesting that significant
   amounts of sand are directed shoreward across the bars, contributing to
   the onshore migration of intertidal bars. Sediment transport rates
   within the troughs proved to be significant only during runnel drainage
   when flow channelization was responsible for a local increase in
   sediment transport, this seaward-directed transport representing a sand
   recycling mechanism that contributes to the stability of the intertidal
   bars. Our measurements also showed a low alongshore variability in
   longshore sediment transport rates, which is an additional factor that
   plays a role in maintaining the linear bar and trough morphology on
   these macrotidal beaches.},

Abstract = {The presence of black carbon (BC) and its interaction with polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in mangrove sediments were studied for the
   first time. The study included an oil contaminated mangrove and two
   other sites of different character. BC content ranged from 0.03\% to
   0.47\% (dry weight sediment), reaching a maximum of 9\% of the total
   organic carbon. Cluster analysis indicated strong BC and high molecular
   weight (HMW) PAH association but no relationship was found between BC
   and alkylated PAHs. The ratio C4Ph/BaP was used to verify differences in
   the mobility of alkylated and HMW PAHs along a core from the oil
   contaminated site. Results for the solid-water coefficient of
   distribution (K-d in I kg(-1)) for pyrene were similar using untreated
   sediment samples (log K-d 4.66 +/- 0.03) and chemo-thermal oxidation
   (CTO) residues (log K-d 4.39 +/- 0.03), confirming the importance of BC
   in the partitioning of PAHs. However, the resulting BC-normalized
   distribution coefficients (log K-BC 7.1-7.4 mu g kg(BC)(-1)) were
   greater than published values, probably because of the presence of other
   hydrophobic phases in the refractory organic matter pool. In addition,
   BC normalization of pyrene concentration in mangrove crabs reduced the
   variability in calculated bioaccumulation factors vs. organic
   carbon-normalized concentrations for the sites. The evidence agrees with
   the general view of BC particles controlling the fate of PAHs in
   sediments, but also points out the necessity for studying the process in
   further detail when considering organic matter-rich mangrove sediments.

Volume = {87},

Abstract = {Based on their shell content, the coarse carbonate sands/gravels sampled
   from 13 to 39 m water depth from the Norwegian inner shelf are shown to
   belong to the heterozoan association of James. They are dominated mainly
   by molluscs, polychaetes, cirripeds and foraminifera. Some of the dead
   mollusc species found indicate an origin in shallow water rocky areas
   (Mytilus edulis) and algal and seagrass communities (Rissoa parva). On
   the other hand, other species are typical of an inner shelf (Modiolus
   modiolus). The presence of intertidal/shallow subtidal species on the
   inner shelf (down to 39 m depth) is interpreted as due to transport by
   currents or waves during storm events. Analyses of mollusc shell
   surfaces were also undertaken and show three types of texture:
   unaltered, corroded and polished. The latter two are an alteration of
   the ornament of the shells. The corroded texture is the dominant type on
   the mollusc shells. Another important feature of the mollusc shells is
   the high amount of microboring and in some cases also evidence of
   dissolution. These carbonate sediments are shown to have a complex
   origin, consisting of a mixture of bioclasts from different contemporary
   adjacent environments, and with destruction of bioclasts ranging from
   zero (unaltered texture) to severe (corroded due to microborings and
   dissolution). and with some reworking of older bioclasts into the
   surface sediment layer.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to assess the future wind power potential
   in the Black Sea based on the wind fields provided by the most recent
   regional climate projections achieved in the framework of EURO-CORDEX
   project. The climate change impacts on the wind speed magnitude will
   bring changes in the local wind power generation. From this perspective,
   changes in the wind power potential along the 21st century in some
   reference locations of the Black Sea basin are investigated under the
   RCP4.5 scenario. The recent wind power conditions for a 30-year period
   (1976-2005) are assessed based on the results provided by the same RCM
   (Regional Climate Model) used to generate the future climate projections
   of the wind fields. The impact of the climate change on the future wind
   power potential is evaluated by comparisons between historical data and
   near-future (2021-2050) and more distant future (2071-2100) projections.
   Under the scenario considered, an increase of the mean wind power was
   observed until the middle of the 21st century, followed by a small
   decrease. From the seasonal analysis resulted that, in the reference
   points located on the western side, the projection of the wind energy in
   winter time suggests an increase until the end of the century. On the
   other hand, the linear regressions adjusted to the annual means do not
   indicate a significant trend.},

Title = {Sensitivity of Storm-Induced Hazards in a Highly Curvilinear Coastline
   to Changing Storm Directions. The Tordera Delta Case (NW Mediterranean)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Extreme coastal storms, especially when incident in areas with densely
   urbanized coastlines, are one of the most damaging forms of natural
   disasters. The main hazards originating from coastal storms are
   inundation and erosion, and their magnitude and extent needs to be
   accurately assessed for effective management of coastal risk. The use of
   state-of-art morphodynamic process-based models is becoming standard,
   with most being applied to straight coastlines with gentle slopes. In
   this study, the XBeach model is used to assess the coastal response of a
   curvilinear sensitive deltaic coast with coarse sediment and steep
   slopes (intermediate-reflective conditions). The tested hypothesis is
   that changes in wave direction may cause large variations in the
   magnitude of storm-induced hazards. The model is tested against field
   data available for the Sant Esteve Storm (December 2008), obtaining an
   overall BSS (Brier Skill Score) score on the emerged morphological
   response of 0.68. Later, the 2008 event is used as baseline scenario to
   create synthetic events covering the range from NE to S. The obtained
   results show that storm-induced hazards along a highly curvilinear coast
   are very sensitive to changes in wave direction. Therefore, even under
   climate scenarios of relatively steady storminess, a potential shift in
   wave direction may significantly change hazard conditions and thus, need
   to be accounted for in robust damage risk assessments.},

Title = {Long-term demography and stem productivity of Everglades mangrove
   forests (Florida, USA): Resistance to hurricane disturbance},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {440},
Pages = {79-91},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Mangrove wetlands along coastal regions in neotropical northern
   latitudes are exposed to frequent hurricanes and therefore depend on
   resistant and resilient attributes to persist after these extreme
   events. However, few long-term studies have documented mangrove forest
   dynamics following hurricane disturbance to determine how
   species-specific phenotypic plasticity, species range shifts, and
   environmental stress interact to determine recovery trajectories. We
   present here a comprehensive analysis of Hurricane Wilma's (hereafter,
   ``Wilma{''}) impact (category 3, October 2005) on mangrove forest
   demography and aboveground net productivity in the Everglades, Florida
   (USA). We determined spatiotemporal patterns over a 15-year period (5
   pre- and 10 post-Wilma) in three impacted sites on a productivity
   gradient along the Shark River Estuary. Hurricane resistance was evident
   in the low cumulative tree mortality and long-term recovery from
   defoliation (similar to 10 years). Aboveground standing carbon stocks
   were not significantly reduced, as mortality ranged only from 3 to 10\%.
   A negative linear relationship between Leaf Net Primary Productivity
   (NPPL) and foliar residence time along the estuary shows that an
   increase in foliar production results in shorter residence time, which
   is defined by the interannual variation in NPPL rates and recovery
   periods across sites. We propose this relationship as a proxy of canopy
   recovery in latitudinal comparative studies across mangrove ecotypes and
   coastal settings. This work advances ecological disturbance theory and
   ecological modeling of mangrove forests; specifically, we provide
   quantitative relationships among structural properties and dynamic
   processes to validate agent-based demographic and biogeochemical models
   to forecast the impact of natural and human disturbances on mangrove
   wetlands under climate change.},

Title = {Residents' Attitudes Toward Tourism Development in a Rural Community: A
   Qualitative Approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {90-108},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {In North America, many rural communities with rich amenities have
   experienced increased population, often referred to as ``amenity
   migration?' This type of change theoretically impacts residents'
   attitudes toward tourism development but has not been studied in this
   community context. Thus, the purpose of this study was to use the
   interaction approach to uncover residents' attitudes toward tourism
   development in one rural community experiencing amenity migration. The
   interaction approach has been commonly used to address residents'
   response to ``...place relevant matters{''} (Bridger et al., 2010, p.
   2). However, it has rarely been used to address tourism development in
   rural communities within North America, and never with residents
   experiencing amenity migration as well as ongoing tourism development.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 residents of three
   communities in Tucker County, West Virginia. Participant observation and
   secondary data collection were also employed. Results indicated
   residents had positive (i.e., an increase in economic development, more
   recreation opportunities, and positive social interactions); negative
   (i.e., exploitation and type of job growth, and housing issues); and
   ambivalent attitudes toward tourism development in Tucker County.
   Residents' ambivalence focused on the future of tourism development and
   what impacts it will have on their communities. The impacts they
   addressed ranged from increased prices for housing, to changes in
   community dynamics, to protection of the culture and character of the
   County.
   The results associated with positive and negative attitudes toward
   tourism development were generally in line with the literature. The
   introduction of ambivalent attitudes, however, was unexpected and a
   contribution to the literature. Further, most residents recognized
   amenity migration as having a positive effect on the area; this may
   change as tourism development and the influx of new residents continues.
   Using an interactional approach to uncover residents' attitudes toward
   tourism development proved successful as residents' ambivalence, focus
   on the need for collaboration and controlled growth in the future, and
   more would not have been uncovered using traditional quantitative
   measures. Scholars should continue to use this approach to study
   residents' attitudes toward tourism development and use their results to
   inform community officials, lawmakers, and advocacy groups who are
   advocating for sustainable tourism development in rural communities
   throughout North America.},

   acid (FA) composition of pikeperch larvae. From day 10 to day 34
   posthatching (p.h.), larvae were fed with three isoproteic and
   isolipidic microdiets. The best results of growth and skeletal
   development were related to a high phospholipid level regardless of
   their origin and FA profile. Jaw deformities seemed associated with high
   dietary highly unsaturated FA (HUFA) level. The optimal level of
   eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA + DHA) for pikeperch
   larvae appeared to be around 12 g kg-1 (dry matter) associated with a PL
   level around 90 g kg-1. FA composition of diets and larvae revealed a
   better incorporation of arachidonic acid, EPA and DHA into PL fraction
   especially in larvae fed with soybean PL. Moreover, 34-day-old pikeperch
   larvae may have capability of converting 18 carbon n-3 FA into the n-3
   HUFA. Hence, for pikeperch larvae, PL from plant origin were as
   efficient as those from marine fish origin.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric PM pollution from traffic comprises not only direct
   emissions but also non-exhaust emissions because resuspension of road
   dust that can produce high human exposure to heavy metals, metalloids,
   and mineral matter. A key task for establishing mitigation or preventive
   measures is estimating the contribution of road dust resuspension to the
   atmospheric PM mixture. Several source apportionment studies, applying
   receptor modeling at urban background sites, have shown the difficulty
   in identifying a road dust source separately from other mineral sources
   or vehicular exhausts. The Multilinear Engine (ME-2) is a computer
   program that can solve the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) problem.
   ME-2 uses a programming language permitting the solution to be guided
   toward some possible targets that can be derived from a priori knowledge
   of sources (chemical profile, ratios, etc.). This feature makes it
   especially suitable for source apportionment studies where partial
   knowledge of the sources is available.
   In the present study ME-2 was applied to data from an urban background
   site of Barcelona (Spain) to quantify the contribution of road dust
   resuspension to PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. Given that recently the
   emission profile of local resuspended road dust was obtained (Amato, F,
   Pandolfi, M., Viana, M., Querol, X., Alastuey, A., Moreno, T., 2009.
   Spatial and chemical patterns of PM10 in road dust deposited in urban
   environment. Atmospheric Environment 43 (9),1650-1659), such a priori
   information was introduced in the model as auxiliary terms of the object
   function to be minimized by the implementation of the so-called
   ``pulling equations{''}.
   ME-2 permitted to enhance the basic PMF solution (obtained by PMF2)
   identifying, beside the seven sources of PMF2, the road dust source
   which accounted for 6.9 mu g m(-3) (17\%) in PM10, 2.2 mu g m(-3) (8\%)
   of PM2.5 and 0.3 mu g m(-3) (2\%) of PM1. This reveals that resuspension
   was responsible of the 37\%, 15\% and 3\% of total traffic emissions
   respectively in PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. Therefore the overall traffic
   contribution resulted in 18 mu g m(-3) (46\%) in PM10, 14 mu g m(-3)
   (51\%) in PM2.5 and 8 mu g m(-3) (48\%) in PM1. In PMF2 this mass
   explained by road dust resuspension was redistributed among the rest of
   sources, increasing mostly the mineral, secondary nitrate and aged sea
   salt contributions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To explore the relationship between molluscan species diversity and
   selected environmental variables along a fjord gradient, we took 2
   replicate samples with an epibenthic sledge at 10 localities along a
   transect from the Norwegian Trough to the inner parts of a fjord system.
   The Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') of 65 species decreased markedly from
   offshore to the innermost stations; there were fewer but more abundant
   species in the fjords than offshore. Diversity was positively correlated
   to sill depth, and negatively correlated to distance to `species pool'
   (= recruitment area), C/N, and \% carbon in the surface sediment.
   TWINSPAN, a numerical classification method, divided the mollusc fauna
   into 3 groups: (I) offshore, (II) outer fjord, and (III) inner fjord
   fauna. The relation between the faunal pattern and 15 environmental
   variables was analysed with Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The
   environmental variables that explained most of the variance between
   species in the CCA were sill depth, distance to `species pool', C/N, \%
   C, \% loss on ignition, and median phi-size (phi), and together these
   variables accounted for 74 \% of the variance in the species data. Four
   hypothetical explanations are offered as to why the diversity of the
   deep fjord fauna of molluscs and amphipods is low compared to adjacent
   offshore areas. The 2 most likely explanations are that the sediment
   habitat (i.e. food resources, measured as C/N, and grain size) may be
   more diverse offshore than in fjords, and that the higher influx of
   organic matter in fjords, measured as \% carbon in the sediment, may
   favour the dominance of a few opportunistic species.},

Abstract = {Viruses contribute to the mortality of marine microbes, consequentially
   altering biological species composition and system biogeochemistry.
   Although it is well established that host cells provide metabolic
   resources for virus replication, the extent to which infection reshapes
   host metabolism at a global level and the effect of this alteration on
   the cellular material released following viral lysis is less understood.
   To address this knowledge gap, the growth dynamics, metabolism and
   extracellular lysate of roseophage-infected Sulfitobacter sp. 2047 was
   studied using a variety of techniques, including liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics.
   Quantitative estimates of the total amount of carbon and nitrogen
   sequestered into particulate biomass indicate that phage infection
   redirects B75\% of nutrients into virions. Intracellular concentrations
   for 82 metabolites were measured at seven time points over the infection
   cycle. By the end of this period, 71\% of the detected metabolites were
   significantly elevated in infected populations, and stable isotope-based
   flux measurements showed that these cells had elevated metabolic
   activity. In contrast to simple hypothetical models that assume that
   extracellular compounds increase because of lysis, a profile of
   metabolites from infected cultures showed that 470\% of the 56
   quantified compounds had decreased concentrations in the lysate relative
   to uninfected controls, suggesting that these small, labile nutrients
   were being utilized by surviving cells. These results indicate that
   virus-infected cells are physiologically distinct from their uninfected
   counterparts, which has implications for microbial community ecology and
   biogeochemistry.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Underway measurements of the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and the
   sea surface temperature were made in the northwestern Arabian Sea during
   late intermonsoon and southwest (SW) monsoon 1997. Additionally,
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity were analyzed from
   the surface and deeper waters. CO2 fluxes between atmosphere and ocean
   surface were estimated. Monsoon-forced changes in the near-surface
   carbonate system became clearly visible a few weeks after onset of the
   SW monsoon. Because of the upwelling of CO2-rich waters along the Omani
   coast, DIC and pCO(2) locally increased up to 2210 mumol kg(-1) and 715
   muatm, respectively. The Arabian Sea thus acted as a CO2 source during
   SW monsoon. Highest CO2 fluxes of >150 mmol m(-2) d(-1) were observed in
   the upwelling region off Oman, while the open Arabian Sea revealed
   relatively lower CO2 fluxes but contributed more to the overall CO2
   release because of its larger area. Total CO2 emissions from the Arabian
   Sea from May until August 1997 are estimated to amount 67.6 Tg C. The
   upwelling-induced impacts of biological activity on the carbon cycle
   were estimated by tracing freshly upwelled water along its transport way
   along the sea surface. The obtained CO2 uptake by enhanced net community
   production (NCP) is similar to3.6 times higher than the CO2 emissions.
   In contrast to phosphate, upwelled nitrate apparently is consumed by NCP
   within a timescale of some 10 days, and the upwelling thus does not
   directly supply the central Arabian Sea with nitrate.},

Title = {Temperature Across Vegetation Canopy-Water-Soil Interfaces Is Modulated
   by Hydroperiod and Extreme Weather in Coastal Wetlands},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Environmental temperature is a widely used variable to describe weather
   and climate conditions. The use of temperature anomalies to identify
   variations in climate and weather systems makes temperature a key
   variable to evaluate not only climate variability but also shifts in
   ecosystem structural and functional properties. In contrast to
   terrestrial ecosystems, the assessment of regional temperature anomalies
   in coastal wetlands is more complex since the local temperature is
   modulated by hydrology and weather. Thus, it is unknown how the regional
   free-air temperature (T-Free) is coupled to local temperature anomalies,
   which can vary across interfaces among vegetation canopy, water, and
   soil that modify the wetland microclimate regime. Here, we investigated
   the temperature differences (offsets) at those three interfaces in
   mangrove-saltmarsh ecotones in coastal Louisiana and South Florida in
   the northern Gulf of Mexico (2017-2019). We found that the canopy offset
   (range: 0.2-1.6 degrees C) between T-Free and below-canopy temperature
   (T-Canopy) was caused by the canopy buffering effect. The similar offset
   values in both Louisiana and Florida underscore the role of vegetation
   in regulating near-ground energy fluxes. Overall, the inundation depth
   did not influence soil temperature (T-Soil). The interaction between
   frequency and duration of inundation, however, significantly modulated
   T-Soil given the presence of water on the wetland soil surface, thus
   attenuating any short- or long-term changes in the T-Canopy and T-Free.
   Extreme weather events-including cold fronts and tropical
   cyclones-induced high defoliation and weakened canopy buffering,
   resulting in long-term changes in canopy or soil offsets. These results
   highlight the need to measure simultaneously the interaction between
   ecological and climatic processes to reduce uncertainty when modeling
   macro- and microclimate in coastal areas under a changing climate,
   especially given the current local temperature anomalies data scarcity.
   This work advances the coupling of Earth system models to climate models
   to forecast regional and global climate change and variability along
   coastal areas.},

Title = {The European Earth monitoring (GMES) programme: Status and perspectives},

Abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is the most
   ambitious operational Earth Observation programme to date and will
   provide global, timely and easily accessible information in application
   domains such as land, marine, atmosphere, emergency response, climate
   change and security.
   To accomplish this, the European Union (EU)-led GMES programme comprises
   three components namely the space component, the in-situ component and
   the service component. The space component, led by ESA, is in its
   pre-operational stage, serving users with satellite data acquired by the
   so called ``GMES Contributing Missions{''} already available today or
   planned at European, national and international level. It will become
   operational once the dedicated space infrastructure, comprised by the
   ``Sentinel{''} missions and their corresponding ground segments are
   operational. The first of these satellite series will be launched in
   2013. The Sentinel missions will provide a unique set of observations
   utilising different techniques spanning C-band SAR, mid to medium
   resolution optical and thermal observations with increased spectral
   resolution, altimeter and dedicated spectrometers for atmospheric
   chemistry.
   This data, combined with in-situ data, some assimilated into models,
   will then be turned into services for monitoring the environment, the
   climate and for security related issues.
   The GMES Space Component (GSC) is organised in two overlapping phases:
   the development phase and the operational phase, the latter planned to
   start in 2014. The main challenge is now to ensure the programme's
   long-term sustainability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {COMPOSITION AND GENESIS OF TEMPERATE, SHALLOW-MARINE CARBONATE MUDS:
   SPENCER GULF, SOUTH AUSTRALIA},

Number = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The origin of carbonate muds (grain sizes, 63 mm) in shallow,
   nontropical marine environments is poorly documented. Coarse-grained
   carbonates often characterize coastal temperate seafloors, but many such
   deposits also have abundant carbonate muds. Spencer Gulf, a large,
   shallow embayment along the southern Australian margin (< 60 m water
   depth), contains mixtures of carbonate gravels, sands, and muds, with
   muds constituting up to 84\% volumetrically. Benthic environments
   include dense seagrass meadows, sand barrens, and rhodolith pavements
   where bivalves, benthic foraminifera, coralline algae, and bryozoans
   dominate heterozoan carbonate assemblages. Mud grain morphologies were
   investigated using scanning electron microscopy, leading to the
   conclusion that muds are predominantly composed of skeletal fragments
   (bivalves, benthic foraminifera, ascidians, echinoderms, and coralline
   algae), interpreted to have formed due to breakdown of rigid material
   via maceration. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms that these muds
   contain combinations of intermediate-Mg calcite, low-Mg calcite, and
   aragonite; with concentrations varying among locations according to
   skeletal grain types. Spencer Gulf muds differ in mineralogy and
   composition from those of classic models of tropical and deep-water
   carbonate mud deposition. Unlike shallow-water, tropical carbonate muds,
   these temperate muds are not dominated by aragonite and there is no
   evidence of carbonate precipitation from seawater. Pelagic organisms
   contribute only trivial amounts to these deposits, in contrast to
   deep-water muds.},

Title = {Life on the edge: environmental determinants of tilefish (Lopholatilus
   chamaeleonticeps) abundance since its virtual extinction in 1882},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {71},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2371-2378},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Unlike many temperate marine species that alter spatial or depth
   distributions in response to environmental change, tilefish
   (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps) has such specific habitat requirements
   that off the coast of New England, USA, it is restricted to the normally
   warm-water, upper continental shelf slope, where it excavates and
   occupies burrows. In 1882, tens of millions of adult tilefish died
   suddenly following the intrusion of lethally cold Subarctic water into
   the tilefish habitat. Here we show that the same climate driver
   implicated in the 1882 event (the North Atlantic Oscillation: NAO) has
   also affected commercial tilefish landings throughout most of the 20th
   century by altering slope water temperatures and likely the tilefish's
   reproductive success. We also show that this temperature-landings
   relationship broke down in the 1970s coincident with dramatically
   increased exploitation. Reconstructions of decadal to millennial scale
   variations in slope water temperatures explain why no mass mortality
   occurred following the 2010 negative NAO anomaly, despite being similar
   in magnitude to the NAO anomaly that preceded the 1882 event.},

Abstract = {This paper is about offshore/onshore wind systems under energy 4.0. A
   consideration is taken to account for the action of the floating motion
   given by the stiffness torque acting on the drive-train. The drive-train
   incorporates the dynamics of the floating platform and tower, resulting
   from the motion of the surface due to the marine wave perturbation. The
   performance of the multiple point clamped five-level converter is
   considered mainly from electrical power perspective. The simulation
   considers a blade pitch control fault causing an instantaneous cutoff on
   the capture of the wind energy to unveil the impact on the systems
   performance. Particularly, the fault influence on the behavior of the
   voltages in the capacitor banks is mitigated by selection of the
   suitable vectors. The multiple point clamped five-level converter with
   the conveniently proposed control strategy is able to recover normal
   operation after fault clearing.},

Abstract = {An increasing use of submarine power cables is found in dynamic
   applications such as floating wind, floating wave and tidal generation
   technologies. These applications substantially differ from common
   applications, such as floating oil and gas installations in that they
   are more dynamic. Power cables that cross the water column, so-called
   umbilicals will be exposed to considerable extreme and fatigue loads
   mainly induced by the motion of the device, incident waves and tidal
   current. The actual loading regimes of dynamic submarine power cables in
   operation are not well understood for marine renewable energy (MRE)
   applications due to a lack of field experience. The cable design has to
   consider a combination of cable geometry, hydrodynamic parameters,
   suitable layout configuration, suitable ancillary systems (e.g. bend
   stiffeners) in relation to the environmental site conditions.
   This paper evaluates the influence of the environmental conditions and
   the cable design parameters on the mechanical loads and potential
   failure modes of a dynamic submarine power cable attached to a dynamic
   floating body in form of a generic point absorber. One notable result is
   the large effect of the tidal direction, even in relatively moderate
   flow conditions. The full range of tidal flow conditions should be
   considered in the power cable design to ensure that the cable MBR is not
   exceeded in any conditions. The shown configurations also give some
   insight into the possible variations of the geometric cable
   configuration. A well balanced S-curve shape yields some of the best
   results and achieves a good load distribution along the cable and the
   transition points, whilst avoiding cable compression. The design
   challenge for the cable configuration is to maintain the S-shape for as
   many environmental and device response modes as possible in order to
   achieve high reliability. This paper will be useful for cable, device
   and site developers of floating MRE to inform the selection of the most
   suitable cable design.},

Abstract = {Soil microorganisms determine the fate of soil organic matter (SOM), and
   their activities compose a major component of the global carbon (C)
   cycle. We employed a multisubstrate, DNA-stable isotope probing
   experiment to track bacterial assimilation of C derived from distinct
   sources that varied in bioavailability. This approach allowed us to
   measure microbial contributions to SOM processing by measuring the C
   assimilation dynamics of diverse microorganisms as they interacted
   within soil. We identified and tracked 1,286 bacterial taxa that
   assimilated C-13 in an agricultural soil over a period of 48 d. Overall
   C-13-assimilation dynamics of bacterial taxa, defined by the source and
   timing of the C-13 they assimilated, exhibited low phylogenetic
   conservation. We identified bacterial guilds composed of taxa that had
   similar C-13 assimilation dynamics. We show that C-source
   bioavailability explained significant variation in both C mineralization
   dynamics and guild structure, and that the growth dynamics of bacterial
   guilds differed significantly in response to C addition. We also
   demonstrate that the guild structure explains significant variation in
   the biogeographical distribution of bacteria at continental and global
   scales. These results suggest that an understanding of in situ growth
   dynamics is essential for understanding microbial contributions to soil
   C cycling. We interpret these findings in the context of bacterial life
   history strategies and their relationship to terrestrial C cycling.},

Abstract = {Belgrade is the capital city of Serbia located southwardly from the
   rivers Sava and Danube on the final part of ``Sumadija region crest{''},
   i.e. ``Belgrade cape{''}. Wider area of Belgrade relief is at the
   absolute altitude of approximately 70 in above sea level.
   Geologic composition of the terrain thereof over basic mountain chain is
   composed of cohesive clastic sediments and carbonate-limestone, with
   subordinated presence of metamorphites - serpentinites and with drifts
   of volcanite - andesites and dacites of Jurassic and Cretaceous age.
   Almost entire area of Belgrade is covered by Quaternary alluvial,
   marshy, proluvial-diluvial and eolian sediments. Differing
   chronsotratographic and lithofacies units are brought into same
   hypsometric level by numerous faults, thus making even more complex
   geotechnical conditions for the construction of transportation tunnels.
   This paper is presenting briefly spatial distribution of Belgrade area
   in accordance with geotechnical conditions of previous and forthcoming
   construction of transportation tunnels, applied methods of excavation
   and improvement of resistance - deformation properties of rock masses.},

Title = {Surrogate optimization of coupled energy sources in a desalination
   microgrid based on solar PV and wind energy},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {500},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {This paper proposes the use of new software called DesalinationPlant to
   solve the convoluted issue of calculating nominal capacities for an
   electric-to-water micro-grid comprised by an inexhaustible distributed
   energy resources; a decentralized storage system, and; a seawater
   desalination system. For this task, DesalinationPlant will use global
   stochastic black-box methods to optimize the amount of distributed
   resources and decentralized batteries coupled to a water desalination
   system. The final aim of this optimization is to maximize the profits of
   renewable micro-grid. DesalinationPlant is able to model very complex
   engineering systems, obtaining a feasible optimum in a limited time due
   to the small volume of evaluations needed to come to an optimum result.
   In this article, a complete desalination system associated with a
   photovoltaic plant, a wind power plant, electrochemical storage and a
   connection to the electric network was modeled to optimize the sizing of
   the distributed renewable resources. The optimization produces useful
   ``optimal{''} values of the objective function, very ``expensive{''} per
   se, in less than 100 evaluations. Therefore, it can be concluded that
   the method used, the DYCORS method is an excellent alternative to other
   black-box optimization methods such as genetic algorithms.},

Title = {The Oregon Nearshore Research Inventory project: The importance of
   science and the scientific community as stakeholders in marine spatial
   planning},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {290-298},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The purpose of Oregon's Nearshore Research Inventory (NRI) project was
   to understand the geographic use of ocean space by the marine science
   community in order to include the information in Oregon's marine spatial
   planning (MSP) process. Spatial data and attributes about the geographic
   use of Oregon's ocean and coast by marine scientists were inventoried
   and mapped; including information about the geographic distribution of
   research, research timelines, and the people and institutions that
   conduct scientific research. The results of the NRI interviews show that
   the scientific community conducts research in twenty percent of the
   nearshore grid cells used in the Oregon's Territorial Sea amendment
   process. These results show that ocean space is used by the scientific
   community, and therefore, should be recognized as a use of ocean space
   in the MSP process.
   As new uses, such as wave energy extraction, are proposed along
   coastlines and in the ocean, MSP can be used as a tool to reduce
   conflict and find compatible uses of ocean and coastal space. A major
   benefit of the scientific community's use of ocean and coastal space is
   that it results in data that can be used to inform ecosystem-based
   management decisions. Interruptions in long-term scientific research and
   monitoring as a result of ocean space use conflicts could limit the
   availability of information for use in future management decisions.
   While considering tradeoffs in the MSP process, decision makers need to
   recognize and account for the value of scientific space as a use of the
   ocean. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Application of the generic DPSIR framework to seagrass communities of

Note = {12th International Coastal Symposium (ICS), Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine
   Sci \& Engn, Coastal Proc Res Grp, Plymouth, ENGLAND, APR 09-12, 2013},
Abstract = {Seagrasses are rooted flowering plants, forming dense and highly
   productive meadows in transitional and coastal waters, which assure
   major functions and services contributing to the ecosystems health.
   However, the increased decline and fragmentation of seagass meadows lead
   to the loss of the associated benefits. In Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon
   (Portugal), seagrass meadows showed a marked decline during the past
   three decades. In this context, the DPSIR framework
   (Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Response) arises as an useful tool for
   environmental assessments. The objective of this study was to apply the
   DPSIR conceptual model to the seagrass communities in the Ria de Aveiro
   lagoon, to identify the main drivers, pressures, state and impacts
   resulting in its decline. Lastly, it was intended to propose possible
   management responses towards the maintenance of the functions and
   services provided by the seagrass communities in the Ria de Aveiro. This
   framework provided an integrated view of the past-present information
   considering the background data available. The results obtained by the
   application of the DPSIR framework to the seagyass communities of Ria de
   Aveiro lagoon structured the existing data from the point of view of a
   multiple-effect chain, and it was suggested that seagrasses decline in
   this coastal system have been mainly due to anthropogenic pressures. In
   conclusion, this work is a relevant contribution from an
   ecological-scientific perspective of seagrass meadows in the Ria de
   Aveiro lagoon, with succinct information potentially useful to be
   integrated in management tools applied to the overall coastal lagoon.},

Abstract = {The efficient conversion of solar energy into heat for steam generation
   has been regarded as a promising strategy toward energy harvesting and
   water desalination. While many efforts have been devoted to metal- and
   carbon-based solar thermal systems, concern has arisen that the
   development of high-performance solar steam devices is still largely
   limited by the high cost, inflexibility, redundant fabrication process,
   and low photothermal efficiency. In this work, we report the direct
   fabrication of flexible and robust polymeric composites for highly
   efficient solar steam generation simply based on two kinds of
   inexpensive and popularly used polymers, polyaniline (PANI) and
   hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The resulting PANI@PVDF
   composite devices demonstrate stretchable, durable, and tunable
   photothermal energy conversion features, which could achieve the
   excellent evaporation rate of 1.41 kg m(-2) h(-1) with a high steam
   generation efficiency of 85.0\% under 1 sun illumination. The PANI@PVDF
   devices also exhibit superb durable evaporation performance over 40
   cycles, with a high long-term desalination effect for seawater. This
   work may offer the opportunity for addressing the current material
   design challenges that typically limit the practical fabrication of
   inexpensive, flexible, and robust composites toward solar steam
   generation and seawater desalination.},

Abstract = {The upper part of the Middle Coniacian/Santonian-Middle Campanian
   deep-water Dol Formation of the island of Brac is composed of countless
   fine-grained allodapic intercalations deposited in an intraplatform
   trough. Within the studied section 13 beds can be distinguished, each
   defined by its lower part built up of dark grey limestone with abundance
   of branched, horizontally to subhorizontally oriented burrows, and the
   upper part, in which the light grey to white limestone contains larger
   burrows, rarely branched, showing no preferential orientation. The
   lower, dark grey, intensively bioturbated levels are interpreted as
   intervals formed during high-frequency sea-level highstands, while the
   upper, light grey-to-white levels are interpreted as intervals formed
   during the high-frequency sea-level lowstands. Cyclic alternation of
   these two intervals within the fine-grained allodapic beds is
   interpreted as the interaction between the amount of carbonate
   production on the platform margin and the periodicity and intensity of
   shedding and deposition in the distal part of toe-of-slope environment,
   which is governed by Milankovitch-band high frequency sea-level changes.},

Title = {Energy management of a microgrid using demand response strategy

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-100},
Abstract = {Microgrid is an effective means of integrating multiple energy sources
   of distributed energy to improve the economy, stability and security of
   the energy systems. A typical microgrid consists of Renewable Energy
   Source (RES), Controllable Thermal Units (CTU), Energy Storage System
   (ESS), interruptible and uninterruptible loads. From the perspective of
   the generation, the microgrid should be operated at the minimum
   operating cost, whereas from the perspective of demand, the energy cost
   imposed on the consumer should be minimum. The main key in controlling
   the relationship of microgrid with the utility grid is managing the
   demand. An Energy Management System (EMS) is required to have real time
   control over the demand and the Distributed Energy Resources (DER).
   Demand Side Management (DSM) assesses the actual demand in the microgrid
   to integrate different energy resources distributed within the grid.
   With these motivations towards the operation of a microgrid and also to
   achieve the objective of minimizing the total expected operating cost,
   the DER schedules are optimized for meeting the loads. Demand Response
   (DR) a part of DSM is integrated with MG islanded mode operation by
   using Time of Use (TOU) and Real Time Pricing (RTP) procedures. Both TOU
   and RTP are used for shifting the controllable loads. RES is used for
   generator side cost reduction and load shifting using DR performs the
   load side control by reducing the peak to average ratio. Four different
   cases with and without the PV, wind uncertainties and ESS are analyzed
   with Demand Response and Unitcommittment (DRUC) strategy. The Strawberry
   (SBY) algorithm is used for obtaining the minimum operating cost and to
   achieve better energy management of the Microgrid.},

Title = {Energy transfers in internal tide generation, propagation and
   dissipation in the deep ocean},
Journal = {OCEAN MODELLING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {22-40},
Abstract = {The energy transfers associated with internal tide (IT) generation by a
   semi-diurnal surface tidal wave impinging on a supercritical
   meridionally uniform deep ocean ridge on the f-plane, and subsequent
   IT-propagation are analysed using the Boussinesq, free-surface,
   terrain-following ocean model Symphonie. The energy diagnostics are
   explicitly based on the numerical formulation of the governing
   equations, permitting a globally conservative, high-precision analysis
   of all physical and numerical/artificial energy transfers in a
   sub-domain with open lateral boundaries. The net primary energy balances
   are quantified using a moving average of length two tidal periods in a
   simplified control simulation using a single time-step, minimal
   diffusion, and a no-slip sea floor. This provides the basis for analysis
   of enhanced vertical and horizontal diffusion and a free-slip bottom
   boundary condition. After a four tidal period spin-up, the tidally
   averaged (net) primary energy balance in the generation region,
   extending +/-20 km from the ridge crest, shows that the surface tidal
   wave loses approximately C = 720 W/m or 0.3\% of the mean surface tidal
   energy flux (2.506 x 10(5) W/m) in traversing the ridge. This
   corresponds mainly to the barotropicto-baroclinic energy conversion due
   to stratified flow interaction with sloping topography. Combined with a
   normalised net advective flux of baroclinic potential energy of 0.9 x C
   this causes a net local baroclinic potential energy gain of 0.72 x C and
   a conversion into baroclinic kinetic energy through the baroclinic
   buoyancy term of 1.18 x C. Tidally averaged, about 1.14 x C is radiated
   into the abyssal ocean through the total baroclinic flux of internal
   pressure associated with the IT- and background density field. This
   total baroclinic pressure flux is therefore not only determined by the
   classic linear surface-to-internal tide conversion, but also by the net
   advection of baroclinic (background) potential energy, indicating the
   importance of local processes other than linear IT-motion. In the
   propagation region (PR), integrated over the areas between 20 and 40 km
   from the ridge crest, the barotropic and baroclinic tide are decoupled.
   The net incoming total baroclinic pressure flux is balanced by local
   potential energy gain and outward baroclinic flux of potential energy
   associated with the total baroclinic density. The primary net energy
   balances are robust to changes in the vertical diffusion coefficient,
   whereas relatively weak horizontal diffusion significantly reduces the
   outward IT energy flux. Diapycnal mixing due to vertical diffusion
   causes an available potential energy loss of about 1\% of the total
   domain-averaged potential energy gain, which matches k(m)-1/k(m) rho
   0KVN2 to within 0.5\%, for k(m) linearly distributed grid-levels and
   constant background density rho(0), vertical diffusivity (K-V) and
   buoyancy frequency (N). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Multilevel converters have seen an increasing popularity in the last
   decades, due to the increased power ratings, improved power quality, low
   switching losses, and reduced Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Among
   them, the most popular ones are the Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) and the
   Flying Capacitor (FC) inverter topologies. Different derivatives of the
   NPC and FC are prevalent in the literature for various applications.
   However, the main drawback of the NPC and FC topologies is the high
   dc-link voltage, which has to be more than twice of the grid peak
   voltage for grid integration. Therefore, a front-end boost dc-dc
   converter is normally required before the inverter, which decreases the
   overall efficiency of the system. Single-stage dc-ac power converters
   with boost capabilities offer an interesting alternative compared to the
   two-stage approach. Considering this aspect, a novel 5-Level three-phase
   boost type inverter is introduced in this paper for general-purpose
   applications (e.g. rolling mills, fans, pumps, marine appliances,
   mining, tractions, and most prominently grid-connected renewable energy,
   etc.) which reduces the dc-link voltage requirement to half of the
   conventional 5-Level NPC, ANPC and 5-Level FC family. Whilst reducing
   the dc-link voltage requirement, the number of active and passive
   components are also reduced. The principle of operation and theoretical
   analysis supported by key simulation and experimental waveforms of a 1.5
   kW prototype are presented to prove the concept of the proposed
   5L-Boost-ANPC inverter.},

Title = {Simultaneous depolymerization and fermentation of lignin into

Journal = {ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Biodegradation of lignin has been focused on bacteria and fungi, but
   little information is available on lignin biotransformation with marine
   protists. In this paper, kraft pine lignin was used as a carbon source
   for a newly recognized and patented lignin degrader, Thraustochytrium
   striatum HB. The fermentation medium was optimized in terms of nitrogen
   source and trace elements. The results showed NH4Cl was the best
   nitrogen source to enhance lignin consumption from 3 (for yeast extract
   or peptone) to 17\%, while the utilization of yeast extract or peptone
   was found to inhibit lignin consumption by T. striatum HB. The presence
   of trace elements and vitamins improved lignin utilization from 17 to
   25\% by inducing the production of lignolytic enzymes. Different lignin
   depolymerization methods, including laccase, fungal secretome and Fenton
   reagent were used to enhance lignin fermentation. In the presence of
   laccase, both cell growth and lignin consumption were improved, and it
   was found that different laccases had different working mechanisms.
   Enzymatic depolymerization resulted in 25-30\% lignin degradation,
   slightly higher than that (22\%) from Fenton reagent. NMR analysis
   indicated that the fungus-derived laccase primarily worked on the
   breakdown of inter-unit linkages in lignin molecules, while
   plant-derived laccase possibly attacked the aromatic ring structures.
   With the function of laccase, more lowmolecular-weight lignin fragments
   can be generated, and laccase-catalyzing reaction would direct the
   equilibrium toward depolymerization by preventing repolymerization of
   small fragments. On the contrary, lignin peroxidase-dominant fungal
   secretome and Fenton reagent facilitated lignin degradation but not cell
   growth, possibly due to the generation of inhibitory compounds from
   lignin depolymerization by fungal secretome and Fenton reagent. The
   results from this research demonstrate that marine protists, such as T.
   striatum HB are a class of promising platform microorganisms for lignin
   valorization into valuable bioproducts.},

Title = {Past and present potential of the Adriatic deep sea sediments to produce
   methane hydrates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {2724-2732},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose There is a growing understanding that methane hydrates (MHs)
   distributed globally in permafrost and deep sea sediments present an
   enormous unconventional reservoir of methane (CH4); however, there is
   also increasing concern about their role in the global climate change.
   The study focuses on the evaluation of the environmental conditions in
   the deep Adriatic Sea during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21.5-18.3 ka
   BP) and presently with respect to MHs potential occurrence.
   Materials and methods The MHs phase stability diagram was calculated in
   order to evaluate the methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) by using the
   Croatian Legacy Data and the digital bathymetry map of the Adriatic Sea
   obtained from the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency (CHA). Environmental data
   from different surveys published in the scientific literature were used
   to assess the environmental conditions in the deep Adriatic Sea during
   the LGM and present. The sea level rise of 100 m since the end of the
   LGM was taken into consideration. The volume of methane in place (MIP)
   as an estimation of the amount of CH4 stored in MHs deposits at standard
   conditions of pressure and temperature (SPT, T-0 = 273.15 K, P-0 =
   0.101325 MPa) was calculated by using combined gas law V-SPT = (PxV/T) x
   (T-SPT/P-SPT).
   Results and discussion Evaluation of the MHs phase stability diagram for
   the Adriatic Sea in present environmental conditions has revealed that
   MHs are exactly at the boundary of stability. This has been calculated
   for the potential temperature of 13 degrees C, the salinity of 3.87\%
   (data measured at the E2-M3A deep ocean observatory of the Southern
   Adriatic), and the average geothermal gradient of 17 degrees C km(-1)
   reported in the literature and verified by the Croatian Legacy Data of
   CHA. According to the published literature, LGM deep sea temperature was
   2-4 degrees C lower and seawater was saltier. Consequently, the
   estimation of MHSZ during the LGM taking into consideration the
   temperature of 10 degrees C and salinity of 3.98\% revealed a potential
   deposit of methane in place ( MIP) of more than 415 x 10(9) m(3), the
   majority of which probably dissociated in the sea/atmosphere system in
   the last 18 ka.
   Conclusions The results have shown that MHs reservoir in the deep sea
   Adriatic basin shows boundary instability for MHs occurrence which might
   be of importance for studying the role of MHs in climate change. Further
   research is needed as follows: (1) thermodynamic modeling in order to
   understand if the MHs dissociation is concluded; and (2) in the case of
   the transient condition, seismic data analysis in order to reveal the
   presence of a relic bottom simulating reflection.},

Abstract = {Bacteria possessing ACC deaminase activity reduce the level of stress
   ethylene conferring resistance and stimulating growth of plants under
   various biotic and abiotic stresses. The present study aims at isolating
   efficient ACC deaminase producing PGPR strains from the rhizosphere of
   rice plants grown in coastal saline soils and quantifying the effect of
   potent PGPR isolates on rice seed germination and seedling growth under
   salinity stress and ethylene production from rice seedlings inoculated
   with ACC deaminase containing PGPR.
   Soils from root region of rice growing in coastal soils of varying
   salinity were used for isolating ACC deaminase producing bacteria and
   three bacterial isolates were identified following polyphasic taxonomy.
   Seed germination, root growth and stress ethylene production in rice
   seedlings following inoculation with selected PGPR under salt stress
   were quantified.
   Inoculation with selected PGPR isolates had considerable positive
   impacts on different growth parameters of rice including germination
   percentage, shoot and root growth and chlorophyll content as compared to
   uninoculated control. Inoculation with the ACC deaminase producing
   strains reduced ethylene production under salinity stress.
   This study demonstrates the effectiveness of rhizobacteria containing
   ACC deaminase for enhancing salt tolerance and consequently improving
   the growth of rice plants under salt-stress conditions.},

Abstract = {Cold Ironing (CI) is increasingly becoming more practiced to reduce air
   pollution emissions of ships as well as technical challenges, e.g., grid
   limitation capacity at ports. Large Cruise Ships represent the most
   energy requiring ship type that a commercial port can host, powering
   them from shore represent so a great challenge. Port of Civitavecchia is
   one of the world's most visited by Cruise Ships and soon will be
   requiring a CI infrastructure. Cruise Ships CI may need power up to 14
   MW and the port's grid can only supply a max of 6 MW coming from its
   most powerful Point of Delivery (POD). To avoid the installation of
   another substation the possibility of installing a high power and high
   energy ESS is researched. The aim of this paper is to determine the main
   characteristics of a grid-scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)
   that can be installed in the Port of Civitavecchia to power Cruise Ships
   CI. The port's grid will be studied with the introduction of the new
   BESS the existing and additional Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and its
   performance will be analyzed with the help of an Energy Management
   Simulation Software (EMSS).},

Title = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management (or `triple bottom line')
   assessments of the western rock lobster resource: Is there an optimal
   target for fishing?},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {264-274},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is often termed triple
   bottom line because it takes into account ecological, economic and
   social criteria. Effective implementation of EBFM requires development
   of appropriate governance structures for decision-making processes and
   management, so governance effectiveness and efficiency can be regarded
   as the fourth element in a `quadruple bottom line.' Few fisheries have
   explicitly considered all four criteria within their resource
   assessments and harvest strategies. Furthermore, as some of these
   objectives may be in competition (e.g. employment levels, profit), a
   simultaneous evaluation of these criteria is required to identify the
   optimal level of fishing to deliver the best overall community outcome.
   The western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus, resource in Western
   Australia is used as an EBFM case study by evaluating: sustainability of
   target species and effects on ecosystem and protected species; economics
   of the fishery; effect on employment, coastal communities and quality of
   recreational fishing; and governance effectiveness including explicit
   sectoral catch allocations, and the efficiency of monitoring and
   compliance systems.
   In 2010 the fishery moved from effort-controlled maximum sustainable
   yield (MSY) to a quota-controlled, maximum economic yield (MEY) system.
   This study explicitly examined how different levels of harvesting across
   the MSY to MEY range affected each of ten EBFM criteria. We confirmed
   that these individual objectives were maximised at different total
   allowable commercial catches. However an example is provided for
   weighting of objectives from a possible management perspective that
   identified the upper end of the MEY range as likely to generate the
   optimum outcome for this fishery.},

Title = {Potential of osmotic power generation by pressure retarded osmosis using
   seawater as feed solution: Analysis and experiments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {429},
Pages = {330-337},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The most commonly explored salinity-gradient scheme in the pressure
   retarded osmosis (PRO) process is based on the pairing of seawater and
   river water as a salinity gradient resource. However, due to the lack of
   a high-performance PRO membrane, a sufficient osmotic pressure
   differential across the membrane active layer to produce high power
   density cannot be attained with this seawater-river water pair. While
   high-performance PRO membranes have to be developed, there are other
   approaches to increase power density that combine several salinity
   gradient resources more efficiently. This study analyzes scenarios of
   osmotic power generation by PRO based on a variety of salinity gradient
   resources. Brine from RO (or future FO) desalination plants and
   municipal wastewater effluent (or brackish water) may be used as a
   high-salinity draw solution and low-salinity feed solution,
   respectively. The use of high salinity brines (as draw solution) from
   future FO desalination plants paired with seawater (as feed solution)
   may be an especially viable approach for a hybrid process of FO
   desalination and PRO power generation. In this approach, seawater is the
   only input resource, and there is no need to have separate intake and
   pre-treatment for the feed and draw solutions as in the conventional
   seawater-river water PRO scheme. From the analysis of these scenarios,
   we performed experiments with seawater (0.5 M NaCl) as feed solution to
   investigate the feasibility of the PRO process with the various proposed
   schemes. For the 2 M draw/0.5 M feed solution scheme at a solution
   temperature of 30 degrees C, a water flux of 13.9 L m(-2) h(-1) and
   corresponding projected power density of 4.7 W/m(2) were obtained at a
   hydraulic pressure difference of 12.5 bar using a commercial cellulose
   triacetate FO membrane. This study demonstrates that osmotic power
   generation by pressure retarded osmosis using seawater as a feed
   solution is potentially viable through the introduction of a hybrid
   process of FO desalination and PRO osmotic power generation. (C) 2012

Title = {BAOBABS ON KUBU ISLAND, BOTSWANA - A DENDROCHRONOLOGICAL MULTI-PARAMETER
   STUDY USING RING WIDTH AND STABLE ISOTOPES (delta C-13, delta O-18)},
Journal = {ERDKUNDE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {71},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), all
   of Africa is very likely to warm up more than the global average during
   this century. Especially (semi-) arid regions are expected to experience
   particularly high warming and possibly catastrophic droughts. However,
   assessments of the impacts of climate change on these regions are
   currently impeded by a lack of transregional high temporal resolution
   proxy data for the African continent. Baobab trees are widely
   distributed in (semi-) arid Africa and can reach ages of up to 2000
   years. This pilot study was aimed at investigating African baobabs,
   Adansonia spp., from a site in Botswana using multiple
   dendroclimatological methods. Increment cores from 16 individual baobabs
   growing on Kubu Island (20 degrees 53' S, 25 degrees 49' E), a granite
   pluton located in the Kalahari, were collected in June 2011 to test for
   annual growth and the species' utility for palaeoclimatic studies. Due
   to the particular wood fabric and relatively high water content, baobab
   increment cores were packed in air-tight opaque tubes and stored in a
   freezer to prevent drying and mould formation. The complicated wood
   anatomical structure was found to be analysed best using a microscope
   with incident UV light, allowing tree-ring boundaries to be
   distinguished. Nonetheless, potential differences in individual site
   conditions, as well as diverse tree ages, caused conventional
   dendrochronological crossdating to fail. Missing and false tree rings
   could be identified due to the strong relationship between tree-ring
   width and annual precipitation amount allowing the development of a
   preliminary 50 year-long baobab chronology (1960-2009). Subsequently,
   stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses revealed significant
   correlations of Delta C-13 and delta O-18 of tree rings with climate
   data. Year-to-year isotope variability and trends were found to be in
   good agreement with established models of fractionation. Intrinsic
   water-use efficiency has mainly increased over the study period (2-30
   \%). Despite the demonstrated high potential of African baobabs as a
   valuable high-resolution climate archive, we conclude that more
   dendrochronological calibration studies are required at various sites in
   southern Africa. Furthermore, ecophysiological monitoring of climate and
   stable isotope signal transfer from the atmosphere, through soil and
   leaves into the tree rings is necessary to fully understand tree-ring
   formation and climate response of the African baobab.},

Abstract = {Understanding temporal and spatial distributions of naturally occurring
   total organic carbon (TOC) in sediments is critical because TOC is all
   important feature or surface water quality. This study investigated
   temporal and spatial distributions of sediment TOC and its relationships
   to sediment contaminants in the Cedar and Ortega Rivers, Florida, USA,
   using three-dimensional kriging analysis and field measurement. Analysis
   of field data showed that large temporal changes in sediment TOC
   concentrations occurred in the rivers, which reflected changes in the
   characteristics and magnitude of inputs into the rivers during
   approximately the last 100 yr. The average concentration of TOC in
   sediments from the Cedar and Ortega Rivers was 12.7\% with a maximum or
   22.6\% and a minimum of 2.3\%. In general, more TOC accumulated at the
   upper 1.0 m of the sediment in the southern part of the Ortega River
   although the TOC sedimentation varied with locations and depths. In
   contrast, high concentrations of sediment contaminants, that is, total
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated hiphenyls
   (PCBs), were found in sediments from the Cedar River. There was no
   correlation between TOC and PAHs or PCBs in these river sediments. This
   finding is in contradiction to some other studies which reported that
   the sorption of hydrocarbons is highly related to the organic matter
   content of sediments. This discrepancy occurred because of the
   differences in TOC and hydrocarbon source input locations. It was found
   that more TOC loaded into the southern part of the Ortega River, while
   almost all of the hydrocarbons entered into the Cellar River. This study
   suggested that the locations of their input sources as well as the land
   use patterns should also be considered when relating hydrocarbons to
   sediment TOC.},

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The floating LNG plants are gaining recently increasing attention in
   offshore energy exploitation. The effects of periodically oscillatory
   motion on the fluid flow in all processes on the offshore plant are very
   complicated and required detailed thermodynamic and hydrodynamic
   analyses. In this paper, numerical simulations are conducted by CFD code
   combined with user-defined functions (UDF). The computational model of
   the circular pipe flow is established with the excitation rolling
   motion, at the excitation frequencies of 1-4 rad/s and the excitation
   angles of 3-15 degree, respectively. The influences of the flow
   velocities and excitation conditions on the pressure characteristics,
   including the time-average pressure, the amplitude and the period of
   pressure fluctuation are systematically investigated. It is found that
   the pressure fluctuation of the in-viscid flow keeps almost constant at
   different flow velocities. The amplitude of the pressure fluctuation
   increases with the increase of the excitation angle. Meanwhile, with the
   increase of the excitation frequency, the amplitude decreases in the
   vertical pipe, but increases in the horizontal pipe. It is also found
   that the period of the pressure fluctuation is depended on the
   excitation frequency. Furthermore, the theoretical analyses for the flow
   in the rolling circular pipe are conducted, which qualitatively agree
   with the numerical simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {INCREASE IN CARBONATE CONTRIBUTION FROM FRAMEWORK-BUILDING METAZOANS
   THROUGH EARLY CAMBRIAN REEFS OF THE WESTERN BASIN AND RANGE, USA},

Abstract = {During the early Cambrian, organisms with robust skeletons began to
   integrate with microbialite reef structures. Specifically,
   archaeocyathan sponges were among the first metazoan reef-builders. Here
   we investigate the transition from microbial-dominated reef environments
   to metazoan-based reefs from strata in the western Basin and Range of
   California and Nevada. This study integrates point count data from
   petrographic thin sections with stable carbon isotopic and elemental
   composition of carbonates. From the earliest reef bearing formations to
   the latest, metazoan framework contribution increases from zero to
   29.7\%. This increase is linked to the addition of new
   framework-building organisms, namely coralomorphs, as well as an
   increase in archaeocyath body size. Correspondingly, Shannon's diversity
   increases from 0.652 to 1.492. However, skeletal contributions from
   additional organisms within the reefs (e.g., trilobites, echinoderms)
   appear unchanged and their diversity is not correlated with
   framework-builder diversity. A positive carbon isotopic excursion within
   the Lower Poleta Formation correlates with decreases in the abundances
   of uranium and molybdenum that suggest a global change in organic carbon
   burial as opposed to localized or diagenetic factors. This allows for
   chemostratigraphic correlation to published carbon isotopic data and
   provides a proposed regional age constraint of roughly 517 million
   years. Overall, early Cambrian reefs at this location exhibit a pattern
   of increasing metazoan contribution during the transition from
   microbial- to metazoan-based reef support, however, diversity remained
   low until additional organisms evolved to inhabit these ecosystems.},

Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {{[}1] We examine six different coupled climate model simulations to
   determine the ocean biological response to climate warming between the
   beginning of the industrial revolution and 2050. We use vertical
   velocity, maximum winter mixed layer depth, and sea ice cover to define
   six biomes. Climate warming leads to a contraction of the highly
   productive marginal sea ice biome by 42\% in the Northern Hemisphere and
   17\% in the Southern Hemisphere, and leads to an expansion of the low
   productivity permanently stratified subtropical gyre biome by 4.0\% in
   the Northern Hemisphere and 9.4\% in the Southern Hemisphere. In between
   these, the subpolar gyre biome expands by 16\% in the Northern
   Hemisphere and 7\% in the Southern Hemisphere, and the seasonally
   stratified subtropical gyre contracts by 11\% in both hemispheres. The
   low-latitude ( mostly coastal) upwelling biome area changes only
   modestly. Vertical stratification increases, which would be expected to
   decrease nutrient supply everywhere, but increase the growing season
   length in high latitudes. We use satellite ocean color and
   climatological observations to develop an empirical model for predicting
   chlorophyll from the physical properties of the global warming
   simulations. Four features stand out in the response to global warming:
   ( 1) a drop in chlorophyll in the North Pacific due primarily to retreat
   of the marginal sea ice biome, ( 2) a tendency toward an increase in
   chlorophyll in the North Atlantic due to a complex combination of
   factors, ( 3) an increase in chlorophyll in the Southern Ocean due
   primarily to the retreat of and changes at the northern boundary of the
   marginal sea ice zone, and ( 4) a tendency toward a decrease in
   chlorophyll adjacent to the Antarctic continent due primarily to
   freshening within the marginal sea ice zone. We use three different
   primary production algorithms to estimate the response of primary
   production to climate warming based on our estimated chlorophyll
   concentrations. The three algorithms give a global increase in primary
   production of 0.7\% at the low end to 8.1\% at the high end, with very
   large regional differences. The main cause of both the response to
   warming and the variation between algorithms is the temperature
   sensitivity of the primary production algorithms. We also show results
   for the period between the industrial revolution and 2050 and 2090.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination
   plants in the Canary Islands (Spain) where there are more than 320
   private and public units of varying size. The objective is to provide
   proposals to optimize the operation of these plants, improving energy
   consumption, water quality, costs and emissions, and making the
   desalination process more efficient and sustainable. An analysis is
   undertaken in this study of the carbon footprint ratios (per m(3) and
   type of inhabitant or per m(3) and type of productive activity) for each
   of the islands as a contribution to the decision-making process on the
   inclusion of renewable energy in the energy mix. The conditions for the
   production of freshwater in each of the islands vary due to differences
   in the available power technologies and the energy costs. The ecological
   footprint is also studied for each island. This work shows the results
   of an analysis of energy efficiency and environmental footprints. The
   conclusions of the study can serve as a tool to improve energy
   efficiency in SWRO plants. For an annual desalinated water production in
   the Canary Islands of 660,000 m(3)/d, and considering an energy
   consumption of about 3.04 kWh/m(3), the calculated carbon footprint per
   year is 439,402 t CO2 and the ecological footprint 219,701 ha/y. Given a
   total population in the islands of 2,207,225 inhabitants, the ecological
   footprint is 0.1 ha/person/y, and the carbon footprint 0.2 t
   CO2/person/y.},

Abstract = {Photosynthetic carbon metabolism and the biochemical composition of
   late-winter phytoplankton assemblages in the eastern North Atlantic
   Ocean were studied during an oceanographic cruise carried out in March
   1992. Enhanced levels of phytoplankton biomass and primary production
   were linked to the subtropical front-Azores Current (STF/AC) region.
   High values of the relative incorporation of carbon into proteins
   indicated that the phytoplankton was growing at a rate close to the
   maximum growth rate. A very high percentage of carbon was incorporated
   into the lipid fraction at southern latitudes, whereas incorporation
   into polysaccharides peaked al the AC. In general, the biochemical
   composition of particulate matter reflected the observed patterns of
   photosynthate partitioning. Latitudinal changes in phytoplankton species
   composition accounted for the geographical Variability in C-14 labelling
   patterns. Turnover times of particulate matter estimated for the STF/AC
   region were relatively low (3-5 days) and suggested balanced growth of
   the microplankton community over daily time scales.},

Abstract = {Intertidal clam fisheries seem ideal candidates for the devolution of
   management authority from government to local stakeholders. In St.
   Mary's Bay, Nova Scotia, a private firm recently applied for a 10-year
   renewal of a large (1,627 ha) lease for quahog clam aquaculture. This
   case study examines the challenges of implementing community-based
   natural resource management (CBNRM) in rural fisheries within a broad
   integrated coastal management (ICM) institutional environment that
   favours corporate stakeholders. The challenges facing clam harvesters in
   rural Digby Neck, Nova Scotia arise from poor communication and
   coordination within government and between government and communities,
   as well as higher-level policy conflicts. The most important challenge
   arises from `stealth privatization' of clam beaches. A single firm was
   granted rights of first refusal to depurate all clams harvested from
   closed (polluted) beaches in the region, resulting in the de facto
   privatization of all (polluted and unpolluted) clam beaches. Experiences
   in other parts of Canada suggest there may be community-based governance
   approaches that avoid the pitfalls associated with corporate management
   of clam beaches. New thinking is required about how to moderate the
   `privatization paradigm' so prevalent within senior levels of government
   in order to ensure environmental and social sustainability in rural
   fishing communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   preeminent steel pipe design researchers, Dr. Reynold Watkins, the
   design of flexible pipes is largely dependent on the surrounding soils.
   The selection of flexible pipe materials and the design of the flexible
   pipeline system begins with and depends almost entirely on the ground
   conditions through which the pipeline will be constructed.
   The Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) and Dallas Water Utilities
   (DWU) began design of the Integrated Pipeline Project (IPL) in 2008 and
   have been advancing the art and science of large diameter pipeline
   project delivery ever since. The \$2.3 billion IPL is a joint project
   between DWU and TRWD and will, when completed, include 150 miles of
   pipeline from Lake Palestine to Lake Benbrook. The pipeline crosses a
   number of challenging obstacles and passes through a number of highly
   variable ground conditions, from rippable (soft) rock to running,
   saturated sands and everything in between.
   The 13-mile long alignment of IPL Section 15-2 crosses the Waxahachie
   Creek valley west of IH-45 before following a long, gentle ridgeline
   roughly between Ennis and Waxahachie, Texas as shown in Figure 1 below.
   The pipeline crosses some very design-challenging soils, including the
   notorious, heave-susceptible Blackland Prairie. The
   geotechnical/geophysical program prepared by the Program Team noted a
   number of ``Areas of Geologic Concern{''} in Section 15-2, most notably
   in the ``Waxahachie Creek Bottoms,{''} an alluvial valley with a broad
   floodplain and shallow, water-bearing sands within and just beneath the
   ``typical{''} trench profile.
   The design team worked collaboratively with the pipeline owners and
   their program management team to develop best-value design and
   construction procurement approaches to deliver the project in a way that
   fairly attributed and mitigated the ground condition risks while
   assuring the best life-cycle value for the Owners. This paper describes
   the project constraints faced and approaches taken to mitigate both
   design and construction risks. These approaches included clearly
   defining the design intent that was predicated on assumed ground/trench
   conditions and the following construction inspection and management
   practices:
   Clear delineation of areas of geotechnical concern in the bidding
   documents
   Clear definition of the ground conditions assumptions made in pipe and
   trench envelope design in the bidding documents
   Definitive pre-construction validation of ground conditions ahead of
   material procurement
   Validation of in-situ trench conditions during pipeline installation
   Provisions for alternative trench and backfill envelopes in both the bid
   schedule and plan and specifications that equitably mitigate bidding and
   construction cost risks related to ground conditions},

Title = {Enhancing energy system security and stability - a novel approach using
   PSO support islanding detection in a grid connected distributed energy
   system and environmental effects of grid faults},
Journal = {ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS},
Abstract = {Energy system with small scale capacity, distributed generations (DG)
   and Micro Grid (MG) attains very potential and plays a significant role
   in utility grid infrastructure. Although DG energy system integration
   has many benefits, its working at disturbance conditions leads a harming
   humans and converter devices. Hence these conditions lead a security and
   stability issues. For an energy system, electric utility grid
   integration is essential as renewable energy sources are rapidly with
   installation Distributed Generation (DG). A lot of issues are arising
   during the operation like interruption, disorder and uncertainty
   difficulty. Control of inverter is properly obtain with voltage and
   frequency variation and this Variable Inverter Control Vector (VICV)
   method is proposed to identify Islanding Detection (ISN) with Rate of
   Change of Voltage (RCV), Rate of Change of Frequency (RCF). Adaptive ISN
   algorithm is developed with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) tuned
   VICVs improves a 20\% of voltage stability performance and 15\%
   frequency stability is outcome of proposed of system, and used to
   identify ISN events in integrated utility grid. When a network is
   extended by means of new small scale energy systems and operating with
   main grid network, the possibility of preexistence of global best with
   PSO data is also reconsidered for acquisition of optimization. This
   paper presents updating VICV functions as change in voltage and
   frequency at Point of Common coupling (PCC) with all grid connected
   cases of energy system.},

Title = {Sustainable development prospects for Italian coastal cultural heritage:
   a Ligurian case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {This paper aims to present preliminary key findings from an
   investigation conducted in the framework of the Progetto Finalizzato
   Beni Culturali (Special Project for Safeguarding Cultural Heritage),
   convened by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR-National
   Research Council). The investigations focused on the role of cultural
   heritage as a positive force in the operation of integrated coastal
   management programmes in ways consistent with the application of Agenda
   21 in the Italian coastal zone
   (http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/agenda21.htm). The region of Liguria, in
   northwestern Italy facing the Ligurian Sea, has been taken as a case
   study because it is one of the richest Italian regions as regards
   cultural heritage and one of the most subject to human pressure. The
   initial phase of the research focused on the role of museums, with the
   aim of devising scenarios to integrate them optimally into coastal
   programmes and plans. It also considered a number of landscape and
   cultural characteristics of the region taking into account the influence
   exerted by the geographical distribution of these resources. The paper
   reports on this stage by reviewing planning and the role of coastal
   cultural heritage in Italy; exploring the Ligurian geographical context
   and its significance for the nature and distribution of cultural
   heritage resources; examining a discernable expansion of cultural
   heritage tourism within the region; sketching scenarios for encouraging
   this development based on museum-orientated itineraries; and identifying
   a range of obstacles confronting the successful creation of such
   itineraries. The ultimate aim of the work is the development of
   guidelines to be addressed to decision-making centres, and particularly
   to coastal regional authorities to ensure the optimum inclusion of
   cultural heritage in the framework of coastal management programmes and
   planning. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All

Title = {Storage and release of nutrients during litter decomposition for native

   wetland},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {149},
Pages = {5-16},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Projections of climate change impacts over the coming decades suggest
   that rising sea level will flood coastal wetlands. We studied the
   impacts of three intensities of flooding on litter decomposition in the
   native Cyperus malaccensis, and the invasives Spartina alterniflora and
   Phragmites australis in Shanyutan wetland (Minjiang River estuary,
   China). Invasive species had larger C, N and P stocks in plant-litter
   compartments and higher fluxes among plant-litter-soil, which increased
   with flooding intensity. Litter mass remaining (\% of initial mass) were
   correlated with the N:P ratio in remaining litter, consistently with the
   N-limitation in this wetland. P. australis had the highest accumulated N
   release (P < 0.001) in all flooding intensities, whereas C. malaccensis
   had higher N accumulated release than S. alternifolia but only at low
   flooding intensity. At high flooding intensity, the N released in the
   first year of litter decomposition (gm(-2)y(-1)) were 9.56 +/- 0.21, 2
   .38 +/- 0.18 and 1.92 +/- 0.03 for P. australis, S. alternifolia and C.
   malaccensis, respectively. The higher rates of nutrient release from
   litter decomposition in invasive species provided better nutrient supply
   during the growing season coinciding with the initial phases of
   decomposition. Thus, this study shows that invasive species may gain a
   competitive advantage over the native C. malaccensis under the projected
   scenarios of sea level rises.},

Abstract = {Energy budget was calculated for the cultured mussel population on net
   substrata of the mussel farm (10 000 m2) in Chupa Inlet, the White Sea.
   Seasonal changes of respiration rate of the White Sea mussels depended
   on both sea-water temperature and stage of gonad cycle. Maximal values
   of respiration rate were recorded in late spring and June, minimal ones
   in winter and early spring. Caloric content of the whole mollusc (with
   shell and mantle fluid) was 210 cal/g.
   Maximal values of energy flow in the cultured mussel population were
   observed in summer; however, net production efficiency in autumn was
   higher than in summer. This coefficient for the investigated mussel
   population was equal to 0.19 in 4 years. Total biomass eliminated during
   the observation period was 60-80\% of the total production in different
   size groups. For 1 kg increment in biomass (i.e. 210 kcal), the White
   Sea mussels needed about 2300 kcal of food. During the 4-year
   cultivation period the investigated farm (10 000 m2) withdrew about
   710{*} 10(6) kcal from the environment. Of this, 30\% was returned into
   the ecosystem with faeces and 8\% due to elimination, 56\% was dispersed
   due to metabolism and only 6\% (about 220 t) remained as terminal
   biomass on the net bands which may be harvested.},

Title = {An islanding partition method of active distribution networks based on
   chance-constrained programming},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {242},
Pages = {78-91},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {With the high integration of uncontrollable distributed generators
   (NDGs) comprising photovoltaic arrays (PVs) and wind turbines (WTs),
   many technical issues have become increasingly prominent in the
   islanding operation of active distribution networks (ADNs). Such
   problems including branch overloading and voltage violations threaten
   the secure operation of distribution systems and a continuous power
   supply. To address the uncertainties of NDG outputs when implementing
   islanding partition strategies, this paper proposes a new method of the
   islanding partition of ADNs based on chance-constrained programming.
   First, power generation scenarios and probability distributions for
   these scenarios are generated according to historical data considering
   the time series characteristics and uncertainties of NDGs. Then, the
   chance-constrained description of islanding operation is expanded to
   consider the effect of uncertainties related to NDGs. Moreover, an
   islanding partition model of ADNs based on chance-constrained
   programming is established. By applying convex relaxation and
   introducing auxiliary variables, the model is converted to a
   mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming model that can be
   effectively solved. Finally, case studies involving the modified IEEE
   33-node system, IEEE 123-node system and an actual distribution system
   are conducted to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the
   proposed method.},

Abstract = {This study addresses whether high concentrations of small ice crystals
   in the upper 1 km or so of high, thick tropical cirrus clouds are
   principally responsible for the highly reflective clouds observed over
   the equatorial Pacific ``warm pool{''}. This region of the tropics has
   recently been shown to contain extensive shields of cirrus clouds which
   significantly influence the global climate through their effect on the
   radiation budget of the tropics. In-situ and remote sensing measurements
   of cloud microphysical and radiative properties from field programs in
   the central and western tropical Pacific and radiative transfer
   calculations are used to derive distributions of cloud microphysical
   properties with height and their relationship to cloud radiative
   properties. Clouds associated directly with convection are shown to have
   sufficiently high optical depths near cloud top to produce localized
   areas of bright or optically ``thick{''} cirrus, reflecting more than
   40\% of the incoming solar radiation. However, in general the upper
   parts of cirrus cannot alone account for the high albedos (fraction of
   incoming solar energy reflected) but do contribute substantially when
   high albedos are observed. The lower parts of the. cirrus, in some cases
   extending down to the melting layer or below when they are called
   stratiform cloud regions, are usually necessary to produce high albedos.},

Title = {Nitrogen and carbon cycling in a New Zealand pumice soil under a manuka

Abstract = {Shrubland communities dominated by manuka (Leptospermum scoparium J.
   Forst. and G. Forst.) and kanuka (Kunzea ericoides var. ericoides ((A.
   Rich) J. Thompson) are widespread throughout New Zealand. They
   frequently colonise disturbed land surfaces and are important for
   erosion mitigation, and also for their capacity to act as a carbon ( C)
   sink. We here investigate C and nitrogen (N) cycling in 3 stands
   (similar to 26-56 years old) that had established on a repeatedly burned
   forest site on a Podzolic Orthic Pumice soil in the Turangi area,
   central North Island. For comparison, limited measurements of N cycling
   were also made at other manuka-kanuka sites on non-volcanic soils. Leaf
   N concentrations at the Turangi site were 11.8-13.9 g/kg, and lower than
   those at many of the other manuka-kanuka stands. Total annual litterfall
   and N content increased with stand age, as did total N concentrations in
   FH material and mineral soil (0-100mm depth). Total C concentrations in
   mineral soil did not, however, differ significantly in the 3 stands.
   Levels of soil microbial C and N, rates of carbon dioxide production,
   and metabolic coefficients (qCO(2) values) suggest C cycling could be
   fairly rapid at this site. In contrast, rates of net mineral-N and
   nitrate-N production were low to very low compared with those in similar
   pumice soils under angiosperm-conifer forests, and in the non-volcanic
   soils under other manuka-kanuka stands. Low N availability and tight N
   cycling at the Turangi site are thereby strongly suggested. No
   definitive explanation for the atypically low N availability at this
   site is apparent, although the possible effects of previous forest
   burnings may have been a contributing factor. The continued growth of
   these shrubs, nevertheless, shows they can compete successfully for the
   N that does become available through gross N mineralisation in the
   Turangi ecosystem.},

Abstract = {During the Kaiko-Tokai project, we took a total of 15 near-surface
   sediment push cores from inside and outside seafloor clam colonies and
   bacterial mats in the Nankai Trough. In this study, we present the
   chemical and isotopic composition of pore fluids extracted from the
   sampled cores, with special emphasis on those taken at the Ryuyo Canyon,
   and discuss (a) the chemical relation between the seeping fluid and
   biological communities, and (b) the origin of cold seep fluids. Compared
   with bottom seawater, up to 5\% depletion of chloride concentration,
   extremely high CH4 concentration of more than 300 mumol/kg, and slight
   deltaD(H2O) depletion are observed in pore fluids at the Ryuyo Canyon,
   which suggests that the Ryuyo Canyon is an active seep zone of low
   chloride, CH4-rich, low deltaD(H2O) fluid from the sea bottom.
   Remarkable depletion of sulfate and significant enrichment of dissolved
   inorganic carbon and of hydrogen sulfide are also observed in the pore
   fluids, particularly those taken within bacterial mats, while the carbon
   isotopic composition of pore fluid dissolved methane (delta(13)C(CH4))
   shows large heterogeneity (up to 30parts per thousand) in and around the
   vents. These chemical and isotopic characteristics might be due to
   active anaerobic methane oxidation and hydrogen sulfide production
   (methane oxidation through sulfate reduction) in the sedimentary layer
   just below (within 30 cm) the vents on the seafloor. The carbon isotopic
   composition of methane can be considered direct evidence of the
   mediation process between methane-enriched cold seep fluid and the
   H2S-dependent biological community on the cold seep vent. After
   correcting for the effect of methane oxidation at the sediment surface,
   we estimate the end-member carbon isotopic composition of methane as
   less than -90parts per thousand PDB, and the end-member CH4/C2H6 ratio
   as more than 10(3), which suggests a microbial, shallow layer is the
   origin of methane in the fluid. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   experiencing a shift from coral-dominated to algal-dominated systems.
   The macroalga Turbinaria ornata comprises the majority of the increasing

   distribution is increasing throughout this region. Aspects of the
   ecomorphology of Turbinaria make it ideally suited to thrive under the
   physical conditions found across barrier reefs throughout French
   Polynesia. Spatial morphological variation allows Turbinaria to produce
   morphotypes that are suited either to the calin, unidirectional, slowly
   flowing water in the backreef or to the high-energy wave-driven flow of
   the forereef. Backreef plants are flexible and produce airbladders that
   make them buoyant, whereas forereet plants are not buoyant, but strong
   and stiff. Production of bladders and resulting buoyancy has been found
   to be a phenotypically plastic trait in response to movement of water
   and confers advantages to backreef plants and plays all important role
   in dispersal. Ontogenetic Variation Of buoyancy, material properties,
   and reproductive capacity is part of a dispersal strategy whereby
   fertile, buoyant, fronds drift between oceanic islands and form new
   populations, thereby contributing to the recent expansion of range of T.

Abstract = {In the current work, the diagnosis of a reverse osmosis desalination
   unit is reported. Over the two last decades, the studied desalination
   unit was supplying a 1,200 bed hotel. The feed water was driven from a
   well near the sea. The desalination unit has two stages giving an
   average recovery equal to 81\%. The behaviour of all water streams with
   respect to aggressiveness and scaling tendency was assessed. The second
   stage reject water was shown to exhibit a very high scaling behaviour
   with an instantaneous precipitation in the absence of feed water pH
   adjustment. The analyses have shown that the produced water was very
   aggressive. The second stage module autopsy has revealed a sharp
   decrease in the membrane performances because of mineral as well as
   organic fouling. The inorganic scale was essentially made of coesite,
   calcite and kaolinite clay. The presence of silica and clay was
   attributed to an inadequate pre-treatment process, whereas the presence
   of calcite crystals at the membrane surface reveals that the chemical
   inhibition performed at the pre-treatment process without adjusting the
   pH was not able to prevent calcium carbonate precipitation. A periodic
   acid wash of the second stage membranes is then necessary to guarantee
   the desired objectives of this stage.},

Title = {Gas geochemistry of the Mobile Bay Jurassic Norphlet Formation: Thermal
   controls and implications for reservoir connectivity},
Journal = {AAPG BULLETIN},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {93},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1319-1346},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Mobile Bay gas field is located offshore Alabama in the northern
   Gulf of Mexico. Production is from eolian dunes of the Jurassic Norphlet
   sandstone at depths exceeding 6100 m (>20,000 ft) and temperatures
   greater than 200 degrees C. Reservoir connectivity and compositional
   variation, including the distribution of nonhydrocarbon gases (H(2)S and
   CO(2)), are critical factors in production strategy. To evaluate the
   controls on compositional variation and connectivity, detailed molecular
   and isotopic analyses were conducted for 29 wells. Analysis of volatiles
   in fluid inclusions suggests that the field was originally filled with
   oil that subsequently cracked to gas. In addition to the thermal
   destruction (cracking) of oil, the process of thermochemical sulfate
   reduction (TSR) continues to destroy the remaining hydrocarbons through
   oxidation of gas and reduction of sulfate to form H(2)S and CO(2). The
   variable extent of the TSR process at Mobile Bay results in a wide i
   range of hydrocarbon and H(2)S compositions. Condensates are almost
   exclusively composed of diamondoids whose I composition appears
   controlled by H(2)S concentrations.
   In contrast to hydrocarbon and H(2)S contents, CO(2) concentrations are
   relatively constant throughout the field. Carbon isotopic ratios for
   CO(2) correlate positively with those for wet-gas hydrocarbons but are
   heavier than expected for CO(2) originating from hydrocarbon oxidation
   via TSR. The narrow range of CO(2) contents and heavy isotope ratios
   suggests that CO(2) is regulated by water-rock equilibration and
   carbonate precipitation. The destruction of the hydrocarbon gas and
   mineralization of the carbon dioxide product create a volume reduction
   and an associated drop in reservoir pressure. This process creates
   several intemal sinks (or exits) that may control the spill direction
   for gas in the field.},

Title = {Multistage pressure-retarded osmosis configurations: A unifying
   framework and thermodynamic analysis},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {476},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Pressure-retarded osmosis has enjoyed increasing research interest over
   the last decade. Recent studies focusing on single-stage PRO designs
   have raised doubts regarding the long-term economic viability of the
   technology. While most of the analyses are based on single-stage
   operation, comprehensive analysis of multistage PRO which shows promise
   for better energetic performance is absent. Previous studies on
   multistage PRO differ in their design philosophies and performance
   metrics, leading to an incomplete assessment regarding the potential
   benefits of multistaging. In this paper, we develop a unifying framework
   to classify several existing multistage configurations. In addition, we
   analyze the multistage PRO system from a thermodynamic perspective.
   Among the two major multistage design strategies, namely interstage
   pressure control and independent feed inputs to each stage, we found the
   latter to be more effective towards increasing net power density. In
   comparison to a single-stage device, a 10-stage system achieves around
   9\% higher net power density while using the same membrane area.},

Title = {Ammonium Behavior and Nitrogen Isotope Characteristics of 2:1 Clay
   Minerals from Submarine Hydrothermal System in the Wakamiko Crater of
   Kagoshima Bay, Southwestern Japan},

Abstract = {2:1 clay minerals such as smectite incorporating ammonium were extracted
   to investigate the ammonium behavior and nitrogen isotope
   characteristics for two different sediment cores which were collected
   from shimmering sites on seafloor of the Wakamiko crater, southwestern
   Japan. Inorganic nitrogen contents in clay fraction were estimated by
   calibration curve based on consistently decreasing carbon and nitrogen
   ratio during the treatment to decompose organic materials, after
   removing inorganic carbon. The results show that the proportions of
   inorganic nitrogen for total nitrogen in clay fraction of SWS
   site(Core\#1094MR: av. 18.2\%) are higher than those in SES
   site(Core\#1093MG: av. 11.5\%). Relatively good crystallinity of the
   former suggests that exchangeable ammonium was transformed to
   non-exchangeable ammonium during more evolving diagenetic process.
   Nitrogen isotope variance of clay fraction(SES site: Core\#1093MG: -4.4
   similar to +0.2 \%, av. -2.4 \%; SWS site: Core\#1094MR: -0.7 similar to
   +3.0 \%, av. +1.5 \%) during sequential decomposition of exchangeable
   ammonium suggests that heat flow derived from deep magma led to nitrogen
   isotope fractionation between dissolved ammonium and ammonia in the
   fluids involved in the formation of 2:1 clay mineral incorporating
   ammonium with local temperature variation.},

Title = {Storage and depth distribution of organic carbon in volcanic soils as
   affected by environmental and pedological factors},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {163-175},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It has been recognised that volcanic soils, particularly Andosols, can
   store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). This study
   investigates the factors controlling the regional and vertical
   distributions of SOC in soils of volcanic origin. To this aim, we
   investigated the vertical distribution of SOC in a total of 212 soil
   profiles representing all combinations of soil-forming factors in a
   volcanic area with a high diversity of ecosystems and soil types. We
   analysed the SOC contents in relation to intrinsic (soil type and
   relevant soil properties: texture and pH) and extrinsic factors
   (climate, parent material, relief), and we studied the patterns of SOC
   distribution with depth by fitting the SOC contents to different curve
   models. Furthermore, we selected ten soil profiles for a more detailed
   study to assess the effect of vegetation by examining the relationships
   of the SOC storage and depth distribution to the amount and allocation
   of plant roots and litterfall.
   SOC storage was controlled by the interaction of climatic (rainfall),
   time (substrate age), topographic (slope) and biotic (plant-mediated)
   factors. Our results indicate that under humid conditions, large organic
   inputs and the inhibition of microbial degradation due to low pH,
   AI-toxicity and persistent anaerobiosis within soil microaggregates
   largely contributed to SOC accumulation. Soil type was a poor predictor
   of SOC storage, most likely due to the co-occurrence of young and
   evolved Andosols and a certain andic character in many soils that did
   not qualify as Andosols. The distributions of root carbon and SOC
   appeared to be closely interrelated, suggesting a major role of roots in
   the supply of organic matter and the lack of significant bioturbation.
   The depth distribution of SOC was best fitted by the quadratic, cubic
   and power models, the latter being a feasible alternative that should be
   used to this aim in volcanic soils rather than the widely used
   exponential model. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Global climate damage in 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C scenarios based

Journal = {ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The quantitative functions for climate damages provide theoretical
   ground for the cost-benefit analysis in climate change economics, and
   they are also critical for linking climate module with economic module
   in the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMB). Nevertheless, it is
   necessary for IAMs to update sectoral climate impacts in order to catch
   up the advance in climate change studies. This study updates the
   sectoral climate damage function at global scale from climate Framework
   for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution (FUND) model and develops
   the aggregate climate damage function in a bottom-up fashion. Besides
   conventional sectors such as agriculture, forestry, water resources,
   energy consumption and ecosystems, this study expands climate disaster
   types, assesses human health impacts caused by various air pollutants,
   and updates coastal damage by sea level rise. The Beijing Climate Center
   Simple Earth System Model (BCC\_SESM) is used to project climate system
   based on Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, and the 2 degrees C and 1.5
   degrees C scenarios based on RCPs and SSP2 databases. Sectoral results
   show that the agricultural sector is projected to suffer 63\% of the
   total damage, followed by water resources (16\%) and human health (12\%)
   sectors in 2100. The regression results indicate that the aggregate
   climate damage function is in positive quadratic form for zero
   discounting. Under BAU scenario, the aggregate climate damage is
   projected to be 517.7 trillion USD during 2011-2100. Compared to that,
   the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C scenarios are projected to
   respectively reduce climate damages by 215.6 trillion USD (approximately
   41.6\%) and 263.5 trillion USD (50.9\%) in 2011-2100.},

Journal = {PROGRESS IN POLYMER SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1067-1088},

Abstract = {Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is one of the most important polymeric
   materials available today and is used to manufacture many items, ranging
   from packaging and toys to healthcare devices. PVC is per sea rigid
   material but it is made softer by compounding with plasticizers,
   particularly phthalate esters such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
   (DEHP). In flexible plasticizer PVC (P-PVC), phthalates are not
   chemically bound to PVC and they are released into the external
   environment. In particular, prolonged contact of P-PVC based medical
   devices with body fluids or tissues has been shown to be associated with
   severe health risks. Major concerns regarding the safety of P-PVC in
   medical plastic items have been raised, and several alternatives to
   phthalates and to P-PVC itself as well as chemical/physical treatments
   of P-PVC to reduce DEHP migration have been proposed.
   This review outlines recent scientific approaches for preventing DEHP
   contamination of humans by P-PVC medical devices, highlighting the
   impact of the proposed alternative materials on human health and
   strategies for implementing them. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {A new methodology incorporating public participation within Cuba's ICZM
   program},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {186},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Although public participation (PP) has influenced some integrated
   coastal zone management (ICZM) programs around the world, researchers
   have rarely analyzed this component specifically inside an ICZM cycle.
   Furthermore, the approach for integrating environmental energy planning
   tools within the ICZM Programs for the Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS) has presented an ongoing challenge for specialists involved in
   management issues. In Cuba, plans for coastal development are supported
   by land use planning activities and environmental planning tools.
   However, the functions and outputs of those tools are ``non-obvious{''},
   precluding sufficient integration among them. As these aforementioned
   actions have not been systematically carried out in the Cuban territory,
   and the systems of inter-institutional relationships with local
   communities have presented some insufficiencies, the national
   marine-terrestrial interphase has suffered some negative environmental
   impacts impossible to be solved by the national authorities. Designing a
   new methodology that incorporates PP and environmental energy planning
   tools in the stages of an ICZM program is the objective of this article.
   The methodology was named MePuPa and has improved current tools for land
   use planning and ICZM in Cuba. Previously selected ``Local Indicators of
   Environmental Sustainability{''}, applied in two geo-systemic units in
   the southeastern region of Cuba, were used to demonstrate the
   methodology. The qualitative and qualitative methods in the proposed
   MePuPa were also applied. Finally, the MePuPa methodology was tested for
   four of its five stages. Six advantages and five learned lessons were
   identified during the Preparation to Proposal stages. MePuPa resulted in
   a useful local management tool for environmental energy planning, ICZM,
   economic and agricultural activities, strategic ecosystems recovery, as
   well as improvements to the governance and decision-making processes in
   one SIDS.},

Title = {Weather and sex ratios of head-started Agassiz's desert tortoise
   Gopherus agassizii juveniles hatched in natural habitat enclosures},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {145-155},
Abstract = {Head-starting of Agassiz's desert tortoise, a means to aid recovery of
   this threatened species, may adversely affect offspring sex ratios via
   temperature-dependent sex determination combined with possible unnatural
   thermal conditions in head-start facilities. We determined sex ratios in
   juvenile tortoises hatched from first clutches of 4 annual cohorts at
   the head-start facility at the US Marine Corps Base, Twentynine Palms,
   California, USA, using non-fatal, endoscopic inspection of gonads.
   Cohort sexes ranged from 97\% females (female:male ratio of 6.25:1) in
   2008 to 84\% males (female:male ratio of 0.19:1) in 2009, apparently
   primarily in response to local weather conditions during the
   temperature-sensitive phase of incubation. Warmer weather during
   development of a second clutch laid in 2009 led to fewer males (55\%,
   female:male ratio of 0.82). Efforts to cool (artificially shade) some
   nesting burrows were unsuccessful in increasing the proportion of male
   hatchlings in 2009. Cohort sex ratios were associated with average daily
   air temperatures during incubation, such that more females were produced
   during warmer periods, in good agreement with published
   temperature-controlled laboratory experiments. These results suggest
   that weather played a major role in determining sex ratios, with
   apparently smaller or negligible influences resulting from initial
   location, structure and operation of the head-start facility;
   experimental shading of nests; and individual mothers' variation in the
   timing of egg laying and placement of nests within the natal burrows.
   These results, obtained from a remote, mostly natural field site,
   indicate the potentially great sensitivity of sex determination in nests
   of wild, free-living desert tortoises to changes in climate.},

Abstract = {There is scope for land-use changes to increase or decrease CO2
   concentrations in the atmosphere over the next century. Here we make
   simple but robust calculations of the maximum impact of such changes.
   Historical land-use changes (mostly deforestation) and fossil fuel
   emissions have caused an increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 of
   90 ppm between the pre-industrial era and year 2000. The projected range
   of CO2 concentrations in 2100, under a range of emissions scenarios
   developed for the IPCC, is 170-600 ppm above 2000 levels. This range is
   mostly due to different assumptions regarding fossil fuel emissions. If
   all of the carbon so far released by land-use changes could be restored
   to the terrestrial biosphere, atmospheric CO2 concentration at the end
   of the century would be about 40-70 ppm less than it would be if no such
   intervention had occurred. Conversely, complete global deforestation
   over the same time frame would increase atmospheric concentrations by
   about 130-290 ppm. These are extreme assumptions; the maximum feasible
   reforestation and afforestation activities over the next 50 years would
   result in a reduction in CO2 concentration of about 15-30 ppm by the end
   of the century. Thus the time course of fossil fuel emissions will be
   the major factor in determining atmospheric CO2 concentrations for the
   foreseeable future.},

Title = {Recrystallization of magnesian calcite overgrowths on calcite seeds
   suspended in seawater},
Journal = {AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {337-360},
Abstract = {The formation and subsequent reactions of magnesian calcite overgrowths
   on calcite were investigated by means of closed system seeded
   precipitation experiments. These experiments demonstrated that (1) thin
   overgrowths of magnesian calcite are precipitated on calcite seeds
   suspended in seawater; (2) the solubilities of the coatings increase
   outward from the seed crystals as a linear function of the log of
   relative coating thickness; (3) during the period of these experiments
   (up to 5.5 months), the magnesian calcite coatings continued to increase
   in thickness, but became less soluble in composition. The stabilization
   reaction, referred to as recrystallization, can be described by the
   following equation:
   CaxMg(1-x)CO3 + {[}z + y(x + z)]Ca2+ + 2yHCO(3)(-)
   = (1 + y)Ca(x+z)Mg(1-x-z)CO3 + {[}z + y(x + z - 1)]Mg2+ + yCO(2) +
   yH(2)O;
   (4) recrystallization rate is dependent on solution saturation state,
   with a reaction order of 3. 2 for artificial seawater and 4.0 for
   natural seawater; and (5) by the cessation of the closed system
   experiments, overgrowth compositions approached that of the stable
   calcite (a few mol\% MgCO3).
   Armoring of suspended carbonate particles in the surface oceans with
   magnesian calcite overgrowths would provide an effective barrier to
   release of the oceanic supersaturation with respect to calcite.
   Thicknesses of such coatings would be limited by the recrystallization
   rate of the magnesian calcite. Estimates based on the recrystallization
   rates determined in this work indicate coatings on the order of 0.02 mu
   m in thickness could form on particles as they sink through the mixed
   layer. According to these calculations, the total amount of carbon
   precipitated annually in magnesian calcite overgrowths is comparable to
   the riverine flux of dissolved carbon to the oceans. Field observations
   of several investigators indicate the likely presence of magnesian
   calcite coatings on planktonic particles, and provide evidence for
   possible recrystallization of biogenic magnesian particles in the marine
   environment.},

Title = {Spatially Explicit Assessment of Social Vulnerability in Coastal China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Social vulnerability assessment has been recognized as a reliable and
   effective measure for informing coastal hazard management. Although
   significant advances have been made in the study of social vulnerability
   for over two decades, China's social vulnerability profiles are mainly
   based on administrative unit. Consequently, no detailed distribution is
   provided, and the capability to diagnose human risks is hindered. In
   this study, we established a social vulnerability index (SoVI) in 2000
   and 2010 at a spatial resolution of 250 m for China's coastal zone by
   combining the potential exposure index (PEI) and social resilience index
   (SRI). The PEI with a 250 m resolution was obtained by fitting the
   census data and multisource remote sensing data in random forest model.
   The county-level SRI was evaluated through principal component analysis
   based on 33 socioeconomic variables. For identifying the spatiotemporal
   change, we used global and local Moran's I to map clusters of SoVI and
   its percent change in the decade. The results suggest the following: (1)
   Counties in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and eastern
   Guangzhou, except several small hot spots, exhibited the most
   vulnerability, especially in urban areas, whereas those in Hainan and
   southern Liaoning presented the least vulnerability. (2) Notable
   increases were emphasized in Tianjin, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl
   River Delta. The spatiotemporal variation and heterogeneity in social
   vulnerability obtained through this analysis will provide a scientific
   basis to decision-makers to focus risk mitigation effort.},

Journal = {NATURE},

Volume = {432},
Number = {7014},
Pages = {209-211},

Abstract = {Primordial solidification of the Moon (or its uppermost layer) resulted
   in the formation of a variety of rock types that subsequently melted and
   mixed to produce the compositional diversity observed in the lunar
   sample suite(1,2). The initial rocks to crystallize from this Moon-wide
   molten layer (the magma ocean) contained olivine and pyroxene and were
   compositionally less evolved than the plagioclase-rich rocks that
   followed. The last stage of crystallization, representing the last few
   per cent of the magma ocean, produced materials that are strongly
   enriched in incompatible elements including potassium (K), the rare
   earth elements (REE) and phosphorus (P)-termed KREEP3-5. The decay of
   radioactive elements in KREEP, such as uranium and thorium, is generally
   thought to provide the thermal energy necessary for more recent lunar
   magmatism(4,6,7). The ages of KREEP-rich samples are, however, confined
   to the earliest periods of lunar magmatism between 3.8 and 4.6 billion
   years (Gyr) ago(8,9), providing no physical evidence that KREEP is
   directly involved in more recent lunar magmatism. But here we present
   evidence that KREEP magmatism extended for an additional 1 Gyr, based on
   analyses of the youngest dated lunar sample.},

Title = {Modeling studies of dissolved organic matter cycling in Santa Barbara
   Basin (CA, USA) sediments},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {100-119},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Here we describe new reaction-transport models for the cycling of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM, both dissolved organic carbon {[}DOC] and
   dissolved organic nitrogen {[}DON]) in anoxic marine sediments, and
   apply these models to data from Santa Barbara Basin sediment cores
   (maximum depth of 4.6 m). Model results show that most organic carbon
   (and nitrogen) flow in the sediments occurs through reactive DOM
   intermediates that turn over rapidly to produce inorganic
   remineralization endproducts. Refractory DOM is also produced, and the
   vast majority of this refractory DOM is not remineralized and either
   escapes as a benthic flux across the sediment-water interface or is
   buried. Except near the sediment surface, refractory DOM represents
   >95\% of the total pore water DOM. Pore water DOM appears to be
   consistently depleted in nitrogen as compared to its source organic
   matter, which may be the result of differential production of
   carbon-versus nitrogen-containing refractory DOM during
   remineralization.
   Refractory DOC (DOCr) in Santa Barbara Basin sediment pore waters is
   largely produced from degradation of sediment particulate organic carbon
   (POC). In addition, there is an upward basal flux of DOCr that is
   strongly depleted in C-14 (-810\%). The Delta C-14 value of DOCr varies
   according to its source, ranging from +60 parts per thousand (a
   component of surface sediment POC enriched with radiocarbon from nuclear
   weapons testing in the 1960's) to -810 parts per thousand (the basal DOC
   flux). Each contributes to the DOCr benthic flux, which has a
   weighted-average Delta C-14 value of -40 parts per thousand. The
   model-determined DOCr benthic flux is roughly half of the total DOC
   benthic flux, consistent with observations in the literature that
   sediments are a source of both labile and refractory DOC to bottom
   waters. These results support previous arguments that sediment benthic
   fluxes represent an important source of refractory DOC to the oceans.
   The benthic flux of refractory DOC from these sediments may also
   contribute pre-aged DOC to the water column if the different
   sub-components of the anoxic pore water DOCr pool with differing
   radiocarbon ages have differing reactivities in the oxic marine water
   column. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A region of exceptionally high macrofaunal benthic biomass exists in
   Barrow Canyon, implying a carbon export process that is locally
   concentrated. Here we offer an explanation for this benthic
   ``hotspot{''} using shipboard data together with a set of dynamical
   equations. Repeat occupations of the Distributed Biological Observatory
   transect in Barrow Canyon reveal that when the northward flow is strong
   and the density front in the canyon is sharp, plumes of fluorescence and
   oxygen extend from the pycnocline to the seafloor in the vicinity of the
   hotspot. By solving the quasi-geostrophic omega equation with an
   analytical flow field fashioned after the observations, we diagnose the
   vertical velocity in the canyon. This reveals that, as the along stream
   flow converges into the canyon, it drives a secondary circulation cell
   with strong downwelling on the cyclonic side of the northward flow. The
   downwelling quickly advects material from the pycnocline to the seafloor
   in a vertical plume analogous to those seen in the observations. The
   plume occurs only when the phytoplankton reside in the pycnocline, since
   the near-surface vertical velocity is weak, also consistent with the
   observations. Using a wind-based proxy to represent the strength of the
   northward flow and hence the pumping, in conjunction with a
   satellite-derived phytoplankton source function, we construct a time
   series of carbon supply to the bottom of Barrow Canyon.},

Abstract = {Global focus is gradually turning away from crude oil as a major of
   energy to natural gas due to its abundant availability, environmental
   friendliness and cost effectiveness, this has effectively increased the
   transboundary pipeline networks with minimal consideration to the impact
   at which the offshore segment of such projects could have on the
   environment.
   This paper considers Nigeria's present engagement in transboundary
   transportation of 11.3 billion cubic meters per day (11.3 BCMPD) of
   natural gas to Benin, Togo and Ghana for thermal and industrial uses
   through a 1,033 km pipeline network out of which 617 km is a submerged
   offshore pipeline network. The study is necessitated by the alarming
   frequency at which hydrocarbon pipeline failure Occurs in Nigeria with
   the resulting economy, environmental and human consequences. It was
   discovered that any failure along the offshore segment of the
   pipe-length poses high risk of hydrate formation and dissolution of some
   constituents which could result to problems ranging from behavioral
   nature (e.g. fish excitement, increased activities and scattering in the
   waterbody) to chronic poisoning, fire outbreak, loss of human lives and
   livestock and climate change.
   Development of pragmatic management scheme, robust leak detection model
   and predictive model on natural gas flow pattern in waterbody are
   recommended.},

Abstract = {Dielectric Elastomers (DEs) are a very promising technology for the
   development of energy harvesting devices based on the
   variable-capacitance electrostatic generator principle. As compared to
   other technologies, DE Generators (DEGs) are solid-state energy
   conversion systems which potentially feature: 1) large energy densities,
   2) good energy conversion efficiency that is rather independent of cycle
   frequency, 3) easiness of manufacturing and assembling, 4) high shock
   resistance, 5) silent operation, 6) low cost. Envisioned applications
   for DEGs are in devices that convert ocean wave energy into usable
   electricity.
   This paper introduces the Lozenge-Shaped DEG (LS-DEG) that is a specific
   type of planar DE transducer with one degree of freedom. A LS-DEG
   consists of a planar DE membrane that is connected along its perimeter
   to the links of a parallelogram four-bar mechanism. As the mechanism is
   put into reciprocal motion, the DE membrane varies its capacitance that
   is then employed as a charge pump to convert external mechanical work
   into usable electricity.
   Specifically, this paper describes the functioning principle of LS-DEGs,
   and provides a comparison between different hyper-elastic models that
   can be used to predict the energy harvesting performances of realistic
   prototypes. Case studies are presented which address the constrained
   optimization of LS-DEGs subjected to failure criteria and practical
   design constraints.},

Abstract = {Collaborative governance between ecological environment and climate
   change is a novel signature in China's policy agenda. However, such
   coordination remains understudied, especially at the local level. Using
   the principal component analysis, entropy evaluation methods, and the
   Coupling Coordination Degree Model (CCDM), we evaluated the level of
   coordination between carbon and air quality mitigation from 34
   low-carbon pilot cities in China. We also illustrated the mechanism and
   policy formation that leads to different coupling patterns at the local
   level using three case studies. We found that most pilot cities perform
   a medium level of coupling coordination between low carbon development
   and air quality. The result reveals that most low-carbon pilot cities
   score relatively well in low-carbon development. Further, there is a
   significant cleavage in air quality between cities in the North and
   those in the South, indicating pilot cities in the South coordinate
   better than those in the North. In particular, pilot programs in the
   Southwest and Southeast coastal region perform well in collaborative
   governance, while the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is rated poorly
   because of the gap between air quality and low carbon development. Also,
   we found that the same low-carbon policy might have heterogeneous
   effects on different air pollutants and across different regions. The
   local government should adopt low-carbon development policies that
   address local level specific environmental and economic conditions to
   maximize their air pollution mitigation benefits.},

   Radial Sand Ridges},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sea-level-rise (SLR) induced by global climate would by changing tidal
   dynamics in the deltaic and coastal regimes aggravate inundation risks.
   In order to have a thorough understanding of the tidal responses to SLR
   in the RSR of the South Yellow Sea, a comprehensive analysis on the
   tidal and tidal components' responses to SLR are conducted. Spatial
   variations of tides and tidal components between SLR scenarios and
   present-day scenario are examined. Strong spatial variation in tidal
   responses to SLR occurs over the RSR. Further investigation reveals it
   is the semidiurnal tide (S2) in control of the tidal range evolution
   under SLR in this area. Strong spatial variability in the primary tidal
   amplitudes' evolution is found between northern Dongsha shoal and
   southern Lansha-yang channel in the RSR. The significantly enhanced
   shallow water tidal components, M4 and MS4, lead to increase tidal
   distortion(flood-dominant) in the nearshore under SLR. In addition, the
   natural period for tidal resonance in the RSR tends to be smaller and
   the amplification due to resonance enhances. The evolution in tidal
   asymmetry and tidal resonance adjusts the timing and height of the local
   highwater levels. Therefore, conclusion in this study can be used for
   reference to future high-water level prediction in the RSR. (C) 2021

Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {238},
Pages = {305-314},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Materials based on biochar have good application prospects in the field
   of solar interfacial evaporation. However, due to their amorphous
   structure, most biochar materials often require additional chemical
   treatment for interfacial evaporation, which is inconsistent with the
   original intention for low cost and easy fabrication. Here, a solar
   absorption layer made of loofah sponge biochar prepared by direct
   compression and carbonization and a substrate with water conveyance and
   heat insulation effects were combined into a squashed loofah sponge
   biochar interfacial evaporator (SLSBIE). The SLSBIE achieved an
   evaporation rate of 1.565 kg m(-2) h(-1) and an evaporation efficiency
   of 80.66\% under 1 sun (1000 W m(+2)). The good performance of the
   SLSBIE is mainly due to the porosity (554.1 m(2) g(+1)), light
   absorptivity (89.21\%), and hydrophilicity (rich in C-O and C=O) of the
   structure of loofah sponge biochar, as well as the optimization. The
   heat loss and energy balance of LSBIE were analyzed in detail. The
   measured concentrations of Na+, Mg+, K+, Ca2+ and total dissolved solids
   of condensate water met the standards of the World Health Organization
   for drinking water, which indicated that SLSBIE had good practicability.},

Abstract = {While economic theory acknowledges that some features of technology
   (e.g., indivisibilities, economies of scale and specialization) can
   fundamentally violate the traditional convexity assumption, almost all
   empirical studies accept the convexity property on faith. In this
   contribution, we apply two alternative flexible production technologies
   to measure total factor productivity growth and test the significance of
   the convexity axiom using a nonparametric test of closeness between
   unknown distributions. Based on unique field level data on the petroleum
   industry, the empirical results reveal significant differences,
   indicating that this production technology is most likely non-convex.
   Furthermore, we also show the impact of convexity on answers to
   traditional convergence questions in the productivity growth literature.

Abstract = {The combination of ocean warming and acidification as a result of
   increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered to be a
   significant threat to calcifying organisms and their activities on coral
   reefs. How these global changes impact the important roles of
   decalcifying organisms (bioeroders) in the regulation of carbonate
   budgets, however, is less understood. To address this important
   question, the effects of a range of past, present and future CO2
   emission scenarios (temperature+acidification) on the excavating sponge
   Cliona orientalis Thiele, 1900 were explored over 12weeks in early
   summer on the southern Great Barrier Reef. C. orientalis is a widely
   distributed bioeroder on many reefs, and hosts symbiotic dinoflagellates
   of the genus Symbiodinium. Our results showed that biomass production
   and bioerosion rates of C. orientalis were similar under a
   pre-industrial scenario and a present day (control) scenario.
   Symbiodinium population density in the sponge tissue was the highest
   under the pre-industrial scenario, and decreased towards the two future
   scenarios with sponge replicates under the business-as-usual' CO2
   emission scenario exhibiting strong bleaching. Despite these changes,
   biomass production and the ability of the sponge to erode coral
   carbonate materials both increased under the future scenarios. Our study
   suggests that C. orientalis will likely grow faster and have higher
   bioerosion rates in a high CO2 future than at present, even with
   significant bleaching. Assuming that our findings hold for excavating
   sponges in general, increased sponge biomass coupled with accelerated
   bioerosion may push coral reefs towards net erosion and negative
   carbonate budgets in the future.},

Abstract = {The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar, or NISAR, mission is an
   Earth-mapping radar observatory to be launched from Sriharikota (India)
   in 2022. This mission is a collaboration between the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Indian Space
   Research Organization (ISRO). This spacecraft will carry two instruments
   that will operate at radar wavelengths (L and Sband) and will provide
   data for understanding changes in the Earth's land surface. The
   scientific data from this mission will revolutionize our understanding
   of the causes and consequences of land surface changes on Earth, ranging
   from Solid Earth Deformation in the form of natural hazards like
   earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and landslides, to ecosystem
   disturbances, to changes in the cryosphere (measurements of polar ice
   caps, ice sheets and sea ice).
   A nominal Reference Observation Plan, that repeats roughly every 12-24
   days, developed prior to launch by the NISAR Mission Planning team, in
   consultation with the Science Team, will form the basis of science data
   collection by the payload instruments onboard the NISAR observatory
   after launch. Scheduling of science observations for the mission
   requires accounting for limited spacecraft resources like onboard data
   storage, downlink capacity, energy/power, thermal limits and instrument
   duty cycles. In addition to nominal science data collection, the project
   has a Level 1 requirement to respond to requests for urgent data
   acquisition over disaster sites (natural or anthropogenic) by scheduling
   new acquisitions within 24 hrs of notification and delivering science
   data within 5 hours of data acquisition. This capability is to be
   exercised on a `best-efforts basis'.
   While the definition of what constitutes an `urgent request', and how
   such requests would be submitted to the project, is within the domain of
   the Science Team, the Mission System team is responsible for developing
   the baseline operations concept and implementation approach for
   responding to such requests. Given the `best-efforts' nature of this
   requirement, a few high-level guidelines have been developed to help
   guide the formulation of the operations concept, and are presented in
   this paper. Requests for urgent response data will be accommodated
   following the guiding principle of minimal to no impact on nominal
   science and planned engineering activities. No change in satellite orbit
   or attitude will be made for urgent response. Restricting response
   approaches to only changing the downlink and/or ground processing
   priority for existing observations, and adding new observations only in
   areas where NISAR will not be nominally imaging, allows for minimal
   impact on the Reference science Observation Plan. No instrument mode
   changes will be allowed for urgent response (except for high-priority
   requests), and no new observations that impact either planned science or
   engineering activities will be scheduled. Additionally, data requests
   must fit within the available project resource margins (both spacecraft
   and ground resources are to be evaluated). Both JPL and ISRO will be
   involved at various steps of the implementation, irrespective of whether
   the urgent request is for L-SAR (NASA instrument) or S-SAR (ISRO
   instrument) or a joint dataset.},

Abstract = {An engineering-scale seawater reverse osmosis-pressure retarded osmosis
   (SWRO-PRO) system was designed and deployed to evaluate the energy
   recovery during seawater desalination through salinity gradient energy.
   Experimental data on energy recovery and consumption were collected from
   a PRO system composed of up to five 4040 spiral-wound membrane elements,
   utilizing freshwater and RO concentrate to drive permeation. During
   experimental testing, specific energy recoveries as high as 0.14 kW
   h/m(3) were achieved; however, energy consumption due to pressure losses
   in the system reduced the net specific energy recovery to a maximum of
   -0.07 kW h/m(3). A 100\% increase in energy recovery or 50\% decrease in
   energy consumption would be necessary to yield a positive net energy
   recovery. Also, a combined approach of simultaneously increasing energy
   recovery and decreasing energy consumption would be a more desirable
   path for SWRO-PRO to become an energy positive technology. Experimental
   data were then paired with modeling software utilizing a solution
   diffusion-with-defects model to demonstrate the presence and extent of
   defects in the membrane structure that allow for pressure-driven pore
   flow. The solution-diffusion-with-defect model explains the lower than
   expected water permeability and salt rejection often seen in
   experimental PRO results. Integrating this model into future software
   will allow for more accurate simulation of larger systems and aid in
   investigations of PRO scale-up.},

Abstract = {Coastal and marine tourism (CMT) has become a growing and important
   subsector of the tourism industry in recent years. To identify the state
   of and trends in the field, a bibliometric analysis of CMT was conducted
   to evaluate global productivity over the past 31 years (1990-2020). All
   relevant publications in the analysis were extracted from the Web of
   Science Core Collection database. As a result, the review found that the
   identified 6190 documents showed an upward trend during this time
   period. The most productive and influential countries, institutions, and
   authors were also identified in this analysis, and the distribution of
   subject categories and journals was analyzed. VOSviewer was used to
   analyze the coauthorships among countries, institutions, and authors.
   Based on an analysis of the high-frequency keyword co-occurrence
   network, four major CMT research topics were identified: (1) the
   sustainable development of CMT, (2) the impact of CMT on destinations,
   (3) CMT management and conservation, and (4) the impact of climate
   change on CMT. This analysis can help reveal and determine the research
   focus and trends in the CMT field.},

Abstract = {The Gulf of Kachchh (Gulf), India, an ecologically rich habitat, has a
   wide variety of activities, such as extensive salt farming along the
   coast, brine release from salt farms, maintenance dredging by ports and
   disposal of dredged material, release of hot water from thermal power
   plants, and navigation. Management of coastal and marine areas by
   maintaining the balance between the developmental activities and
   protection of marine environment is a challenging task for coastal
   managers and requires a complete understanding of the physical,
   chemical, and biological aspects of the system. In this study, a
   two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (MIKE-21) was developed for Gulf of
   Kachchh with rectangular grid resolution of 450 by 450 m to understand
   the role of circulation pattern for mixing capacity of the Gulf. The
   model was calibrated with tide and current at predetermined locations.
   The model predictions show good agreement with the measured tide and
   current data. The model-predicted amplitudes and phases of major tidal
   constituents at four locations compare well with the observed data. The
   root mean square error for model predictions was found to be within
   10\%. Analysis of residual currents obtained from a 29.5-days simulation
   revealed the formation of eddies in the outer Gulf. Presence of these
   eddies and the magnitudes of residual currents indicate the mixing
   capacity of the central and outer Gulf. The results strengthen and
   extend understanding of circulation and mixing patterns in the
   management of the habitat.},

Abstract = {We model supply chain of an industry solution equipment manufacturer,
   where the merchandise is sold worldwide, but suppliers are mostly
   located in Asia. The preferred shipment of supply is the ocean shipment,
   and it takes about 5 weeks. Premium air shipment can be used to expedite
   delivery, but it costs substantially higher. To hedge against
   variability of demand and to satisfy customer service level, a certain
   level of safety stock is needed but inventory carrying cost can be high.
   Therefore, a careful fulfillment strategy is very important to balance
   serviceability and cost. A supply chain simulation model is developed to
   analyze the order fulfillment and supply planning process for the
   business to identify efficient supply chain strategy. The model
   simulates and evaluates three key performance metrics; serviceability,
   inventory costs and premium transportation costs, and their
   interactions.},

Abstract = {It is very important to estimate the waves generated by a small vessel
   so as to investigate their effects on floating bodies within the scope
   of fisheries and ocean engineering. Simplified methods for estimating
   the wave heights and periods of ship waves have been presented in
   previous studies. However, estimating the direction of ship waves is not
   easy. The focus of the present study is to develop an analytical
   technique to determine the direction of ship waves based on the
   measurements in field experiments. The multiple signal classification
   (MUSIC) method is newly proposed for determining the direction of ship
   waves. For high ship speeds, the directional spectrum of ship waves
   estimated by MUSIC resulted in a sharp monotone peak, and the estimated
   directions of ship waves were very similar to the results of field
   experiments using an actual small vessel. The proposed MUSIC method has
   thus been confirmed to be effective in estimating ship wave directions
   with high resolution.},

Title = {OPTIMIZING THE PANEL AREA OF A PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM IN RELATION TO THE

Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Due to poor sizing, grid-connected photovoltaic systems often
   underexploit the capacity of the static inverter resulting in reduced
   efficiency and an increase in the cost of energy. The objectives of the
   present project are:
   to show the effects of an oversized solar module area on the efficiency
   and profitability of a system
   to define the conditions required for oversizing.
   The simulations performed in a previous phase of the project showed that
   higher profitability was attained with the power of the photovoltaic
   field area sized between 40 and 80\% (depending on the conditions) above
   the nominal power of the static inverter. The validation of these
   results was obtained from two sites:
   Herdern (near Zurich/Switzerland/lat 47.5 degrees N/long 8.4 degrees
   E/410 m above sea level) with three installations of 4.4, 3.8 and 3.4 kW
   S.T.C. for an inverter of nominal 3.3 kW a.c.
   Lausanne (Switzerland/lat 46.6 degrees N/long 6.6 degrees E/410 m above
   sea level) with three installations of 5.6, 4.0 and 2.4 kW S.T.C. for a
   static inverter of nominal 3.4 kW a.c.
   Detailed results are available for tests performed on both
   installations. The results clearly demonstrate the difference between
   optimal energy production and optimal energy cost. Finally,
   recommendations are given for optimization calculations of the
   photovoltaic module area and new construction directives for static
   inverters with a view to oversizing are issued.},

Abstract = {Improving the performance of anode is a crucial step for increasing
   output power of marine sediment microbial fuel cells (MSMFCs) to drive
   marine monitor to work for a long term on the ocean floor. A pyrolyzed
   iron phthalocyanine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes composite
   (FePc/MWCNTs) has been utilized as a novel nodified anode in the MSMFC.
   Its structure of the composite modified anode and electrochemical
   performance have been investigated respectively in the paper. There is a
   substantial improvement in electron-transfer efficiency from the
   bacteria biofilm to the modified anode via the pyrolyzed FePc/MWCNTs
   composite based on their cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Tafel curves. The
   electron transfer kinetic activity of the FePc/MWCNTs-modified anode is
   1.86 times higher than of the unmodified anode. The maximum power
   density of the modified MSMFC was 572.3 +/- 14mW m(-2), which is 2.6
   times larger than the unmodified one (218.3 +/- 11 mW m(-2)). The anodic
   structure and cell scale would be greatly minimized to obtain the same
   output power by the modified MSMFC, so that it will make the MSMFC to be
   easily deployed on the remote ocean floor. Therefore, it would have a
   great significance for us to design a novel and renewable long term
   power source. Finally, a novel molecular synergetic mechanism is
   proposed to elucidate its excellent electrochemical performance.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are characterized by continued human influence, e.g.
   with drainage ditches, coastal dikes or landscape restoration. In
   addition, it is important to understand the complex interactions with
   the sea to predict impacts of further development. In the present study
   the aim was to analyze surface and subsurface flow in a coastal wetland
   located at the Baltic Sea coastline near Warnemunde (Germany) to
   quantify water exchange with the Baltic Sea and analyze the effect of a
   storm flood event on saline intrusion. A 3-D transient groundwater model
   and a one-dimensional surface water model were set up and calibrated by
   using hydraulic head measurements. The results indicate that in addition
   to ditch flow, groundwater discharge to the Baltic Sea often has a
   significant influence on the overall water budget of the fen. From the
   transient modelling it became evident that water exchange between
   groundwater in the fen and the Baltic Sea depends on sea level and very
   often fluctuates between seaward and landward flow directions on daily
   to weekly time scales.},

Volume = {240},

Abstract = {The viscosity of synthetic peridotite liquid has been investigated at
   high pressures using in-situ falling sphere viscometry by combining a
   multi-anvil technique with synchrotron radiation. We used a newly
   designed capsule containing a small recessed reservoir outside of the
   hot spot of the heater, in which a viscosity marker sphere is embedded
   in a forsterite+enstatite mixture having a higher solidus temperature
   than the peridotitc. This experimental setup prevents spheres from
   falling before a stable temperature above the liquidus is established
   and thus avoids difficulties in evaluating viscosities from velocities
   of spheres falling through a partially molten sample.
   Experiments have been performed between 2.8 and 13 GPa at temperatures
   ranging from 2043 to 2523 K. Measured viscosities range from 0.019 (+/-
   0.004) to 0.13 (+/- 0.02) Pa s. At constant temperature, viscosity
   increases with increasing pressure up to similar to 8.5 GPa but then
   decreases between similar to 8.5 and 13 GPa. The change in the pressure
   dependence of viscosity is likely associated with structural changes of
   the liquid that occur upon compression. By combining our results with
   recently published 0.1 MPa peridotite liquid viscosities {[}D.B.
   Dingwell, C. Courtial, D. Giordano, A. Nichols, Viscosity of peridotite
   liquid, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 226 (2004) 127-138.], the experimental
   data can be described by a non-Arrhenian, empirical Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman
   equation, which has been modified by adding a term to account for the
   observed pressure dependence of viscosity. This equation reproduces
   measured viscosities to within 0.08 log(10)-units on average. We use
   this model to calculate viscosities of a peridotitic magma ocean along a
   liquid adiabat to a depth of similar to 400 km and discuss possible
   effects on viscosity at greater pressures and temperatures than
   experimentally investigated. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Tidal stream turbines: With or without a Gearbox?},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {74-88},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a review-based comparative study addressing the
   critical issue of tidal stream turbine drivetrain options. Indeed, tidal
   stream turbines are still in development stages with few industrial
   project deployments. Their technology is not as mature as wind turbine
   technology, while facing immersion constraints where have to withstand
   high loading and harsh submarine conditions. These constraints make
   tidal stream turbines potentially suffering from higher failures rate.
   Evidence of this potential higher failures rate highlights the need for
   adopting the most resilient drivetrain options with a higher degree of
   maintainability. Indeed, even though tidal stream and wind turbine
   drivetrains remain similar, the load variability differs.
   In competitiveness and large deployment contexts, tidal stream turbines
   are facing many challenges. The drivetrain configuration choice is one
   of the most important one that should address the question: with or
   without a gearbox? Indeed, the gearbox should be one of the important
   concerns for future tidal farm operators (as it is for wind farm
   operators), mainly because of its highest downtime per failure amongst
   all the tidal stream turbine drivetrain components.
   This paper will therefore address this critical issue by proposing a
   review-based drivetrain options comparison and discussing potential and
   promising topology options as the magnetic gearbox.},

Abstract = {California, Oregon, and Washington produced 98\% of the commercial U.S.
   pear crop from 2003-2005, consisting of `Williams' ('Bartlett') (51\%),
   `Beurre Anjou' (36\%), `Beurre Bosc' (11\%) and 2\% others, mainly
   `Doyenne du Comice', `Red Clapp's Favorite', `Seckel' and `Concorde'.
   Declining processing demand has heightened interest and evaluation of
   new fresh market alternatives. Production, post-harvest quality, and
   consumer sensory evaluation data from 2001 to 2006 has allowed
   identification of several new potentially commercially valuable
   cultivars. Among the more favorably rated candidates are fire blight
   resistant selections developed at the USDA Appalachian Fruit Research
   Station in Kearneysville, West Virginia. These are `Blake's Pride' (OHUS
   66131-021), US 71655-014 and `Sunrise' (OHUS 66170-047), which both
   bloom and harvest before or with `Bartlett'. `Blake's Pride' trees Yield
   consistently but dry weather is required for optimum fruit finish.
   `Sunrise' trees are also productive and fruit maintains a clear finish.
   Also promising is Cinnamon (R) (Fowler Nurseries, Inc., Newcastle, CA,
   USA), a fully russeted sport of `Bartlett' which blooms before or with
   `Bartlett' but harvests about two weeks later in California. `Abate
   Fetel' and `Concorde' have been difficult to ripen in California, and
   `Concorde' has shown some internal browning after one month of storage.},

Title = {Nitrogen source and rate effects on the production of buffalograss

Abstract = {Application of livestock manure to crop lands is one method of recycling
   nutrients. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of
   applying solid cattle (Bos spp.) manure (SCM), liquid swine (Sus spp.)
   effluent (LSE), or commercial fertilizer (CF; urea) at three application
   rates (0, 120, or 240 kg N ha(-1)) on the yield, plant canopy height,
   and nutritive value (crude protein, CP; and in vitro organic matter
   digestibility, IVOMD) of buffalograss {[}Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.)
   Engelm.] forage grown with irrigation during a 4-yr period. Two forage
   harvests were made in each of four growing seasons, and canopy height
   was measured before each harvest. For all N sources, seasonal dry matter
   yield (DMY), canopy height, and CP increased as N rate increased during
   each of the 3 yr following establishment. However, as the buffalograss
   stand aged, the yield, canopy height, and nutritive value of forage
   declined. Given the availability of livestock manure in the High Plains
   region of the USA and the need to recycle this by-product from confined
   animal feeding operations, the application of livestock manure to
   buffalograss grown with irrigation for hay or pasture could be a viable
   and sustainable production system. Future work should address the
   long-term effects of applying livestock manure to soils in relation to
   nutrient loading and water quality.},

Title = {A model of the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {A three dimensional model of Arctic Ocean circulation and mixing, with a
   horizontal resolution of 18 km, is overlain by a biogeochemical model
   resolving the physical, chemical and biological transport and
   transformations of phosphorus, alkalinity, oxygen and carbon, including
   the air-sea exchange of dissolved gases and the riverine delivery of
   dissolved organic carbon. The model qualitatively captures the observed
   regional and seasonal trends in surface ocean PO4, dissolved inorganic
   carbon, total alkalinity, and pCO(2). Integrated annually, over the
   basin, the model suggests a net annual uptake of 59 Tg C a(-1), within
   the range of published estimates based on the extrapolation of local
   observations (20-199 Tg C a(-1)). This flux is attributable to the
   cooling (increasing solubility) of waters moving into the basin, mainly
   from the subpolar North Atlantic. The air-sea flux is regulated
   seasonally and regionally by sea-ice cover, which modulates both air-sea
   gas transfer and the photosynthetic production of organic matter, and by
   the delivery of riverine dissolved organic carbon (RDOC), which drive
   the regional contrasts in pCO(2) between Eurasian and North American
   coastal waters. Integrated over the basin, the delivery and
   remineralization of RDOC reduces the net oceanic CO2 uptake by similar
   to 10\%.},

Title = {Granulation of the autochthonous planktonic bacterial community of
   seawater for saline wastewater treatment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) process is a fast-growing sustainable
   biological treatment for wastewater. Activated sludge (AS) is the
   standard inoculum used for cultivating AGS, even for the treatment of
   saline wastewaters. However, the application of the allochthonous AS
   community for both developing halotolerant AGS and establishing
   biological nutrient removal (BNR) under saline conditions is a
   challenging task. To circumvent this problem, herein, the cultivation of
   AGS directly from the autochthonous planktonic bacterial community of
   seawater was investigated. For developing halophilic AGS, a sequencing
   batch reactor was operated by directly supplying nutrient-amended
   seawater without inoculum (i.e., AS or AGS). The approach described
   herein succeeded in rapidly granulating the planktonic bacteria of
   seawater and establishing BNR at a 34 ppt salinity. The ammonium and
   total nitrogen removals of 92-100\% and 81-90\% were observed during
   22-100 days of start-up, respectively. Interestingly, nitrite
   accumulation was not observed under saline conditions. Phosphate removal
   progressively improved and stabilized at over 76\% within 2 months of
   start-up. The phosphate removal profiles comprised of P release and
   uptake phases, which are typical to those of the enhanced biological
   phosphorus removal mechanism. The granulation of planktonic microbes
   involved distinct events such as the formation of micro-aggregates,
   macro-aggregates, and granules but not flocs. Granular growth was
   observed within few days, suggesting that the granulation of the
   autochthonous planktonic microbial community of seawater is a rapid
   phenomenon. The granules were dense (1.5 g ml(-1)) and compact (SVI5: 6
   ml g(-1)) and had an excellent settling velocity (41.2 m h(-1)) on day
   25. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that AGS had lesser
   bacterial diversity than the seawater microbiome due to the enrichment
   of alpha-proteobacteria. The removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was not
   significantly impacted at the lower salinities of 25 and 17 ppt.
   Furthermore, the halophilic AGS was able to achieve an efficient BNR and
   treatment of real seafood processing wastewater without acclimation.
   Thus, granulation of the autochthonous halophilic bacteria of seawater
   is a novel strategy for developing halophilic AGS and to achieve a high
   BNR under saline conditions.},

   attractant to the surf?},

Abstract = {With the recovery of whale populations, carcass strandings on beaches
   are growing. Beach burial is a common management option for stranded
   carcasses. However, communities fear shark attraction following leachate
   transport to the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge. Here, a
   sediment column mesocosm experiment indicated that carcasses can be a
   localised source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phosphate and
   ammonium to groundwater. The spatial reach of the leachate plume was <
   2.5 m, while the temporal stabilisation occurred over 100-300 days. No
   significant chemical signals were observed under a beach-buried carcass,
   implying effective attenuation of decomposition plumes. For beaches with
   conditions similar to our one-directional, fast flowing sediment
   experiment generating extreme groundwater contamination, it is unlikely
   that any leachate from a whale carcass would reach the ocean if buried >
   25 m onshore. Therefore, carcass leachate plumes would only potentially
   attract sharks to the surf under specific conditions not experienced
   during our experiments.},

Abstract = {E-textile sensors present a real potential since they can be integrated
   into unobtrusive systems such as garments. They allow the monitoring of
   physiological parameters without disturbing the operator. Although they
   are mainly used in the medical field for personal health care, these
   sensors are increasingly used in our daily activities. In sports, at
   work or at home, embedded sensors are used for on-line human monitoring
   and for improving the quality of life. The work presented here concerns
   the processing and evaluation of new sensors for monitoring respiratory
   activity. Six piezo-resistive membranes are integrated into the backrest
   of a seat similar to the one you would expect on a commercial aircraft,
   allowing for non-obtrusive monitoring. The objective is to extract valid
   and reliable features from the fusion of these sensors in order to
   provide a non-obtrusive alternative to chest-straps for monitoring
   respiratory activity. Results show the developed fusion algorithm
   performs better than a worn reference (chest strap) both in nominal and
   agitated contexts for monitoring breathing rate.},

Title = {The seasonal cycle in sinking particle fluxes off Vancouver Island,

Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {We have made year-long observations of sinking particle fluxes with
   sequential sediment traps moored at a depth of 200 m at three sites
   proceeding offshore from Vancouver Island, Canada in water depths of
   500-2500 m. Total particle flux and biogenic silica decreased offshore
   as expected in an eastern boundary current regime. No obvious gradient
   was observed in POC, and CaCO3 was proportionally greater offshore. Even
   there POC dominated over particulate inorganic carbon (as CaCO3)
   indicating a net removal of CO2 from surface water by biological
   activity. Common to all three sites, we observed an annual cycle in
   total particle flux, with highest fluxes during spring/summer,
   reflecting the higher primary production during these seasons. In spite
   of changes in total fluxes, the ratios between organic C, CaCO3 and
   biogenic silica of the sedimented material did not change over the
   annual cycle. Atomic C-organic/N-total ratios were highest in the summer
   and lowest in the winter, possibly reflecting an increase in the
   relative contribution of lithogenic particles during winter. The
   isotopic composition of sinking particulate nitrogen (delta(15)N(total))
   tended to be lighter during periods of higher fluxes, most likely
   reflecting variation in relative nutrient utilization and length of the
   food chain. The delta(13)C(organic) composition of sinking particles
   varied among sites, probably reflecting differences in planktonic
   species composition; contributions of terrestrial organic matter appear
   unlikely. Currents at 50 m depth were higher and more variable at the
   inshore site, and temperature and salinity were also more variable,
   consistent with the tendency for dominance of diatoms (silica shells) in
   more energetic environments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {Exploring local adaptation and the ocean acidification seascape studies

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},

Pages = {1053-1064},
Abstract = {The California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), a temperate
   marine region dominated by episodic upwelling, is predicted to
   experience rapid environmental change in the future due to ocean
   acidification. The aragonite saturation state within the California
   Current System is predicted to decrease in the future with
   near-permanent undersaturation conditions expected by the year 2050.
   Thus, the CCLME is a critical region to study due to the rapid rate of
   environmental change that resident organisms will experience and because
   of the economic and societal value of this coastal region. Recent
   efforts by a research consortium - the Ocean Margin Ecosystems Group for
   Acidification Studies (OMEGAS) - has begun to characterize a portion of
   the CCLME; both describing the spatial mosaic of pH in coastal waters
   and examining the responses of key calcification-dependent benthic
   marine organisms to natural variation in pH and to changes in carbonate
   chemistry that are expected in the coming decades. In this review, we
   present the OMEGAS strategy of co-locating sensors and oceanographic
   observations with biological studies on ben-thic marine invertebrates,
   specifically measurements of functional traits such as
   calcification-related processes and genetic variation in populations
   that are locally adapted to conditions in a particular region of the
   coast. Highlighted in this contribution are (1) the OMEGAS sensor
   network that spans the west coast of the US from central Oregon to
   southern California, (2) initial findings of the carbonate chemistry
   amongst the OMEGAS study sites, and (3) an overview of the biological
   data that describes the acclimatization and the adaptation capacity of
   key benthic marine invertebrates within the CCLME.},

Abstract = {In the present work, a spar-buoy scaled model was designed and built
   through a ``Lab-on-Sea{''} unit, equipped with an energy harvesting
   system. Such a system is based on deformable bands, which are loyal to
   the unit, to convert wave motion energy into electricity by means of
   piezo patch transducers. In a preliminary stage, the scaled model,
   suitable for tests in a controlled ripples-type wave motion channel, was
   tested in order to verify the ``fixed-point{''} assumption in pitch and
   roll motions and, consequently, to optimize energy harvesting. A special
   type of structure was designed, numerically simulated, and
   experimentally verified. The proposed solution represents an
   advantageous compromise between the lightness of the used materials and
   the amount of recoverable energy. The energy, which was obtained from
   the piezo patch transducers during the simulations in the laboratory,
   was found to be enough to self-sustain the feasible on-board sensors and
   the remote data transmission system.},

Title = {Quantification of the near-surface wind conditions of the African coast:
   A comparative approach (satellite, NCEP CFSR and WRF-based)},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {189},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The temporal and spatial variations of the near-surface wind conditions
   across the African coast are enormous due to local flow perturbations
   from changes in sea surface roughness or/and the weather system
   processes driven mainly by the Atlantic and Indian Ocean Currents. Over
   the past decades, the patterns of the near surface wind speed and
   directional flow have significantly changed across the globe. To
   quantify the long-term changes of the surface wind conditions off the
   African coasts, the spatial distributions of historical wind climates
   and analyzed surface temperature from remote sensing and two atmospheric
   models are presented. Thus, the offshore wind conditions variability
   derived across 4 coastal zones are quantified through a comparative
   approach. Over period of 2001-2010, the trends of regional-scale wind
   conditions from the numerical model of NCEP CFSR and satellite
   observations of CCMP are assessed. For identification of geographical
   viable locations with concentrated energy resource and negative
   temperature gradient, the surface wind conditions are adjusted to
   offshore turbine generator (V80 2 MW) operating height of 100 m. Based
   on statistical evaluation of the offshore wind condition, graphical
   representations of the historical wind climate are presented.
   Furthermore, the monthly and seasonal sectorwise winds at 10 and 100 m
   ASL for 2002 are compared in determining how local perturbations had
   caused a drift in offshore wind flows within the boundary height of 100
   m. On local-scale evaluation, the near-surface wind conditions derived
   from WRF are validated with NCEP and CCMP datasets. The long-term
   historical wind conditions in time and space revealed that the
   satellite, WRF and NCEP models are reliable tools in replication of the
   coastal wind conditions across the coasts of Africa. Results also
   indicate the southeast coast to be an energetic region with concentrated
   mean wind energy flux between 300 and 1580 W/m(2) (8.10-13.70 m/s), but
   subjects to coastal variations of strong weather processes. No
   persistent wind pattern was found when considering the variability of
   near-surface wind conditions from a low to high latitude. (C) 2019

Title = {Salt stress response in the halophyte Limoniastrum guyonianum Boiss},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {217},
Pages = {1-9},
Abstract = {Limoniastrum guyonianum is an evergreen perennial halophyte. Its
   response to severe salinity was investigated by exposing ninety-day-old
   plantlets to a 0-1000mM NaCl range for 3 months. Growth, water status,
   electrolyte leakage (EL), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, salt excretion,
   leaf pigment content, photosynthetic parameters, chloroplast
   ultrastructure, and contents of Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, proline and
   polyphenols were determined. Results of these studies indicate that L.
   guyonianum is a facultative halophyte and can survive at 1000 mM NaCl.
   Plants treated with 300 mM NaCl had a 25\% increase in whole plant fresh
   mass that is attributed to increased photosynthetic activity and
   adequate water uptake. Sodium and chloride accumulation increased with
   salinity and was associated with significant reductions in leaf K+,
   Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations due to excretion out of leaves.
   Consequently, photosynthetic machinery was highly preserved against
   toxic ions. Polyphenol accumulation increased with salt treatments while
   lipid peroxidation decreased with salinity levels at 200-1000 mM NaCl.
   Proline accumulation increased with salt treatments up to and including
   400 mM NaCl. The increase in intrinsic water use efficiency at medium
   salt levels indicates that L. guyonianum is efficient at using the low
   available water under salt stress. These physiological and biochemical
   responses to salinity and the salt excretion process allowed L
   guyonianum to tolerate severe salinity. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {Optimal operating parameter determination and modeling to enhance
   methane production from macroalgae},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {163},
Pages = {2190-2197},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This work aims at proposing a robust strategy to determine the optimal
   operating parameters based on fuzzy modeling for enhancing the
   productivity of methane using Pelvetia canaliculata. The applied
   strategy is a combination of fuzzy logic (FL) modeling and particle
   swarm optimizer (PSO). First, FL is used to build a model that describes
   methane production using the experimental datasets. Second, a PSO
   algorithm is used to obtain the best-operating conditions of the
   production process. The decision vari-ables used in the optimization
   process are beating time and the feedstock/inoculum ratio (F/I). Each
   parameter was studied for three different values. The beating time was
   set at 0, 30, and 60 min while the F/I ratio was set at 0.3, 0.5, and
   0.7. To assess the resulting performance, a comparison study was carried
   out between the optimized results thought proposed strategy and those
   obtained by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The FL model
   produced a higher accuracy, i.e., lower values of Root Mean Squared
   Errors (RMSEs), compared with the RSM. Therefore, the obtained results
   confirmed that the proposed strategy is better than RSM. (c) 2020

Abstract = {This study is focused on sedimentary environments, facies distribution,
   and sequence stratigraphy. The facies and sequence stratigraphic
   analyses of the Bahram Formation (middle-late Devonian) in south-central
   Iran are based on two measured stratigraphic sections in the southern
   Tabas block. The Bahram Formation overlies red sandstones Padeha
   Formation in sections Hutk and Sardar and is overlain by Carboniferous
   carbonate deposits of Hutk Formation paraconformably, with a thickness
   of 354 and 386 m respectively. Mixed siliciclastic and carbonate
   sediments are present in this succession. The field observations and
   laboratory studies were used to identify 14 micro/petrofacies, which can
   be grouped into 5 depositional environments: shore, tidal flat, lagoon,
   shoal and shallow open marine. A mixed carbonate-detrital shallow shelf
   is suggested for the depositional environment of the Bahram Formation
   which deepens to the east (Sardar section) and thins in southern
   locations (Hutk section). Three 3rd-order cyclic siliciclastic and
   carbonate sequences in the Bahram Formation and one sequence shared with
   the overlying joint with Hutk Formation are identified, on the basis of
   shallowing upward patterns in the micro/pertofacies. (C) 2015, China

Abstract = {This study aims in filling the gap in understanding the relationship
   between trend and extreme in diurnal and nocturnal temperatures (Tx and
   Tn) over the Gulf of Guinea area and the Sahel. Time-evolution and trend
   of Tx and Tn anomalies, extreme temperatures and heat waves are examined
   using regional and station-based indices over the 1900-2012 and
   1950-2012 periods respectively. In investigating extreme temperature
   anomalies and heat waves, a percentile method is used. At the regional
   and local scales, rising trends in Tx and Tn anomalies, which appear
   more pronounced over the past 60 years, are identified over the two
   regions. The trends are characterized by an intensification of: i)
   nocturnal/Tn warming over the second half of the 20th century; and ii)
   diurnal/Tx warming over the post-1980s. This is the same scheme with
   extreme warm days and warm nights. Finally annual number of diurnal and
   nocturnal heat waves has increase over the Gulf of Guinea coastal
   regions over the second half of the 20th century, and even more
   substantially over the post-1980s period. Although this trend in extreme
   warm days and nights is always overestimated in the simulations, from
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), those models
   display rising trends whatever the scenario, which are likely to be more
   and more pronounced over the two regions in the next 50 years. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Adequate hydrogeophysical monitoring of CO2 geological storage remains a
   challenge as different parameters might be modified during storage. That
   implies to compare real-time measurements to an adequate baseline. At
   the Maguelone shallow experimental site a representative baseline for
   electrical resistivity was built from a large number of downhole
   geophysical measurements. At this coastal site this issue is
   particularly important due to the production of biogenic gas from the
   subsurface sediments. For this, a modified petrophysical model based on
   the Waxman-Smits model is proposed to estimate gas saturation found to
   vary from 2 to 7\% within shallow sand layers. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {In the stratified ocean, vertical eddy diffusivity in the subsurface
   pycnocline plays a major role in new production through transporting
   nutrients upwards from the darker/nutrient-rich layer. In order to
   evaluate the diffusivity that was less available in the subsurface
   layers where indirect estimations are difficult, we conducted direct
   microstructure measurements in the upper 300 m of the open Pacific
   during summer, from 40 degrees S to 50 degrees N along 170 degrees W and
   from 137 degrees E to 120 degrees W across the subtropical North Pacific
   (21 degrees 30 ` N-23 degrees N). The subsurface pycnocline in the mid-
   and low-latitude regions was occupied primarily by the Subtropical
   Underwaters characterized by high salinity, and the Subtropical Mode
   Waters appeared with an increasing depth and latitude. In the North
   Pacific, low-salinity subarctic water with shallow seasonal pycnocline
   was observed in the high-latitude region. The base level of the
   diffusivity was 0.14-0.47 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1), while elevations up to
   0.51-13 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1) were observed at the equator where the
   Equatorial Undercurrents formed the strong shear in the subsurface
   layer, and in areas high internal tide energy such as the Hawaiian
   Ridge. The effect of wind on the diffusivity was less clear, probably
   because the wind energy is generally low during summer. The
   shear-to-strain ratio showed dome-shaped profiles with respect to
   latitude and an increasing trend from west to east in the subtropical
   North Pacific. The geographical distributions of the diffusivity
   presented in this study will contribute to better understanding
   biogeochemical cycles in the stratified upper ocean through improving
   estimations of the material transport.},

Title = {The distribution of benthic biomass in hadal trenches: A modelling
   approach to investigate the effect of vertical and lateral organic
   matter transport to the seafloor},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {21-33},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Most of our knowledge about deep-sea habitats is limited to bathyal
   (200-3000 m) and abyssal depths (3000-6000 m), while relatively little
   is known about the hadal zone (6000-11,000 m). The basic paradigm for
   the distribution of deep seafloor biomass suggests that the reduction in
   biomass and average body size of benthic animals along depth gradients
   is mainly related to surface productivity and remineralisation of
   sinking particulate organic carbon with depth. However, there is
   evidence that this pattern is somewhat reversed in hadal trenches by the
   funnelling of organic sediments, which would result in increased food
   availability along the axis of the trenches and towards their deeper
   regions. Therefore, despite the extreme hydrostatic pressure and
   remoteness from the pelagic food supply, it is hypothesized that biomass
   can increase with depth in hadal trenches. We developed a numerical
   model of gravitational lateral sediment transport along the seafloor as
   a function of slope, using the Kermadec Trench, near New Zealand, as a
   test environment. We propose that local topography (at a scale of tens
   of kilometres) and trench shape can be used to provide useful estimates
   of local accumulation of food and, therefore, patterns of benthic
   biomass. Orientation and steepness of local slopes are the drivers of
   organic sediment accumulation in the model, which result in higher
   biomass along the axis of the trench, especially in the deepest spots,
   and lower biomass on the slopes, from which most sediment is removed.
   The model outputs for the Kermadec Trench are in agreement with
   observations suggesting the occurrence of a funnelling effect and
   substantial spatial variability in biomass inside a trench. Further
   trench surveys will be needed to determine the degree to which seafloor
   currents are important compared with the gravity-driven transport
   modelled here. These outputs can also benefit future hadal
   investigations by highlighting areas of potential biological interest,
   on which to focus sampling effort. Comprehensive exploration of hadal
   trenches will, in turn, provide datasets for improving the model
   parameters and increasing predictive power. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {Building on the neorealist assumption, the current study argues that
   during the analysed time frame (2006-2016), the energy related issues
   have contributed to a shift in the Black Sea regional structure which
   drastically affected the regional balance of power. The current
   strategic reset determined by the shift in the regional system from a
   ``balanced multipolar{''} system, to an ``unbalanced{''} one warns about
   the new regional context that has reached an unprecedented level of
   uncertainty. In order to test this assumption, the study utilizes
   interpretative case studies for each Black Sea riparian state focusing
   on analysing the trends in the energy cooperation. The results reveal
   that energy cooperation represents a crucial aspect for interpreting and
   elucidating the complexity of the Black Sea regionalisation process, for
   defining and characterising the space of interactions between the
   riparian states and for understanding the power distribution within the
   region.},

   Point to the coastline near to Brean Down. Other proposals have tended
   to be for flood defence and for the creation of impounded water bodies
   to encourage waterfront development.
   Each of these proposals have had potential to impact upon the nature
   conservation interest of the Severn Estuary and the sub-estuaries. The
   extent of that impact has been the subject of much research and debate.
   The Countryside Council for Wales (and its predecessor the Nature
   Conservancy Council) is responsible not only for the statutory
   protection of the estuary, but also for advising the Government on the
   likely ecological impact of these types of proposals. This paper will
   explore the approach that has been adopted by CCW in dealing with these
   proposals, concentrating on those which have and could have an impact on
   the nature conservation and associated interest of the Welsh coast,
   particularly those at Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and the Severn Tidal
   Barrage, and put the case for the conservation of the extreme physical
   and biological environments of these hypertidal estuaries.},

Title = {Evaluation of Multimodal Transport in China Based on Hesitation Fuzzy
   Multiattribute Decision-Making},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Intermodal transportation, as an efficient form of transport
   organization, is a key technology and means for the logistics industry
   to balance transport costs and efficiency. How to deeply analyze the key
   factors constraining the level of development of multimodal
   transportation in China, building multimodal transportation development
   evaluation index system and evaluation model, evaluating comprehensively
   the multimodal transportation development level in China, and putting
   forward targeted countermeasures is of great practical significance.
   Based on the hesitant fuzzy multiattribute decision-making method, this
   paper analyzes the key factors influencing the level of multimodal
   transportation development from the perspective of sea-rail intermodal
   transport and further uses the interval number discretization and
   likelihood deviation maximization multiattribute decision-making method
   to construct a mixed-data index evaluation model, which is combined with
   data from 11 provinces (cities) in China. The study shows that there is
   a big gap among different provinces (cities) in China concerning the
   level of multimodal transportation development. Besides, the volume of
   intermodal container transportation and railway mileage are the core
   factors affecting the level of multimodal transportation development,
   and the results of the evaluation model can objectively reflect the
   level of multimodal transportation development and problems in each
   province (city). The research results further enrich the theoretical
   system of intermodal transportation development and provide a reference
   for the relevant management departments in formulating intermodal
   transportation plans and policies by putting forward pertinent
   suggestions in the field of management. In the future, the research
   direction should include the ecological environment, economic benefits,
   and other indicators into the evaluation system, expand the research
   scope of the modes of combined transportation such as public rail
   transport and public air transport, and improve the applicable scope of
   the evaluation model and the evaluation capability of specific
   scenarios.},

Title = {Developing ocean climate change indicators for the north-central
   California coast and ocean},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {252},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The Ocean Climate Indicators Project, developed for the Greater
   Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS), yielded the first set of
   physical and biological ocean climate indicators specifically developed
   for the north-central California coast and ocean region, which extends
   from Point Arena to Point Ano Nuevo and includes the ocean shorelines of
   the San Francisco metropolitan area. This case study produced a series
   of physical and biological indicator categories through a best
   professional judgment (BPJ) process with an interdisciplinary group of
   over 50 regional research scientists and marine resource managers from a
   wide range of state and federal agencies, NGOs, and universities. A
   working group of research scientists and marine resource managers used
   this set of ocean climate indicators to develop the Ocean Climate
   Indicators Monitoring Inventory and Plan. The Plan includes monitoring
   goals and objectives common for eight physical and four biological
   indicators; specific goals for each indicator; monitoring strategies and
   activities; an inventory of available monitoring data; opportunities for
   expanding or improving existing or new monitoring approaches; and case
   studies with specific examples of the indicators' utility for natural
   resource management and basic scientific research. Beyond developing
   indicators that support effective science-based management decisions,
   this scalable process established and strengthened mutually beneficial
   connections between scientists and managers, resulting in indicators
   that had broad support of project participants, were quickly adopted by
   the GFNMS, and could be used by managers and scientists from this region
   and beyond.},

Title = {Genomic signatures of natural selection at phenology-related genes in a
   widely distributed tree species Fagus sylvatica L},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Background Diversity among phenology-related genes is predicted to be a
   contributing factor in local adaptations seen in widely distributed
   plant species that grow in climatically variable geographic areas, such
   as forest trees. European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is widespread, and
   is one of the most important broadleaved tree species in Europe;
   however, its potential for adaptation to climate change is a matter of
   uncertainty, and little is known about the molecular basis of climate
   change-relevant traits like bud burst. Results We explored single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at candidate genes related to bud burst
   in beech individuals sampled across 47 populations from Europe. SNP
   diversity was monitored for 380 candidate genes using a sequence capture
   approach, providing 2909 unlinked SNP loci. We used two complementary
   analytical methods to find loci significantly associated with geographic
   variables, climatic variables (expressed as principal components), or
   phenotypic variables (spring and autumn phenology, height, survival).
   Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to detect candidate markers across
   two spatial scales (entire study area and within subregions). We
   revealed 201 candidate SNPs at the broadest scale, 53.2\% of which were
   associated with phenotypic variables. Additive polygenic scores, which
   provide a measure of the cumulative signal across significant candidate
   SNPs, were correlated with a climate variable (first principal
   component, PC1) related to temperature and precipitation availability,
   and spring phenology. However, different genotype-environment
   associations were identified within Southeastern Europe as compared to
   the entire geographic range of European beech. Conclusions Environmental
   conditions play important roles as drivers of genetic diversity of
   phenology-related genes that could influence local adaptation in
   European beech. Selection in beech favors genotypes with earlier bud
   burst under warmer and wetter habitats within its range; however,
   selection pressures may differ across spatial scales.},

Abstract = {A feeding experiment was conducted to examine the effects of dietary
   administration of Bacillus subtilis and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) on
   growth performance, survival, immune responses and disease resistance of
   juvenile large yellow croaker, Larimichthys crocea (mean initial body
   weight 7.82 g +/- 0.68). Nine practical diets were formulated to contain
   three levels of B. subtilis (0.0, 0.42 x 10(7) cfu g(-1) and 1.35 x
   10(7) cfu g(-1)), each with three FOS levels (0.0.2\% and 0.4\% of dry
   weight). Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 60
   juveniles. The experiment was conducted in floating sea cages (1.0 x 1.0
   x 1.5 m) for 10 weeks. At the termination of the feeding trial,
   alternative complement pathway (ACP), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
   lysozyme activity of serum and respiratory burst activity of head kidney
   macrophage were determined and fishes were challenged intraperitoneally
   with Vibrio harveyi. The results showed that at each dietary FOS level,
   dietary supplementation of 1.35 x 10(7) cfu g(-1)B. subtilis
   significantly increased the specific growth rate (SCR) (P < 0.01) and
   feed efficiency ratio (FER) (P < 0.05) compared with the groups without
   B. subtilis supplementation. The immune assay showed that at each FOS
   level, compared to the groups without B. subtilis supplementation
   significantly enhanced serum lysozyme was observed in fish fed the B.
   subtilis-supplemented diets (P < 0.05) and significantly enhanced serum
   SOD activity was observed in fish fed the diet with 1.35 x 10(7) cfu
   g(-1)B. subtilis (P < 0.05), while the serum ACP activity and the
   respiratory burst activity of head kidney macrophage were independent of
   dietary treatments. The challenge experiment showed that compared to the
   groups without B. subtilis supplementation the cumulative mortality
   after infection with V. harveyi was significantly lower in fish fed the
   diet with 1.35 x 10(7) cfu g(-1)B. subtilis (P < 0.05), at each FOS
   level. However, at each dietary B. subtilis level, addition of FOS in
   diets did not significantly affect the growth performance, immune
   response and disease resistance of large yellow croaker. No significant
   interactions were observed between dietary B. subtilis and FOS. These
   results showed that dietary supplementation of B. subtilis at a dose of
   1.35 x 10(7) cfu g(-1) improved growth, feed efficiency ratio,
   non-specific immune responses and disease resistance of juvenile large
   yellow croaker, L. crocea. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Predicting impacts of sea level rise on wintering redhead ducks along
   the lower Texas Coast},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The potential impacts of sea level rise to wildlife populations and
   their habitats are of concern. Localized relative sea levels have been
   rising at elevated rates compared to global sea levels, and this trend
   will impact coastal plant communities, particularly wetlands. The Laguna
   Madre, a hypersaline lagoon, is home to nearly 80\% of North America's
   redheads (Aythya americana) during winter. The large, shallow lagoon
   provides optimal growing conditions for seagrasses, including shoalgrass
   (Halodule wrightii), the redhead's primary winter food. Adjacent to the
   Laguna Madre are coastal ponds, on which redheads rely for fresh water.
   The close proximity of these freshwater sources to the coast makes them
   vulnerable to saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise. Using Sea Level
   Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM), we modeled the impacts of sea level
   rise on coastal ponds and foraging areas along the lower Texas coast
   through the year 2100. We also determined which coastal habitat types
   would be most affected by rising sea levels. The SLAMM model indicated
   that 9 land cover types had a >= 50\% change in occurrence from the
   initial 1999 time period to 2100. The model also predicted that 93 of
   the known 156 coastal ponds would become inundated with salt water. The
   predicted loss of foraging habitat and its typical proximity to coastal
   ponds creates a need to identify where conservation and enhancement of
   wintering redhead habitat should be placed to mitigate the effects of
   sea level rise. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   step of one hour, above-and below-ground plant growth is calculated in
   relationship to fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, water and energy. Plant
   growth is separated into reproductive and vegetative developmental
   stages. The model is driven by hourly weather input data for radiation,
   temperature, vapour pressure, wind speed, and precipitation. For two
   sites located on the Swiss Plateau at 548 and 915 m above sea level the
   difference between measured and simulated annual dry matter was in the
   range of -6-21\% depending on location, year, and cutting regime.
   Analysis of the annual dynamics of simulated and measured dry matter
   production revealed the importance of the differentiation between
   reproductive and vegetative growth. Largest deviations in yield were
   obtained for growth periods with extremely dry or cold and rainy
   weather. Simulated energy fluxes agreed well with measurements, whereas
   annual nitrogen yield tended to be underestimated by the model. Analysis
   of sensitivity to model parameters and initial conditions revealed the
   high importance of a parameter for the nitrogen concentration of the
   structural plant dry matter. This could indicate that the nitrogen sink
   limitation of the model could be too low. It is concluded that on an
   annual basis productivity, energy balance and nitrogen dynamics of
   productive pastures under mid-European conditions can be simulated
   accurately with a high temporal resolution using today's climatic
   conditions between 500 and 1000 m above sea level, and that the model
   could be used to assess the sensitivity of pastures to future climatic
   changes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {An important consideration for the design of micro-grid for an
   uninterruptible infrastructure is the ability to ensure its continual
   operation regardless of the health of the utility grid. This paper
   proposes a multiple layer power security design concept for re-designing
   of such an uninterruptible electrical network with an improved
   reliability and sustainability by integrating with renewable resources
   and energy storage systems. The re-designed microgrid network and the
   control scheme were modelled and simulated in PowerFactory. Potential
   problems during the network re-design such as protection discrimination
   and power factor degradation due to high PV penetration have been
   analysed and solutions have been provided. System performance of the
   re-designed network has been evaluated through various test cases.},

Abstract = {Global warming and fisheries harvest are significantly impacting wild
   fish stocks, yet their interactive influence on population resilience to
   stress remains unclear. We explored these interactive effects on
   early-life development and survival by experimentally manipulating the
   thermal and harvest regimes in 18 zebrafish (Danio rerio) populations
   over six consecutive generations. Warming advanced development rates
   across generations, but after three generations, it caused a sudden and
   large (30?50\%) decline in recruitment. This warming impact was most
   severe in populations where size-selective harvesting reduced the
   average size of spawners. We then explored whether our observed
   recruitment decline could be explained by changes in egg size, early egg
   and larval survival, population sex ratio, and developmental costs. We
   found that it was most likely driven by temperature-induced shifts in
   embryonic development rate and fishing-induced male-biased sex ratios.
   Importantly, once harvest and warming were relaxed, recruitment rates
   rapidly recovered. Our study suggests that the effects of warming and
   fishing could have strong impacts on wild stock recruitment, but this
   may take several generations to manifest. However, resilience of wild
   populations may be higher if fishing preserves sufficient body size
   diversity, and windows of suitable temperature periodically occur.},

Title = {Compensation for environmental services from artisanal fisheries in SE

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},

Abstract = {Artisanal fisheries are of great importance in Brazil, as they are
   responsible for more than 50\% of national fish production. This
   importance, associated with the necessity of conserving marine
   environments threatened by multiple competing uses, leads us to propose
   mechanisms for co-management of fisheries by users and public
   authorities. This proposal takes into account: a) local conflicts
   between artisanal and industrial fishers; b) local rules over the use of
   fishing areas established by artisanal fishers; c) the advent of
   protected areas that close access to some fishing areas used by
   artisanal fisheries; and d) co-management options being explored between
   government and fishers. This study suggests policy and technical
   alternatives under consideration to manage the artisanal fisheries of
   southeastern Brazil with a focus on Ilha Grande bay in Rio de Janeiro.
   In our case study, based on field research conducted in 2009, we show
   that artisanal fishers are squeezed into a marine space between
   protected areas and industrial fishing. We suggest that a combination of
   fishing agreements (FAs), based on experience in Amazonian fisheries and
   extractive reserves, and payment for environmental services (PES), based
   on forest and related water resource experience, could improve
   management and livelihoods for local artisanal fisheries by stimulating
   and rewarding fishers who participate in conservation efforts. The two
   instruments (FAs and PES) are the subject of considerable research and
   practical experience. Their integration in an instrument mix represents
   a contribution from transdisciplinary fields of human ecology and
   ecological economics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ice and firn core studies provide one of the most valuable tools for
   understanding the past climate change. In order to evaluate the temporal
   isotopic variability recorded in ice and its relevance to environmental
   changes, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were studied in a firn
   core from coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. The annual delta
   O-18 profile of the core shows a close relation to the El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) variability. The ENSO indices show significant
   correlation with the surface air temperatures and delta O-18 values of
   this region during the austral summer season and support an additional
   influence related to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The correlation
   between the combined ENSO-SAM index and the summer delta O-18 record
   seems to have been caused through an atmospheric mechanism. Snow
   accumulation in this region illustrates a decreasing trend with opposite
   relationships with delta O-18 data and surface air temperature prior and
   subsequent to the year 1997. A reorganization of the local water cycle
   is further indicated by the deuterium excess data showing a shift around
   1997, consistent with a change in evaporation conditions. The present
   study thus illustrates the utility of ice-core studies in the
   reconstruction of past climate change and suggests possible influence of
   climatic teleconnections on the snow accumulation rates and isotopic
   profiles of snow in the coastal regions of east Antarctica.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {156},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The microbial communities associated with plant's compartments and the
   expression of the chloroplast chaperonin Hsp60 have been simultaneously
   analyzed during the diel cycle in the marine seagrass Thalassia
   hemprichii from the lagoon of Magoodhoo island (Maldives), characterized
   by remarkable daily shifts in temperature and light. Plants showed a
   significant up-regulation of Hsp60 expression from 8.00 a.m. to 2.00
   p.m., in correspondence with the increase in temperature and light,
   confirming their role as defense mechanism against photoinhibition and
   oxidative damage. However, a further significant increase of the Hsp60
   level was also observed when irradiance and temperature dropped,
   suggesting that the cellular stress was still in progress. The
   plant-associated microbial communities showed differences by plant
   compartment and sampling time, with the aboveground compartment (leaves)
   being much more dynamic than the belowground one (roots/rhizomes). In
   the phyllosphere, a progressive shift during the day from the absolute
   dominance of the Gammaproteobacteria class, mainly constituted of
   Enterobacteraceae family, to the increase of the biodiversity due to the
   rise of Alphaproteobacteria was observed. Belowground, the microbial
   diversity was much lower than aboveground, being Gammaproteobacteria the
   most represented class throughout all sampling times. Vibrionaceae
   family was the most abundant at 8:00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. decreasing
   slightly at 2.00 p.m., partially replaced by Halomonadaceae. The
   combined biochemical and microbial markers allows to assess the plant
   stress response and to deepen the knowledge on the seagrasses adaptation
   to harsh and changing environmental conditions, resulting useful to
   detect early signs of change in an organism's physiological state.
   Furthermore, the variation of Hsp60 expression and associated bacterial
   communities in response to light and temperature fluctuations support
   the `holobiont' theory, which considers the plant/microorganisms
   association as a functional unit, as suggested for corals.},

Title = {Geological evidence for AD 1008 tsunami along the Kachchh coast, Western
   India: Implications for hazard along the Makran Subduction Zone},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman tsunami emphasized the catastrophic nature of
   such disasters and exposed our knowledge gap of the historical and
   palaeo events. In the aftermath of this deadly event, the thrust in
   palaeotsunami studies was restricted to areas in the Indian Ocean,
   affected by this tsunami. The northern Arabian Sea, which hosts a
   similar tsunamigenic source i.e. the Makran Subduction Zone (MSZ), has
   so far remained `Terra-Incognita'. Here, for the first time, we report
   geological evidence of the 1008 AD tsunami, also mentioned as `an
   enigma' in the historical reports, by identifying a >250 km long sand
   sheet with a landward extent of more than 250 m from the Indian
   coastline. Detailed sedimentology and geochemistry reveals an offshore
   origin of this sand sheet, from where it was eroded by a high energy
   wave and deposited in a supratidal environment. Optical and AMS C-14
   chronology constrains its age of deposition around 1000 AD. The shear
   size of the sand sheet, laterally and across the coast, along with grain
   size, a characteristically different provenance, are some of the major
   indicators, which can be useful in palaeotsunami/palaeostorm deposit
   distinction. Our report of the AD 1008 event from the Indian coastline,
   also supports the claim that the Western MSZ, albeit at longer
   intervals, has experienced major thrust earthquakes (M-w >8) in the
   historical past. The proximity of this sand sheet to the shoreline does
   not discount the role of extremely unlikely, large storms as its causal
   mechanism.},

Abstract = {Promising nanotechnological platforms, based on inorganic nanoparticles
   and nanomaterials, have emerged in such fields as targeted drug
   delivery, bio-and chemical sensing, catalysis, antimicrobial coatings,
   and optoelectronic devices, among others. However, concerns regarding
   the sustainability of physicochemically-synthesized nanomaterials, which
   often require energy-intensive processes, high temperatures, toxic
   solvents or undesirable chemical wastes, have also emerged. Researchers
   have therefore looked to replace chemical syntheses by sustainable and
   environmentally friendly techniques. Biosynthesis of nanomaterials,
   i.e., the use of living organisms, their components, extracts or
   biomolecules, as catalysts for the sustainable production of
   nanomaterials, has experienced a tremendous expansion during the last
   two decades. Among these production platforms, the roles of algae have
   attracted increasing attention from research scientists worldwide. The
   aim of the present review, the first of its kind, is to provide
   important information to readers regarding the diversity of algal
   strains exploited in the booming field of nanobiotechnology and green
   chemistry, the various methodologies through which these diverse
   organisms are used, the variety of fabricated nanomaterials composed of
   noble metals, oxides and chalcogenides, and the significance of the
   large range of sizes and shapes of these nanomaterials that confer to
   them unique properties desirable for specific bio-applications.},

Title = {Temperature adaptation of microbial communities in different horizons of
   Siberian permafrost-affected soils from the Lena Delta},
Journal = {CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-182},
Abstract = {The cell membrane phospholipid (PL) inventory of microbial populations
   in a Siberian permafrost soil of the Lena Delta was analysed to examine
   as to how the microbial populations within different horizons of the
   active layer were adapted to the extreme temperature gradient in this
   environment. One surface-near and one permafrost-near soil sample were
   taken from the active layer on Samoylov Island in the southern central
   Lena Delta (Siberia) and in each case incubated at 4 and 28 degrees C.
   Subsequently, the phospholipid cell membrane composition of the
   indigenous microbial populations was qualitatively and quantitatively
   determined and compared. In both horizons, the Incubation at 4 degrees C
   is characterized by a shift in the PL inventory to more short chain
   fatty acids. A significant trend in the proportions of saturated and
   unsaturated fatty acids, however, was not detected. A higher proportion
   of both short chain and unsaturated fatty acids counterbalances the
   effect of decreasing cell membrane fluidity with decreasing
   environmental temperature. Thus, the adaptation of the permafrost
   microbial populations within the different horizons to varying ambient
   temperature conditions appears to be mainly regulated by the chain
   length of the phospholipid fatty acids. Although there is almost no
   change in the proportions Of unsaturated fatty acids between the 4 and
   28 degrees C incubation experiments, the permafrost-near horizon in
   general contains more unsaturated fatty acids than the surface-near
   horizon and a higher proportion of short chain fatty acids. This
   suggests that the lipid inventory of the microbial population nearer to
   the perennially frozen ground is more adapted to lower temperatures than
   that of the microbial community from the surface-near horizon, which
   seems to show a higher flexibility toward higher temperature conditions.
   The permafrost-near horizon appears to be dominated by psychrophilic
   species, while the surface-near horizon is characterized by a
   mesophilic-dominated microbial community. (c) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {Temperature impacts on lipid allocation among juvenile gadid species at

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {566},
Pages = {183-198},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts on Arctic fish communities will largely be
   determined by temperature-dependent vital metabolic rates of resident
   and invading species. In this study, we experimentally measured total
   lipids and lipid class storage in the liver and muscle of 2 juvenile
   Arctic gadids (Arctic cod Boreogadus saida and saffron cod Eleginus
   gracilis) and 2 juvenile boreal gadids (walleye pollock Gadus
   chalcogrammus and Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus). Experiments were
   conducted over a 4 wk period across 5 temperatures (0, 5, 9, 16 and 20
   degrees C) at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, OR, USA.
   Results indicated clear species-specific non-linear effects of
   temperature on lipid accumulation. Arctic cod demonstrated a cold-water,
   stenothermic response with relatively high lipid storage (28 mg lipid
   g(-1) WWT) and growth at 0 degrees C. In contrast, saffron cod
   demonstrated a warmer-water, eurythermic response with elevated growth
   at temperatures beyond 16 degrees C but comparatively low lipid storage
   across all thermal habitats (10 to 17 mg lipid g(-1) WWT). Lipid storage
   and growth in the boreal species was dome-shaped and notably higher at
   intermediate temperatures (maximum lipid values of 44 mg lipid g(-1) WWT
   for walleye pollock, 28 mg lipid g(-1) WWT for Pacific cod). Further,
   the combined effects of temperature on both growth and lipid storage led
   to elevated lipid accumulation rate (LAR) indices in boreal species (4
   to 11) compared to Arctic species (< 3) at temperatures above 4 degrees
   C. These results suggest that warming in the Arctic will lead to
   decreased condition in the resident mid-trophic fish assemblage in the
   absence of replacement by more boreal-type species shifting poleward.},

Title = {Facilitating recruitment of Amphibolis as a novel approach to seagrass
   rehabilitation in hydrodynamically active waters},
Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {61},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1123-1133},
Abstract = {Worldwide, 29\% of seagrass habitats have been lost over the past
   century. Compared with large-scale losses, successful restoration
   programs are usually only small scale (a few hectares). One area of
   significant seagrass loss (45200 ha) is Adelaide, South Australia.
   Improvements to wastewater management have raised the possibility of
   rehabilitation in this area. Traditional methods of seagrass restoration
   are expensive and have had limited success owing to high wave energy. We
   investigated a range of biodegradable substrates, mostly made of hessian
   (burlap), to enhance Amphibolis recruitment as an alternative. After 5
   weeks, 16 514 seedlings, or 157 seedlings m(-2), had recruited. Survival
   declined over the following 12 months to 31.4\%, and down to 7.2\% after
   3 years, in part as a result of breakdown of the hessian, and the
   wave-exposed nature of the sites. During the initial 12 months, above-
   and belowground biomass increased 2.6- and 6.4-fold, respectively. The
   technique may represent a non-destructive, cost-effective (<AU \$10 000
   ha(-1)) method to restore Amphibolis over large spatial scales and in
   areas that are hydrodynamically too active for traditional techniques,
   thus helping ameliorate some of the large-scale losses of seagrasses
   that have occurred globally.},

Abstract = {Production of CO2-tolerant microalgae have received much attention as
   well as physicochemical fixation of CO2 in industrial flue gas. Although
   many microalgae that are tolerant to high levels of CO2 have been found
   and evaluated, the CO2 concentration for their good growth is generally
   lower than their maximum tolerable CO2 level. In the present study, we
   attempted to isolate microalgae capable of growing in high levels of CO2
   (high-level-CO2-preferring microalgae, HCP-microalgae). We used a
   CO2-permeable polystyrene bottle for the enrichment of HCP-microalgae in
   environmental samples. Two Picochlorum strains, Azisu1 and Azisu2, were
   isolated following enrichment of seawater. The strains showed fast
   growth in 20\%-40\% CO2 and contained high amount of some vitamins (B1,
   B6, and C), L-proline, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. The C18 unsaturated
   and C16 saturated fatty acids were found dominant. In addition,
   astaxanthin was also found, but its cellular content was not high. Based
   on the previous reports on some Picochlorum sp. strains, it can be
   concluded that Azisu1 and Azisu2 may be promising candidates for
   commercial applications in nutraceutical, livestock, and aquaculture
   industries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A cross-shelf moored array, shipboard current profiler observations and
   glider observations were collected over the first few months of 2012 as
   part of a study of wintertime phytoplankton blooms off the coast of
   northern South Carolina, United States. The combined dataset is examined
   to document the internal wave field in the region inshore of the
   offshore deflection of the Gulf Stream. Moderate amplitude isopycnal
   displacements of 10-20 meters are common in glider observations over the
   slope; much larger displacements were observed when the glider was drawn
   offshore by the Gulf Stream. Meanders of the Gulf Stream indirectly
   forced the outer shelf flow through formation of filaments off the
   meander crests that moved along the upper slope. Several filaments
   exhibited unusually strong flow and moved equatorward, displacing
   ambient waters. Moored current meters indicate intermittent internal
   tides on the upper slope and shelf and a correlation with the external
   tide. The intermittency of the internal tide may be related to the
   varying alongshelf flow and varying mass field over the shelf.},

Abstract = {Estimates of carbon stocks and their annual change for extensive
   Australian sub-tropical forests are based on indirect estimates or on
   data derived from temperate forests. We estimated live above-ground tree
   carbon (LAC) stocks at landscape level from 355 000 measurements of 94
   127 tree stems from 604 permanently monitored plots representing
   2.6millionha of managed uneven-aged mixed-species native forests in
   sub-tropical Queensland. These plots were established between 1936 and
   1998 and re-measured every 2 to 10years up to 2011. Landscapes were
   represented by 16 broad vegetation groups growing across a mean annual
   rainfall range of 500 to 2000mm. Landscape-mean LAC stocks varied from
   20.8 +/- 4.3tCha(-1) in inland eucalypt woodlands to 146.4 +/-
   11.1tCha(-1) in coastal wet tall open forests. Landscape maximum LAC
   stock, defined as the mean of maximum LAC stocks over the entire
   measurement history for a specified landscape under prevailing
   environmental conditions and disturbance regimes, including sustainable
   forest management, ranged from 34.0 +/- 7.2tCha(-1) in inland eucalypt
   woodlands to 154.9 +/- 19.4tCha(-1) in coastal wet tall open forests.
   Annual live above-ground net carbon flux (C-flux) across all forests
   types ranged from 0.46 to 2.92tCha(-1) y(-1) with an overall mean of
   0.95tCha(-1) y(-1) (n=2067). Comparison of our results with
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates shows that in
   all cases, except for the sub-tropical steppe, the IPCC over-estimated
   stocks by between 13\% and 34\%. Conversely, the IPCC estimated C-fluxes
   were between 14\% and 40\% less than the Queensland estimates. These
   results extend statistically valid estimates of landscape LAC stocks and
   fluxes to the sub-tropical regions of Australia.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Detailed preliminary assessment of subsurface is required in potential
   site for CO2 re-injection in order to ensure safe and viability of the
   project. Using 3D seismic data analysis and well correlation, a
   potential site located onshore Niger Delta Basin was assessed for CO2
   re-injection. The result indicates multiple reservoir units across the
   stacked stratigraphy, indicating potential multiple CO2 storage
   intervals. Well correlation using four wells has further revealed a
   laterally extensive, thick and sealed potential reservoir located at
   supercritical depth favorable for geosequestration. Traps are found to
   be mainly structural consisting of collapsed crest and rollover
   anticlines. Growth faults are the dominant structural type and the
   overall structural style within the field is simple with minimal
   complexity. In the triangle analysis, a potential leak point
   characterized by thick sand blocks and low potential for shale smearing
   shows high tendency for CO2 leakage. However, this would only be the
   case if injected CO2 exceeded the maximum supportable column heights
   which can be obtained using 3D fault seal modeling to further
   characterized the basin.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the radicalness of industry path transformation
   in different geographical contexts by analysing the introduction of new

   analytical framework based on path dependence theory to conduct a
   comparative case study of the introduction of offshore farming
   technology in the salmon farming industry in both coastal Norway and
   Tasmania, Australia. We show that similar points of departure can lead
   to different path transformation radicalness. In each case, the
   transformation outcome will depend on the unique interplay between
   agency and regional structural components during windows of opportunity.
   The empirical analysis supports the importance of considering agency,
   regional structural components and global technology trends when
   investigating path transformation radicalness.},

Title = {Effect of Tropical Cyclones on Short-Term Evolution of Carbonate Sandy

Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Carbonate sandy beaches in Reunion Island show various forms of evidence
   of erosion. Extreme waves associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) play a
   major role in beach dynamics. The present study analyzes and quantifies
   back-reef beach response and recovery from forcing generated by TCs
   Dumile, Felleng, and Bejisa, which occurred in 2013 and 2014. The study
   focuses on carbonate beaches of Reunion Island from Cap Champagne to the
   Passe de Trois-Bassins. Morphological and volumetric changes on beaches
   were analyzed by comparing 19 beach profiles. The results show that TCs
   are able to cause significant morphosedimentary change on the back-reef
   beaches of Reunion Island. These changes affect beach topography and
   involve longshore and cross-shore sediment transport. An alongshore
   variation in beach response is observed, which varies according to
   tropical storm intensity and coastal morphology. The intensity of impact
   seems to be related to reef width. The most severe erosion occurred at
   Boucan Canot, where reef is absent with a loss of -24 +/- 2 m(3) after
   TC Dumile, -38.7 +/- 1.2 m(3) after Felleng, and -42.5 +/- 1.6 m(3)
   after Bejisa. Elsewhere, the volumetric changes is less than 5 m(3)
   under TC Dumile and vary between 2 and 11 m(3) under TC Felleng and
   between 2 and 23 m(3) under TC Bejisa. No significant impact occurred at
   La Saline where the reef flat is large and provides good protection for
   the beach; however, relative coastline orientation and prestorm
   beach-profile morphology also play an essential role in storm impact.
   Wave height and water level are also determinant factors of storm
   erosion potential. After storms, the beaches show a relative capacity
   for recovering because of calm conditions; however, different behaviours
   are observed along the same beach compartment. This suggests local
   influence of coastal structure and/or reef geomorphology in sediment
   transport processes.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests play an important role in facilitating biogeochemical
   pathways and cycling acting as blue carbon sinks. These services are
   primarily regulated by the activity of the soil microbiome. However,
   there is still limited research into spatial and temporal variation
   patterns of bacterial community assemblages in mangrove soils. This
   study investigated important ecological scales of microprocesses that
   govern microbial communities in an arid mangrove ecosystem. Shifts in
   microbial community composition were influenced by fluctuations in
   environmental factors within the mangrove forests of the Red Sea
   influenced by seasonal changes in sea level. Notably, in summer
   microbial communities in shrub sites differed significantly from the
   fringe and the winter samples, with lower alpha diversity yet a higher
   dominance of specialized species capable of surviving in extreme
   conditions. The onset of dispersal limitation and heterogenous selection
   and the reduction of drift are likely the main forces shaping community
   assemblages. Specifically, in summer lower mean tidal levels eliminate
   tidal inundation creating a harsh high salinity and high temperature
   environment with no tidal connection thereby influencing the onset of
   dispersal limitation. An increased understanding of the spatial and
   temporal variation of bacterial communities is critical when assessing
   delivery of ecosystem services and their role in soil biogeochemical
   processes.},

Volume = {36},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Global climate models and analyses of instrumental datasets provide a
   wide range of scenarios for future tropical Pacific climate change,
   limiting the accuracy of regional climate projections. Coral records
   provide continuous reconstructions of tropical Pacific climate trends
   that are difficult to quantify using the short, sparse instrumental
   datasets available from the tropical Pacific. Here, we present
   coral-based reconstructions of late 20th century sea-surface temperature
   and salinity trends from several islands in the central tropical
   Pacific. The coral data reveal warming trends that increase towards the
   equator, implying a decrease in equatorial upwelling in the last
   decades. Seawater freshening trends on the southern edge of the
   Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone suggest a strengthening and/or an
   equatorward shift of the convergence zone. Together, the new coral
   records support a late 20th century trend towards ``El Nino-like{''}
   conditions in the tropical Pacific, in line with the majority of coupled
   global climate model projections. Citation: Nurhati, I. S., K. M. Cobb,

Title = {The feasibility of a novel bioreactor for vaccine production of

Abstract = {The performance of a new type of tide mode culture system was
   investigated in this study. This novel bioreactor provides two separated
   stages, liquid and gas, for cell growth requirements. The immobilized
   cells absorbed the nutrient from medium during the liquid stage and
   subsequently were exposed directly to fresh air to absorb oxygen during
   the gas stage. Operating with PK15 cells under optimal conditions, we
   obtained 2.3 x 10(9) cells in 500 ml reactor. It is 30 times higher than
   the initial inoculum and about 11 times higher than the production by
   roller bottle. For the vaccine production of classical swine fever
   (CSFV), a high virus titer of 2.1 x 10(9) median tissue culture
   infective dose (TCID50) was yielded which provided exceed 300 doses per
   milliliter of CSFV solution. Therefore, this new cultural system
   performed well not only for cell production but also for virus yield. It
   should be a highly efficient production for the CSFV vaccine and have
   practical potential in other animal cell culture vaccine. (c) 2012

   ocean bottom pressure variations, as well as understanding responses to
   changes in the global climate system. Initially a pioneering experiment
   of geodesy, the time-variable observations have matured into reliable
   mass transport products, allowing assessment and forecast of a number of
   important climate trends, and improvements in service applications such
   as the United States Drought Monitor. With the successful launch of the
   GRACE Follow-On mission, a multi-decadal record of mass variability in

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-49},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We propose that nonharvest plantations could provide important
   opportunities for restoration of indigenous forest cover and related
   ecosystem services. We assessed the relative performance of three
   Podocarpaceae (podocarps) species planted into a degraded Ponderosa Pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) plantation, central North Island, New Zealand. We
   hypothesised that the degraded pine plantation overstorey could provide
   suitable conditions for the development of a podocarp-dominated forest
   structure within ca. 50years of underplanting and that podocarp growth
   would differ depending on the species suitability to the site. Rimu
   (Dacrydium cupressinum) significantly outperformed both Totara
   (Podocarpus totara) and Kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) in height
   and diameter growth. Rimu was now the structurally dominant tree where
   it occurred rather than pine. Per annum scaled carbon storage within
   Rimu stands was significantly greater than the Totara, Kahikatea or Pine
   stands. All podocarp species had attained a greater stand density
   compared to the pine overstorey. Possible reasons for the differing
   podocarp growth performance include different light requirements,
   response to soil nutrients, elevational distributions and frost
   susceptibility. There were significant differences in understorey
   species richness among the different stands of podocarp species.
   Underplanting accelerated successional development by incorporating
   late-successional indigenous canopy dominants within the forest
   succession and overcame limitations imposed on forest succession at the
   site from its isolation from indigenous forest tree seed sources.},

Abstract = {With the wide application of nuclear energy in marine nuclear power
   plant, the nuclear safety analysis of marine nuclear power reactor has
   become inevitable, and has been gradually concerned. Radiation safety
   criterion is an important index of safety analysis of nuclear power
   plant. Because of the characteristics of the reactor, its radiation
   protection management has higher and more strict requirements, which
   makes strengthening radiation protection become an important task of the
   reactor. The radiation solution method of marine nuclear power plant
   based on 3D neutron transport equation is proposed. Firstly, the program
   mathematical model of dose field analysis of marine nuclear power
   reactor cabin is constructed to obtain the radiation dose field of
   marine nuclear power reactor cabin. Then, based on the obtained nuclear
   radiation measurement field information, the radiation solution of the
   marine nuclear power plant is realized by the discrete solution method
   based on the 3D neutron transport equation. It is verified that the
   method has high accuracy and credibility for radiation calculation of an
   offshore nuclear power plant.},

Title = {Climatic modulation of timing of systems-tract development with respect
   to sea-level changes (middle Pleistocene of Crotone, Calabria, southern
   Italy)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {77},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {461-468},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change has traditionally played a secondary role in the
   literature behind eustasy and tectonics, with eustasy regarded as the
   main controlling factor in development of sedimentary sequences. Here,
   we emphasize the role of the interaction of climate-modulated sediment
   supply and sea-level change, particularly its potential impact on
   sequence development.
   We discuss a case history from the lower-middle Pleistocene of the
   highly subsiding Valle di Manche shelf area (Crotone Basin, Calabria,
   southern Italy), where a stack of cyclothems spanning from late Marine
   Isotope Stage (MIS) 22 to full MIS 18 preserves a full record of
   eustatic cycles, glacials included. Tectonics certainly played a
   critical role in the creation of local accommodation, ultimately
   controlling the preservation of an almost complete sedimentary record.
   However, its role as a factor controlling the sediment flux on
   Milankovian scale can be ruled out. Direct comparisons between data
   concerning 6180, pollen, and physical stratigraphy demonstrate that
   climate-induced changes in sediment load caused significant deviations
   from the predicted timing and magnitude of the responses to sea-level
   changes in the traditional sequence model. A phase lag occurred in the
   timing of systems tracts, leading to a significant delay of one-quarter
   of a sea-level cycle. Specifically, climate-driven sediment discharge
   during sea-level rise triggered progradation of shelf-margin wedges,
   which should thus be considered lowstand in their architecture and
   ``transgressive{''} in their timing. This was generated by a shift
   toward drier conditions, leading to extensive deforestation and
   consequent lowering of the threshold for slope erosion and mass-wasting
   processes in the source area.
   Due to the reduced extent of the transfer zone, sedimentary signals were
   conveyed rapidly from source to sink with little apparent attenuation,
   suggesting that the Milankovitch-scale climate changes can lead to rapid
   source-to-sink responses on tectonically active margins fed by
   high-gradient, short-headed streams. The studied case history
   demonstrates that the impact of Milankovitch-scale climatic forcing on
   sediment supply in an icehouse world can be more influential than
   sediment redistribution due to corresponding sea-level fluctuations.
   These findings emphasize that a reconstruction of the timing of
   systems-tract development with respect to sea-level changes based on a
   sequence-stratigraphic approach may be misleading, whenever independent
   chronological and climatic constraints are not available.},

Title = {Development and validation of an AI-Driven model for the La Rance tidal
   barrage: A generalisable case study},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {332},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In this work, an AI-Driven (autonomous) model representation of the La
   Rance tidal barrage was developed using novel parametrisation and Deep
   Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. Our model results were
   validated with experimental measurements, yielding the first Tidal Range
   Structure (TRS) model validated against a constructed tidal barrage and
   made available to academics. In order to proper model La Rance,
   parametrisation methodologies were developed for simulating (i) turbines
   (in pumping and power generation modes), (ii) transition ramp functions
   (for opening and closing hydraulic structures) and (iii) equivalent
   lagoon wetted area. Furthermore, an updated DRL method was implemented
   for optimising the operation of the hydraulic structures that compose La
   Rance. The achieved objective of this work was to verify the
   capabilities of an AI-Driven TRS model to appropriately predict (i)
   turbine power and (ii) lagoon water level variations. In addition, the
   observed operational strategy and yearly energy output of our AI-Driven
   model appeared to be comparable with those reported for the La Rance
   tidal barrage. The outcomes of this work (developed methodologies and
   DRL implementations) are generalisable and can be applied to other TRS
   projects. Furthermore, this work provided insights which allow for more
   realistic simulation of TRS operation, enabled through our AI-Driven
   model.},

Title = {From individual responses to population effects: Integrating a decade of
   multidisciplinary research on blue whales and sonar},

Abstract = {As ecosystems transform under climate change and expanding human
   activities, multidisciplinary integration of empirical research,
   conceptual frameworks and modelling methods is required to predict,
   monitor and manage the cascading effects on wildlife populations. For
   example, exposure to anthropogenic noise can lead to changes in the
   behaviour and physiology of individual marine mammals, but management is
   complicated by uncertainties on the long-term effects at a population
   level. We build on a decade of diverse efforts to demonstrate the
   strengths of integrating research on multiple stressors for assessing
   population-level effects. Using the case study of blue whales exposed to
   military sonar in the eastern north Pacific, we model how behavioural
   responses and environmental effects induced by climate change affect
   female survival and reproductive success. Environmental changes were
   predicted to severely affect vital rates, while the current regime of
   sonar activities was not. Simulated disturbance had a stronger effect on
   reproductive success than adult survival, as predicted by life-history
   theory. We show that information on prey resources is critical for
   robust predictions, as are data on baseline behavioural patterns, energy
   budgets, body condition and contextual responses to noise. These results
   will support effective management of the interactions between sonar
   operations and blue whales in the study area, while providing pragmatic
   guidance for future data collection to reduce key uncertainties. Our
   study provides important lessons for the successful integration of
   multidisciplinary research to inform the assessment of the effects of
   noise and other anthropogenic stressors on marine predator populations
   in the context of a changing environment.},

Title = {The decline of winter monsoon velocity in the South China Sea through
   the 20th century: Evidence from the Sr/Ca records in corals},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-85},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A modern massive Porites coral was collected from the Longwan Bay (19
   degrees 20'N, 110 degrees 39'E) on the east coast of the Hainan Island,
   China. The coral was sectioned vertical to the growth axis into discs of
   double density-bands representing annual growth. The samples were
   analyzed for the Sr/Ca ratio by inductively coupled plasma atomic
   emission spectrometry. The history of winter sea-surface temperature
   (SST) is reconstructed using the Sr/Ca ratio in winter bands of corals.
   The winter SST at Xisha in the middle of the South China Sea (SCS) is
   weakly correlated with the instrument-measured winter monsoon velocity
   (WMV) with a correlation coefficient of 0.19. The winter SST data from
   corals at Longwan Bay, Hainan, in the northern SCS are moderately
   correlated with the WMV (r=0.40). Interestingly we found that the
   difference of winter SSTs between the two sites (Xisha and Longwan Bay,
   Hainan) (the X-H index) is significantly negatively correlated with the
   WMV (r=-0.73). This negative correlation may be related to the intrusion
   of the warm Kuroshio Current into the SCS through the Luzon Strait
   promoted by the strong northeastern monsoon winds in the winter. Using
   the relationship between our coralline data and observed WMV, the
   calculated winter monsoon velocity (WMVc) was obtained for 87 years.
   This data set in combination with the instrument-measured data between
   1993 and 1998 generate a record of WMVc for a period of 93 years from
   1906 to 1998. The WMVc in the 20th century shows significant interannual
   and decadal variability with a trend of persistent decline in the whole
   20th century at the rate of decrease of -0.02 (m/s)/a. The lowest wind
   velocity occurred during the last two decades of the 20th century. The
   WMVc has decreased significantly by about 30\% from the early to the
   late of 20th century. The 20th century decline of winter monsoon
   velocity evidenced from the SCS coral records is consistent with the
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) simulations for
   monsoon response to increasing temperatures. In addition, an obvious
   decline shift of WMV around 1976 can be seen in both instrumental and
   proxy records and it coincides with many other Pacific records. This
   shift is likely to correspond to a Pacific-wide change in the Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation occurring at the same time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {ENERGY},

Volume = {141},
Pages = {991-1003},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Nowadays, the optimization of different sectors of petroleum industry,
   including recovery, production and distribution is of great interest to
   researchers. In this paper a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
   model is presented to maximize the net present value (NPV) of a crude
   oil network. The model includes production planning, facility
   location-allocation, and distribution planning. The impact of gas
   injection and swap is considered simultaneously in the proposed model
   innovatively. Gas injection into oil reservoirs is one of the most
   essential factors in the protection of oil reserves and one of the
   strategies for sustainable production. Associated petroleum gas (APG) is
   re-injected into gas injection well to enhance oil recovery. Also,
   applying the oil swap helps to reduce oil distribution costs. A
   petroleum network in Iran is studied to demonstrate the model
   performance and validity. The computational results demonstrate the
   efficiency and the sensitivity analysis of important parameters and
   consideration of impact of the mentioned items on long-term profits is
   investigated in large scale simulate problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {All-inclusive coral reef restoration: How the tourism sector can boost
   restoration efforts in the caribbean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {Following a strong decline in the health of Caribbean coral reefs in the
   1970s, disease outbreaks, overfishing, and warming events have continued
   to push these reefs towards a point of no return. As such, researchers
   and stakeholders have turned their attention to restoration practices to
   overcome coral recovery bottlenecks on Caribbean reefs. However,
   successful restoration faces many challenges, including economical and
   logistical feasibility, long-term stability, and biological and
   ecological factors yet to fully understand. The tourism sector has the
   potential to enhance and scale restoration efforts in the Caribbean,
   beyond simple financial contributions. Its strengths include long-term
   presence in several locations, logistical and human resources, and a
   business case focused on preserving the ecosystem services on which it
   depends. Here, we present the restoration program of Iberostar Hotels
   and Resorts which includes a scientific team that incorporates
   science-based solutions into resort operations to promote reef
   resilience in the face of climate change. We exemplify the potential of
   our program to scale up science-based reef restoration in collaboration
   with academia, local community, and government by presenting the first
   utilization of the Coral Bleaching Automated Stress System (CBASS) in
   Latin America and the Latin American Caribbean, with the aim of applying
   findings on coral thermotolerance directly to Iberostar's reef
   restoration program across the Caribbean. This program presents a new
   model for tourism involvement in coral restoration and illustrates its
   capacity to scale up existing restoration practices by utilizing the
   strengths of the sector while maintaining science-based decision making.},

Abstract = {Climate change expected from increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations
   has been studied widely. Further, it is recognized that cities are a
   major source of anthropogenic CO2. However, few studies of CO2
   concentrations in, or near, cities have been conducted. A LI-COR
   infrared gas analyzer was operated in a suburban region of Vancouver
   during June 1993. The observed summer-rime concentrations show a late
   afternoon minimum, and overnight maximum around the upwind background
   concentration. The afternoon CO2 minimum is attributed to the strength
   of biospheric photosynthesis and strong mixing of local anthropogenic
   sources within a deep mixed layer. Poor nighttime mixing, lower mixed
   layer depths, and biospheric respiration account for the observed
   nighttime maximum, often more than 80 ppmv greater than the background
   concentration. A numerical multiple-box transport and mixing model was
   developed to simulate the observed diurnal pattern of CO2 concentration
   at the suburban site. CO2 emissions inventories for important mobile
   sources, stationary sources, and biospheric sources and sinks provide
   input to the model for upwind fetch areas. Other CO2 inputs include
   advection, entrainment from above the mixed layer and modelled mixed
   layer depth for the CO2 mixing volume. Close agreement between
   observations and model results show the importance of boundary layer
   structure on CO2 concentrations at a specific location. In terms of CO2,
   the role of the city is placed in its global context. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {The natural resource base of land, water and vegetation in arid and semi
   arid areas is highly fragile and extremely vulnerable to degradation.
   Increasing population along with the demand for more food, fodder and
   fuelwood has given rise to a chain of interrelated economic, social and
   environmental issues associated with the land degradation.
   Desertification is essentially a result of soil degradation. A variety
   of natural and human factors are contributing to desertification,
   including drought, overgrazing, over exploitation of land and water
   resources, over cultivation of marginal lands, deforestation, soil
   erosion, water logging and salinity and the use of inappropriate
   agricultural technologies. The consequences of this are: abandoned
   croplands, affected by waterlogging and salinity; abandoned villages,
   traditional irrigation systems and croplands desertified by deteriorated
   groundwater aquifers or lowering of the water table; siltation of
   rivers, irrigation systems and reservoirs; landslides in hilly areas.
   The desertification leads to agricultural productivity losses and
   enhance poverty. It also causes significant reductions in carbon storage
   in soils, contributing to global warming, and loss of biodiversity.
   Various approaches are being applied to combat the menace of
   desertification. Introduction of rapid growing exotic species of trees
   and grasses for stabilization of shifting sand dunes; creation of
   microclimates through shelterbelt plantation have proved highly
   successful towards the control of desertification. Sustainable land
   management (SLM), soil and water conservation, afforestation and
   rehabilitation of degraded land, repetitive high resolution satellite
   images, delineation and mapping of affected areas, remote sensing and
   geographic information systems (GIS) arc likely to be suitable
   strategies for combating desertification in Pakistan. The efforts
   already underway to combat desertification need to be strengthened and
   integrated through a nationally supported, coordinated and monitored
   system.},

Abstract = {The annual anthropogenic ocean carbon uptake of 2.6 +/- 0.5 Gt C is
   changing ocean composition (e.g., pH) at unprecedented rates, but our
   ability to track this trend effectively across various ocean ecosystems
   is limited by the availability of low-cost, high-quality autonomous pH
   sensors. The Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE was a year-long
   competition to address this scientific need by awarding \$2 million to
   developers who could improve the performance and reduce the cost of pH
   sensors. Contestants' sensors were deployed in a series of trials
   designed to test their accuracy, repeatability, and stability in
   laboratory, coastal, and open-ocean settings. This report details the
   validation efforts behind the competition, which included designing the
   sensor evaluation trials, providing the conventional true pH values
   against which sensors were judged, and quantifying measurement
   uncertainty. Expanded uncertainty (coverage factor k=2, corresponding to
   95\% confidence) of validation measurements throughout the competition
   was approximately 0.01 pH units. A custom tank was designed for the
   coastal trials to expose the sensors to natural conditions, including
   temporal variability and biofouling, in a spatially homogenous
   environment. The competition prioritized the performance metrics of
   accuracy, repeatability, and stability over specific applications such
   as high-frequency measurements. Although the XPRIZE competition focused
   on pH sensors, it highlights considerations for testing other marine
   sensors and measuring seawater carbonate chemistry.},

Abstract = {This research aimed to evaluate the effects of partial or total
   replacement of fish oil (FO) with unrefined peanut oil (PO) on growth
   and some physiological parameters of Mozambique tilapia juveniles for 60
   days. Three triplicate groups (initial weight 6.36 +/- 0.19 g) were fed
   with isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets in which FO was replaced with
   PO in graded increments of 50\% (PO0, PO50, PO100). The results showed
   that weight gain and feed efficiency of fish fed with PO50 diet were
   statistically higher than in the other two groups (P<0.05). No
   significant effects were observed on whole body proximate composition of
   fish fed with the experimental diets (P>0.05). The partial or total
   replacement of FO with PO did not affect on the hematological and
   immunological parameters of fish. Serum glucose, total cholesterol and
   triglyceride were lower in fish fed with PO50 diet (P<0.05). The present
   study revealed that PO can be used as an alternate source of dietary
   lipid up to 50\% in tilapia feeds without adverse effects on growth
   performance, hemato-immunological and serum biochemical parameters},

Title = {Consumer preferences and willingness to pay for compact fluorescent

   Lucia},

Abstract = {This article examines consumer willingness to pay for energy-saving
   compact fluorescent light bulbs using the results of a stated
   preferences study conducted in the Caribbean island nation of Saint
   Lucia. Geographic location, low income status, and age are found to
   affect willingness-to-pay for compact fluorescent lighting, while higher
   income status and other demographic variables appear to have minimal or
   no significant impacts. Energy efficiency knowledge is associated with
   increased willingness-to-pay for energy-efficient bulbs and with
   increased use of compact fluorescent lighting. Contrary to theoretical
   expectations, past purchase of compact fluorescent bulbs is found to
   have no impact on self-reported willingness to pay. We hypothesize that
   this null result is due to the recent emergence of low-cost, low-quality
   compact fluorescent bulbs in the Saint Lucian lighting market, which may
   be negatively influencing consumers' preferences and expectations
   regarding energy-efficient lighting. Findings support the argument that
   government-sponsored education and subsidy programs will likely result
   in increased use of energy-saving technologies in Saint Lucia. But such
   behavioral changes may not be sustained in the long run unless low
   quality bulbs - the ``lemons{''} of the compact fluorescent lighting
   market - can be clearly identified by consumers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {A comparative study of large-scale atmospheric circulation in the
   context of a future scenario (RCP4.5) and past warmth (mid-Pliocene)},
Journal = {CLIMATE OF THE PAST},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1613-1627},
Abstract = {The mid-Pliocene warm period (similar to 3.3-3.0 Ma) is often considered
   as the last sustained warm period with close enough geographic
   configurations compared to the present one associated with atmospheric
   CO2 concentration (405 +/- 50 ppm) higher than the modern level. For
   this reason, this period is often considered as a potential analogue for
   the future climate warming, with the important advantage that for
   mid-Pliocene many marine and continental data are available. To
   investigate this issue, we selected the RCP4.5 scenario, one of the
   current available future projections, to compare the pattern of tropical
   atmospheric response with the past warm mid-Pliocene climate.
   We use three Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM)
   simulations (RCP4.5 scenario, midPliocene and present-day simulation)
   carried out with the IPSL-CM5A model and investigate atmospheric
   tropical dynamics through Hadley and Walker cell responses to warmer
   conditions, considering that the analysis can provide some assessment of
   how these circulations will change in the future. Our results show that
   there is a damping of the Hadley cell intensity in the northern tropics
   and an increase in both subtropics. Moreover, northern and southern
   Hadley cells expand poleward. The response of the Hadley cells is
   stronger for the RCP4.5 scenario than for the mid-Pliocene, but in very
   good agreement with the fact that the atmospheric CO2 concentration is
   higher in the future scenario than in the midPliocene (543 versus 405
   ppm). Concerning the response of the Walker cell, we show that despite
   very large similarities, there are also some differences. Common
   features to both scenarios are: weakening of the ascending branch,
   leading to a suppression of the precipitation over the western tropical
   Pacific. The response of the Walker cell is stronger in the RCP4.5
   scenario than in the mid-Pliocene but also depicts some major
   differences, as an eastward shift of its rising branch in the future
   scenario compared to the mid-Pliocene.
   In this paper, we explain the dynamics of the Hadley and Walker cells,
   and show that despite a minor discrepancy, the mid-Pliocene is certainly
   an interesting analogue for future climate changes in tropical areas.},

Abstract = {The native fucalean macroalga Carpophyllum flexuosum (Esper) Grev, has
   recently occupied many reefs on wave-exposed coasts in north-eastern New
   Zealand. At recently colonised sites, C. flexuosum occurs mainly on
   coralline-dominated areas with moderate densities of sea urchins
   (Evechinus chloroticus). At these sites. stipes of C. flexuosum are
   shorter, with more branching, reduced laminae, and increased stipe
   weights compared to those at sheltered sites. Survivorship of tagged
   individuals was less on wave-exposed than on sheltered reefs. On
   sheltered shores, small C. flexuosum suffered moderate mortality, but
   large individuals suffered little mortality from any source. All
   individuals transplanted from sheltered to wave-exposed shores died or
   became moribund as stipes, whereas those which survived transplanting
   from wave-exposed to sheltered shores assumed a morphology more
   characteristic of sheltered sites. Population modelling suggested that
   the existence of stands of C. flexuosum on wave-exposed shores is
   dependent on regular recruitment, though it is not clear whether
   populations are maintained by recruitment from within or without. The
   establishment of C. flexuosum on wave-exposed shores is correlated with
   decadal scale decreases in wave energy. We predict that the patchiness
   of recruitment of C. flexuosum in space and time rand the ubiquity and
   reproductive characteristics of the dominant laminarian Ecklonia
   radiata) and its susceptibility to wave action will prevent the fucalean
   from inducing long-term changes of assemblage organisation.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to compare the trapping efficiency
   of two Alsynite sticky traps (modified Williams and modified Broce) and
   two phtalogen blue cloth traps (Vavoua and Nzi) to be used in an
   integrated control programme of Stomoxys spp. (Diptera: Muscidae) on
   Reunion Island. Mean daily catches of these flies on two dairy farms
   differed significantly between the four types of trap. The Broce trap
   was the least efficient and had the lowest specificity for Stomoxys spp.
   The Vavoua, Nzi and Williams traps performed significantly better but
   could not be ranked on the basis of the numbers of Stomoxys caught
   because their respective performances differed between farms. Given the
   various practical criteria, it is concluded that, as control tools, blue
   cloth traps (Vavoua and Nzi) have practical advantages over the Williams
   trap. The Vavoua trap, which is less expensive and easier to use for
   farmers, seems adequate to complement other methods of fly control on
   Reunion Island.},

Abstract = {The distribution of species is shifting in response to recent climate
   change. Changes in the abundance and distributions of habitat-forming
   species can have knock-on effects on community structure, biodiversity
   patterns and ecological processes. We empirically examined temporal
   changes in the abundance of the warm-water kelp Laminaria ochroleuca at
   its poleward range edge in the Western English Channel. Resurveys of
   historical sites indicated that the abundance of L. ochroleuca has
   increased significantly in recent decades. Moreover, examination of
   historical records suggested that L. ochroleuca has extended its
   distribution from sheltered coasts on to moderately wave-exposed open
   coasts, where it now co-exists and competes with the assemblage dominant
   Laminaria hyperborea. Proliferation of L. ochroleuca at its poleward
   range edge corresponds with a period of rapid warming in the Western
   English Channel. Preliminary comparisons between L. ochroleuca and L.
   hyperborea highlighted some subtle but ecologically significant
   differences in structure and function. In summer, the average biomass of
   epiphytic stipe assemblages on L. hyperborea was 86 times greater than
   on L. ochroleuca whereas, on average, L. ochroleuca had a greater stipe
   length and its blade supported 18 times as many gastropod grazers
   (Gibbula cineraria). Differences in summer growth rates were also
   recorded, with L. ochroleuca being more productive than L. hyperborea
   throughout July. Comprehensive seasonally replicated comparisons are
   needed to examine the wider implications of proliferation of L.
   ochroleuca at its poleward range edge, but our study suggests that local
   biodiversity patterns and ecological processes (e.g. timing of
   productivity and trophic pathways) on shallow subtidal reefs may be
   altered by shifts in the relative abundances of habitat-forming kelp
   species.},

Title = {Beach-dune degradation in a Mediterranean context of strong development
   pressures, and the missing integrated management perspective},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {299-306},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean coast of Tetouan, south of the Spanish enclave of
   Ceuta, in Morroco, comprises headland-bound beach-dune systems bordering
   small coastal plains that are increasingly taken up by socio-economic
   activities and coastal infrastructure essentially related to tourism
   development. The 35 km shoreline shows a long-term (multi-decadal)
   erosional trend due jointly to the damming of the small wadis that
   hitherto supplied sand to the beach-dune system, the construction of
   leisure harbours that trap sand and act as boundaries to longshore sand
   redistribution, and continuous direct dune destruction. Over 95\% of the
   coastal dunes on this microtidal coast have now been destroyed by
   housing and tourism infrastructure, in a national context marked by a
   total absence of beach-dune management, and inscribed in an antiquated
   coastal development setback line of only 3 m relative to the high water
   level. The short-term sediment budgets of two contrasting beach-dune
   systems were analysed on the basis of digital elevation models obtained
   from three successive surveys conducted in February and March 2008 in
   order to document coastal response patterns to storms under the present
   conditions of sediment budget stress. Ksar Rimal comprises a narrow
   beach and a virtually completely destroyed dune, and Cabo Negro exhibits
   a wider beach and a partially degraded dune. The two beach-dune sites
   showed balanced sediment budgets, and resilience following a succession
   of a severe storm (maximum significant wave height (Hs) offshore of 4.2
   m), a moderate storm (maximum offshore Hs of 2.8 m) and fair-weather
   conditions (maximum offshore Hs < 1 m). The survey period is, however,
   too short to identify the imprint of chronic erosion, and at the short
   timescale of the study, the resilience shown by both beaches may simply
   imply that they are presently attuned to the current storm regime. Each
   beach exhibited a specific resilience mode. Ksar Rimal was dominated by
   changes essentially limited to the steep narrow beach, involving berm
   erosion and reformation. The mode on Cabo Negro beach involved sand
   exchange with the subsisting dune. Continuous dune destruction under
   development pressures and sand-supply deficit from the nearby wadis
   will, however, definitely be detrimental to both the protective role of
   dunes against storms and to beach-dune sand exchanges that contribute to
   the maintenance of a healthy coastal sediment budget. The case of the
   Tetouan coast is symptomatic of the situation of large portions of the
   coast of Morocco now under pressure from development, a situation that,
   unfortunately, mimicks that of many sectors of depositional coasts in
   the Mediterranean. Mitigation of coastal erosion requires a firm
   connection between coastal science and management, but also the rapid
   implementation of measures aimed at restoring the coastal sediment
   budget and assuring active beach-dune sand exchange. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Human activities are a major source of threat to marine ecosystems.
   Solutions thus require changes to or cessation of those activities in
   addition to multiple restorative and conservation efforts - all of
   which, in turn, require public support for success. However, scientific
   understanding of threats to marine ecosystems has not paralleled public
   understanding of those threats in many jurisdictions. Highly complex,
   interwoven, distant, vulnerable to multiple stressors, and hosting biota
   that are biologically unfamiliar to people, marine ecosystems present
   unique communication challenges.
   The merits of effective communication capable of motivating behavioural
   change, policy action and support for marine conservation are often
   emphasized. To date, however, environmental communication, as a field,
   has largely focused on terrestrial ecosystems and more recently on
   climate change, leaving research-informed marine conservation
   communication neglected.
   Adding to the small compilation of marine conservation communication
   literature, this integrative review provides a new understanding of how
   six message frames (emotional, problem/solution, outcome, value-based,
   distance, and social norm) can interactively help enhance the
   effectuality of conservation messages. Insights from the framing-related
   literature are merged with those from relevant fields including the
   theoretical literature, and the behavioural, social, and environmental
   sciences to define concepts, provide examples and explain the relevance
   of the six identified frames. The potential strength of these frames are
   discussed and suggestions on how they might be used to communicate
   different marine conservation issues are provided. 1.2.3.},

Title = {Chronic coral consumption by butterflyfishes},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-93},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Interactions between predators and prey organisms are of fundamental
   importance to ecological communities. While the ecological impact that
   grazing predators can have in terrestrial and temperate marine systems
   are well established, the importance of coral grazers on tropical reefs
   has rarely been considered. In this study, we estimate the biomass of
   coral tissue consumed by four prominent species of corallivorous
   butterflyfishes. Sub-adult butterflyfishes (60-70 mm, 6-11 g) remove
   between 0.6 and 0.9 g of live coral tissue per day, while larger adults
   (> 110 mm, similar to 40-50 g) remove between 1.5 and 3 g of coral
   tissue each day. These individual consumption rates correspond to the
   population of coral-feeding butterflyfishes at three exposed reef crest
   habitats at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, consuming between 14.6 g
   (+/- 2.0) and 19.6 g (+/- 3.9) .200 m(-2) day(-1) of coral tissue. When
   standardised to the biomass of butterflyfishes present, a combined
   reefwide removal rate of 4.2 g (+/- 1.2) of coral tissue is consumed per
   200 m(-2) kg(-1) of coral-feeding butterflyfishes. The quantity of coral
   tissue removed by these predators is considerably larger than previously
   expected and indicates that coral grazers are likely to play an
   important role in the transfer of energy fixed by corals to higher
   consumers. Chronic coral consumption by butterflyfishes is expected to
   exact a large energetic cost upon prey corals and contribute to an
   increased rate of coral loss on reefs already threatened by
   anthropogenic pressure and ongoing climate change.},

Title = {A review of methods used to analyse albatross diets-assessing priorities

Year = {2016},

Number = {9},
Pages = {2125-2137},

Abstract = {Many seabird populations are threatened by interactions with commercial
   fisheries, and climate change. Understanding their prey requirements and
   dietary flexibility in this context is important for effective
   conservation and management. However, changes in the methods used to
   assess diet, as well as the spatial and temporal coverage of monitoring
   schemes, may reduce our ability to detect and monitor these marine
   threats. To help assess conservation priorities linked to diet, we
   performed a systematic review of 109 albatross diet papers published
   between 1950 and 2016, which corresponded to 296 studies when stratified
   by sampling year, breeding site, and breeding species. We assessed the
   methods used, changes over time, and spatial and temporal sampling
   coverage by species and island group. Most albatross studies have
   focused on chick-rearing, and diet during other breeding phases is
   comparatively poorly known. Furthermore, chicks are more commonly
   sampled than adults and very rarely immature birds, all of which may
   differ in diet composition. There was a pronounced shift over time in
   the preferred method of characterising diet, from the morphological
   examination of prey remains to stable isotope analysis of tissue. This
   shift has reduced the volume of detailed taxonomic information available
   from morphological studies. This difference in resolution hinders the
   ability to detect changes in prey species, with implications for
   management of threatened albatrosses and for monitoring broader changes
   in marine ecosystems. In a knowledge gap analysis for important breeding
   colonies (with >5\% of global population), we identified key sites where
   existing monitoring has provided a foundation for robust longitudinal
   diet studies. Maintaining and augmenting these long-term research
   programmes will enable analyses of the impacts of changing climate and
   fishing practices on seabird populations and facilitate the timely
   identification and implementation of management options.},

Title = {Increasing Hydrostatic Pressure Impacts the Prokaryotic Diversity during
   Emiliania huxleyi Aggregates Degradation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the dark ocean, the balance between the heterotrophic carbon demand
   and the supply of sinking carbon through the biological carbon pump
   remains poorly constrained. In situ tracking of the dynamics of
   microbial degradation processes occurring on the gravitational sinking
   particles is still challenging. Our particle sinking simulator system
   (PASS) intends to mimic as closely as possible the in situ variations in
   pressure and temperature experienced by gravitational sinking particles.
   Here, we used the PASS to simultaneously track geochemical and microbial
   changes that occurred during the sinking through the mesopelagic zone of
   laboratory-grown Emiliania huxleyi aggregates amended by a natural
   microbial community sampled at 105 m depth in the North Atlantic Ocean.
   The impact of pressure on the prokaryotic degradation of POC and
   dissolution of E. huxleyi-derived calcite was not marked compared to
   atmospheric pressure. In contrast, using global O-2 consumption
   monitored in real-time inside the high-pressure bottles using planar
   optodes via a sapphire window, a reduction of respiration rate was
   recorded in surface-originated community assemblages under increasing
   pressure conditions. Moreover, using a 16S rRNA metabarcoding survey, we
   demonstrated a drastic difference in transcriptionally active
   prokaryotes associated with particles, incubated either at atmospheric
   pressure or under linearly increasing hydrostatic pressure conditions.
   The increase in hydrostatic pressure reduced both the phylogenetic
   diversity and the species richness. The incubation at atmospheric
   pressure, however, promoted an opportunistic community of ``fast ``
   degraders from the surface (Saccharospirillaceae, Hyphomonadaceae, and
   Pseudoalteromonadaceae), known to be associated with surface
   phytoplankton blooms. In contrast, the incubation under increasing
   pressure condition incubations revealed an increase in the particle
   colonizer families Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteraceae, and also
   Colwelliaceae, which are known to be adapted to high hydrostatic
   pressure. Altogether, our results underline the need to perform
   biodegradation experiments of particles in conditions that mimic
   pressure and temperature encountered during their sinking along the
   water column to be ecologically relevant.},

Title = {Sustained net CO2 evolution during photosynthesis by marine
   microorganisms},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {7},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Background: Many aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms possess an
   inorganic-carbon-concentrating mechanism that raises the CO2
   concentration at the intracellular carboxylation sites, thus
   compensating for the relatively low affinity of the carboxylating enzyme
   for its substrate. In cyanobacteria, the concentrating mechanism
   involves the energy-dependent influx of inorganic carbon, the
   accumulation of this carbon - largely in the form of HCO3- - in the
   cytoplasm, and the generation of CO2 at carbonic anhydrase sites in
   close proximity to the carboxylation sites.
   Results: During measurements of inorganic carbon fluxes associated with
   the inorganic-carbon-concentrating mechanism, we observed the surprising
   fact that several marine photosynthetic microorganisms, including
   significant contributors to oceanic primary productivity, can serve as a
   source of CO2 rather than a sink during CO2 fixation. The
   phycoerythrin-possessing cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. WH7803 evolved
   CO2 at a rate that increased with light intensity and attained a value
   approximately five-fold that for photosynthesis. The external CO2
   concentration reached was significantly higher than that predicted for
   chemical equilibrium between HCO3- and CO2, as confirmed by the rapid
   decline in the CO2 concentration upon the addition of carbonic
   anhydrase. Measurements of oxygen exchange between water and CO2, by
   means of stable isotopes, demonstrated that the evolved CO2 originated
   from HCO3- taken up and converted intracellularly to CO2 in a
   light-dependent process.
   Conclusions: We report net, sustained CO2 evolution during
   photosynthesis. The results have implications for energy balance and pH
   regulation of the cells, for carbon cycling between the cells and the
   marine environment, and for the observed fractionation of stable carbon
   isotopes. (C) Current Biology Ltd ISSN 0960-9822.},

Title = {Modeling urban evapotranspiration using remote sensing, flux footprints,
   and artificial intelligence},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {786},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {As climate change progresses, urban areas are increasingly affected by
   water scarcity and the urban heat island effect. Evapotranspiration (ET)
   is a crucial component of urban greening initiatives of cities worldwide
   aimed at mitigating these issues. However, ET estimation methods in
   urban areas have so far been limited. An expanding number of flux towers
   in urban environments provide the opportunity to directly measure ET by
   the eddy covariance method. In this study, we present a novel approach
   to model urban ET by combining flux footprint modeling, remote sensing
   and geographic information system (GIS) data, and deep learning and
   machine learning techniques. This approach facilitates spatio-temporal
   extrapolation of ET at a half-hourly resolution; we tested this approach
   with a two-year dataset from two flux towers in Berlin, Germany. The
   benefit of integrating remote sensing and GIS data into models was
   investigated by testing four predictor scenarios. Two algorithms (1D
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest (RF)) were
   compared. The best-performing models were then used to model ET values
   for the year 2019. The inclusion of GIS data extracted using flux
   footprints enhanced the predictive accuracy of models, particularly when
   meteorological data was more limited. The bestperforming scenario
   (meteorological and GIS data) showed an RMSE of 0.0239 mm/h and R2 of
   0.840 with RF and an RMSE of 0.0250 mm/h and a R2 of 0.824 with 1D CNN
   for the more vegetated site. The 2019 ET sum was substantially higher at
   the site surrounded by more urban greenery (366 mm) than at the
   inner-city site (223 mm), demonstrating the substantial influence of
   vegetation on the urban water cycle. The proposed method is highly
   promising for modeling ET in a heterogeneous urban environment and can
   support climate change mitigation initiatives of urban areas worldwide.

Title = {Detailed investigation of overwash on a gravel barrier},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {350},
Pages = {27-38},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {This paper uses results obtained from a prototype-scale experiment
   (Barrier Dynamics Experiment: BARDEX) undertaken in the Delta flume, the
   Netherlands, to investigate overwash hydraulics and morphodynamics of a
   prototype gravel barrier. Gravel barrier behaviour depends upon a number
   of factors, including sediment properties (porosity, permeability,
   grain-size) and wave climate. Since overwash processes are known to
   control short-term gravel barrier dynamics and long-term barrier
   migration, a detailed quantification of overwash flow properties and
   induced bed-changes is crucial. Overwash hydrodynamics of the prototype
   gravel barrier focused on the flow velocity, depth and discharge over
   the barrier crest, and the overwash flow progression across and the
   infiltration through the barrier. During the BARDEX experiment, overwash
   peak depth (0.77 m), velocity (5 m s(-1)) and discharge (max. 6 m(3)
   m(-1)) were high, especially considering the relatively modest wave
   energy (significant wave height = 0.8 m). Conversely to schemes found in
   the literature, average flow depth did not linearly decrease across the
   barrier; rather, it was characterised by a sudden decrease at the crest,
   a milder decrease at the barrier top and then propagation as a shallow
   water lens over the backbarrier. The barrier morphological evolution was
   analysed over a series of 15-min experimental runs and at the timescale
   of individual overwash events. Overall, the morphological variation did
   not result from an accumulation of many small consistently erosive or
   accretionary events, but rather the mean bed elevation change per event
   was quite large (10 mm) and the overall morphology change occurred due
   to a small imbalance in the number of erosive and accretionary events at
   each location. Two relationships between overwash hydrodynamic variables
   were deduced from results: (1) between overwash flow depth and velocity
   a power-type relation was obtained; and (2) a linear relation was
   observed between overwash flow depth and maximum overwash intrusion
   distance across the barrier top (i.e. overwash intrusion). Findings from
   this study are useful to enhance the knowledge of overwash processes and
   also have practical applications. On the one hand, results shown here
   can be use for the validation of overwash predictive models, and
   additionally, the simple empirical relations deduced from the dataset
   can be used by coastal managers to estimate overwash intrusion distance,
   which in turn can assist in the location of areas under risk of overwash
   and breaching. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Monitoring the sedimentary budget and dislocated boulders in western
   Greece - results since 2008},
Journal = {SEDIMENTOLOGY},

Abstract = {Dislocated boulders are one sign of high-energy wave impacts on coasts.
   These high-energy impacts, caused by severe storms or tsunamis, can
   trigger initial cracking and transport of boulders. Monitoring of these
   boulders, as well as the associated coastal sites is important in
   distinguishing between gradual coastal processes and high-energy events.
   Western Greece is a seismically active area, where tsunamis and
   high-energetic storms might occur and such past events are documented by
   historic and geoscientific research, making it an ideal location for
   monitoring dislocated boulders. Since 2008, monitoring of eight
   different coastal sites in this region was conducted by terrestrial
   laser scanning and photogrammetric approaches, with low-cost unmanned
   aerial vehicles. The re-use of similar surveying points in following
   years, allowed highly accurate monitoring. Point clouds derived from
   these methods were evaluated for change detection by point cloud
   comparisons. The data were also used to establish accurate
   three-dimensional models of dislocated boulders (n = 70). The determined
   boulder volumes of these accurate three-dimensional models were
   incorporated in wave transport equations and wave decay curves, and
   compared with monitoring results. A comprehensive overview of dislocated
   boulders in western Greece is presented. Three-dimensional boulder
   reconstruction is compared to an approach which uses a tape-based
   measuring of boulder axes, with the tape-based measurement showing a
   mean overestimation of mass by 32\%. Accurate monitoring over time by
   both methods, is achieved by using fixed networks of reference points.
   Changes for each site over time, detected by direct point cloud
   comparisons, are fit to the possible inundation calculated by wave decay
   curves based on computed minimum wave heights for boulder transport.
   Both storm and tsunami waves may have initiated movement from the cliff
   edge and further transport is also possible. However, boulders showed no
   further movement from their current position in the area for the time
   period of this study.},

Abstract = {The ocean is of great significance in the climate system, global
   resources and strategic decision making. With the continuous improvement
   in remote sensing technology, ocean remote sensing research has
   increasingly become an important topic for resource development and
   environmental protection. This paper uses bibliometric analysis method
   and VOSviewer visual software to conduct analysis. The analysis focuses
   on the period from 1990 to 2020. The analysis results show that articles
   have been steadily increasing over the past two decades. Scholars and
   researchers form the United States, China and Europe (mainly Western
   European countries), as well as NASA, Chinese Academy of Sciences and
   NOAA have bigger influence in this field to some extent. Among them, the
   United States and NASA holds the core leading position. Moreover, global
   cooperation in this field presents certain characteristics of
   geographical distribution. This study also reveals journals that include
   the most publications and subject categories that are highly relevant to
   related fields. Cluster analysis shows that remote sensing, ocean color,
   MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), chlorophy, sea
   ice and climate change are main research hotspots. In addition, in the
   context of climate warming, researchers have improved monitoring
   technology for remote sensing to warn and protect ocean ecosystems in
   hotspots (the Arctic and Antarctica). The valuable results obtained from
   this study will help academic professionals keep informed of the latest
   developments and identify future research directions in the field
   related to ocean remote sensing.},

Abstract = {Subterranean ecosystems present ideal opportunities to study mechanisms
   underlying responses to changes in climate because species within them
   are often adapted to a largely constant temperature. We have
   characterized the thermal conditions of caves in the western Alps, and
   related these hypogean climate data to the occurrence of Troglohyphantes
   spiders (Araneae, Linyphiidae). Our data indicated that present
   distributions reflect Pleistocene glaciation events and also pointed to
   specific responses as a consequence of changes in temperature. Constant
   temperatures recorded inside caves provide an approximation of the mean
   annual temperature outside, thus we extended the results to a regional
   scale. We used ecological niche modeling to predict habitat suitability
   both in the Pleistocene and under future global warming scenarios. These
   analyses pointed toward a future decline in habitat suitability for
   subterranean spiders and the potential extinction of the most restricted
   endemic species. When compared with other species that live in confined
   habitats such as islands and mountains, we expect cave species to be as
   much, if not more, vulnerable to climate change.},

Abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is now recognized as an important
   pathway between land and sea. As such, this flow may contribute to the
   biogeochemical and other marine budgets of near-shore waters. These
   discharges typically display significant spatial and temporal
   variability making assessments difficult. Groundwater seepage is patchy,
   diffuse, temporally variable, and may involve multiple aquifers. Thus,
   the measurement of its magnitude and associated chemical fluxes is a
   challenging enterprise.
   A joint project of UNESCO and the International Atomic Energy Agency
   (IAEA) has examined several methods of SGD assessment and carried out a
   series of five intercomparison experiments in different hydrogeologic
   environments (coastal plain, karst, glacial till, fractured crystalline
   rock, and volcanic terrains). This report reviews the scientific and
   management significance of SGD, measurement approaches, and the results
   of the intercomparison experiments. We conclude that while the process
   is essentially ubiquitous in coastal areas, the assessment of its
   magnitude at any one location is subject to enough variability that
   measurements should be made by a variety of techniques and over large
   enough spatial and temporal scales to capture the majority of these
   changing conditions.
   We feel that all the measurement techniques described here are valid
   although they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is
   recommended that multiple approaches be applied whenever possible. In
   addition, a continuing effort is required in order to capture
   long-period tidal fluctuations, storm effects, and seasonal variations.

Title = {Ocean acidification does not overlook sex: Review of understudied
   effects and implications of low pH on marine invertebrate sexual
   reproduction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Sexual reproduction is a fundamental process essential for species
   persistence, evolution, and diversity. However, unprecedented
   oceanographic shifts due to climate change can impact physiological
   processes, with important implications for sexual reproduction.
   Identifying bottlenecks and vulnerable stages in reproductive cycles
   will enable better prediction of the organism, population, community,
   and global-level consequences of ocean change. This article reviews how
   ocean acidification impacts sexual reproductive processes in marine
   invertebrates and highlights current research gaps. We focus on five
   economically and ecologically important taxonomic groups: cnidarians,
   crustaceans, echinoderms, molluscs and ascidians. We discuss the spatial
   and temporal variability of experimental designs, identify trends of
   performance in acidified conditions in the context of early reproductive
   traits (gametogenesis, fertilization, and reproductive resource
   allocation), and provide a quantitative meta-analysis of the published
   literature to assess the effects of low pH on fertilization rates across
   taxa. A total of 129 published studies investigated the effects of ocean
   acidification on 122 species in selected taxa. The impact of ocean
   acidification is dependent on taxa, the specific reproductive process
   examined, and study location. Our meta-analysis reveals that
   fertilization rate decreases as pH decreases, but effects are
   taxa-specific. Echinoderm fertilization appears more sensitive than
   molluscs to pH changes, and while data are limited, fertilization in
   cnidarians may be the most sensitive. Studies with echinoderms and
   bivalve molluscs are prevalent, while crustaceans and cephalopods are
   among the least studied species even though they constitute some of the
   largest fisheries worldwide. This lack of information has important
   implications for commercial aquaculture, wild fisheries, and
   conservation and restoration of wild populations. We recommend that
   studies expose organisms to different ocean acidification levels during
   the entire gametogenic cycle, and not only during the final stages
   before gametes or larvae are released. We argue for increased focus on
   fundamental reproductive processes and associated molecular mechanisms
   that may be vulnerable to shifts in ocean chemistry. Our recommendations
   for future research will allow for a better understanding of how
   reproduction in invertebrates will be affected in the context of a
   rapidly changing environment.},

Title = {Sensitivity of estuaries to sea level rise: Vulnerability indices},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {60-68},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {This study addresses the question of how tidally-dominated estuaries
   will adapt to rises in mean sea level and changes in river flows
   associated with global climate change. The aim was to develop generic
   `Vulnerability Indices' to provide immediate indications of relative
   resilience or sensitivity. Four indices indicate the likely impacts on:
   (1) Mass flow, (2) Energetics, (3) Vertical mixing and (4) Salinity
   intrusion.
   Application of these indices to 96 estuaries in England and Wales
   suggests that a mean sea-level rise of 1 m will:
   have little overall effect on mass flows but significant impacts on
   energy dissipation levels, especially in depths less than about 10 m
   have a small impact on levels of vertical mixing in deeper estuaries,
   but a significant impact in shallow (<10 m), micro-tidal estuaries
   increase the salinity intrusion length by at least 7\% in the deepest
   estuaries and by in excess of 25\% in estuaries shallower than 10 m.
   In seaward regions of strongly tidal estuaries, impacts from changes in
   river flow, Q have little effect on either mass flow or energetics.
   However, a change of 25\% (either increase or decrease) will have
   significant effects on both vertical mixing and salinity intrusion. The
   impacts on vertical mixing will be greatest in estuaries closer to
   micro-tidal conditions. Saline intrusion lengths will increase in
   proportion to the related decrease in river flow (and vice versa).
   These impacts must be considered alongside likely accompanying evolution
   in morphologies indicated by Prandle (2006). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A sulfidic driver for the end-Ordovician mass extinction},
Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {331},
Pages = {128-139},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The end-Ordovician extinction consisted of two discrete pulses, both
   linked, in various ways, to glaciation at the South Pole. The first
   phase, starting just below the Normalograptus extraordinarius Zone,
   particularly affected nektonic and planktonic species, while the second
   pulse, associated with the Normalograptus persculptus Zone, was less
   selective. Glacially induced cooling and oxygenation are two of many
   suggested kill mechanisms for the end-Ordovician extinction, but a
   general consensus is lacking. We have used geochemical redox indicators,
   such as iron speciation, molybdenum concentrations, pyrite framboid size
   distribution and sulfur isotopes to analyze the geochemistry in three
   key Hirnantian sections. These indicators reveal that reducing
   conditions were occasionally present at all three sites before the first
   pulse of the end-Ordovician extinction, and that these conditions
   expanded towards the second pulse. Even though the N. extraordinarius
   Zone appears to have been a time of oxygenated deposition, pyrite is
   significantly enriched in S-34 in our sections as well as in sections
   reported from South China. This suggests a widespread reduction in
   marine sulfate concentrations, which we attribute to an increase in
   pyrite burial during the early Hirnantian. The S-isotope excursion
   coincides with a major positive carbon isotope excursion indicating
   elevated rates of organic carbon burial as well. We argue that euxinic
   conditions prevailed and intensified in the early Hirnantian oceans, and
   that a concomitant global sea level lowering pushed the chemocline
   deeper than the depositional setting of our sites. In the N. persculptus
   Zone, an interval associated with a major sea level rise, our redox
   indicators suggests that euxinic conditions, and ferruginous in some
   places, encroached onto the continental shelves. In our model, the
   expansion of euxinic conditions during the N. extraordinarius Zone was
   generated by a reorganization of nutrient cycling during sea level fall,
   and we argue, overall, that these dynamics in ocean chemistry played an
   important role for the end-Ordovician mass extinction. During the first
   pulse of the extinction, euxinia and a steepened oxygen gradient in the
   water column caused habitat loss for deep-water benthic and nektonic
   organisms. During the second pulse, the transgression of anoxic water
   onto the continental shelves caused extinction in shallower habitats.

Abstract = {Drifting cylindrical traps and the flux proxy Th-234 indicate more than
   an order of magnitude higher sinking fluxes of particulate carbon and
   Th-234 in January 2009 than measured by a time-series conical trap used
   regularly on the shelf of the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The higher
   fluxes measured in this study have several implications for our
   understanding of the WAP ecosystem. Larger sinking fluxes result in a
   revised export efficiency of at least 10\% (C flux/net primary
   production) and a requisite lower regeneration efficiency in surface
   waters. High fluxes also result in a large supply of sinking organic
   matter to support subsurface and benthic food webs on the continental
   shelf. These new findings call into question the magnitude of seasonal
   and interannual variability in particle flux and reaffirm the difficulty
   of using moored conical traps as a quantitative flux collector in
   shallow waters. Citation: Buesseler, K. O., A. M. P. McDonnell, O. M. E.

Abstract = {Man's admiration of the underwater world has been recorded ever since
   ancient times and to this day, it does not cease to amaze large sections
   of modern society. Whether for recreational or sport purposes,
   commercial activities or strategic military operations, the underwater
   environment plays an amusing yet inhospitable host to its many
   explorers. Knowledge and respect for our oceans are keys for a
   sustainable and safe relationship between humans and the underwater.
   People have often used their ingenuity for adaptation to various
   environments and the technology for allowing divers to reach extreme
   places in a safe manner is developing rapidly. This paper will
   investigate benefits of using robots as diving buddies for aiding
   underwater navigation. In a typical dive mission scenario, a diver is
   given relative distance and bearings to an underwater target as he tries
   to overcome environmental influences to navigate to that target using
   customary diving equipment; a compass and diving computer/watch. Diving
   robots can introduce sensors capable of achieving advanced navigation
   and guiding divers even in low visibility conditions. The experiment in
   this paper compares these two approaches and validates the results in a
   simulation environment on 26 participants. The success rate in finding
   and reaching the targets are compared in terms of time and distance
   travelled. Finally, the simulation tools are evaluated by participants
   as well as its potential in developing algorithms and user training
   using a NASA-TLX workload estimation scale. Copyright (C) 2022 The

Title = {Inverse effects of recent warming on trees growing at the low and high
   altitudes of the Dabie Mountains, subtropical China},
Journal = {DENDROCHRONOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {59},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding how tree rings of different species at different
   elevations respond to climate, and whether their relationship is stable
   over time is crucial not only for credible palaeoclimatic
   reconstructions, but also for better awareness of forest growth dynamics
   and therefore making scientific management decisions against a
   background of global warming. In this work, six tree-ring chronologies
   of Pinus taiwanensis at three sites from 800 to 1550 m above sea level
   (asl), and Pinus massoniana at three sites from 500 to 650 m asl were
   developed in the Dabie Mountains (DBS), subtropical China. In recent
   decades, only P. taiwanensis at 1550 m asl showed a positive
   growth-trend. Both P. taiwanensis at 800 m asl and three low-altitude P.
   massoniana at 500-650 m asl showed negative growth trends.
   Climate-growth relationship analyses revealed that 1) temperature was
   the dominant climatic factor that controlled tree-ring growth in DBS. It
   exerted most influence on trees growing at the lower and upper limit,
   than for trees growing at altitudes from 650 to 1450 m asl. Only
   precipitation in October positively influenced tree growth of P.
   massoniana at all three sites and P. taiwanensis at 800 m asl; 2) There
   was a shift in temperature's impact on trees, that was from
   significantly negative relationship at the four lower altitudes, mainly
   for the current growing-season, to significantly positive relationship
   in previous February-July period at the highest altitude. The higher the
   altitude, the more significant the lag effect of temperature on trees;
   3) The influence of temperature on tree growth at most altitudes were
   variable over time. The positive influence of temperature on trees at
   1550 and 1450 m asl was comparatively stable during the early period of
   instrumental records. It strengthened evidently since the early 1990s,
   which is coincidental with the timing of the evident temperature
   increase in DBS. On the contrary, the negative impacts of temperature on
   tree growth at 800, 650 and 500 m asl had weakened since the early
   1990s. Besides the increase of water use efficiency of trees, we
   speculated that the increasing influence of precipitation in May and
   July weakened the relationship between temperature and tree rings at low
   altitudes. This work points out that the upper and lower limits of
   forest in DBS offer the preferred locations for future sampling in
   climate reconstruction, but the stability of tree growth and climate
   over time should be considered. Moreover, forest management should give
   priority to altitude factors, in addition to tree species
   representation.},

Title = {A Hybrid Islanding Detection Method Based on Lissajous Pattern Having
   Robust Performance Under Various Power Quality Scenarios},
Journal = {IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL},
Abstract = {A fast, accurate, robust, and two-staged islanding detection technique
   (IDT) is proposed. It is the hybridization of second-order general
   integrator-frequency locked loop (SOGI-FLL), Lissajous pattern (LP), and
   active power absorption-cum-reactive power injection via dc-bus
   connected battery unit-based inverter. The LP is used to identify
   islanding condition on the basis of frequency variation of fundamental
   voltage. Here, the measured ac voltage signal is preprocessed by
   SOGI-FLL to obtain fundamental bus voltage under various power quality
   scenarios. This assures robust islanding detection by removing
   uncertainty, and thus, reliability is improved. The uncertainty effects
   due to the partial shading condition of the PV module (source-side
   disturbance) and weak grid-connected condition are avoided by dc-bus
   connected battery storage unit. Thus, it removes above-said limitations
   of the existing scheme. The LP-based detection within the nondetection
   zone is expedited due to active and reactive powers variation via
   controlling of the inverter and charging operation of the dc-bus
   connected battery unit. During the reactive power injection by solar
   inverter, active power is absorbed by dc-bus connected battery unit. In
   effect, an active power output of the inverter is reduced. Here, the
   reactive power injection at the reduced active power output condition of
   the inverter accelerates frequency variation allowing rapid islanding
   detection. The real-time experiments are carried out using Typhoon-HIL
   tools to compare the proposed method with other works reported in the
   literature. Improved performances under diversified scenarios are found
   in the proposed case.},

Abstract = {Climate change constitutes an additional threat for intertidal species
   that already have to cope with a challenging environment. The present
   study focuses on the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and aims at
   investigating the importance of thermal acclimation in heat stress
   response. Microcosm exposures were performed with mussels submitted to
   an identical acute thermal stress following two thermal summer
   acclimations standing for present or future temperature conditions. Gill
   proteomes were analyzed by 2DE and 96 differentially expressed
   proteoforms were identified. Our results show that cell integrity
   appears to be maintained by the rise in molecular protective systems
   (i.e. Heat Shock Proteins), and by the reallocation of energy production
   via a switch to anaerobic metabolism and the setting up of alternative
   energy pathways. Finally, our results indicate that the response of
   mussels to acute thermal stress is conditioned by the acclimation
   temperature with an improved response in organisms acclimated to higher
   temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modeling spatial variability in offshore geotechnical properties for
   reliability-based foundation design},
Journal = {STRUCTURAL SAFETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {49},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {18-26},
Abstract = {Design of foundations for offshore energy production typically requires
   soil characterization over large areas. Often, in uniform geological
   settings, it is neither practical nor economical to acquire geotechnical
   data at every foundation location. Additionally, the zone of interest
   for the foundation may extend deeper than the available geotechnical
   data. This paper describes a model of spatial variability in
   geotechnical properties for foundation design in deep water Gulf of
   Mexico. The geology consists of normally to slightly over-consolidated
   marine clays. Data are available for about 100 locations with soil
   borings, jumbo piston cores and cone penetration tests. A random field
   model that describes spatial variations in the design undrained shear
   strength is formulated and calibrated. This model is incorporated into a
   reliability-based framework to account for uncertainty due to spatial
   variability in foundation design. In this setting, depth-averaged values
   of design undrained shear strength are correlated over longer distances
   than point values due to stratigraphic features. There is less variation
   and greater spatial correlation in the design undrained shear strength
   for deeper versus shallower deposits and along the continental shelf
   versus off from the shelf. The increased conservatism required in
   foundation design due to spatial variability when site-specific strength
   data are not available is generally small. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Experience staging and symbolic knowledge: The case of Bornholm culinary
   products},
Journal = {EUROPEAN URBAN AND REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4, SI},

Abstract = {The ongoing changes in Western food markets and the emergence of
   alternative' agri-food production-consumption systems have been
   conceptualized in numerous ways but very rarely in terms of an
   experience turn'. This article applies the perspective offered by the
   concept of the experience economy and empirically analyses the
   development and marketing of culinary products from the Danish island of
   Bornholm as production-side activities in a larger territorial staging
   system' which at consumption-side primarily relates to urban consumers.
   A second analytical focus is on the knowledge aspects of
   experience-based economic activities. The knowledge aspects of the
   coordinated staging activities of Bornholm firms, business networks and
   governance actors are studied by use of the differentiated knowledge
   bases taxonomy, which includes a category of socio-cultural symbolic'
   knowledge, complementary to the technological and scientific types of
   knowledge important for developing functional assets of products. The
   data and analyses suggest that the experience economy perspective can
   enrich the research on alternative food production systems by directing
   attention to the crucial role of strategic, coordinated staging of
   experiences that reach the consumers in and outside the region. Second,
   the article shows that the innovation and staging of experience
   offerings and authenticity-based products relies on symbolic knowledge
   dynamics in creating and communicating commercially relevant cultural
   values and meanings and that the sources of such knowledge dynamics are
   not only local but to a large extent extra-regional and multi-scalar.
   These findings are indications of new opportunities, barriers and
   external linkages for rural areas.},

Title = {Quantification of octacalcium phosphate, authigenic apatite and detrital
   apatite in coastal sediments using differential dissolution and standard
   addition},
Journal = {OCEAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {571-585},
Abstract = {Knowledge of calcium phosphate (Ca-P) solubility is crucial for
   understanding temporal and spatial variations of phosphorus (P)
   concentrations in water bodies and sedimentary reservoirs. In situ
   relationships between liquid-and solid-phase levels cannot be fully
   explained by dissolved analytes alone and need to be verified by
   determining particular sediment P species. Lack of quantification
   methods for these species limits the knowledge of the P cycle. To
   address this issue, we (i) optimized a specifically developed
   conversion-extraction (CONVEX) method for P species quantification using
   standard additions, and (ii) simultaneously determined solubilities of
   Ca-P standards by measuring their pH-dependent contents in the sediment
   matrix. Ca-P minerals including various carbonate fluorapatite (CFAP)
   specimens from different localities, fluorapatite (FAP), fish bone
   apatite, synthetic hydroxylapatite (HAP) and octacalcium phosphate (OCP)
   were characterized by XRD, Raman, FTIR and elemental analysis. Sediment
   samples were incubated with and without these reference minerals and
   then sequentially extracted to quantify Ca-P species by their
   differential dissolution at pH values between 3 and 8. The
   quantification of solid-phase phosphates at varying pH revealed
   solubilities in the following order: OCP> HAP> CFAP (4.5\% CO3)> CFAP
   (3.4\% CO3)> CFAP (2.2\% CO3)> FAP. Thus, CFAP was less soluble in
   sediment than HAP, and CFAP solubility increased with carbonate content.
   Unspiked sediment analyses together with standard addition analyses
   indicated consistent differential dissolution of natural sediment
   species vs. added reference species and therefore verified the
   applicability of the CONVEX method in separately determining the most
   prevalent Ca-P minerals. We found surprisingly high OCP contents in the
   coastal sediments analyzed, which supports the hypothesis of apatite
   formation by an OCP precursor mechanism.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the Tropical Rain belts with an Annual cycle and a
   Continent Model Intercomparison Project (TRACMIP). TRACMIP studies the
   dynamics of tropical rain belts and their response to past and future
   radiative forcings through simulations with 13 comprehensive and one
   simplified atmosphere models coupled to a slab ocean and driven by
   seasonally varying insolation. Five idealized experiments, two with an
   aquaplanet setup and three with a setup with an idealized tropical
   continent, fill the space between prescribed-SST aquaplanet simulations
   and realistic simulations provided by CMIP5/6. The simulations reproduce
   key features of present-day climate and expected future climate change,
   including an annual-mean intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) that is
   located north of the equator and Hadley cells and eddy-driven jets that
   are similar to present-day climate. Quadrupling CO2 leads to a northward
   ITCZ shift and preferential warming in Northern high latitudes. The
   simulations show interesting CO2-induced changes in the seasonal
   excursion of the ITCZ and indicate a possible state dependence of
   climate sensitivity. The inclusion of an idealized continent modulates
   both the control climate and the response to increased CO2; for example,
   it reduces the northward ITCZ shift associated with warming and, in some
   models, climate sensitivity. In response to eccentricity-driven seasonal
   insolation changes, seasonal changes in oceanic rainfall are best
   characterized as a meridional dipole, while seasonal continental
   rainfall changes tend to be symmetric about the equator. This survey
   illustrates TRACMIP's potential to engender a deeper understanding of
   global and regional climate and to address questions on past and future
   climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the feasibility analysis of co-fired combined cycles
   (biomass-derived gas + natural gas) based on the gasification of
   sugarcane residues (bagasse and trash). Performance results are based on
   simulation of co-fired combined cycles. Feasibility analysis is based on
   estimates of the capital costs and O\&M costs for such cycles, taking
   into account current and middle term costs of BIG-CC technology (both
   considering scaling and learning effects). A deep reduction of the
   investments regarding the gasification island and auxiliaries is a key
   point to make BIG-CC competitive in the electricity market, and the
   required learning can be reached with co-fired BIG-CC systems. Besides
   alleviation of technical problems related to gas turbine operation with
   biomass-derived gas, co-fired BIG-CC units can operate with relative
   flexibility regarding the fuel mix. The construction of 10-15 short- to
   medium-size gasification islands would be enough to induce important
   cost reductions due to learning effects. As long as the investment on
   the gasification island is reduced, and depending on the price ratio of
   natural gas and biomass, pure BIG-CC plants could achieve a reasonable
   level of feasibility regarding other options of electricity production.
   In the short run there is no advantage for co-fired combined cycles
   regarding the costs of reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, but in the
   middle run both co-fired and pure BIG-CC power plants can be a better
   option than capture and storage Of CO2. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Tidal dissipation within a short-period transiting extrasolar planet
   perturbed by a companion object can drive orbital evolution of the
   system to a so-called tidal fixed point, in which the apses of the
   transiting planet and its perturber are aligned, and variations in
   orbital eccentricities vanish. Significant contribution to the apsidal
   precession rate is made by gravitational quadrupole fields, created by
   the transiting planets tidal and rotational distortions. The fixed-point
   orbital eccentricity of the inner planet is therefore a strong function
   of its interior structure. We illustrate these ideas in the specific
   context of the recently discovered HAT-P-13 exoplanetary system, and
   show that one can already glean important insights into the physical
   properties of the inner transiting planet. We present structural models
   of the planet, which indicate that its observed radius can be maintained
   for a one-parameter sequence of models that properly vary core mass and
   tidal energy dissipation in the interior. We use an octupole-order
   secular theory of the orbital dynamics to derive the dependence of the
   inner planet's eccentricity, e(b), on its tidal Love number, k(2b). We
   find that the currently measured eccentricity, e(b) = 0.021 +/- 0.009,
   implies 0.116 < k(2b) < 0.425, 0 M(circle plus) < M(core) < 120 M(circle
   plus), and 10,000 < Q(b) < 300,000. Improved measurement of the
   eccentricity will soon allow for far tighter limits to be placed on all
   of these quantities, and will provide an unprecedented probe into the
   interior structure of an extrasolar planet.},

Abstract = {Ultrasonic disinfection involves the application of low-frequency
   acoustic energy in a water body to induce cavitation. The implosion of
   cavitation bubbles generates high speed microjets > 1 km/s, intense
   shock wave > 1 GPa, localized hot spots > 1000 K, and free-radicals,
   resulting in cell rupture and death of micro-organisms and pathogens.
   Treatment of marine ballast water using power ultrasonics is an
   energy-intensive process. Compared with other physical treatment methods
   such as ultraviolet disinfection, ultrasonic disinfection require 2 to 3
   orders of magnitude more energy to achieve similar rate of
   micro-organism mortality. Current technology limits the amount of
   acoustic energy that can be transferred per unit volume of fluid and
   presents challenges when it comes to high-flow applications. Significant
   advancements in ultrasonic processing technology are needed before
   ultrasound can be recognized as a viable alternative disinfection
   method. The ultrasonic resonator has been identified as one of the areas
   of improvement that can potentially contribute to the overall
   performance of an ultrasonic disinfection system. The present study
   focuses on the design of multiple-orifice resonators (MOR) for
   generating a well-distributed cavitation field. Results show that the
   MOR resonator offers significantly larger vibrational surface area to
   mass ratio. In addition, acoustic pressure measurements indicate that
   the MOR resonators are able to distribute the acoustic energy across a
   larger surface area, while generating 2-4 times higher pressures than
   existing ultrasonic probes. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Soil nematode community assembly in a primary tropical lowland
   rainforest},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {More than half of the world's tropical lowland rainforests have been
   lost due to conversion to agricultural land (such as rubber
   plantations). Thus, ecological restoration in degraded tropical lowland
   rainforests is crucial. The first step to restoration is restoring soil
   functioning (i.e., soil fertility, carbon, and nitrogen cycling) to
   levels similar to those in the primary tropical lowland rainforest. This
   requires understanding soil nematode community assembly in primary
   tropical lowland rainforest, which has never been explored in this
   habitat. In this study, we measured species compositions of plant and
   soil nematode communities and soil characteristics (pH, total and
   available nitrogen, phosphorus, and soil water content) in a primary
   tropical lowland rainforest, which is located on Hainan Island, China.
   We performed two tests (the null-model test and distance-based Moran's
   eigenvector maps (MEM) and redundancy analysis-based variance
   partitioning) to quantify the relative contribution of the deterministic
   (abiotic filtering and biotic interactions) and stochastic processes
   (random processes and dispersal limitation) to the soil nematode
   community. We found that a deterministic process (habitat filtering)
   determined nematode community assembly in our tropical lowland
   rainforest. Moreover, soil properties, but not plant diversity, were the
   key determinants of nematode community assembly. We have, for the first
   time, managed to identify factors that contribute to the nematode
   community assembly in the tropical lowland rainforest. This quantified
   community assembly mechanism can guide future soil functioning recovery
   of the tropical lowland rainforest.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION},

Abstract = {The deposition and distribution of trace metals in surface sediments of
   the karstic, microtidal and low-wave energy environment of the Neretva
   River delta and the adjacent coastal region were investigated. These
   processes were studied in relation to the sedimentological
   characteristics of the deposits, their surface physico-chemical
   properties, i.e., specific surface area (SSA) and cation exchange
   capacity (CEC), and the content, characteristics and origin of
   sedimentary organic matter (SOM). The results indicate two principal
   mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of trace metals in the
   delta plain and adjacent marine surface sediments. Firstly, the presence
   of SOM in the delta plain freshwater sediments exerts a significant
   effect on their surface properties, thus influencing the distribution of
   trace metals, particularly Cd. In the Neretva Channel, the highest share
   of the terrestrial component of SOM (estimated from delta C-13 values of
   organic carbon) was found in the proximity of the river mouth. This
   coincides with the markedly elevated concentrations of Pb, Cu and Cd,
   indicating their association with organic substances of terrestrial
   origin. Secondly, the spatial distributions of Ni, Co and Zn in the
   surface marine sediments of the Neretva Channel are closely related to
   the sedimentation dynamics and deposition pattern of the river-borne
   fine-grained particles. The strong correlation between the
   concentrations of Ni, Co and Zn and the content of Al, Fe and Mn
   indicates their binding on Mn and Fe oxide and oxyhydroxide coatings at
   the clay mineral surfaces. The results indicate a low level of
   anthropogenic metal contamination in the investigated area. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Existing studies on recent global warming are almost exclusively based
   on environmental data from the Earth's surface. Seasonal information on
   the effects of climate change on subsurface settings of mid to high
   latitudes is extremely scarce. Here, we present the first temperature
   proxy record from bottom (c. 50 m) water settings of the North Sea
   employing the oxygen isotope composition of ocean quahog shells. Results
   indicate that delta(18)O(aragonite) measured across shells of Arctica
   islandica can provide reliable estimates (+/- 0.25 to +/- 0.4 degrees C)
   of the ambient bottom water temperatures. Over the period AD 1880-2001,
   warming trends in bottom waters are of the order of 0.042 to 0.138
   degrees C/decade. Apparently, the annual maximum -temperature trend
   shows a twofold increase over the past four decades (0.236 degrees
   C/decade) while the minimum-temperature trend has remained relatively
   stable (0.042 degrees C/decade). During the same time interval, however,
   annual maximum temperatures at the sea surface quadrupled. Shell
   oxygen-isotope-derived winter temperatures also provide a proxy for the
   winter North Atlantic oscillation index (WNAO). Some 28 to 50\% of the
   variability in minimum temperatures below the thermocline can be
   explained by changes of the WNAO. Our new toot enables testing and
   verification of climate models prior to the 20th century greenhouse
   forcing. Copyright (c) 2005 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change and marine invasive species have posed a
   major threat to significant ecological, aesthetic, economic and amenity
   value to the countries and territories of the Wider Caribbean Region.
   Today, the Caribbean Sea is plagued with the invasive lionfish ( Pterois
   volitans and P. miles). As the range and abundance of the lionfish
   throughout the Caribbean has grown, recognition of the grave threat it
   poses to the native marine ecosystems has prompted the development of
   lionfish management plans across the region. The efforts of eight
   countries in the region to manage lionfish are evaluated using the US
   Environmental Protection Agency Aquatic Invasive Species framework and
   the inclusion of climate change and/or changing conditions. The
   countries and overseas territories evaluated were Anguilla, Bahamas,
   Cayman Islands, Grenada, St. Eustatius, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
   US Virgin Islands. Although specific strategies differed amongst the
   islands depending upon needs, culture, and individual circumstances,
   most of the plans included aspects of education and outreach, control
   and monitoring protocols, and research and information management. Areas
   that were found to be notably weak to nonexistent included leadership,
   prevention, early detection and rapid response and restoration; This
   comparative analysis provides opportunities for knowledge sharing and
   intra- and inter-country cooperation, facilitating the transfer and
   development of interventions that contribute to the conservation of
   significant island biodiversity. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Sustainable development may be reached through nature conservation as
   overexploitation of natural resources destroys the basis of future
   economic activities. Both historic and present cases of nature
   destruction, e.g. the deforestation around the Mediterranean, lead to
   unsustainable development followed by the collapse of civilisations. New
   problems such as the globalisation of the world economy have forced
   fishery into overexploitation of the oceans and have lead to over
   intensification of agricultural production, particularly in Europe. Mass
   tourism has also exerted destructive effects. So far, the external costs
   of these damages are seldom internalised. The European Nature Heritage
   Fund (EURONATURE) is working on these problems by supporting and
   co-ordinating sustainable development projects. Activities range from
   the establishment of ecotourism on six European islands, the restoration
   of the Narew Wetlands of Poland, the recovery of transhumance drover
   roads in Spain, and the sustainable management of forests on Mount Atos
   to flora and fauna protection on the Swabian Alb and in the White
   Carpathians, and the ``peace for nature{''} initiative for sustainable
   development in the Near East. In the future, EURONATURE intends to
   continue its active role as a catalyst of sustainable development,
   trying to convince economists and politicians that nature conservation
   is an undeniable economic factor necessary to ensure the availability of
   resources for the future.},

Title = {Large-scale climatic effects on traditional Hawaiian fishpond
   aquaculture},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Aquaculture accounts for almost one-half of global fish consumption.
   Understanding the regional impact of climate fluctuations on aquaculture
   production thus is critical for the sustainability of this crucial food
   resource. The objective of this work was to understand the role of
   climate fluctuations and climate change in subtropical coastal estuarine
   environments within the context of aquaculture practices in He. eia
   Fishpond, O. ahu Island, Hawai'i. To the best of our knowledge, this was
   the first study of climate effects on traditional aquaculture systems in
   the Hawaiian Islands. Data from adjacent weather stations were analyzed
   together with in situ water quality instrument deployments spanning a
   12-year period (November 2004 - November 2016). We found correlations
   between two periods with extremely high fish mortality at He. eia
   Fishpond (May and October 2009) and slackening trade winds in the week
   preceding each mortality event, as well as surface water temperatures
   elevated 2-3 degrees C higher than the background periods
   (March-December 2009). We posit that the lack of trade wind-driven
   surface water mixing enhanced surface heating and stratification of the
   water column, leading to hypoxic conditions and stress on fish
   populations, which had limited ability to move within net pen
   enclosures. Elevated water temperature and interruption of trade winds
   previously have been linked to the onset of El Nio in Hawai'i. Our
   results provide empirical evidence regarding El Nico effects on the
   coastal ocean, which can inform resource management efforts about
   potential impact of climate variation on aquaculture production.
   Finally, we provide recommendations for reducing the impact of warming
   events on fishponds, as these events are predicted to increase in
   magnitude and frequency as a consequence of global warming.},

Title = {Sea turtle species vary in their susceptibility to tropical cyclones},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {153},
Number = {2},
Pages = {471-478},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Severe climatic events affect all species, but there is little
   quantitative knowledge of how sympatric species react to such
   situations. We compared the reproductive seasonality of sea turtles that
   nest sympatrically with their vulnerability to tropical cyclones (in
   this study, ``tropical cyclone{''} refers to tropical storms and
   hurricanes), which are increasing in severity due to changes in global
   climate. Storm surges significantly decreased reproductive output by
   lowering the number of nests that hatched and the number of hatchlings
   that emerged from nests, but the severity of this effect varied by
   species. Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) began nesting
   earliest and most offspring hatched before the tropical cyclone season
   arrived, resulting in little negative effect. Loggerhead turtles
   (Caretta caretta) nested intermediately, and only nests laid late in the
   season were inundated with seawater during storm surges. Green turtles
   (Chelonia mydas) nested last, and their entire nesting season occurred
   during the tropical cyclone season; this resulted in a majority (79\%)
   of green turtle nests incubating in September, when tropical cyclones
   are most likely to occur. Since this timing overlaps considerably with
   the tropical cyclone season, the developing eggs and nests are extremely
   vulnerable to storm surges. Increases in the severity of tropical
   cyclones may cause green turtle nesting success to worsen in the future.
   However, published literature suggests that loggerhead turtles are
   nesting earlier in the season and shortening their nesting seasons in
   response to increasing sea surface temperatures caused by global climate
   change. This may cause loggerhead reproductive success to improve in the
   future because more nests will hatch before the onset of tropical
   cyclones. Our data clearly indicate that sympatric species using the
   same resources are affected differently by tropical cyclones due to
   slight variations in the seasonal timing of nesting, a key life history
   process.},

Abstract = {Sediments from the Polar Front Zone were sampled in the Indian Sector of
   the Antarctic Ocean as part of the French JGOFS expedition Antares 1.
   The first porewater distributions of O(2) and NO(3)(-) and organic
   carbon data in the solid phase in this part of the ocean were used to
   model the recycling of organic matter in sediments. The data are
   described by a model containing two types of degradable organic matter
   with distinct reactivities. We estimate that the reactivity of the most
   labile organic carbon is very close to that of fresh organic matter with
   an average C:N ratio of 7. We estimate that particulate organic carbon
   fluxes deposited at the sediment-water interface range between 0.2 and
   0.8 mol C m(-2) y(-1), with two peaks near the Polar Front and the
   Subantarctic Front. The flux of organic carbon deposited at the
   sediment-water interface is unusually high and represents similar to
   10-20\% of estimated primary production. From these findings, we
   conclude that production in the pelagic zone of this region is strongly
   linked to deposition and recycling in the sediment.},

   many species found in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea and contributes
   substantially to the fishery resource structure and biological
   reproduction in the northern China Sea. Based on long-term ecosystem
   surveys in the Yellow River estuary during the main spawning period
   (May) of most fishery species from 1959 to 2011, the responses of the
   ecosystem, including regime shifts in species composition, biomass,
   diversity, and other related factors, were analyzed in this study. Since
   the 1980s, the dominant large-size species of high economic value (e.g.,
   Largehead Hairtail Trichiurus lepturus) have been replaced by
   short-lived, low-trophic-level, planktivorous pelagic species (e.g.,
   Scaly Hairfin Anchovy Setipinna taty and Japanese Anchovy Engraulis
   japonicus). Currently, traditional commercially targeted fishes, such as
   the Largehead Hairtail, Red Seabream Pagrus major, and Pacific Herring
   Clupea pallasii, are locally extinct. There has been a rapid shift of
   dominant species from highly valued, high-trophic-level, large-sized
   demersal species with complicated age structures to low-value,
   low-trophic-level, small-sized pelagic species with simple age
   structures; this shift has resulted in major changes to the ecological
   cycle and restoration of fishery resources. The fish catch declined from
   421.66kg/h in 1959 to 0.25kg/h in 2008 and then increased to 3.62kg/h in
   2011. Diversity and evenness indices showed a continuously increasing
   trend during 1959-2011. The Yellow River estuary may be significantly
   compromised by overfishing, climate change, dam construction, and
   pollution, resulting in the decline of traditional fishing industries
   and reduced biodiversity in this ecosystem.},

Abstract = {In recent years, natural gas (NG)- and liquefied natural gas (LNG)-based
   power generation options have been considered as a potential alternative
   to grid electricity at desalination plants to reliably meet the
   increasing energy demand and reduce the associated environmental
   impacts. This study comparatively evaluated on a life cycle basis the
   economic and environmental cost-benefits of LNG/NG for self-generation
   of power with those of the grid electricity supply. The analysis
   conducted showed that for desalination plant sizes of 75-570 ML/day, the
   LNG-based onsite power generation option is 20-30\% more economical than
   the alternative connection to the grid. However, the life cycle cost
   (LCC) of the LNG-based onsite power generation system is from 43\% to up
   to 86\% higher than the NG-based counterpart for desalination plant
   sizes that increase progressively from 10 to 570 ML/day. A sensitivity
   analysis conducted on two conceptual mid-range capacity seawater
   desalination plants showed that variations in the electric tariff rate,
   fuel cost, plant efficiency, and economic parameters affect the LCC of
   various power supply options. The study also showed that when the grid
   electricity with a cleaner mix (i.e., low emission factor) is available,
   this option results in lower GHG emissions than the LNG/NG power source
   alternatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper describes measurements of waves and nearbed velocities, beach
   morphology and sedimentology on a macrotidal beach on the northwest
   coast of the Isle of Man. The spring tide range was approximately 5.4 m,
   with mean wave heights of 0.56 to 1.35 m and periods of 3 to 8 seconds. 
   The range of grain sizes available on the beach varied between -3.65phi
   and 2.13phi.  The intertidal beach morphology exhibited three distinct
   zones: a steep, reflective high-tide zone, a moderately steep mid-tide
   zone and a flat, dissipative low-tide zone. An overall trend of
   shoreward coarsening grain size was observed on this beach. Wave
   characteristics varied noticeably over a tidal cycle. The wave height
   increased with tidal height, and two wave zones were observed: a zone of
   broken waves, in which the wave field appeared to be saturated, and a
   zone of mixed unbroken and breaking waves. The surf scaling parameter
   increased and the breaker height decreased as the tide ebbed, indicating
   that conditions were moderately to strongly reflective over most of the
   measured tidal cycle.
   The macrotidal beach on the Isle of Man described in this paper does not
   fit easily into any previously identified macrotidal beach categories.
   Although it is generally exposed to only moderate wave energy, it does
   not exhibit the typical multi-barred profile. The Manx beach may
   represent an intermediate beach stage close to the reflective end of a
   continuum of macrotidal beach morphologies.},

Abstract = {The Canadian Arctic is characterized by a high variation in landform
   types and there are complex interactions between land, water and the
   atmosphere which dramatically affect the distribution of biota.
   Biodiversity depends upon the intensity, predictability and scale of
   these interactions. Observations, as well as predictions of large-scale
   climate models which include ocean circulation, reveal an anomalous
   cooling of northeastern Canada in recent decades, in contrast to the
   overall significant increase in average annual temperature in the
   Northern Hemisphere. Predictions from models are necessary to forecast
   the change in the treeline in the 21st century which may lead to a major
   loss of tundra. The rate of change in vegetation in response to climate
   change is poorly understood. The treeline in central Canada, for
   example, is showing infilling with trees, and in some locations,
   northerly movement of the boundary. The presence of sea ice in Hudson
   Bay and other coastal areas is a major factor affecting interactions
   between the marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of ice and therefore
   hunting of seals by polar bears will reduce bear and arctic fox
   populations within the region. in turn, this is likely to have
   significant effects on their herbivorous prey populations and forage
   plants, Further, the undersurface of sea ice is a major site for the
   growth of algae and marine invertebrates which in turn act as food for
   the marine food web. A rise in sea-level may flood coastal saltmarsh
   communities leading to changes in plant assemblages and a decline in
   foraging by geese and other consumers. The anomalous cooling in the
   eastern Arctic, primarily in late winter and early spring, has
   interrupted northern migration of breeding populations of geese and
   ducks and led to increased damage to vegetation in southern arctic
   saltmarshes as a result of foraging. It is likely that there has been a
   significant loss of invertebrates in those areas where the vegetation
   has been destroyed, Warming will have major effects on permafrost
   distribution and on ground-ice resulting in a major destabilization of
   slopes and slumping of soil, and disruption of tundra plant communities.
   Disruption of peat and moss surfaces lead to loss of insulation, an
   increase in active-layer depth and changes in drainage and plant
   assemblages. Increases of UV-B radiation will strongly affect vulnerable
   populations of both plants and animals, The indigenous peoples will face
   major changes in life style, edibility of food and health standards, if
   there is a significant warming trend. The great need is for information
   which is sensitive to the changes and will assist in developing an
   understanding of the complex interactions of the arctic biota, human
   populations and the physical environment.},

Abstract = {Elemental and stable carbon isotopic compositions and biomarker
   concentrations were determined in sediments from the Columbia River
   basin and the Washington margin in order to evaluate geochemical
   approaches for quantifying terrestrial organic matter in marine
   sediments. The biomarkers include: an homologous series of long-chain
   n-alkanes derived from the surface waxes of higher plants; phenolic and
   hydroxyalkanoic compounds produced by CuO oxidation of two major
   vascular plant biopolymers, lignin and cutin. All marine sediments,
   including samples collected from the most remote sites in Cascadia
   Basin, showed organic geochemical evidence for the presence of
   terrestrial organic carbon. Using endmember values for the various
   biomarkers determined empirically by two independent means, we estimate
   that the terrestrial contribution to the Washington margin is
   approximately 60\% for shelf sediments, approximately 30\% for slope
   sediments, and decreases further to less-than-or-equal-to 15\% in basin
   sediments. Results from the same geochemical measurements made with
   depth in gravity core 6705-7 from Cascadia Seachannel suggest that our
   approach to assess terrestrial organic carbon contributions to
   contemporary deposits on the Washington margin can be applied to the
   study of sediments depositing in this region since the last glacial

Volume = {80},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-72},
Abstract = {During the Uppermost P. gigas conodont zone (P. linguiformis zone) the
   stepwise Frasnian extinction culminates in the global
   transgressive-regressive Frasnian-Famennian >>Kellwasser event<<.  Most
   pelagic organisms of the tropical marine environment are more or less
   affected by this mass extinction.  During the early Upper Devonian
   extinction rates are clearly related to the deposition of black shales
   and the storage of a great amount of organic carbon in the (shelf)
   sediments.  Contemporaneous positive excursions of the delta-C-13
   recorded from pelagic limestones of Europe and Australia prove a
   worldwide change in the CO2 content of the oceans surface water which is
   in balance with the atmosphere.  If the climate is controlled by the CO2
   content of the atmosphere, a cyclic operation process might have
   developed with the succession:  transgression - high organic production
   - deposition of organic carbon - lowering of CO2 in the atmosphere -
   icehouse effect - polar glaciation - regression - erosion of organic
   carbon and resupply of CO2 to the ocean and atmosphere - greenhouse
   effect - deglaciation - transgression.  During the change from a
   greenhouse to an icehouse effect an overturn of the anoxic oceans
   probably was one of the causes for the mass killing of low latitude
   marine organisms.},

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-66},
Abstract = {Exchanges between sediment pore waters and the overlying water column
   play a significant role in the chemical budgets of many important
   chemical constituents. Direct quantification of such benthic fluxes
   requires explicit knowledge of the sediment properties and
   biogeochemistry. Alternatively, changes in water-column properties near
   the sediment-water interface can be exploited to gain insight into the
   sediment biogeochemistry and benthic fluxes. Here, we apply a 1-D
   diffusive mixing model to near-bottom water-column profiles of Ra-224
   activity in order to yield vertical eddy diffusivities (K-Z), based upon
   which we assess the diffusive exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC), nutrients and oxygen (O-2), across the sediment-water interface
   in a coastal inlet, Bedford Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada. Numerical model
   results are consistent with the assumptions regarding a constant, single
   benthic source of Ra-224, the lack of mixing by advective processes, and
   a predominantly benthic source and sink of DIC and O-2, respectively,
   with minimal water-column respiration in the deep waters of Bedford
   Basin. Near-bottom observations of DIC, O-2 and nutrients provide flux
   ratios similar to Redfield values, suggesting that benthic respiration
   of primarily marine organic matter is the dominant driver. Furthermore,
   a relative deficit of nitrate in the observed flux ratios indicates that
   denitrification also plays a role in the oxidation of organic matter,
   although its occurrence was not strong enough to allow us to detect the
   corresponding AT fluxes out of the sediment. Finally, comparison with
   other carbon sources reveal the observed benthic DIC release as a
   significant contributor to the Bedford Basin carbon system.},

Abstract = {Porous organic polymers hold great promise for molecular sieving
   membrane separation. Although the inclusion of functional ionic liquid
   (IL) in the pores offers a facile way to manipulate their separation
   properties, the IL leaching during the separation process is difficult
   to avoid. Herein, we report a strategy to in-situ encapsulate ILs into
   the micropores of the conjugated microporous polymer membrane via a
   6-min electropolymerization and further seal the aperture of the pores
   to prevent ILs leaching by solvent-assisted micropore tightening (SAMT).
   Upon screening the binding energy between different ILs and gas
   molecules, two ILs were selected to be incorporated into the membrane
   for CO2/CH4 and O-2/N-2 gas separations. The resultant separation
   performances surpass the 2008 Robeson upper bound. Notably, the ILs can

Abstract = {Understanding the geochemical cycling of sulfur in sediments is
   important because it can have implications for both modern environments
   (e.g., deterioration of water quality) and interpretation of the ancient
   past (e.g., sediment C/S ratios can be used as indicators of
   palaeodepositional environment). This study investigates the geochemical
   characteristics of sulfur, iron, and organic carbon in fluvial and
   coastal surface sediments of the Laizhou Bay region, China. A total of
   63 sediment samples were taken across the whole Laizhou Bay marine
   region and the 14 major tidal rivers draining into it. Acid volatile
   sulfur, chromium (II)-reducible sulfur and elemental sulfur, total
   organic carbon, and total nitrogen were present in higher concentrations
   in the fluvial sediment than in the marine sediment of Laizhou Bay. The
   composition of reduced inorganic sulfur in surface sediments was
   dominated by acid volatile sulfur and chromium (II)-reducible sulfur. In
   fluvial sediments, sulfate reduction and formation of reduced inorganic
   sulfur were controlled by TOC and reactive iron synchronously. High C/S
   ratios in the marine sediments indicate that the diagenetic processes in
   Laizhou Bay have been affected by rapid deposition of sediment from the
   Yellow River in recent decades.},

Abstract = {The historic and contemporary distribution for the Psittacidae family in
   Mexico using the greatest database assembled until now was estimated.
   The ecological niche models were generated with the MaxEnt algorithm.
   Temperature and precipitation were used, as well as an analysis of
   vegetation and availability of protected areas established until 2015.
   The models did not present omission errors and allow to have updated
   estimates for each species. The species with the greatest potential
   distribution was Amazona albifrons, and Amazona auropalliata had the
   smallest one. The results indicate that all the species have lost
   suitable habitat area, especially Ara macao, Amazona auropalliata and A.
   oratrix. Although tropical forests are present on most species
   distributions, temperate forests had a high cover percentage for 6
   species. The proportion of protected area for each species was higher
   when compared with previous estimates from the year 2000. The precise
   estimate of the distribution of Mexican Psittacidae has international
   conservation implications, as 6 species are endemic and 4 species may
   present their greater potential distribution in Mexico according to IUCN
   information. Due to habitat loss some species have a high vulnerability,
   present and future, making it necessary to examine the relationship
   between environmental suitability and patterns of population abundance.
   The use of ecological niche models to evaluate distributional changes
   associated with climate change may be also necessary. All Rights

Title = {Impact to Coral Reef Populations at Ha'ena and Pila'a, Kaua'i, Following
   a Record 2018 Freshwater Flood Event},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many corals and reef-dwelling organisms are susceptible to the impacts
   of storm events, which are typically characterized by large inputs of
   freshwater, sediment, and nutrients. The majority of storm effects are
   focused on shallow, nearshore reef flats, as low salinity and
   sedimentation tend to dissipate with depth and distance from shore. In
   April 2018, record rainfall on the northern coast of Kaua'i caused
   extensive flooding and landslides, introducing large amounts of
   freshwater and sediment into nearshore reefs. Using benthic and fish
   transects from 2016-2019 and temperature, sediment, and rainfall data
   gathered pre- and post-flood, this study aimed to quantify and explicate
   the effects of flooding on the various biotic populations of two reef
   habitats at Pila'a and Ha'ena, Kaua'i. Results from the shallow Pila'a
   reef suggest sediment and freshwater-associated declines in mean urchin
   abundance (-52.0\%) and increases in mean coral bleaching (+54.5\%) at
   the flood-prone eastern sector. Additionally, decreases in mean urchin
   (-65.7\%) and fish (-42.3\%) populations were observed at shallow Ha'ena
   transects, but not deep sites, supporting the occurrence of
   depth-specific affliction. Multivariate community-level analyses
   affirmed much of these results, showing a significant shift in community
   structure before and after the flood at both Pila'a and Ha'ena. The
   outcomes of this study are pertinent to strategic design and solution
   development by local aquatic resource managers, especially as
   anthropogenic climate change continues to increase the frequency,
   duration, and intensity of storm events.},

   Osmosis Power Plants: Dead Sea-Red Sea Conveyor},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this study, three pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) power plants are
   proposed to be built on the Red Sea-Dead Sea (RSDS) water conveyance
   project, to generate power from the salinity gradient between two water
   streams at different salt concentrations. The first two proposed plants
   are to be built after sea water reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination
   plants, where Red Sea water and the rejected brine from SWRO plants are
   used as feed and draw solutions, respectively. In the third proposed
   plant, Red Sea water and Dead Sea water will be used. Results showed
   that the three proposed plants are technically feasible while the third
   plant is the only one that is economically feasible with a 134.5 MW
   capacity and a 0.056 \$/KWh levelized cost of electricity (LCE). The
   power generated from the third PRO power plant accounts for about 24.7\%
   of the power needed for the RSDS project that can be used to power
   SWRO-2 in order to reduce the electricity consumption by 49.3\%. If the
   generated power from the proposed PRO plant is sold to the Jordanian
   national electricity grid at the current selling price in accordance
   with Jordanian prices of electricity, a saving of about 21.2\% can be
   attained. It is found that using the power generated by the current
   proposed plants for desalination project purposes will significantly
   reduce the price of desalinated water produced from SWRO desalination
   plants.},

Title = {Duration of water flow interruption drives the structure and functional
   diversity of stream benthic diatoms},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {770},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Flow cessation affects river ecosystems submitted to low precipitation
   and increased water demand, and creates unfavourable conditions to
   aquatic biological communities. Diatoms are amongst the most sensitive
   biological groups to hydric stress, making them good indicators of
   preceding hydrological conditions. We here analyse the response of
   diatom assemblages to the duration and frequency of non-flow periods in
   23 Mediterranean temporary streams. All of them experienced a strong
   decrease in water flow during summer, leading to a period of flow
   cessation. In addition, other ten permanent streams (zero dry days
   during the study period) were included in the study for comparative
   purposes. Temporary and permanent streams showed similar diatom species
   richness, evenness, and alpha diversity. However, beta diversity was
   higher in temporary than permanent streams, regardless rare taxa (<1\%
   occurrence) had similar numbers in the two types of streams. Alpha
   diversity, richness, and evenness of diatom assemblages in the temporary
   streams changed with the duration of the non-flow period. Durations of
   50-100 days were associated to higher alpha diversity, richness, and
   evenness, but longer non-flow periods caused their decrease. Diatoms
   thriving under the most extreme conditions were mostly aerophilic,
   pioneer, and motile taxa. The proportion of aerophilic diatom taxa
   increased beyond 100 dry days, particularly in those sites receiving
   more intense solar radiation. Overall, the taxonomical and functional
   composition of diatom assemblages mostly responded to the duration of
   the non-flow period, irrespectively of these being consecutive or not.
   This study shows that diatom assemblages from temporary streams contain
   taxa adapted to non-flow conditions, but remain vulnerable to further
   reductions of water flow associated to climate or global change.
   `Unimpacted' watercourses in the Mediterranean region, independently of
   their flow regime, should be urgently protected and used as taxonomical
   and functional early indicators of climate change. (C) 2021 Elsevier

   evaporation is to develop facile manufacturing materials and scalable
   methods with high solar conversion efficiency by heat localization. In
   addition, a decrease in the solar evaporation rate due to humidity
   saturation in the evaporation chamber is also a reason for the lower
   freshwater collection rate. In this paper, we demonstrate a
   solar-driven, interfacial evaporation-based and passive
   electricity-independent desalination unisystem, which consists of an
   evaporation chamber that uses hydrophilic and low-cost carbonized
   biomass full of water transportation microchannels, for the first time,
   as a solar evaporator. Meanwhile, the designed external aluminum
   condenser of the condensation chamber realizes freshwater collection.
   With improved designs and repeated tests, such a desalination unisystem
   achieves a stable evaporation rate of 1.492 kg m(-2) h(-1) and
   solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of similar to 90.8\% under 1 sun.
   It also simultaneously generates freshwater with a collection efficiency
   of similar to 85.4\% compared to the evaluated water evaporation rate in
   the open atmosphere. This portable, easily implemented, and
   nonenergy-consuming desalination unisystem has the potential to provide
   new inspiration for the realm of seawater desalination and wastewater
   treatment.},

   Seawater Battery: Feasibility and Future Directions},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Rechargeable seawater battery (SWB) is a unique energy storage system
   that can directly transform seawater into renewable energy. Placing a
   desalination compartment between SWB anode and cathode (denoted as
   seawater battery desalination; SWB-D) enables seawater desalination
   while charging SWB. Since seawater desalination is a mature technology,
   primarily occupied by membrane-based processes such as reverse osmosis
   (RO), the energy cost has to be considered for alternative desalination
   technologies. So far, the feasibility of the SWB-D system based on the
   unit cost per desalinated water (\$ m(-3)) has been insufficiently
   discussed. Therefore, this perspective aims to provide this information
   and offer future research directions based on the detailed cost
   analysis. Based on the calculations, the current SWB-D system is
   expected to have an equipment cost of approximate to 1.02 \$ m(-3)
   (lower than 0.60-1.20 \$ m(-3) of RO), when 96\% of the energy is
   recovered and stable performance for 1000 cycles is achieved. The anion
   exchange membrane (AEM) and separator contributes greatly to the
   material cost occupying 50\% and 41\% of the total cost, respectively.
   Therefore, future studies focusing on creating low cost AEMs and
   separators will pave the way for the large-scale application of SWB-D.},

Title = {Transpiration in Quercus suber trees under shallow water table
   conditions: the role of soil and groundwater},

Abstract = {Water is one of the major environmental factors limiting plant growth
   and survival in the Mediterranean region. Quercus suber L. woodlands
   occupy vast areas in the Iberian Peninsula, frequently under shallow
   water table conditions. The relative magnitude of soil and groundwater
   uptake to supply transpiration is not easy to evaluate under these
   circumstances. We recently developed a conceptual framework for the
   functioning of the root system in Q. suber that simulates well tree
   transpiration, based on two types of root behaviour: shallow connected
   and deep connected. Although this significantly improved knowledge on
   the functional traits of Mediterranean Q. suber, the approach has the
   limitation of requiring root sap flow data, which are seldom available.
   In this work, we present alternative methodologies to assess if trees
   are connected to groundwater and to estimate the soil and groundwater
   contributions to tree transpiration. We provide evidence on the tree
   unrestricted access to groundwater solely based on meteorological, stem
   sap flow and leaf water potential data. Using a soil mass balance
   approach, we estimated the yearly soil and groundwater contributions to
   tree transpiration: 69.7\% and 30.3\%, respectively. Groundwater uptake
   became dominant in the dry summer: 73.2\% of tree transpiration. Results
   reproduce extremely well those derived from root modelling. Because of
   its simplicity both in formulation and data requirements, our approach
   is potentially liable to be adapted to other groundwater-dependent
   Mediterranean oak sites, where interactions between land use and water
   resources may be relevant. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Paths towards greater consensus building in experimental biology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In a recent editorial, the Editors-in-Chief of Journal of Experimental
   Biology argued that consensus building, data sharing, and better
   integration across disciplines are needed to address the urgent
   scientific challenges posed by climate change. We agree and expand on
   the importance of cross-disciplinary integration and transparency to
   improve consensus building and advance climate change research in
   experimental biology. We investigated reproducible research practices in
   experimental biology through a review of open data and analysis code
   associated with empirical studies on three debated paradigms and for
   unrelated studies published in leading journals in comparative
   physiology and behavioural ecology over the last 10 years. Nineteen per
   cent of studies on the three paradigms had open data, and 3.2\% had open
   code. Similarly, 12.1\% of studies in the journals we examined had open
   data, and 3.1\% had open code. Previous research indicates that only
   50\% of shared datasets are complete and re-usable, suggesting that
   fewer than 10\% of studies in experimental biology have usable open
   data. Encouragingly, our results indicate that reproducible research
   practices are increasing over time, with data sharing rates in some
   journals reaching 75\% in recent years. Rigorous empirical research in
   experimental biology is key to understanding the mechanisms by which
   climate change affects organisms, and ultimately promotes evidence-based
   conservation policy and practice. We argue that a greater adoption of
   open science practices, with a particular focus on FAIR (Findable,
   Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) data and code, represents a
   much-needed paradigm shift towards improved transparency,
   cross-disciplinary integration, and consensus building to maximize the
   contributions of experimental biologists in addressing the impacts of
   environmental change on living organisms.},

Title = {Do Electric Vehicles Mitigate Urban Heat? The Case of a Tropical City},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {On top of their well known positive impact on air quality and CO2
   emissions, electric vehicles generate less exhaust heat compared to
   traditional vehicles thanks to their high engine efficiency. As such,
   electric vehicles have the potential to mitigate the excessive heat in
   urban areas-a problem which has been exacerbated due to urbanisation and
   climate change. Still, the heat mitigation potential of electric
   vehicles has not been fully understood. Here, we combine high-resolution
   traffic heat emission inventories with an urban climate model to
   simulate the impact of the fleet electrification to the near-surface air
   temperature in the tropical city of Singapore. We show that a full
   replacement of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles with
   electric vehicles reduces the near-surface air temperature by up to 0.6
   degrees C. The heat mitigation potential is highest during the morning
   traffic peak and over areas with the largest traffic density.
   Interestingly, the reduction in exhaust heat emissions due to the fleet
   electrification during the evening traffic peak hardly leads to a
   reduction of near-surface air-temperatures, which is attributed to the
   different atmospheric conditions during morning and evening. This study
   presents a new quantification of the city-wide impact of electric
   vehicles on the air temperature in a tropical urban area. The results
   may support policy-makers toward designing holistic solutions to address
   the challenge of climate change adaptation and mitigation in cities.},

Title = {Mangrove dieback during fluctuating sea levels},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that climate change and intensification of the
   El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has increased variation in sea
   level. Although widespread impacts on intertidal ecosystems are
   anticipated to arise from the sea level seesaw associated with climate
   change, none have yet been demonstrated. Intertidal ecosystems,
   including mangrove forests are among those ecosystems that are highly
   vulnerable to sea level rise, but they may also be vulnerable to sea
   level variability and extreme low sea level events. During 16 years of
   monitoring of a mangrove forest in Mangrove Bay in north Western
   Australia, we documented two forest dieback events, the most recent one
   being coincident with the large-scale dieback of mangroves in the Gulf
   of Carpentaria in northern Australia. Diebacks in Mangrove Bay were
   coincident with periods of very low sea level, which were associated
   with increased soil salinization of 20-30\% above pre-event levels,
   leading to canopy loss, reduced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) and reduced recruitment. Our study indicates that an
   intensification of ENSO will have negative effects on some mangrove
   forests in parts of the Indo-Pacific that will exacerbate other

   The easier access to medium resolution natural resources satellite data
   has greatly popularised the use of this type of information in land
   cover studies and ecosystems management. This paper presents the results
   of a study of land cover changes in a coastal area located in eastern
   Brazil (Conde Municipality - State of Bahia). Using a Geographic
   Information System (GIS), Landsat multi-temporal data (1984, 1995 and
   2003) were photo interpreted and converted to raster maps. Overlay
   operations (map algebra) were then used to assess and quantify land
   cover changes within the studied area. It was found that the documented
   changes were mostly related to an increase in tourism and summer
   resident population, directly related to the construction of the BA-099
   highway, also known as Green Line (Linha Verde). In some places,
   ecosystem degradation arising from these recent occupation patterns
   could be mapped. Overall however, the ecosystems preservation status
   between 1984 and 2003 can be considered very good. The methodology used
   can be easily applied for other sites and proved to be an easy and cheap
   alternative for environmental institutions interested to quickly
   evaluate ecosystems preservation status and land use trends during the
   last few decades. Coastal management initiatives can be better planned
   and implemented using this kind of spatially geo-referenced data.},

Abstract = {Irrational rice planting-breeding modes may result in serious ecological
   and environmental issues and unsustainable agriculture. In this study,
   economic benefits combined with emergy analysis were used to evaluate
   the environmental and economic performances of three rice production
   modes, namely, rice monoculture (RM), conventional rice-crab (CRC) and
   optimized rice-crab (ORC) modes, in Panjin City surrounding Liaohe River
   Basin in Northeast China. Rice and crab yields of ORC were increased by
   8\% -12\% and 9\% compared with those of RM and CRC modes, respectively.
   The value-to-cost ratio, economic benefits density and benefit-cost
   ratio of ORC increased by 46\%-51\%, 55\%-80\% and 59\%-66\%,
   respectively, compared with those of RM and CRC modes. The results of
   emergy analysis indicated that the production efficiency of ORC mode
   increased by 21\%-45\% compared with that of CRC mode according to the
   unit emergy values though slightly lower than that of RM mode. Compared
   with those of RM and CRC modes, renewable fraction and emergy
   sustainability index increased within the ranges 7\%-28\% and 4\% -36\%,
   respectively, and environmental loading ratio decreased by 9\%-34\%,.
   Considering ecological and economic effects, ORC mode was conducive to
   improve the sustainability and economic viability of rice production in
   Liaohe River Basin. Labor and service, fertilizer utilization, and
   forage input play an important role in emergy investment structure among
   the three modes, thereby suggesting that appropriate allocation of labor
   should be implemented to improve the labor efficiency and government
   should increase subsidies for fertilizer and agricultural machinery.
   Moderate industrial integration and large-scale operation modes,
   efficient utilization of local resources, whereas reducing external
   inputs are suggested to considerably improve the environmental
   performance and sustainable development capacity of the rice
   planting-breeding mode. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Earth-Air Heat Exchangers (EAHE) work blowing the air through buried
   ducts to employ the soil as a heat/cold sink. Thus the thermal energy
   contained in the soil can meet heating/cooling needs of buildings and
   reduce the conventional consumption of energy. In Brazil, recent
   research about these devices has been done considering its south region
   where a subtropical climate prevails. However, there is a lack of
   studies addressing the thermal performance of EAHE in coastal cities,
   where one can find the soil very sandy and the water table near the
   ground surface. In particular, this paper studies numerically the
   installation of EAHE in three different places located in the coastal
   south Brazilian city of Rio Grande, where the geotechnical profiles of
   the soil were obtained in-situ through standard penetration tests (SPT),
   aiming to promote thermal performance analysis for EAHE. In the
   simulations presented here, the influence of the water in the soil and a
   shortage of clayey layers in some sites relatively reduced their
   performance in more than 60\%. Moreover, for these sites, the thermal
   potential for EAHE is poorly affected by placing the ducts at depths
   below 2.0 m.},

   Developing Countries: A Case Study of North Cyprus},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The growth in population of North Cyprus, and the increasing demand for
   housing, are two important factors that are rapidly shaping the
   development of the island. To meet this housing demand, contractors are
   resorting to high-rise apartment buildings as a housing solution. The
   study was carried out to investigate the possibilities of integrating PV
   systems into apartment buildings. This is a novel approach in housing
   within the context of North Cyprus. With the use of building information
   modelling (BIM) software, the possibility of this approach was tested.
   The study considered several cost variables and the advantages of
   building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems integrated into
   apartment buildings at the design stage of the buildings. The
   willingness to pay (WTP) for this technology was also tested using
   qualitative methods and an economic analysis was carried out to
   ascertain the viability and feasibility of this technology. This was in
   line with present government policies using the net metering system. The
   method of analysis was carried out using a model proposed for BIPV
   integration in apartment buildings. The results derived from the survey
   data suggest that consumers prefer a price lower than epsilon 4500 for a
   3 kWp integration of solar power equipment to their apartments.},

Title = {A Spectral Parameterization of Drag, Eddy Diffusion, and Wave Heating
   for a Three-Dimensional Flow Induced by Breaking Gravity Waves},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {67},
Number = {8},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There are three distinct processes by which upward-propagating gravity
   waves influence the large-scale dynamics and energetics of the middle
   atmosphere: (i) nonlocalized transport of momentum through wave
   propagation in three dimensions that remotely redistributes atmospheric
   momentum in both zonal and meridional directions from wave generation to
   wave dissipation regions; (ii) localized diffusive transport of
   momentum, heat, and tracers due to mixing induced by wave breaking; and
   (iii) localized transport of heat by perturbing wave structures due to
   dissipation that redistributes the thermal energy within a finite
   domain. These effects become most significant for breaking waves when
   momentum drag, eddy diffusion, and wave heating- the ``breaking
   trinity{''}-are all imposed on the background state. This paper develops
   a 3D parameterization scheme that self-consistently includes the
   breaking trinity in large-scale numerical models. The 3D
   parameterization scheme is developed based on the general relationship
   between the wave action flux and the subgrid-scale momentum and heat
   fluxes developed by Zhu in 1987 and a mapping approximation between the
   wave source spectrum and momentum deposition distribution developed by
   Alexander and Dunkerton in 1999. For a set of given input wind and
   temperature profiles at each model grid, the parameterization scheme
   outputs the vertical profiles of the subgrid-scale force terms together
   with the eddy diffusion coefficients in the momentum and energy
   equations for a 3D background flow.},

Abstract = {The MORPH project (FP7, 2012-2016) is aimed at developing efficient
   methods and tools to map the underwater environment in situations that
   are not easily addressed by current technology. Namely, the missions
   that are of interest are those that involve underwater surveying and
   marine habitat mapping of rugged terrain and structures with full 3D
   complexity, including vertical cliffs. Potential applications include
   the study of cold water coral reef communities, ecosystems from
   underwater canyons, pipeline and harbor monitoring, or the inspection of
   wind turbine foundations. The project introduced and advanced a novel
   concept of an underwater robotic system composed of a number of mobile
   robot modules (nodes), carrying complementary sensors for perception of
   the environment. Instead of being physically coupled, the modules are
   connected via communication links that allow a flow of essential
   information among them. Without rigid links, the so-called MORPH
   Supra-Vehicle can reconfigure itself and adapt according to the
   environment and mission goals, responding, for example, to the shape of
   the terrain, including vertical walls. The flexibility allows for more
   optimal positioning of each sensor, increased number of simultaneous
   viewpoints, and generally high-resolution data collection.
   MORPH is aimed at providing a proof-of-concept demonstration of such
   capabilities, an effort that includes technological developments in many
   of the subfields of underwater technology. The main results are
   summarized and presented in this paper.},

Abstract = {More and more aquaculture inshore farms will move offshore, as there are
   more benefits to work offshore for these industries. The research on the
   fluid flows through a net cage has a lot of positive significance, which
   can improve the utilization rate of feed to improve the fish production
   and understand the diffusion law of the pollution source in order to
   protect the marine environment. Computational simulation has a lower
   cost compared to laboratory experiment. Computer simulations were used
   to study the changes in the fluid regime as the fluid passed through the
   net cage, as well as changes in the concentration of contaminants. This
   review and relevant discussions on the softwares and application can
   provide some suggestions for the future research on aquaculture and net
   cage.},

Abstract = {A thick bloom of the marine prymnesiophycean, Phaeocystis globosa was
   observed in the central Arabian Sea during the summer monsoon period
   (July-August, 1996). The cells were mostly in colonial form, embedded in
   gelatinous matrices. The cell diameter was approximately 7 mu m and
   showed a distinct double feature form. The intensity of the bloom was as
   high as 3750 x 10(6) cells m(-2) and the carbon content ranged between
   33 and 550 mu g L-1. Almost 90\% of the phytoplankton population was
   composed of P. globosa in the bloom area. Other common forms were
   chain-forming diatoms like Rhizosolenia spp., Nitzschia spp. and
   Chaetoreros spp. The photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a, however did
   not show any concomitant rise with the bloom intensity probably because
   the bloom was sampled during a senescent phase. The carbon chlorophyll
   ratio varied between 112 and 810. This is the first report on the
   occurrence of Phaeocystis from the Arabian Sea. It seems pertinent to
   ask whether this is a result of the genus being introduced and adapted
   to new environments due to human influence and whether it will influence
   food chains in the future. (C) 2000 Ifremer/CNRS/IRD/Editions

Abstract = {Subglacial tills play an important role in glacier dynamics but are
   difficult to characterize in situ. Amplitude Variation with Angle (AVA)
   analysis of seismic reflection data can distinguish between stiff tills
   and deformable tills. However, AVA analysis in mountain glacier
   environments can be problematic: reflections can be obscured by Rayleigh
   wave energy scattered from crevasses, and complex basal topography can
   impede the location of reflection points in 2-D acquisitions. We use a
   forward model to produce challenging synthetic seismic records in order
   to test the efficacy of AVA in crevassed and geometrically complex
   environments. We find that we can distinguish subglacial till types in
   moderately crevassed environments, where moderate' depends on crevasse
   spacing and orientation. The forward model serves as a planning tool, as
   it can predict AVA success or failure based on characteristics of the
   study glacier. Applying lessons from the forward model, we perform AVA
   on a seismic dataset collected from Taku Glacier in Southeast Alaska in
   March 2016. Taku Glacier is a valley glacier thought to overlay thick
   sediment deposits. A near-offset polarity reversal confirms that the
   tills are deformable.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a mixed integer non-linear mathematical model for
   a simulation of a hybrid energy source consisting of photovoltaics (PV),
   wind turbines (WT) and pumped storage hydroelectricity (PSH). The
   concept of PV-WT-PSH has been well described and evaluated for sparsely
   populated or remote areas such as islands. Here, due to the rapid
   development of renewable energy sources and most importantly the
   variable (non-dispatchable) energy sources such as wind and solar, the
   idea of wind and solar powered PSHs has been investigated in the context
   of the national energy system. The economic and environmental impact of
   the proposed hybrid has been assessed. The results reveal that to cover
   almost 40\% of the energy demand one should expect the energy cost to
   increase by 25\%.},

Title = {Pilot scale land-based cultivation of Saccharina latissima Linnaeus at
   southern European climate conditions: Growth and nutrient uptake at high
   temperatures},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {459},
Pages = {166-172},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Saccharina latissima is a cold water seaweed species with commercial
   potential. The northern Portuguese coast is the southern distribution
   limit of the species, where some dispersed populations can be found. S.
   latissima has been identified as being a potential candidate for
   monoculture or as part of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA)
   systems, presenting good results considering both growth and
   biofiltration performance. In the present work, the cultivation of S.
   latissima in a pilot land-based system was performed in order to assess
   the efficiency of two different methods: tumbling in the water column vs
   attached to fixed ropes at the bottom of the tank. S. latissima
   cultivated in tumble culture presented the best results, reaching growth
   rates of 10.6 +/- 0.9\% day(-1) and 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm day(-1), with a
   weekly yield around 120 g DW m(-2). Cultivation using this method was
   continued over the summer, for assessment of S. latissima growth at
   warmer temperatures. Average weekly yield ranged between 44.7 and 146.3
   (average 110) g DW m(-2) from April to mid-May; from mid-May to mid-July
   a high variability was observed, when some negative values indicating
   biomass loss were obtained and from mid-July onwards, average weekly
   yield ranged between 36.7 and 78.3 g DW m(-2). These results showed that
   tank cultivation of S. latissima in tumble culture was possible
   throughout the summer, withstanding average temperatures around 20
   degrees C from May onwards, well above published optimum temperatures
   for this species. This fact may be explained by their origin in
   populations located near the southern distribution boundary, which may
   have acquired adaptations that increased tolerance to high temperatures.
   Cultivation of S. latissima using tumble culture in outdoor tanks at
   southern latitudes appears to be feasible even during high temperature
   periods. Densities around 8 kg m(-3) were effective in keeping epiphytes
   development low. This system may be used for seaweed monoculture or as a
   biofilter component of IMTA systems.
   Statement of relevance
   The present manuscript is relevant for commercial land-based aquaculture
   of S. latissima, a high commercial value species, as a monoculture or as
   a part of an integrated multitrophic aquaculture system, since it
   presents information directly applicable to commercial installations due
   to its pilot scale trials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Physiological responses of germinant Pinus palustris and P. taeda
   seedlings to water stress and the significance of the grass-stage},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {458},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L) has gradually replaced longleaf pine (P.
   palustris Mill.) across much of the coastal southeastern United States.
   Given recent interest in the regeneration of longleaf pine ecosystems,
   understanding how these two species will respond to drier conditions
   associated with climate change will be critically important. We
   conducted a progressive water-stress experiment on germinants of P.
   palustris and P. taeda over the course of 9 weeks, measuring gas
   exchange, allometry, water relations, and tracheid anatomy. P. palustris
   developed more overall biomass, had wider tracheids, allocated more of
   its biomass into leaf tissue, and maintained a narrower safety margin
   against hydraulic failure than P. taeda. Both species reduced leaf gas
   exchange as water stress increased, though P. palustris experienced
   earlier and greater declines in photosynthetic rates than P. taeda. The
   greater aboveground growth and narrower hydraulic safety margin observed
   in P. palustris represents a trade-off between growth and hydraulic
   safety and is likely related to the species' defensive strategy against
   fire. We suggest that this trade-off may limit P. palustris germinant
   regeneration on sandier, xeric sites as climate change intensifies.},

Title = {Chlorophyll-a and Sea Surface Temperature Changes in Relation to
   Paralytic Shellfish Toxin Production off the East Coast of Tasmania,
   Australia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Toxic phytoplankton have been detrimental to the fishing and aquaculture
   industry on the east coast of Tasmania, causing millions of dollars in
   loss due to contaminated seafood. In 2012-2017, shellfish stocks were
   poisoned by Alexandrium catenella, a dinoflagellate species that
   produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PST). Remote sensing data may
   provide an environmental context for the drivers of PST events in
   Tasmania. We conducted spatial and temporal trend analyses of the
   Multi-Scale Ultra-High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (MUR SST) and
   Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative chlorophyll-a (OC-CCI chl-a) to
   determine if SST and chl-a correlated with the major toxin increases
   from 2012 to 2017. Along with the trends, we compare the remotely sensed
   oceanographic parameters of SST and chl-a to toxin events off the east
   coast of Tasmania to provide environmental context for the high-toxin
   period. Spatial and temporal changes for chl-a differ based on the
   north, central, and southeast coast of Tasmania. For sites in the north,
   chl-a was 5.3\% higher from the pre-PST period relative to the PST
   period, 5.1\% along the central part of the coast, and by 6.0\% in the
   south based on deviations from the coastal study area time series.
   Overall, SST has slightly decreased from 2007 to 2020 (tau = -0.011, p =
   0.827) and chl-a has significantly decreased for the east coast (tau =
   -0.164, p = 1.58 x 10(-3)). A negative relationship of SST and PST
   values occurred in the north (r = -0.530, p = 5.32 x 10(-5)) and central
   sites (r = -0.225, p = 0.157). The correlation between satellite chl-a
   (from OC-CCI, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and
   Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Aqua) and in situ data
   is weak, which makes it difficult to assess relationships present
   between chl-a and toxin concentrations. Moving forward, the development
   of a regional chl-a algorithm and increased in situ chl-a collection and
   plankton sampling at a species level will help to improve chl-a
   measurements and toxic phytoplankton production monitoring around
   Tasmania.},

Abstract = {For a large set of major world rivers we established the empirical
   relations existing between the observed organic carbon fluxes and the
   climatic, biologic, and geomorphologic patterns characterizing the river
   basins. These characteristics were extracted from various ecological
   databases. The corresponding carbon fluxes were taken from the
   literature. Dissolved organic carbon fluxes are mainly related to
   drainage intensity, basin slope, and the amount of carbon stored in
   soils. Particulate organic carbon fluxes are calculated as a function of
   sediment fluxes, which depend principally upon drainage intensity,
   rainfall intensity, and basin slope. Although the drainage intensity is
   mainly related to the amount of precipitation and to mean temperature in
   the basin, slope is also retained as one of the controlling factors. Our
   empirical models result in a total organic carbon flux to the oceans of
   about 0.38 Gt per year globally. About 0.21 Gt carbon (Gt C) enter the
   oceans in dissolved form and about 0.17 Gt C in particulate form, We
   further regionalize fluxes with respect to major climates, different
   continents, and different ocean basins. About 45\% of the organic carbon
   is discharged from tropical wet regions. The major part of the dissolved
   organic carbon is discharged into the Atlantic Ocean, while the bulk of
   the particulate organic carbon is discharged into the Indian and Pacific
   Oceans.},

Abstract = {Globalization is a significant factor for optimization of the existing
   transport chains. It is a major power for sustainable development of
   containerized transport, the relevant transport infrastructure and
   terminal equipment.
   The development of seaports and inland waterway connections became
   important part in global supply chain. The transportation models which
   are using multimodal transport service consist from maritime, port and
   hinterland parts. Choosing the appropriate strategy allows the shipping
   companies to reduce the transport cost and helps them to be more
   competitive on the cargo market. This article aims to identify the
   challenges and prospects for development of multimodal transport
   operations with containerized cargoes using of system approach to the
   each subsystems of the multimodal transport chain. To achieve the scope
   of the paper, research has been done on the global effects that big
   shipping companies contribute to the final transport cost; to the
   organization in container terminals and further influence on the local
   terminal operators; to the improvement of port infrastructure, including
   the number of offered services and implementation of innovations for
   increasing terminal efficiency. As a result, the main parameters for
   evaluation of the importance of one container terminal in the supply

Abstract = {A vast ocean rich with resources to maintain a sustainable livelihood
   surround Pacific Island Countries and Territories. In Fiji, coastal
   resources are a primary source of food, medicine, income and other
   necessities for livelihood security. Human-induced climate change places
   growing pressure on the quality of coastal resources due to the
   increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters like coastal
   erosion and flooding. Anthropogenic activities like coastal mining of
   earth minerals further threatens livelihood security with cumulative
   pressure on the coastal environment and its resources. This paper
   discusses the compounding impacts of mining in the flood-prone community
   of Vanua Votua in Ba (Fiji). They currently witness the degradation of
   their coastal environment and its resources (iqoliqoli). The people of
   Vanua Votua have a cultural and spiritual attachment to their coastal
   ecosystem as indigenous custodians. However, they are limited in their
   ability to conserve and protect their iqoliqoli due to an unfair legal
   duality of national coastal governance structures and processes between
   the state and indigenous custodians. We found that a central issue of
   coastal mining, governance, and the people's livelihood vulnerabilities,
   is Fiji's Mining Act {[}Cap 146] and associated environmental
   legislations and policies that consolidate much of the coastal
   governance authority with the state. The Fiji Mining Act is currently
   under review. This paper provides a timely case study using the
   Sustainable Livelihood Approach and the Vanua Research Framework,
   outlining the need for current and future legislation to be nuanced and
   sensitive to the realities of the local context.},

Abstract = {Linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) are anionic high production volume
   surfactants used in the manufacture of cleaning products. Here, we have
   studied the effect of the characteristics of marine and estuarine
   sediments on the sorption of LAS. Sorption experiments were performed
   with single sediment materials (pure clays and sea sand), with sediments
   treated to reduce their organic carbon content, and with field marine
   and estuarine sediments. C-12-2-LAS was used as a model compound.
   Sorption to the clays montmorillonite and kaolinite resulted in
   non-linear isotherms very similar for both clays. When reducing the
   organic content, sorption coefficients decreased proportionally to the
   fraction removed in fine grain sediments but this was not the case for
   the sandy sediment. The correlation of the sediment characteristics with
   the sorption coefficients at different surfactant concentrations showed
   that at concentrations below 10 99 C-12-2-LAS/L, the clay content
   correlated better with sorption, while the organic fraction became more
   significant at higher concentrations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Deformation of an ice pack influenced by waves and topographic
   enhancement of tidal motion near Hopen Island in the Barents Sea},
Journal = {COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {194},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the physical mechanisms behind the deformation of pack ice
   floes is important for understanding the dynamics of the local ice
   regime, and for the calibration and validation of ice dynamics models.
   In April 2017, six Iridium satellite-tracking beacons were deployed on
   six pack ice floes in the Barents Sea south of Svalbard in the Norwegian
   Arctic. The ice tracker deployment was performed as part of an offshore
   research expedition carried out onboard the Research Vessel (RV)
   Polarsyssel to characterize the local sea ice environment. In addition
   to the ice tracker deployments, an anemometer beacon, a wave beacon, and
   an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) were deployed on a drifting
   ice floe to which the vessel was moored for nearly three days, and
   extensive thickness, salinity, and density measurements were made. The
   wave beacon recorded the vertical acceleration of the floe so that wave
   forcing on the floe drift could be estimated. The in-situ wind, ocean
   current, wave, and ice thickness and density measurements permitted the
   estimation of met-ocean forcings on the acceleration of the ice floe. On
   April 28, two days after the last ice tracker was deployed on April 26,
   the six tracked ice floes rapidly dispersed just to the west-southwest
   of Hopen Island. The dispersion of the ice floes was dominated by strong
   shearing within the local ice pack, coinciding with a rapid increase in
   the speeds of the local tidal currents, which was soon followed by a
   rapid increase in the wave energy. Each of the six tracked ice floes
   increased their observed drift speeds in sync with the increase in the
   local tidal current speeds at different times for each floe, but at
   approximately the same decrease in water depth as they reached the
   northern edge of Spitsbergen Bank. The rapid increase in the tidal
   currents was linked to the topographic enhancement of tidal motion near
   Hopen Island in the shallower waters of Spitsbergen Bank. The wind and
   wave measurements made by the anemometer and wave beacons and ice
   tracker left on the ice floe to which the vessel was moored allowed for
   an estimate of the relative strength of the wind, tidal, and wave
   forcings on the local ice field. The results showed that the tidal
   currents initially dominated the dynamic response of the local ice field
   compared to the wind, which led to the conclusion that the enhanced
   tidal current was ultimately the dominant cause of the initial
   dispersion of the local pack ice field on April 28, and the dispersion
   was then further enhanced by the increase in wave energy.},

Title = {Differences in the vertical accretion of sediment among mangrove species
   with different aerial root types},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {256},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {As a type of zonal vegetation along tropical and subtropical coastlines,
   mangrove species have developed aerial root systems to adapt to their
   environment. However, little is known about the differences in the
   surface vertical accretion (SVA) of sediment among aerial root types. In
   this study, three typical mangrove species with different aerial root
   systems (Avicennia marina with pneumatophores, Bruguiera gymnorhiza with
   root knees, and Kandelia candel with plank roots) were investigated in
   Zhenzhu Bay of the Beibu Gulf, China. Vertical accretion and the total
   volume of aerial roots (VM) were monitored and calculated in three
   communities of these species along the intertidal gradient over three
   growing seasons (2017-2019). The results were as follows: (1) The
   differences in SVA and the accretion rate among the three mangrove
   species were significant (p < 0.01), and the highest accretion rate was
   detected in plank roots (1.51 cm year- 1), followed by root knees (1.05
   cm year- 1) and pneumatophores (0.63 cm year- 1). (2) The values of VM
   and annual increment in VM were highest for plank roots, followed by
   root knees and pneumatophores, and the differences in VM and the
   corresponding rate of increase among mangrove species were significant
   (p < 0.01). (3) SVA, the surface accretion rate and VM differed among
   hydrogeomorphic zones, with the highest values found in the seaward
   fringe, followed by the interior and the landward fringe. (4) Close
   linear relationships between VM and SVA and between VM annual increment
   and SVA rate were detected regardless of root type and hydrogeomorphic
   zone. We conclude that significant differences in SVA and the accretion
   rate exist among the three mangrove species, and that SVA and VM and VM
   annual increment and SVA rate exhibit a linear relationship.},

Title = {Examining bulk and iron-associated organic carbon through depth in
   margin sea sediments (China) under contrasting depositional settings:
   Chemical and NEXAFS spectral characterization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Marine sediments are the largest sink for organic carbon (OC) on Earth,
   and iron (Fe) oxides play an important role in stabilization of
   sedimentary OC. However, the roles of Fe oxides in OC stabilization
   during prolonged burial, for example, up to tens of thousands of years
   or more are still poorly constrained. In this study, we used traditional
   chemical extraction and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
   (NEXAFS) spectroscopic technique to characterize bulk OC and
   Fe-associated OC (Fe-OC) through depth in gravity cores collected from
   three sites near the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE), in the South Yellow
   Sea (SYS), and in the middle Okinawa Trough, which have contrasting
   depositional environments. Results show that depositional environments
   have exerted quite different influences on sources and burial of
   sedimentary OC, and thus on OC degradation during prolonged burial at
   the three sites. Reactive Fe (Fe-R) contents at the three sites are
   greatly influenced by sediment sources, the history of its transport,
   and its reworking intensity, with Fe-R contents near the highly dynamic
   YRE much higher than at the central SYS and the middle Okinawa Trough.
   The fractions of Fe-OC in total OC (f(Fe)(-OC)) displayed no clear or
   consistent trends with depth or by site, probably due to the dual roles
   of Fe redox cycling in OC protection versus its oxidation. As indicated
   by the f(Fe)(-OC), reactive Fe plays a limited role in OC preservation
   in margin sea sediments of East China. A combination of NEXAFS spectra
   and isotopic compositions of bulk OC and Fe-OC indicates that main OC
   functionalities have not experienced differential alterations and/or no
   specific OC moieties have been selectively stabilized/released during
   prolonged burial in the three contrasting depositional environments.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a model for tactical planning of Norwegian
   petroleum production. The problem involves regulation of production
   levels from wells, splitting of production flows into oil and gas
   products, further processing of gas and transportation in a pipeline
   network. Blending and processing of gas is necessary to satisfy quality
   requirements in the markets. The problem is formulated with
   multi-component flows, regulation alternatives in production, non-linear
   splitting for chemical processing and linear quality constraints on
   composite products. Production and splitting are modelled with integer
   requirements. The model is implemented in Xpress(MP) with a Visual Basic
   supported user interface in Excel. It is constructed in cooperation with
   the major Norwegian oil company, Statoil and can identify optimal
   production patterns and assist in planning of possible shut-downs,
   demonstrate system robustness to customers and aid in contract
   negotiations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Detection and attribution of global change effects on river nutrient
   dynamics in a large Mediterranean basin},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {13},
Pages = {4085-4098},
Abstract = {Attributing changes in river water quality to specific factors is
   challenging because multiple factors act at different temporal and
   spatial scales, and it often requires examining long-term series of
   continuous data. Data consistency is sometimes hindered by the lack of
   observations of relevant water quality variables and the low and uneven
   sampling frequency that characterizes many water quality monitoring
   schemes. Nitrate and dissolved phosphate concentration time series
   (1980-2011) from 50 sampling stations across a large Mediterranean river
   basin were analyzed to disentangle the role of hydrology, land-use
   practices, and global climatic phenomena on the observed nutrient
   patterns, with the final aim of understanding how the different aspects
   of global change affected nutrient dynamics in the basin. Dynamic factor
   analysis (DFA) provided the methodological framework to extract
   underlying common patterns in nutrient time series with missing
   observations. Using complementary methods such as frequency and trend
   analyses, we sought to further characterize the common patterns and
   identify the drivers behind their variability across time and space.
   Seasonal and other cyclic patterns were identified as well as trends of
   increase or decrease of nutrient concentration in particular areas of
   the basin. Overall, the impact of global change, which includes both
   climate change and anthropogenic impacts, on the dynamics of nitrate
   concentration across the study basin was found to be a multifaceted
   process including regional and global factors, such as climatic
   oscillations and agricultural irrigation practices, whereas impacts on
   phosphate concentration seemed to depend more on local impacts, such as
   urban and industrial activities, and less on large-scale factors.},

Abstract = {A novel LiFePO4/C composite, including 85.4 wt\% of spherical LiFePO4
   nanocrystallites with the size of 22 nm is fabricated by using 3D
   coralloid nitrogen-containing carbon with large pore volume (4.68 cm(3)
   g(-1)) and thin walls (2-3 nm) as interpenetrating conductive framework.
   Based on the whole composite, the LiFePO4/C cathode material exhibits a
   stable and high reversible capacity of 144.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and
   60.4 mA h g(-1) at 20 C (based on the weight of LiFePO4, it can deliver
   a high capacity of 155.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 85.3 mA h g(-1) at 20
   C). The cell retains 96.7\% of its initial capacity at 10 C over 1000
   cycles with an ultrahigh specific power of 5114 W kg(-1) and the
   coulombic efficiency is >99\%. The excellent performance is ascribed to
   the facile lithium-ion diffusion within the LiFePO4 nanocrystallites and
   high conductivity through the 3D continuous network. This coralloid
   carbon not only provides sufficient space for LiFePO4 hosting to further
   assist in energy storage, but also acts as a rigid nano-confinement
   support that prevents agglomeration of LiFePO4 during calcinations,
   which might be extended for the fabrication of other nano-sized
   electrode materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The use of palm oil in aquaculture feeds for salmonid species},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LIPID SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {109},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In this overview, our current knowledge and research being conducted on
   the use of palm oil in the commercial feeds for cold-water salmonid
   species such as Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout will be highlighted.
   Salmonid diets have a high lipid content to provide a source of easily
   available energy and also n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which
   is used to maintain membrane fluidity in a cold-water environment. The
   culture of salmonid fishes has traditionally depended on marine fish
   oils for this purpose, but with limited supplies and the rapid increase
   in salmon production, alternatives to fish oils must be investigated.
   Research has shown that crude palm oil can be used to replace 100\% of
   added fish oils in salmonid diets without compromising growth
   performance and feed utilization efficiency, despite reductions in lipid
   and fatty acid digestibilities that occur during low water temperatures
   over the winter rearing period. Fatty acid desaturation and elongation
   activities increased with increasing dietary palm oil and, to a certain
   extent, decreasing water temperatures. The effects of palm oil on fish
   health requires further research, but the use of this more saturated
   vegetable oil may reduce oxidative stress in fish, thereby reducing
   pathological conditions associated with this physiological state. It is
   generally known that the fish fillet fatty acid composition directly
   reflects that of the dietary oil used. Extrapolating from work done with
   other vegetable oils, the supply of beneficial n-3 PUFA in salmon
   fillets to the human consumer can be maintained by using a finishing
   diet strategy just prior to harvesting, despite significant reductions
   in these fatty acids when high levels of dietary palm oil are used in
   grower feeds. Compared to vegetable oils such as soybean or rapeseed
   oil, palm oil has several advantages in terms of high oil productivity,
   lower cost, less deposition of undesirable fatty acids such as
   18:2(n-6), superior energy source in the form of saturated and
   monounsaturated fatty acids, and a high content of natural antioxidants
   (carotenes and vitamin E). Fillet texture and color were not affected by
   feeding salmon palm oil-based diets.},

Title = {Expression Regulation of Polycistronic lee3 Genes of Enterohaemorrhagic
   Escherichia coli},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) carries a pathogenic
   island LEE that is consisted mainly of five polycistronic operons. In
   the lee3 operon, mpc is the first gene and has been reported to down
   regulate the type-3 secretion system of EHEC when its gene product is
   over-expressed. Furthermore, mpc has been suggested to have a regulation
   function via translation but the mechanism remains unclear. To clarify
   this hypothesis, we dissected the polycistron and examined the
   translated products. We conclude that translation of mpc detrimentally
   governs the translation of the second gene, escV, which in turn affects
   the translation of the third gene, escN. Then sequentially, escN affects
   the expression of the downstream genes. Furthermore, we located a
   critical cis element within the mpc open-reading frame that plays a
   negative role in the translation-dependent regulation of lee3. Using
   qRT-PCR, we found that the amount of mpc RNA transcript present in EHEC
   was relatively limited when compared to any other genes within lee3.
   Taken together, when the transcription of LEE is activated, expression
   of mpc is tightly controlled by a restriction of the RNA transcript of
   mpc, translation of which is then critical for the efficient production
   of the operon's downstream gene products.},

Abstract = {The dense phytoplankton blooms observed in earlier studies in the
   Southern Ocean Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) may not be representative of all
   regions, so that some previous assessments of the overall importance of
   this system in total primary production may have been overestimated.
   Recent observations have shown that increased phytoplankton production
   may not always be associated with the retreating ice-edge, due to the
   unpredictability of meltwater-induced stability. Complex interactions
   between the MIZ and hydrographic fronts have also been indicated. A
   range of simple simulations, based on biomass inventories for the major
   biogeochemical systems in the Southern Ocean, show that the greater part
   of chlorophyll biomass is located in the extensive regions between the
   major fronts. Consideration of the fronts and the MIZ only, which we
   surmize may be the principal sites of export production, indicates that
   the MIZ is clearly the most important single feature. Even if the
   occurrence of MIZ blooms in the simulations is reduced dramatically,
   such blooms still appear to make a substantial contribution to
   production and, by implication, carbon export.},

Title = {Dual character of Sundarban estuary as a source and sink of CO2 during

Year = {2013},
Volume = {185},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A comprehensive attempt has been made to evaluate the diurnal and
   spatial pattern of CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and water along
   the estuarine track of Indian Sundarbans during the two summer months,
   April and May, 2011. Rigorous field observations were carried out which
   included the hourly measurements of total alkalinity, pH, fugacity of
   CO2 in ambient air and water surface, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll
   a. The estuarine water was found rich in total alkalinity and was
   oversaturated with CO2 throughout the diurnal cycle in the two stations
   situated at the inner and middle estuary, respectively, whereas an
   entirely reverse situation was observed in the outer fringes. The
   fugacity of CO2 in water ranged from 152 to 657 mu atm during the study
   period. The percentage of over-saturation in inner and middle estuary
   varied from 103 to 168 and 103 to 176 \%, respectively, whereas the
   degree of under-saturation in the outer estuary lied between 40 and 99
   \%. Chlorophyll a concentrations were found higher in the outer estuary
   (12.3 +/- 2.2 mg m(-3)) compared to the middle (6.4 +/- 0.6 mg m(-3))
   and inner parts (1.6 +/- 0.2 mg m(-3)), followed by a similar decreasing
   pattern in nutrient availability from the outer to inner estuary. The
   sampling stations situated at the inner and middle estuary acted as a
   net source of 29.69 and 23.62 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1), respectively,
   whereas the outer station behaved as a net sink of -33.37 mg CO2 m(-2)
   day(-1). The study of primary production and community respiration
   further supports the heterotrophic nature of the estuary in the inner
   region while the outer periphery was marked by dominant autotrophic
   character. These contrasting results are in parity with the source
   characters of many inner estuaries and sinking characters of the outer
   estuaries situated at the distal continental shelf areas.},

Title = {Analysing natural ventilation to reduce the cooling energy consumption
   and the fuel poverty of social dwellings in coastal zones},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {279},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In southern European countries, summer temperatures could contribute to
   a high cooling energy consumption. Family units with fewer economic
   resources living in social dwellings could suffer from fuel poverty if
   they want to use air conditioning systems. Otherwise, they could face
   discomfort hours because of a natural ventilation without clear control
   criteria. This study analyses quantitatively and qualitatively the
   possibilities of natural ventilation through mixed-mode and the
   possibility of reducing fuel poverty for family units living in social
   dwellings. For this purpose, the application of a natural ventilation
   approach was analysed through an adaptive behaviour based on EN 16798-1:
   2019. A case study of 51 social dwellings was analysed by using various
   operation hypothesis between 2015 and 2019. The results showed the
   potential of using mixed-mode approaches based on the categories from EN
   16798-1:2019 to achieve savings in the energy consumption and to remove
   cases of fuel poverty in low-income families. Likewise, surveys in which
   families living in these cities participated reflected the great
   awareness of the natural ventilation use, although there is not a clear
   criterion of the need of this ventilation for thermal comfort, as well
   as the need of a supportive use of air conditioning systems. Finally,
   the similarity of the climate conditions of the city analysed and the
   coastal cities from various countries in the south of Europe shows the
   possibility of using ventilation strategies as energy saving measures in
   other regions.},

Journal = {OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {501},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an optimal and energy-efficient time-splitting
   based simultaneous light-wave information and power transfer for
   underwater optical wireless communications. We consider a multi-layer
   turbulence-induced underwater optical channel with each layer
   experiencing independent and non-identically distributed oceanic
   turbulence. A concave optimization problem to maximize the energy
   harvesting for a target data rate is formulated for two cases, that is,
   the deterministic and the stochastic energy harvesting rate.
   Specifically, the analytical expression of optimal time-splitting ratio
   is derived. Furthermore, it is shown that the value of time-splitting
   ratio less than 0.5 is preferred for an efficient performance.
   Simulation results validate the analysis and demonstrate that the
   proposed scheme significantly improves the data rate and the energy
   harvesting for underwater optical communications.},

Abstract = {The ability of Earth System Models to accurately simulate the seasonal
   cycle of the partial pressure of CO2 in surface water (pCO(2)(SW)) has
   important implications for projecting future ocean carbon uptake. Here
   we develop objective model skill score metrics and assess the abilities
   of 18 CMIP5 models to simulate the seasonal mean, amplitude, and timing
   of pCO(2)(SW) in biogeographically defined ocean biomes. The models
   perform well at simulating the monthly timing of the seasonal minimum
   and maximum of pCO(2)(SW), but perform somewhat worse at simulating the
   seasonal mean values, particularly in polar and equatorial regions. The
   results also illustrate that a single ``best'' model can be difficult to
   determine, despite an analysis restricted to the seasonality of a single
   variable. Nonetheless, groups of models tend to perform better than
   others, with significant regional differences. This suggests that
   particular models may be better suited for particular regions, though we
   find no evidence for model tuning. Timing and amplitude skill scores
   display a weak positive correlation with observational data density,
   while the seasonal mean scores display a weak negative correlation.
   Thus, additional mapped pCO(2)(SW) data may not directly increase model
   skill scores; however, improved knowledge of the dominant mechanisms may
   improve model skill. Lastly, we find skill score variability due to
   internal model variability to be much lower than variability within the
   CMIP5 intermodel spread, suggesting that mechanistic model differences
   are primarily responsible for differences in model skill scores.},

Abstract = {Total organic carbon to total nitrogen ratios (C/N) and their isotopic
   compositions (C-13(TOC) and N-15(TN)) are oft-applied proxies to discern
   terrigenous from marine-sourced organics and to unravel ancient
   environmental information. In high depositional Asian marginal seas, the
   inclusion of N-bearing minerals in the bulk sediment dilutes or masks
   signals sought after in N-15 and C-13 analyses, thus leading to
   incorrect and even contradictory interpretations. We used KOH-KOBr to
   separate operationally defined total organic matter into oxidizable
   (labile) and residual fractions for content and isotope measurements. In
   a sediment core in the Okinawa Trough, significant amounts of carbon and
   nitrogen existed in the residual phase, in which the C/N ratio was 9,
   resembling most documented sedimentary bulk C/N ratios in the China
   marginal seas. The residual carbon, which was included in operationally
   defined total organic carbon (TOC), displayed a C-13 range (-22.7 to
   -18.9, mean -20.7) similar to the oft-used marine end-member. After
   removing the interference from the residual fraction, we found that the
   temporal pattern of C-13(LOC) (LOC denotes labile organic carbon) was
   more variable. The residual nitrogen content was associated with illite,
   suggesting a terrestrial origin. Additionally, N-15 in the residual
   fraction likely reflected the climatic controls (e.g., precipitation) on
   lithogenic source materials. Further studies are required to explore the
   controlling factors for carbon and nitrogen isotopic speciation and to
   retrieve the information locked in the residual fraction.},

Title = {Context-dependent carryover effects of hypoxia and warming in a coastal
   ecosystem engineer},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Organisms are increasingly likely to be exposed to multiple stressors
   repeatedly across ontogeny as climate change and other anthropogenic
   stressors intensify. Early life stages can be particularly sensitive to
   environmental stress, such that experiences early in life can ``carry
   over{''} to have long-term effects on organism fitness. Despite the
   potential importance of these within-generation carryover effects, we
   have little understanding of how they vary across ecological contexts,
   particularly when organisms are re-exposed to the same stressors later
   in life. In coastal marine systems, anthropogenic nutrients and warming
   water temperatures are reducing average dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentrations while also increasing the severity of naturally occurring
   daily fluctuations in DO. Combined effects of warming and diel-cycling
   DO can strongly affect the fitness and survival of coastal organisms,
   including the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), a critical
   ecosystem engineer and fishery species. However, whether early life
   exposure to hypoxia and warming affects oysters' subsequent response to
   these stressors is unknown. Using a multiphase laboratory experiment, we
   explored how early life exposure to diel-cycling hypoxia and warming
   affected oyster growth when oysters were exposed to these same stressors
   8 weeks later. We found strong, interactive effects of early life
   exposure to diel-cycling hypoxia and warming on oyster tissue : shell
   growth, and these effects were context-dependent, only manifesting when
   oysters were exposed to these stressors again two months later. This
   change in energy allocation based on early life stress exposure may have
   important impacts on oyster fitness. Exposure to hypoxia and warming
   also influenced oyster tissue and shell growth, but only later in life.
   Our results show that organisms' responses to current stress can be
   strongly shaped by their previous stress exposure, and that
   context-dependent carryover effects may influence the fitness,
   production, and restoration of species of management concern,
   particularly for sessile species such as oysters.},

Abstract = {A marine radar was deployed on a remote clifftop overlooking a 4.8km
   radius area of the Inner Sound of Stroma in the Pentland Firth for 3
   months during spring 2013. The area viewed by the radar includes The
   Crown Estate lease areas for MeyGen Ltd (Inner Sound of Stroma) and
   Scottish Power Renewables (Ness of Duncansby), although the data
   analysis has focussed solely on the MeyGen area. Data were post
   processed to extract current vector maps based on determining the
   Doppler shift of sea surface waves by the tidal current. Comparisons
   between current time series from two Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
   (ADCP) surveys and the radar derived data are presented and show
   excellent correlation. The quality of the data has enabled tidal
   analyses to be performed and spatial variations in tidal current
   constituents to be mapped.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the feeding system

   completely randomized design of six treatments in a factorial
   arrangement of 2x3 was used, having as factors two feeding systems
   (Integral: balanced food with vitamin C plus water; and Mixed: balanced
   food with vitamin C, green forage and water) and three breeds (Peru,
   Andean and Inti). Higher final weights and daily weight gains were
   obtained in the treatments with guinea pigs breed Peru with mixed
   (1010.3 g and 15.31 g) and integral feeding system (991.9 g and 14.61
   g), respectively, with respect to the other treatments (p<0.05); while
   feed consumption in dry matter and carcass yield were statistically
   higher in the Peru group with mixed feeding (48.10 g DM/day, 72.77\%).
   The most efficient feed conversion (p<0.05) was determined in the
   integral feeding system with Peru (2.73) and Andina (2.78) guinea pigs.
   The integral feeding systems registered less consumption and more
   efficient feeding conversion (p<0.05) compared to the mixed system.},

Abstract = {Increases in incident W-B radiation (280-320 nm) have been observed at
   temperate as well as polar latitudes in recent decades. Although UV-B
   radiation makes up only a small portion of the total energy of solar
   radiation and attenuates rapidly in the water column, the high
   sensitivity of living organisms to UV-B radiation makes the observed
   increases potentially important in aquatic ecosystems. To date, research
   has focused largely on the primary producers in marine ecosystems in
   Antarctica where ozone depletion and subsequent increases in UV-B
   radiation have been most pronounced. This review addresses the potential
   role of UV-B radiation in freshwaters by taking into account some of the
   information available in marine systems and applying some of the recent
   advances in our understanding of the ecology of freshwaters. The
   potential for complex rather than simple responses of freshwater
   ecosystems to W-B radiation is emphasized.},

Title = {Smart microgrid hierarchical frequency control ancillary service
   provision based on virtual inertia concept: An integrated demand
   response and droop controlled distributed generation framework},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {92},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Low inertia stack, high penetration levels of renewable energy source
   and great ratio of power deviations in a small power delivery system put
   microgrid frequency at risk of instability. On the basis of the close
   coupling between the microgrid frequency and system security
   requirements, procurement of adequate ancillary services from
   cost-effective and environmental friendly resources is a great challenge
   requests an efficient energy management system. Motivated by this need,
   this paper presents a novel energy management system that is aimed to
   coordinately manage the demand response and distributed generation
   resources. The proposed approach is carried out by constructing a
   hierarchical frequency control structure in which the frequency
   dependent control functions of the microgrid components are modeled
   comprehensively. On the basis of the derived modeling, both the static
   and dynamic frequency securities of an islanded microgrid are provided
   in primary and secondary control levels. Besides, to cope with the low
   inertia stack of islanded microgrids, novel virtual inertia concept is
   devised based on the precise modeling of droop controlled distributed
   generation resources. The proposed approach is applied to typical test
   microgrid. Energy and hierarchical reserve resource are scheduled
   precisely using a scenario-based stochastic programming methodology.
   Moreover, analyzing the results verifies the impressiveness of the
   proposed energy management system in cost-effectively optimizing the
   microgrid ancillary service procurement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Hydrokinetic energy has been mainly studied in areas where the principal
   driver of the current is the tide. However, in certain areas river
   discharges play also a principal role. The exploitation of the
   hydrokinetic resource in such areas has its own peculiarities, dictated
   by the combined influence of the two driving agents. The objective of
   this paper is to investigate the exploitation of hydrokinetic energy in
   the Mino Estuary, the largest estuary in NW Spain and N Portugal, with a
   focus on the site-specific performance of hydrokinetic energy converters
   (HECs) and its intra-annual variability. A state-of-the-art
   hydrodynamics numerical model is implemented and successfully validated
   based on field data. A third generation HEC-to be more specific, the new
   Smart Freestream Turbine (SFT)-is considered, and its performance at the
   location with the greatest potential is assessed by means of: (i)
   site-specific efficiency, (ii) availability factor, and (iii) capacity
   factor. We find that, whereas the site-specific efficiency does not vary
   significantly, the availability and capacity factors do experience
   substantial intra-annual (seasonal) variability. In summer and autumn,
   river discharges are low, and the tide dominates the hydrokinetic
   resource. In contrast, during winter and spring, the river discharges
   significantly contribute to the resource, leading to a considerable
   increase in the availability and capacity factors. More generally, the
   results imply that in areas subject to combined fluvial and tidal
   influences the performance of HECs may depart significantly from that in
   tide-dominated areas, and this departure must be carefully weighed in
   assessing a project. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Polaris deposit, located on Little Cornwallis Island in the Canadian
   Arctic, was a Mississippi Valley-type Zn-Pb deposit hosted by brecciated
   carbonate rocks of the Upper Ordovician Thumb Mountain Formation.
   Mapping indicates that strike-slip faults on the east side of the
   Polaris deposit were active during the last stage of the Late Devonian
   Ellesmerian Orogeny. Polaris is on a jog in the north-oriented, Early
   Devonian Boothia fault system and was the site of localized extension
   during south-directed Late Devonian Ellesmerian compression. This
   structural setting elsewhere in the district may be prospective for
   Zn-Pb mineralisation. Ore fluids rising in the Late Devonian interacted
   with the host rock causing dissolution, brecciation and collapse.
   Carbonate beds are thinned, indicating widespread removal of carbonate
   material. Five breccia types (crackle, pseudo, cobble, mega and
   collapse) are present in the vicinity of the deposit. Crackle breccia is
   preserved around the periphery of the deposit and is indicative of
   structural dilation or the early stages of mineralisation. Dolomite and
   pseudobreccias are also preserved around, and extend beyond, the
   periphery of the deposit. These are considered an early stage of
   alteration directly related to the mineralising fluids and could act as
   a vector to the centre of the mineralising system where collapse, mega
   and cobble breccias occur intimately with massive mineralisation. Crown

Title = {Vulnerability assessment of coastal areas to sea level rise from the
   physical and socioeconomic parameters: case of the Gulf Coast of Bejaia,
   Algeria},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The study area (the Gulf of Bejaia) is a coastal zone of about 70 km
   long in the eastern-central part of the Algerian coast. The coastline
   characterized by sandy beaches, hotels and tourist facilities, airport,
   port, villages and towns has known during these last decades several
   threats like storms, floods and erosion. The present work concerns the
   mapping of the physical and socioeconomic vulnerability of the Gulf
   Coast of Bejaia to sea level rise, using Coastal Vulnerability Index
   (CVI) and geospatial tools. The Physical CVI (CVIPhys) is calculated
   from seven physical variables: geomorphology, coastal slope, coastal
   regional elevation, sea level rise rate, shoreline erosion/accretion
   rates, tidal range and significant wave height. On the other hand, the
   parameters population, cultural heritage, roads, railways, land use and
   conservation designation constitute, for their part, the socioeconomic
   CVI (CVIeco). The values obtained from the calculation of CVIPhys vary
   between 3.53 and 81.83. These results revealed that 22.42 km of the
   studied coastline has a low physical vulnerability, 21.68 km a high
   vulnerability and 15.83 km a very high vulnerability, indicating that
   the most part of the coastline (53.59\%) is vulnerable to sea level
   rise. According to the obtained values of CVIeco, the most vulnerable
   areas of high and very high risk represent 31.81 km of the total
   coastline. They were found along the western (Bejaia and Tichy) and
   eastern (Aokas, Souk El Tenine and Melbou) coast, while the least
   vulnerable stretches, covering 38.19 km of the total length of the
   coast, occupy the rest of the area. This study highlighted areas that
   will be most affected by future sea level rise (SLR) and storm events.
   It revealed that several development projects of Bejaia Gulf Coast,
   including tourist expansion areas, are planned in sites identified as
   very vulnerable. The results obtained from this assessment could guide
   local planners and decision-makers in developing coastal management
   plans in the most vulnerable areas.},

   Environmental Parameters},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Bacterial and archaeal communities play important roles in wetland
   ecosystems. Although the microbial communities in the soils and
   sediments of wetlands have been studied extensively, the comprehensive
   distributions of planktonic bacterial and archaeal communities and their
   responses to environmental variables in wetlands remain poorly
   understood. The present study investigated the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the water
   of an artificially irrigated estuarine wetland of the Liaohe River,
   China, explored whether the wetland effluent changed the bacterial and
   archaeal communities in the Liaohe River, and evaluated the driving
   environmental factors. Within the study, 16S rRNA quantitative PCR
   methods and MiSeq high-throughput sequencing were used. The bacterial
   and archaeal 16S rRNA gene abundances showed significant temporal
   variation. Meanwhile, the bacterial and archaeal structures showed
   temporal but not spatial variation in the wetland and did not change in
   the Liaohe River after wetland drainage. Moreover, the bacterial
   communities tended to have higher diversity in the wetland water in
   summer and in the scarce zone, while a relatively higher diversity of
   archaeal communities was found in autumn and in the intensive zone. DO,
   pH and PO4-P were proven to be the essential environmental parameters
   shaping the planktonic bacterial and archaeal community structures in
   the Liaohe River estuarine wetland (LEW). The LEW had a high potential
   for methanogenesis, which could be reflected by the composition of the
   microbial communities.},

Abstract = {Wave-current interaction, a common phenomenon in the areas of estuary
   and gulf is also notable in deep water sea area. When the current is
   strong enough, wave ``blocking{''} accompanied by wave breaking takes
   place and leads to hazard sea conditions. On the other hand, wave
   countering current is also thought to be one of the main causes of
   occurrence of rogue waves in the ocean, which imperils offshore
   structures and is of much importance for research. Knowing this, viscous
   flow of wave generation on current is simulated by using
   Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation for better understanding
   of its mechanism and flow field. In this study, two-dimensional waves
   propagating without current, along and against pre-existing large-scale
   current have been investigated. The validation of calculation has been
   demonstrated through comparing with preliminary experiments in
   Circulating Water Channel (CWC). When propagating in counter-current,
   wave is steepened and wave height increases dramatically, thus wave
   breaking occurs occasionally. Therefore, the variation of wave height
   and steepness with current velocity has been analyzed quantitatively. It
   has been confirmed that wave ``blocking{''} occurs when current speed is
   comparable with group velocity of waves. And this is analyzed in detail
   in terms of kinematics, energy transfer and others. Accordingly, wave
   breaking is evaluated by the well-known classical wave breaking
   criterion. Furthermore, the proposed viscous model is compared with
   ``simple bore dissipation model{''} to evaluate energy dissipation of
   wave breaking and improvement of numerical model for wave blocking is
   introduced. It has been shown that the present numerical model is
   applicable to reproduce the wave blocking and breaking phenomenon and it
   will be useful for future engineering purpose on predicting real sea
   conditions.},

Title = {Unravelling the impact of lithofacies on the composition of NSO
   compounds in residual and expelled fluids of the Barnett, Niobrara and
   Posidonia formations},
Journal = {ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {155},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The influence of lithofacies on the composition of NSO (nitrogen-,
   sulfur-and oxygen-containing) compounds in unconventional petroleum
   systems has been investigated using examples of biogenic carbonate-rich
   Niobrara Shale, biogenic quartz-rich Barnett Shale and detrital
   clay-rich Posidonia Shale. The chosen sample sets all contain Type II
   marine kerogen in the peak-late oil window. Solvent extracts were
   analyzed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
   spectrometry (FT-ICRMS), combined with atmospheric pressure
   photoionization in positive ion mode ((+)-APPI) and electrospray
   ionization in negative ion mode ((-)-ESI). Covering source and reservoir
   units, our study furthermore enables tracing the impact of lithofacies
   on primary petroleum migration within the Niobrara and Barnett shales.
   Siliciclastic Barnett and Posidonia shale extracts reveal higher
   proportions of NSO compounds confirming their generally higher retention
   capacities for polar organic compounds. However, different retention
   specificities of biogenic quartz-and clay-rich rocks are indicated by
   varying NSO compound compositions in their bitumen fraction: biogenic
   quartz preferentially preserves and retains organonitrogen compounds,
   while the more polar acidic organooxygen species are preferably retained
   by clay minerals. Extracts from the carbonate rocks contain a larger
   fraction of nonaromatic cyclic sulfoxides and amides that are likely
   formed by oxidation processes during maturation of organic matter.
   Fractionations induced by the intra-formation migration differ between
   the Barnett and Niobrara sample sets. While low-polarity organonitrogen
   species are retained in both Barnett (to a greater extent) and Niobrara
   source units, a preferential migration of highly alkylated and small
   acidic NSO components out of the source is only observed in the Niobrara
   samples.

Abstract = {A moored-buoy system for collecting real-time seismic data from the
   coastal ocean has been developed and will be deployed for its initial
   field trial in the fall of 2003. The key component in this moored system
   is an ultra-stretchy mooring hose that provides compliance for waves and
   currents and protects the electrical conductors connecting an Ocean
   Bottom Seismometer (OBS) to a surface buoy from the effects of bending
   and stretching. This hose is able to stretch to more than twice its
   unstretched length of 30 m without putting excessive strain on the
   electrical conductors embedded in its wall. In the initial trials of
   this system, the OBS will be deployed on the bottom in 40 m of water and
   connected to the mooring hose through a cable on the seafloor. It will
   transmit continuous data at a rate of about 5,000 bps to a radio link in
   the surface buoy. A repeater modem located at the Gay Head lighthouse on
   Martha's Vineyard about 18 km from the mooring site will receive the
   transmissions and forward the data to our laboratory at WHOI, about 46
   km distant. A GPS receiver on the surface buoy will be configured to
   send accurate and synchronized time to the OBS on the seafloor, which
   will make it possible to include data from these undersea systems in the
   existing seismic data network without the need for any preprocessing.
   Power to operate the RF link and the OBS will be supplied by solar
   panels and rechargeable batteries on the surface buoy.},

Title = {Climate change and disease: bleaching of a chemically defended seaweed},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2958-2970},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Disease is emerging as an important impact of global climate change, due
   to the effects of environmental change on host organisms and their
   pathogens. Climate-mediated disease can have severe consequences in
   natural systems, particularly when ecosystem engineers, such as
   habitat-formers or top predators are affected, as any impacts can
   cascade throughout entire food webs. In temperate marine ecosystems,
   seaweeds are the dominant habitat-formers on rocky reefs. We
   investigated a putative bleaching disease affecting Delisea pulchra, a
   chemically defended seaweed that occurs within a global warming
   `hot-spot' and assessed how patterns of this phenomenon were influenced
   by ocean temperature, solar radiation, algal chemical defences and
   microbial pathogens. Warmer waters were consistently and positively
   correlated with higher frequencies of bleaching in seaweed populations,
   but patterns of bleaching were not consistently influenced by light
   levels. Bleached thalli had low levels of antibacterial chemical
   defences relative to healthy conspecifics and this was observed across
   entire thalli of partially bleached algae. Microbial communities
   associated with bleached algae were distinct from those on the surfaces
   of healthy seaweeds. Direct testing of the importance of algal chemical
   defences, done here for the first time in the field, demonstrated that
   they protected the seaweed from bleaching. Treatment of algal thalli
   with antibiotics reduced the severity of bleaching in experimental
   algae, especially at high water temperatures. These results indicate
   that bleaching in D. pulchra is the result of temperature-mediated
   bacterial infections and highlight the potential for warming to
   influence disease dynamics by stressing hosts. Understanding the complex
   ways in which global change may affect important organisms such as
   habitat-forming seaweeds, is essential for the management and
   conservation of natural resources.},

Abstract = {Social learning, learning from others, has value in extending knowledge
   about farm management through networks of growers. Exactly how much
   value depends on the structure of the networks. We employed social
   network analysis to study knowledge networks and social learning in
   three American Viticulture Areas in California: Central Coast, Lodi and
   Napa Valley. In a survey, growers confirmed that experiential and social
   learning are more useful for accessing information about farm management
   than formal learning. UC Agriculture and Natural Resources Cooperative
   Extension (UCCE) was found to be well positioned to access and spread
   knowledge through the grower networks but a bottleneck exists - many
   knowledge-sharing relationships and relatively few staff. We also found
   that grower participation in traditional outreach activities, e.g.,
   meetings and demonstrations, is a strong predictor of their number of
   knowledge-sharing relationships, so UCCE and other agricultural support
   organizations have an important role to play in strengthening networks.
   Several network-smart extension strategies might help alleviate the
   bottleneck and rewire networks to more efficiently connect those with
   questions to those with solutions.},

Abstract = {Changes in spatial distribution in several fish species have been
   related to recent increase in global temperature. In the North Sea, both
   a poleward shift and a shift to deeper water have been observed. Here,
   we study the underlying mechanism of these shifts in a comparative study
   of the changes in distribution of two boreal flatfish species (plaice
   Pleuronectes platessa and dab Limanda limanda) and three Lusitanian
   flatfish species (sole Solea solea, solenette Buglossidium luteum, and
   scaldfish Arnoglossus latema) as recorded in annual bottom trawl surveys
   carried out in the North Sea in late summer since 1985. The distribution
   is analysed in relation to the bottom temperature at the time of the
   survey as well as to the seasonal maximum bottom temperature earlier in
   the year. It is shown that the boreal species plaice and dab moved to
   deeper water and maintained the seasonal maximum temperature that they
   experienced in earlier periods, while the Lusitanian species sole,
   solenette, and scaldfish experienced an increase in the seasonal maximum
   temperature that they experienced while maintaining their depth
   distribution. This overall response varied between length classes,
   reflecting a preference for higher temperature of the smaller length
   classes. The results lend support to the hypothesis that the fish
   displayed a direct response to the maximum temperature that occurred
   during the growth season before the time of sampling. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {While Germany has led the market in photovoltaic (PV) implementation
   throughout the last decade, there has been increasing criticism of PV
   support policies due to their high cost. Although declining, the
   levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV is still above the German
   wholesale electricity price. However, using LCOE as an evaluation
   yardstick falls short in at least 2 respects: It neither takes into
   account integration costs rising with PV penetration (ie, undervaluing
   its actual cost) nor avoided externalities of replacing conventional for
   renewable generation (social cost overvaluation). We thus calculate the
   social profitability of PV in Germany by including not only private
   costs and benefits but also integration costs to the electricity system
   and avoided environmental externalities, using the internal rate of
   return and the profitability index as indicators. Our results show that
   when these factors are considered, the social profitability of PV in
   Germany is higher than 10\% at the lower bound of the social cost of
   carbon (150Euro/tCO(2)) up to a penetration level of at least 15\% and
   positive up to a penetration level of at least 25\%. Results also show
   the level of private profitability if all externalities were
   internalized and assert that subsidies are justified to align private
   and social profitability. The proposed method could be used as a
   complementary indicator to private profitability by public institutions,
   development banks, and companies with social responsibility values.},

Abstract = {Viewing the considerable potential of marine agar as a source for the
   sustainable production of energy as well as nature-derived
   pharmaceutics, this work investigated the catalytic activity of three
   novel GH50 agarases from the mesophilic marine bacterium Microbulbifer
   elongatus PORT2 isolated from Indonesian coastal seawaters. The GH50
   agarases AgaA50, AgaB50, and AgaC50 were identified through genome
   analysis; the corresponding genes were cloned and expressed in
   Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). All recombinant agarases hydrolyzed
   beta-p-nitrophenyl galactopyranoside, indicating beta-glycosidase
   characteristics. AgaA50 and AgaB50 were able to cleave diverse natural
   agar species derived from Indonesian agarophytes, indicating a promising
   tolerance of these enzymes for substrate modifications. All three GH50
   agarases degraded agarose, albeit with remarkable diversity in their
   catalytic activity and mode of action. AgaA50 and AgaC50 exerted
   exolytic activity releasing differently sized neoagarobioses, while
   AgaB50 showed additional endolytic activity in dependence on the
   substrate size. Surprisingly, AgaA50 and AgaB50 revealed considerable
   thermostability, retaining over 75\% activity after 1-h incubation at 50
   degrees C. Considering the thermal properties of agar, this makes these
   enzymes promising candidates for industrial processing.},

Title = {Using realized thermal niche to validate thermal preferences from
   laboratory studies. How do they stand?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Temperature is recongnised as the main factor controlling the species
   fitness and performance. Naturally, the thermal preferences (TP) of
   aquatic organisms obtained in controlled conditions have been used to
   relate physiological performance with field data since they are a good
   proxy to the fundamental niche. Literature suggests that dispersal
   capabilities, biological interactions, acclimatisation, adaptation,
   among others might play a role in species distribution; thus, in
   reality, species are usually occupying a realized thermal niche (RTN).
   Therefore, this study was designed to inquire into the following
   questions: Are the TP of tropical aquatic ec-totherms found in
   laboratory conditions similar to their RTN? Can TP be validated with
   occurrences in the wild? To answer these questions, this study compared
   the TP obtained from previously published works with the RTN of the
   crabs Callinectes similis and C. sapidus, the fishes Centropomus
   undecimalis and Ocyurus chrysurus, the lobster Panulirus argus, and the
   octopus Octopus maya obtained from occurrences from 1693documents. When
   RTN values were tested against the TPs obtained in laboratory, no
   significant differences were found for fish species (P > 0.05); in
   contrast, differences for the benthic invertebrates were reported (P <
   0.05). At least two factors could have been affecting these results:
   differences in the average tolerances between geographically distinct
   populations (local adaptation) and the dispersal capabilities that might
   have been forcing a differentiation between populations If, as proposed,
   fishes can actively follow thermal optimum, their response to warming
   scenarios could be faster than benthic organisms. If our hypothesis is
   true, the uncertainty of climate change could be reduced when the local
   adaptation is taking into consideration.},

Title = {A Tsunami Warning System Based on Offshore Bottom Pressure Gauges and
   Data Assimilation for Crete Island in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin},

Abstract = {The Eastern Mediterranean Basin (EMB) is under the threat of tsunami
   events triggered by various causes including earthquakes and landslides.
   We propose a deployment of Offshore Bottom Pressure Gauges (OBPGs)
   around Crete Island, which would enable tsunami early warning by data
   assimilation for disaster mitigation. Our OBPG network consists of 12
   gauges distributed around Crete Island, with a 100-km interval, based on
   three criteria to select the locations. The station network must have a
   good azimuthal coverage and have enough (>50 km) distance from the
   coast, and the OBPGs are placed at the locations where the most
   energetic wave dynamics occur, which is confirmed by Empirical
   Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of pre-calculated tsunami scenarios.
   We demonstrate three test cases comprising a hypothetical seismogenic
   tsunami in east Sicily, a hypothetical landslide tsunami in the Aegean
   Sea, and the real tsunami event of the May 2020 off the Crete
   earthquake. Our designed OBPG network achieves an accuracy of 88.5\% for
   the hypothetical seismogenic tsunami and 87.3\% for the hypothetical
   landslide tsunami with regard to the forecasting of first tsunami peak.
   For the real event of May 2020, it predicts the tsunami arrival at tide
   gauge NOA-04 accurately; the observed and forecasted amplitudes of the
   first wave are 5.0 cm and 4.5 cm, respectively. The warning lead time
   for the May 2020 event was similar to 10 min. Therefore, our results
   reveal that the assimilation of OBPG data can satisfactorily forecast
   the amplitudes and arrival times for tsunamis in the EMB.},

Abstract = {This study was performed to evaluate the effect of replacing fish meal
   with local by-products on Clarias gariepinus growth performance, feed
   utilization and body composition. A control diet contained 50\% of fish
   meal. In four other diets, fish meal was partially replaced by vegetable
   and animal protein blend composed of sunflower oil cake, soybean oil
   cake, groundnut oil cake, bean meal, chicken viscera and blood meal. The
   study was conducted in a recirculating water system at a mean
   temperature of 23.6 degrees C. The five test diets were compared with a
   commercial diet developed for African catfish. All diets were balanced
   to be equal in gross energy (19 kJ g(-1)) and crude protein (40\%). The
   experimental groups were fed in triplicate for 8 weeks, increasing fish
   weight from about 6.2 g at start to 52.3 g in the end. Best specific
   growth rate (SGR=3.4), feed efficiency (FE=1.3) and protein efficiency
   ratio (PER=3) were obtained with the control diet (diet 50\% fish meal),
   although there were no significant differences between the group of fish
   fed the control diet and those fed diets based on groundnut oil cake or
   bean meal, whereas SGR (2.17), FE (0.85) and PER (1.95) were
   significantly (P < 0.01) lower in fish fed diet containing sunflower oil
   cake. No significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in fish fed
   commercial diet and diets containing bean meal or groundnut oil cake.
   Groundnut oil cake or bean meal can thus replace at least 50\% of fish
   meal in the diet of Clarias fingerlings without amino acid
   supplementation. Because of its economic importance and its potential in
   animal nutrition sunflower oil cake is still an interesting feed
   ingredient, but its efficiency should be improved by various processing
   techniques. African catfish can utilize efficiently a diet with low
   percentage of animal protein without growth reduction.},

Title = {Gene expression changes in the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi after
   500 generations of selection to ocean acidification},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {281},
Number = {1786},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Coccolithophores are unicellular marine algae that produce biogenic
   calcite scales and substantially contribute to marine primary production
   and carbon export to the deep ocean. Ongoing ocean acidification
   particularly impairs calcifying organisms, mostly resulting in decreased
   growth and calcification. Recent studies revealed that the immediate
   physiological response in the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi to ocean
   acidification may be partially compensated by evolutionary adaptation,
   yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are currently unknown. Here, we
   report on the expression levels of 10 candidate genes putatively
   relevant to pH regulation, carbon transport, calcification and
   photosynthesis in E. huxleyi populations short-term exposed to ocean
   acidification conditions after acclimation (physiological response) and
   after 500 generations of high CO2 adaptation (adaptive response). The
   physiological response revealed down-regulation of candidate genes, well
   reflecting the concomitant decrease of growth and calcification. In the
   adaptive response, putative pH regulation and carbon transport genes
   were up-regulated, matching partial restoration of growth and
   calcification in high CO2-adapted populations. Adaptation to ocean
   acidification in E. huxleyi likely involved improved cellular pH
   regulation, presumably indirectly affecting calcification. Adaptive
   evolution may thus have the potential to partially restore cellular pH
   regulatory capacity and thereby mitigate adverse effects of ocean
   acidification.},

Abstract = {The variation of ocean acidity (pH) in the Indonesia waters is strongly
   influenced by monsoon. Since the climate change tends to potentially
   change monsoonal variation over the Indonesian region, it will give also
   implication to the ocean pH variation. Moreover, changes of ocean pH
   will give effects to the marine lifes and their environment. In order to
   investigate this issue, we tried to calculate monthly variation of sea
   surface pH in the Indonesia waters based on monthly average temperature
   and salinity over past 18 years data. Temperature and salinity data used
   in this study were taken from the hydrodynamic model of Hamburg Shelf
   Ocean Model (HAMSOM), while alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC) were from World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA 2009). Algorithm from Ocean
   Carbon Model Intercomparison Project-version. 3 (OCMIP-3) was used to
   calculate the pH. The estimation results indicate that pH variation in
   the Indonesia waters changes insignificantly over 18 years. El Nino
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) contribute to
   physical changes of seawater, but did not affect the pH significantly.
   The average pH of seawater is higher during northwest monsoon than
   during southeast monsoon.},

Abstract = {The concept of a microgrid system, when put in simple words, is a small
   scale generation and deployment of power to a small geographical area in
   order to avoid transmission losses and maintain an uninterrupted power
   supply. It has been a mandatory protocol to implement the available
   renewable energy sources (RES) in order to minimize the emission of
   harmful pollutants to the atmosphere from the combustion of the fossil
   fuels. Economic load dispatch (ELD) deals with the optimal sizing of the
   distributed energy resources (DERs) by minimizing the fuel costs.
   Emission dispatch does the optimal sizing of the DERs sources by
   minimizing the amount of pollutants released in the atmosphere. A
   multi-objective Combined Economic-Emission Dispatch (CEED) does the
   optimal DER sizing providing a compromised solution of minimizing both
   the fuel costs and pollutants emission. This paper performs all ELD,
   emission dispatch and CEED on an islanded and renewable-integrated
   microgrid separately using a recently developed novel Whale optimization
   Algorithm (WOA). Four various scenarios of load sharing among the DERs
   are studied. The results are then compared with other recently developed
   bio inspired algorithms to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed
   technique. Further statistical analysis such as ANOVA test and Wilcoxon
   signed rank test are performed to prove the superiority of the proposed
   approach over the various other optimization techniques used. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Improving understanding of how biodiversity and ecosystems respond to
   environmental change is necessary to guide policy and management. To
   this end, the bioDISCOVERY project of the international programme on
   global change, Future Earth, initiates and supports international

   community by participating in the development of global databases. This
   global working-group approach is essential for directing cutting-edge
   science toward supporting international policies, addressing urgent

Title = {The Campanian-Maastrichtian foraminiferal biostratigraphy of the

Abstract = {Micropalaeontological and biostratigraphical studies included
   Campanian-Maastrichtian complexes from five oil exploration wells
   drilled in northern Serbia (Vojvodina): the first is a carbonate-clastic
   complex and second is a -complex containing ophiolites intercalated with
   hemipelagic and pelagic sediments. Within the studied complexes, rich
   associations of planktonic and benthic foraminifera, calcareous
   nannoplankton, palynomorphs, as well as shallow and deep-water fossil
   detritus were determined. The presence of relatively rich associations
   of planktonic foraminifera allowed recognition of two biozones: the
   Globotruncana ventricosa Zone, observed in the sediments of the
   carbonate-clastic complex and the Gansserina gansseri Zone, observed in
   both complexes. Except biozones, based on documented index species, for
   some units in both complexes, larger benthic foraminifera species had
   special biostratigraphical value, and in some of them, the calcareous
   nannoplankton zones were recognized. The studied complexes represent
   deep-water formations, generated in oceanic island arc and trough zones.
   The presence of limestones, which originate from destroyed rudist reefs,
   is explained by transfer by means of gravitational transport mechanisms
   of shallow-water sediments to deep-water depositional environments. In
   this paper, the results of more detailed biostratigraphical and
   palaeo-ecological studies of foraminifera associations in
   Campanian-Maastrichtian complexes in Vojvodina are presented. Combined
   with lithological studies, seven units were determined within the
   complexes. The obtained results are important as a part of
   multidisciplinary, regional exploration of both complexes, generated in
   specific geological conditions, that today -constitute a part of the
   pre-Neogene basement complex in the southeastern part of the Pannonian
   Basin. The CampanianMaastrichtian carbonate-clastic complex represents
   sedimentary cover of the Eastern Vardar Ophiolitic Unit, while the
   ophiolites intercalated with hemipelagic and pelagic limestones belongs
   to the Sava Zone.},

Abstract = {The Tibasosa Formation is the main source of limestones in Boyaca. This
   unit corresponds to a Valanginian-Albian age according to the fossil
   content in the Eastern Cordillera Basin, recording the first incursion
   of the Cretaceous sea in Firavitoba. Outcrop-based facies and
   stratigraphic analyzes of the similar to 12 m-thick
   siliciclastic-carbonate succession of the uppermost Tibasosa Formation
   indicate tidal and carbonate systems. Ten facies/microfacies are grouped
   into two facies associations (FAs): FA1, tidal flat deposits consist of
   laminated sandstones/siltstones and floatstones with a single organism
   dominance (bivalve shells); and FA2 comprises fossiliferous rudstones,
   floatstones, packstones, and wackstones, representing a carbonate
   platform. The petrographic description determined rock textures/genesis
   and the diagenetic sequence with features of the eodiagenesis,
   mesodiagenesis, and telodiagenesis suggesting a primary origin of these
   carbonates. The analysis using cathodoluminescence (CL), energy disperse
   spectrometry (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) allowed
   identify compositional differences, cementation phases, and
   morphological features in different processes as micritization,
   neomorphism, porosity, pyritization, compaction, cementation,
   fracturing, and weathering. The interpretation of facies and microfacies
   indicated a deposition mainly in a shallow platform with variation in
   the hydraulic conditions, warm waters, and episodic events of
   storms/tsunamis that fragmented the bioclasts. A shallow marine system
   in the Eastern Cordillera Basin during Cretaceous indicates a large
   transgressive event that flooded hundreds of kilometers, being a link
   with the Pacific Ocean before the Andes uplift. The main diagenetic
   events correspond to micritization, cementation of calcite, and
   mechanical/chemical compaction as a result of microbial activity,
   dissolution, precipitation in the vadose/phreatic zone, and burial
   diagenesis. The diagenetic sequence events reveal the incidence of
   marine and meteoric process that reduced porosity and attest to the
   microbial activity in carbonate precipitated. This new interpretation
   allows the understanding of carbonate platforms in the Eastern
   Cordillera Basin for future correlations of the Cretaceous sea in
   Colombia.},

Title = {Combination of Gibbs and Helmholtz Energy Equations of State in a
   Multiparameter Mixture Model Using the IAPWS Seawater Model as an
   Example},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For carbon capture and storage (CCS) applications different sets of
   equations of state are used to describe the whole CCS-chain. While for
   the transport and pipeline sections highly accurate equations of state
   (EOS) explicit in the Helmholtz energy are used, properties under
   typical geological storage conditions are described by more simple,
   mostly cubic EOS, and brines are described by Gibbs energy models.
   Combining the transport and storage sections leads to inconsistent
   calculations. Since the used models are formulated in different
   independent variables (temperature and density versus temperature and
   pressure), mass and energy balances are challenging and equilibria in
   the injection region are difficult to model. To overcome these
   limitations, a predictive combination of the Gibbs energy-based IAPWS
   seawater model (IAPWS R13-08, 2008) with Helmholtz energy-based
   multi-parameter EOS is presented within this work. The Helmholtz energy
   model used in this work is based on the EOS-CG-2016 of Gernert and Span
   (J Chem Thermodyn 93:274-293, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jci.2015.05.015,
   2016). The results prove that a consistent combination of the two
   different models is possible. Furthermore, it is shown, that a more
   complex brine model needs to be combined with Helmholtz energy EOS for
   calculations at storage conditions.},

Title = {Latitudinal Range Influences the Seasonal Variation in the Foraging
   Behavior of Marine Top Predators},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Non-migratory resident species should be capable of modifying their
   foraging behavior to accommodate changes in prey abundance and
   availability associated with a changing environment. Populations that
   are better adapted to change will have higher foraging success and
   greater potential for survival in the face of climate change. We studied
   two species of resident central place foragers from temperate and
   equatorial regions with differing population trends and prey
   availability associated to season, the California sea lion (Zalophus
   californianus) (CSL) whose population is increasing and the endangered
   Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) (GSL) whose population is
   declining. To determine their response to environmental change, we
   studied and compared their diving behavior using time-depth recorders
   and satellite location tags and their diet by measuring C and N isotope
   ratios during a warm and a cold season. Based on latitudinal differences
   in oceanographic productivity, we hypothesized that the seasonal
   variation in foraging behavior would differ for these two species. CSL
   exhibited greater seasonal variability in their foraging behavior as
   seen in changes to their diving behavior, foraging areas and diet
   between seasons. Conversely, GSL did not change their diving behavior
   between seasons, presenting three foraging strategies (shallow, deep and
   bottom divers) during both. GSL exhibited greater dive and foraging
   effort than CSL. We suggest that during the warm and less productive
   season a greater range of foraging behaviors in CSL was associated with
   greater competition for prey, which relaxed during the cold season when
   resource availability was greater. GSL foraging specialization suggests
   that resources are limited throughout the year due to lower primary
   production and lower seasonal variation in productivity compared to CSL.
   These latitudinal differences influence their foraging success, pup
   survival and population growth reflected in contrasting population
   trends in which CSL are more successful and potentially more resilient
   to climate change.},

Title = {Less is more: Optimising the biocementation of coastal sands by reducing
   influent urea through response surface method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {315},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The excessive effluent ammonia produced during the conventional
   biocementation of coastal sands by ureolytic Microbially Induced Calcite
   Precipitation (MICP) poses a looming threat to the marine environment.
   This research mitigates this threat by employing a brute force
   deployment of the Response Surface Method (RSM) for optimal minimisation
   of urea, which is the primary contributor of this effluent ammonia, to
   develop a sustainable MICP treatment model for the biocementation of
   coastal sand columns. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and
   calcium carbonate content (CCC) results of these columns, measured
   during their UCS and gravimetric acid washing testing, were used in this
   developed model for its validation and further optimisation. The
   biocementation solution resulting from this finally optimised MICP model
   used 75\% lesser influent urea per gram of sand than its predecessor
   treatment model and still significantly improved the UCS of biocemented
   sand columns (from 0 kPa to 111.63 kPa). The structural analyses (XRD,
   FESEM) of these biocemented columns showed the adsorption of calcium
   carbonate and nesquehonite crystals on sand grains. This reduction in
   the consumption of urea significantly lowers the production of effluent
   ammonia during the biocementation of coastal sands. Therefore, it is
   suggested that this optimised MICP treatment model offers a sustainable
   method for strengthening coastal sands with little to no effect on the
   natural mosaic of their subsurface ecosystems.},

   This paper presents how a 3-level converter structure which was
   developed to double switching frequency is able to switch 50\% more

Abstract = {Using observations of surface winds, solar radiation, ocean currents and
   waves collected by the University of South Florida, Coastal Ocean
   Monitoring and Prediction System (COMPS), augmented by other data and
   numerical model simulations, we address the potential for electrical
   power generation for Florida by harnessing the natural energy sources of
   wind and solar, along with ocean currents and waves. We begin by
   identifying what nature offers. For wind and solar, we use
   specifications from existing, commercially available devices to convert
   nature's bounty to power-generation estimates. In the absence of mature,
   commercially available devices for ocean currents and waves, we draw
   upon physical principles to arrive at power-generation estimates for
   these potential sources. On the basis of what nature offers and what
   machinery may be capable of producing, we then make reasonable
   extra-polations on what these estimations may mean in a practical sense
   for supplying energy to society. Power generation from these naturally
   occurring, alternative energy sources, particularly wind and solar, may
   provide a means for supplementing power generation by conventional fuels
   but does not provide a replacement for conventional fuels.},

Title = {Assessing the dynamics of land cover and shoreline changes of Nijhum
   Dwip (Island) of Bangladesh using remote sensing and GIS techniques},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Land cover alteration is an important driver of ongoing global
   environmental change. Developing countries with a fast-growing
   population have not been able to control a sustainable land-use
   transition that simultaneously increases both forest cover and
   agricultural production. Coastal regions of these countries are
   vulnerable to natural hazards. The present study aims to detect the land
   cover changes with shoreline shifting in Nijhum Dwip of Bangladesh. A
   supervised classification method is used for the Landsat images of 1998,
   2008 and 2018 based on eight significant land covers. A field survey
   also facilitates the locational accuracy of the classification.
   According to the study, about 285 hectares of mangrove forest has
   disappeared between 1998 to 2018. Agricultural lands reduce to 14.89\%
   from 23.13\%, whereas settlement cover has increased rapidly from 3.73\%
   to 11.93\%. About 1153 hectares of land area is added, as accretion rate
   is higher than erosion. Water cover climbed to 7.04\% from 0.69\%
   because of sea level rise. Shoreline is expanding towards north-western
   and south-eastern direction. The major causes of such changes are
   population pressure, expansion of settlement area, and sea level rise.
   The findings of the study will help the policy makers to formulate
   planning for sustainable coastal management in coastal region of
   Bangladesh. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {This paper presents a trigeneration facility based on a biogas driven
   gas turbine cycle for electricity production and an air to water heat
   pump for simultaneous extraction of cooling and potable water, and
   evaluates its robustness and effectiveness under different climatic
   conditions and variable demands. The air to water heat pump, which
   consists of an inside evaporator fan, expansion device, condenser,
   evaporator, and a compressor, is installed for supplying the cooling
   load of a hospital building in summer. In the refrigeration cycle, R134a
   absorbs heat from the inside warm air for space cooling and releases it
   to the saline water for driving a desalination process. Maximum values
   of cooling and electrical demands of a standard hospital building, where
   is located in south of Iran, over the hottest day of 2018 are considered
   for the worst case implementation. Engineering equation solver and
   general algebraic mathematical modeling system are employed to develop
   the non-linear optimization strategy, find the best operating point of
   the air to water heat pump based trigeneration plant, and minimize its
   energy cost under the greatest load level. Moreover, the sensitivity of
   the gained output ratio of desalination cycle to the relative humidity
   of the air entering and leaving the humidifier, the dehumidifier and
   humidifier effectiveness, and the top and bottom temperatures are
   comprehensively analyzed. The relative humidity of air entering the
   humidifier and the larger dehumidifier effectiveness have the
   significant effects on increasing the gained output ratio of the
   desalination cycle. Due to intense solar irradiation in summer, the
   seawater temperature naturally increases, which results in larger gained
   output ratio and higher mass flow rate of pure water.},

Title = {Brackish water desalination using reverse osmosis and capacitive
   deionization at the water-energy nexus},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {183},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {In this article, we present a critical review of the reported
   performance of reverse osmosis (RO) and capacitive deionization (CDI)
   for brackish water (salinity < 5.0 g/L) desalination from the aspects of
   engineering, energy, economy and environment. We first illustrate the
   criteria and the key performance indicators to evaluate the performance
   of brackish water desalination. We then systematically summarize
   technological information of RO and CDI, focusing on the effect of key
   parameters on desalination performance, as well as energy-water
   efficiency, economic costs and environmental impacts (including carbon
   footprint). We provide in-depth discussion on the interconnectivity
   between desalination and energy, and the trade-off between kinetics and
   energetics for RO and CDI as critical factors for comparison. We also
   critique the results of technical-economic assessment for RO and CDI
   plants in the context of large-scale deployment, with focus on
   lifetime-oriented consideration to total costs, balance between energy
   efficiency and clean water production, and pretreatment/post-treatment
   requirements. Finally, we illustrate the challenges and opportunities
   for future brackish water desalination, including hybridization for
   energy-efficient brackish water desalination, co-removal of specific
   components in brackish water, and sustainable brine management with
   innovative utilization. Our study reveals that both RO and CDI should
   play important roles in water reclamation and resource recovery from
   brackish water, especially for inland cities or rural regions. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Coastal marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by urbanization,
   land- based sources of pollution, and climate change. Changes in the
   environment due to these pressures could lead to shifts in community
   composition and dynamics. To address this issue, we sampled the fish
   assemblage of a coastal lagoon to assess species richness, rates of
   occurrence, and relative abundance. We caught 176,136 individuals
   representing 87 taxa. We compared our results to the last published
   survey of the study area conducted during the mid-1990s. Compared to
   historic data, there have been large shifts in percent occurrence in
   some economically important taxa, such as Lagodon rhomboides (Pinfish)
   increasing from 4\% to 53\% and Anchoa spp. (anchovies) increasing from
   23\% to 66\%. These findings possibly indicate changes in the fish
   assemblage, essential fish habitat, or environment over the past 2
   decades. As environmental and anthropogenic stressors continue to impact
   this complex coastal ecosystem, continued monitoring will be critical to
   detecting and understanding changes in the fish community in Mosquito
   Lagoon.},

Abstract = {Malachite, a common secondary mineral in the zone of oxidation, has
   recently become a major source of Cu due to the development of solution
   extraction-electrowinning (SXEW) technologies. Stable isotope
   characterization can contribute needed information on the formative
   mechanisms of malachite by establishing the source materials and
   temperature of Formation.
   The equilibrium O-18 and C-13 isotope fractionations between malachite
   degrees and water and between CO2 gas and malachite were determined by
   slow precipitation experiments over the temperature range 0 to 50
   degrees C:
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   where temperature (T) is in Kelvin, and where mal degrees represents the
   acid liberated CO2 corrected as total calcite oxygen. This internally
   consistent method renders the acid correction unnecessary for
   application of the mal degrees-water thermometer.
   Natural malachites have delta(18)O and delta(13)C values that are
   similar to those for caliches and speleothems. This similarity supports
   the field evidence of malachite forming caliche-like crusts and
   speleothem-like structures, and bears upon the conditions of its
   genesis. The delta(18)O values of +18 to +31 per mil standard mean ocean
   water (SMOW) for natural malachites are dominantly controlled by the
   delta(18)O values of ambient meteoric waters and the surface
   temperatures. Most malachites have delta(13)C values between 0 and -21
   per mil Peedee belemnite (PDB) reflecting a combination of
   vegetation-respired soil CO2 and carbonate rock-derived carbon. A strong
   correlation between the delta(18)O values of malachites and local modem
   meteoric waters suggests that malachites are relatively young, or
   alternatively, that they are easily exchanged. Using the mal
   degrees-water thermometer formation temperatures of 5 degrees to 35
   degrees C are estimated. These temperatures correlate reasonably well
   with the modern local air temperatures. However samples from massive
   sulfide deposits such as Broken Hill, Australia, have estimated
   temperatures as high as 58 degrees C, probably reflecting the heat
   generated by sulfide oxidation during weathering.},

Title = {Temporal trends and identification of the sources of volatile organic
   compounds in coastal seawater},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {628-641},
Abstract = {Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the marine environment are produced
   by biogenic sources (marine macroalgae, phytoplankton, sediments, etc.)
   as well from anthropogenic sources. The temporal variation of such VOCs
   was studied together with their relationship to biological,
   meteorological and physico-chemical factors. Sixty four different VOCs
   were quantified including halogenated (< LoD to 906 ng L-1), non-
   methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) (< LoD to 1539 ng L-1), mono-aromatics (<
   LoD to 4232 ng L-1), oxygenated (< LoD to 1539 ng L-1) and sulfur
   containing compounds (< LoD to 160 ng L-1). The analyses were performed
   employing solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Pigments such as
   chlorophyll a correlated with halogenated compounds (e. g. chloroform
   and dichloromethane) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) was maximal during the
   spring bloom. Multivariate statistical analyses demonstrated seasonal
   changes in the VOC signature (more mono-aromatics and alkanes in the
   winter and halocarbons in the summer). Principal component analysis
   (PCA) demonstrated that physico-chemical and meteorological factors such
   as wind speed and water temperature can influence the detection of VOCs
   in surface waters as well their productions. Partial least squares (PLS)
   modelling highlighted the importance of the microalgae signature in
   spring while macroalgae and sediments dominated at other times. Short
   term variability in concentrations and fluxes was due to such factors as
   tidal state, wind speed and seawater temperature. The atmospheric
   concentrations were significantly less than any regulatory values
   although no measurements were made in eutrophic conditions.},

Title = {Hydro-morphodynamics triggered by extreme riverine floods in a mega
   fluvial-tidal delta},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {809},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Maintaining accretion and progradation in a mega delta is crucial to its
   geomorphic stability and ecology. Extreme riverine floods can disturb
   hydro-sediment dynamics with great damage to the deltaic landscape, as
   for instance deltaic erosion. Nowadays, most mega deltas suffer from
   sediment starvation. Understanding the impact of extreme floods is a
   priority to determine the long-term fate of deltaic systems. Herein, we
   used the Delft 3D model and field data to study the hydraulics and
   morphodynamics of the 2016 extreme riverine floods in the South Passage
   (SP) of the Yangtze Delta. Results reveal that extreme floods can
   increase water levels, velocities, and bed shear stresses in an inner
   estuarine channel and mouth bar, while the flood has a weak effect in
   offshore areas. High-energy floods trigger strong tidal asymmetry and
   Euler residual currents, which intensifies downstream suspended sediment
   transport and bottom riverbed erosion. In comparison with those during
   extreme floods in 2016, net erosion after floods passed away was
   generated with seaward weakened magnitudes, the corresponding mean
   bathymetric erosion thickness was 19.97 cm, 12.71 cm and 4.62 cm in
   inner estuarine channel, mouth bar and offshore area, respectively. Even
   though the seaward deposition patches were due to lower scouring effect
   and converged sediment. Hydrodynamic increments in deeper channels were
   more significant, while shoals and deeper areas were strongly eroded
   with the lowest erosion between -5 m to -6 m isobath. These results
   further clarified the bathymetric patterns with highlights of extreme
   riverine floods that can amplify the sediment-insufficient risks in such
   mega fluvial-tidal delta.},

Title = {PAHs and n-alkanes in Mediterranean coastal marine sediments:
   aquaculture as a significant point source},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {958-963},
Abstract = {The occurrence of polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons in fish
   feed, sediment trap material and marine sediments was examined at two
   fish farms in the eastern Mediterranean. The average (min-max)
   concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fish feed
   and particulate effluents were 316 (287-351) ng g(-1) DW and 487
   (475-499) ng g(-1) DW, respectively. Lower PAH levels were determined in
   the underlying marine sediments. In the surface sediments under the
   farms (0 m distance from the edge of the cages) and in the immediate
   vicinity, the concentration levels of n-alkanes and PAHs were
   significantly higher than in the surrounding sediments in both sites.
   PAHs and n-alkanes individual component profiles of fish feed and
   sinking material were similar with the corresponding profiles of the
   sediment samples collected in the immediate vicinity around the cages.
   On a daily basis, the average PAH sedimentation fluxes under the cages
   was 24.4 mu g m(-2) d(-1), which is considerably higher compared with
   the observed PAH sedimentary fluxes in the open eastern Mediterranean.
   Our results imply that fish farming is a significant source of these
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the marine environment and
   therefore a likely change in the scale of production might introduce new
   sources of environmental risk. Further work is required in order to
   develop an appropriate monitoring system for the sustainable development
   of the aquaculture sector.},

Title = {Origin of Light Noble Gases (He, Ne, and Ar) on Earth: A Review},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {We review the different scenarios for the origin of light noble gases
   (He, Ne, and Ar) on Earth. Several sources could have contributed to the
   Earth's noble gas budget: implanted solar wind, solar nebula gas,
   chondrites, and comets. Although there is evidence for solar-like neon
   in the Earth's mantle, questions remain as to its origin. A new
   compilation of noble gas data in lunar soils, interplanetary dust
   particles, micrometeorites, and solar wind allows examination of the
   implanted solar wind composition, which is key to understanding the
   solar-like mantle neon isotope composition. We show that lunar soils
   that reflect this solar-wind-implanted signature have a Ne-20/Ne-22
   ratio very close to that of ocean island basalts. New data and
   calculations illustrate that the measured plume source Ne-20/Ne-22 ratio
   is close to the primitive mantle ratio, when taking into account mixing
   with the upper mantle (that has lower Ne-20/Ne-22 ratio). This favors
   early solar wind implantation to account for the origin of light
   volatiles (He, Ne, and possibly H) in the Earth's mantle: they were
   incorporated by solar wind irradiation into the Earth's precursor grains
   during the first few Myr of the solar system's formation. These grains
   must have partially survived accretion processes (only a few percent are
   needed to satisfy the Earth's budget of light volatiles). As for the
   atmosphere, the neon isotope composition can be explained by mixing 36\%
   of mantle gases having this solar-wind-implanted signature and 64\% of
   chondritic gases delivered in a late veneer phase.},

Abstract = {The GKL September 2019 workshop on circular economy of plastics in
   agriculture presented data on the current use of mulch films, fleeces,
   foils and hail nets on ca. 16,000 ha of fruit cultivation and 40,000 ha
   of vegetables in Germany with the following breakdown 1) This is
   equivalent to 22\% of the fruit and 29\% of the vegetable acreage in
   Germany. 2) The annual compost usage of 4.07 mil tons in agriculture and
   horticulture in Germany includes 817t micro plastic. 3) Based on a 14\%
   share, this is equivalent to ca. 61t microplastics per year for the
   200,000 ha of fruit, nursery and vegetables grown in Germany. 4) The
   un-informed consumer carries a heavy burden, as the plastic in municipal
   compost largely originates from his disposed (black) plastic flower pots
   and carrier shopping bags used to collect organic household bio-waste.
   5) A voluntary plastic collection system called `ERDE' was set up in
   Germany by European Plastic manufacturers to collect any plastic waste
   from agriculture and horticulture for recycling into granules, thereby
   avoiding plastic waste in the countryside or sea. Detailed values of
   plastic degradation in agriculture and horticulture into microplastics
   await ongoing studies.},

Title = {Effect of nutrient availability on carbon and nitrogen incorporation and

Abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen uptake in a microbial community comprising bacteria
   and microalgae in a sandy marine sediment under nutrient-limited and
   -replete conditions was studied using a mesocosm approach. After 2 wk of
   incubation, a pulse of (HCO3-)-C-13 and (NH4+)-N-15 was added to the
   mesocosms, and subsequent uptake of C-13 and N-15 by bacteria and
   microphytobenthos (MPB) was traced by analysis of C-13 and N-15
   incorporation into hydrolysable amino acids, including the bacterial
   biomarker D-alanine. The results confirm that MPB communities are
   capable of sustained high rates of photosynthesis despite nutrient
   limitation. Under these conditions cellular growth stops (as defined by
   the synthesis of chlorophyll a and amino acids) and the carbon fixed
   under such conditions consists predominantly of carbohydrates produced
   through `overflow metabolism'. In the treatment with nutrient addition,
   algal growth was stimulated and label incorporation was more balanced,
   with carbohydrates accounting for a much smaller fraction of newly fixed
   organic carbon. There was close agreement between net C fixation based
   on O-2 fluxes and the increase of particulate organic carbon in the
   sediment under bath nutrient-limited and -replete conditions. This
   finding suggests that very little fixed C was lost to the water column
   as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), consistent with direct measurements
   of DOC release using. There was a significant and rapid transfer of C-13
   from the MPB to bacterial biomass in both treatments within 24 h of
   label addition, revealing that fixed carbon excreted by MPB was rapidly
   utilised by bacteria. In both treatments, bacteria incorporated a
   significant fraction of N-15 from (NH4+)-N-15, with the greatest
   incorporation being observed under nutrient limited conditions.},

   Hydraulic Engineering in Terms of Four Continua},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Hydraulic engineering infrastructures, such as reservoirs, dikes,
   breakwaters, and inlet closures, have significantly impacted ecosystem
   functioning over the last two centuries. Currently, nature-based
   solutions are receiving increasing attention in hydraulic engineering
   projects and research programs. However, there is a lack of reflection
   on the concomitant, fundamental changes occurring in the field of
   hydraulic engineering, and coastal engineering in particular, and what
   this could mean for sustainability. In this article, we signal the shift
   from conventional to ecosystem-based hydraulic engineering design and
   characterize this in terms of four continua: (i) the degree of inclusion
   of ecological knowledge, (ii) the extent to which the full
   infrastructural lifecycle is addressed, (iii) the complexity of the
   actor arena taken into account, and (iv) the resulting form of the
   infrastructural artefact. We support our arguments with two carefully
   selected, iconic examples from the Netherlands and indicate how the
   stretching ideals of ecosystem-based engineering could engender further
   shifts towards sustainability.},

Abstract = {Ocean colour data are crucial for monitoring and assessing marine
   ecosystems. In this study, the Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal
   Functions (DINEOF) approach was applied to the Ocean Colour Climate
   Change Initiative (OC-CCI), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Secchi disk depth
   (Zsd) to completely reconstruct the missing pixels in the Bohai Sea
   during 1997-2019. The results of cross-validation demonstrate that the
   DINEOF reconstructed data have a good agreement with the
   satellite-measured data. Based on monthly cloud-free satellite data
   reconstructions, the Zsd series showed high negative correlation with
   log10 (Chl-a). The Zsd as a function of log10 (Chl-a) can be well fitted
   by the cubic polynomial in the offshore waters. The Chl-a in the entire
   Bohai Sea showed a significant decreasing trend (-0.013 mg/m(3)/year),
   while the Zsd exhibited a significant increasing trend (0.0065 m/year),
   and both had regional-seasonal variations. In addition, the ensemble
   empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) results reveal highly nonlinear
   trends of Chl-a and Zsd. The linear and nonlinear trends of Chl-a and
   Zsd suggest the deterioration of water quality in the Bohai Sea was not
   continued over the past two decades. This study presents the first
   simultaneous investigation of Chl-a and Zsd using the 23 years of
   cloud-free reconstructions in the Bohai Sea.},

Title = {3D spatial conservation prioritisation: Accounting for depth in marine
   environments},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {While marine environments are three-dimensional (3D) in nature, current
   approaches and tools for planning and prioritising actions in the ocean
   are predominantly two dimensional. Here, we develop a novel 3D marine
   spatial conservation prioritisation approach, which explicitly accounts
   for the inherent vertical heterogeneity of the ocean. This enables both
   vertical and horizontal spatial prioritisation to be performed
   simultaneously. To our knowledge, this is the first endeavour to develop
   prioritisation of conservation actions in 3D. We applied the 3D spatial
   conservation prioritisation approach to the Mediterranean Sea as a case
   study. We first subdivided the Mediterranean Sea into 3D planning units
   by assigning them a z coordinate (representing depth). We further
   partitioned these 3D planning units vertically into three depth layers;
   this allowed us to quantify biodiversity (1,011 species and 19
   geomorphic features) and the cost of conservation actions at different
   depths. We adapted the prioritisation software Marxan to identify 3D
   networks of sites where biodiversity conservation targets are achieved
   for the minimum cost. Using the 3D approach presented here, we
   identified networks of sites where conservation targets for all
   biodiversity features were achieved. Importantly, these networks
   included areas of the ocean where only particular depth layers along the
   water column were identified as priorities for conservation. The 3D
   approach also proved to be more cost-efficient than the traditional 2D
   approach. Spatial priorities within the networks of sites selected were
   considerably different when comparing the 2D and 3D approaches.
   Prioritising in 3D allows conservation and marine spatial planners to
   target specific threats to specific conservation features, at specific
   depths in the ocean. This provides a platform to further integrate
   systematic conservation planning into the wider ongoing and future
   marine spatial planning and ocean zoning processes.},

   weight (BWf) of S. hasta fed at 10\% RL was higher than the other
   treatments. In addition, A. latus fed at 6\% and 8\% RL showed full CG
   regarding BWf compared with fish fed at 10\% RL. The findings of this

Title = {The elemental stoichiometry (C, Si, N, P) of the Hebrides Shelf and its
   role in carbon export},

Abstract = {A detailed analysis of the internal stoichiometry of a temperate
   latitude shelf sea system is presented which reveals strong vertical and
   horizontal gradients in dissolved nutrient and particulate
   concentrations and in the elemental stoichiometry of those pools. Such
   gradients have implications for carbon and nutrient export from coastal
   waters to the open ocean. The mixed layer inorganic nutrient
   stoichiometry shifted from balanced N:P in winter, to elevated N:P in
   spring and to depleted N:P in summer, relative to the Redfield ratio.
   This pattern suggests increased likelihood of P limitation of fast
   growing phytoplankton species in spring and of N limitation of slower
   growing species in summer. However, as only silicate concentrations were
   below potentially limiting concentrations during summer and autumn the
   stoichiometric shifts in inorganic nutrient N:P are considered due to
   phytoplankton nutrient preference patterns rather than nutrient
   exhaustion. Elevated particulate stoichiometries corroborate
   non-Redfield optima underlying organic matter synthesis and nutrient
   uptake. Seasonal variation in the stoichiometry of the inorganic and
   organic nutrient pools has the potential to influence the efficiency of
   nutrient export. In summer, when organic nutrient concentrations were at
   their highest and inorganic nutrient concentrations were at their
   lowest, the organic nutrient pool was comparatively C poor whilst the
   inorganic nutrient pool was comparatively C rich. The cross-shelf export
   of these pools at this time would be associated with different
   efficiencies regardless of the total magnitude of exchange. In autumn
   the elemental stoichiometries increased with depth in all pools
   revealing widespread carbon enrichment of shelf bottom waters with P
   more intensely recycled than N, N more intensely recycled than C, and Si
   weakly remineralized relative to C. Offshelf carbon fluxes were most
   efficient via the inorganic nutrient pool, intermediate for the organic
   nutrient pool and least efficient for the particulate pool. N loss from
   the shelf however was most efficient via the dissolved organic nutrient
   pool. Mass balance calculations suggest that 28\% of PO43-, 34\% of
   NO3- and 73\% of Si drawdown from the mixed layer fails to reappear in
   the benthic water column thereby indicating the proportion of the
   nutrient pools that must be resupplied from the ocean each year to
   maintain shelf wide productivity. Loss to the neighbouring ocean, the
   sediments, transference to the dissolved organic nutrient pool and
   higher trophic levels are considered the most likely fate for these
   missing nutrients.},

Abstract = {This study investigates changes in precipitation regimes in Tuscany
   (central Italy) over the 1955-2013 period, by using the precipitation
   concentration index (PCI) and rainfall amount. The PCI is a
   dimensionless indicator of the temporal concentration of the
   precipitation. Different statistical methods were applied over the whole
   period and two independent sub-periods (1955-1984 and 1985-2013). A
   p-value <0.05 was chosen as level of significance for all the
   statistical tests. Main results, coming from 35 weather stations, did
   not show statistically significant trends of the PCI on annual basis and
   during winter. In spring and summer statistically significant increases
   were found, respectively, in two stations in northern Apennine
   (+1.6/50years) and in four stations in central southern inner areas
   (+2.3/50years). In autumn one station in northern Apennine showed a
   significant decrease (-1.9/50years). Sub-periods analysis mainly showed
   higher values of PCI in the recent sub-period on annual scale
   (statistically significant along the coast), in spring (significant in
   northwest and northern Apennine), in summer (significant in central
   southern inner areas) and during winter (not significant). Considering
   the year-to-year variability of the annual PCI, statistically
   significant increasing trends were found in the northern part of
   Tuscany, while decreasing tendencies were observed in the southern one.
   Concerning annual rainfall, six stations showed statistically
   significant decreases (-19\%/50years). On monthly basis, two stations
   exhibited significant decreasing trends in March and two in December
   (respectively -48\% and -37\%/50years). Two significant decreases were
   observed in both June and July (respectively -53\% and -63\%/50years).
   One station in northern coast showed instead a significant increase in
   September (+72\%/50years). This investigation represents a further tile
   in the larger mosaic of analysis of climate change and its different
   impact on precipitation regime at regional level and supports studies
   concerning water management in the areas characterized by strong
   seasonality.},

Title = {Ecosystem Services Assessment Tools for Regenerative Urban Design in
   Oceania},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Tools that spatially model ecosystem services offer opportunities to
   integrate ecology into regenerative urban design. However, few of these
   tools are designed for assessing ecosystem services in cities, meaning
   their application by designers is potentially limited. This research
   reviews and compares a range of ecosystem services assessment tools to
   find those that are most suited for the urban context of Oceania. The
   tool classification includes considerations of type of input and output
   data, time commitment, and necessary skills required. The strengths and
   limitations of the most relevant tools are further discussed alongside
   illustrative case studies, some collected from literature and one
   conducted as part of this research in Wellington, Aotearoa using the
   Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator (LUCI) tool. A major finding
   of the research is that from the 95 tools reviewed, only four are judged
   to be potentially relevant for urban design projects. These are
   modelling tools that allow spatially explicit visualisation of
   biophysical quantification of ecosystem services. The ecosystem services
   assessed vary among tools and the outputs' reliability is often highly
   influenced by the user's technical expertise. The provided
   recommendations support urban designers and architects to choose the
   tool that best suits their regenerative design project requirements.},

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {To better understand the possible consequences of climate change on reef
   building scleractinian corals in a marginal environment, laboratory
   experiments were conducted to examine the interactive effects of changes
   in salinity and temperature on percent fertilization success and early
   embryonic development of the coral Platygyra acuta. In the present
   study, a salinity of 24 psu (ambient 32 psu) reduced fertilization
   success by 60 \%. Normal embryonic development was reduced by > 80 \% at
   26 psu (ambient 33 psu) with 100 \% abnormal development at 22 psu under
   ambient temperature. Elevated temperature (+3 A degrees C) above the
   ambient spawning temperature did not show any negative effects on
   fertilization success. However, there was a trend for more abnormal
   embryos to develop at elevated temperature in the 2 d of the spawning
   event. The interactive effects between salinity and temperature are
   statistically significant only on normal embryonic development of P.
   acuta, but not on its fertilization success. Salinity was revealed to be
   the main factor affecting both fertilization success and normal
   embryonic development. Interestingly, the much lower fertilization
   success (76 \%) observed in the second day of spawning (Trial 2) under
   ambient temperature recovered to 99 \% success under elevated (+3 A
   degrees C) temperature conditions. Moreover, elevated temperature
   enhanced normal early embryonic development under lowered salinity (26
   psu). This antagonistic interactive effect was consistently observed in
   two successive nights of spawning. Overall, our results indicate that,
   in terms of its fertilization success and embryonic development, P.
   acuta is the most tolerant coral species to reduced salinity thus far
   reported in the literature. Elevated temperature, at least that within
   the tolerable range of the corals, could apparently alleviate the
   potential negative effects from salinity stresses. This mitigating role
   of elevated temperature appears not to have been reported on corals
   before.},

Abstract = {Hydrogen fuel has attracted significant attention as an alternative
   clean energy for hydrogen vehicles and household fuel systems and has
   been expected to be pervasive. Thus, compact, low-power, and highly
   sensitive hydrogen sensors capable of being embedded in
   Internet-of-Things devices are in demand. In this work, an ultrahigh
   sensitive hydrogen sensor operating at room temperature based on the
   Pt-decorated graphene (Pt/Gr) gate AlGaN/GaN
   metal-insulator-semiconductor high electron mobility transistor
   (MIS-HEMT) is presented. The proposed unique gate structure of
   island-like Pt on graphene not only modulates the density of 2-D
   electron gas (2DEG) but also provides efficient diffusion of hydrogen
   ions into the gate even at very low concentrations (<1 ppm) of hydrogen.
   The fabricated Pt/Gr gate AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMT hydro en sensor shows a
   remarkably high response of similar to 1.6 x 10(7) in a hydrogen
   concentration of 1000 ppm at room temperature. Upon exposure of at most
   1 ppm hydrogen gas, the current increases significantly by a factor of
   15.4, exhibiting an unprecedentedly high hydrogen response. Furthermore,
   the proposed AlGaN HEMT architecture has an outstanding hydrogen
   selectivity and insensitivity to NH3, H2S, and CO gases at the same
   time.},

Title = {The ecology and evolution of the monito del monte, a relict species from
   the southern South America temperate forests},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The arboreal marsupial monito del monte (genus Dromiciops, with two
   recognized species) is a paradigmatic mammal. It is the sole living
   representative of the order Microbiotheria, the ancestor lineage of
   Australian marsupials. Also, this marsupial is the unique frugivorous
   mammal in the temperate rainforest, being the main seed disperser of
   several endemic plants of this ecosystem, thus acting as keystone
   species. Dromiciops is also one of the few hibernating mammals in South
   America, spending half of the year in a physiological dormancy where
   metabolism is reduced to 10\% of normal levels. This capacity to reduce
   energy expenditure in winter contrasts with the enormous energy turnover
   rate they experience in spring and summer. The unique life history
   strategies of this living Microbiotheria, characterized by an
   alternation of life in the slow and fast lanes, putatively represent
   ancestral traits that permitted these cold-adapted mammals to survive in
   this environment. Here, we describe the ecological role of this
   emblematic marsupial, summarizing the ecophysiology of hibernation and
   sociality, updated phylogeographic relationships, reproductive cycle,
   trophic relationships, mutualisms, conservation, and threats. This
   marsupial shows high densities, despite presenting slow reproductive
   rates, a paradox explained by the unique characteristics of its
   three-dimensional habitat. We finally suggest immediate actions to
   protect these species that may be threatened in the near future due to
   habitat destruction and climate change.},

Title = {Key parameters of the sediment surface morphodynamics in an estuary - An
   assessment of model solutions},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {308},
Pages = {142-160},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Large-scale geomorphological evolution of an estuarine system was
   simulated by means of a hybrid estuarine sedimentation model (HESM)
   applied to the Guadiana Estuary, in Southwest Iberia. The model
   simulates the decadalscale morphodynamics of the system under
   environmental forcing, using a set of analytical solutions to simplified
   equations of tidal wave propagation in shallow waters, constrained by
   empirical knowledge of estuarine sedimentary dynamics and topography.
   The key controlling parameters of the model are bed friction (f),
   current velocity power of the erosion rate function (N), and sea-level
   rise rate. An assessment of sensitivity of the simulated sediment
   surface elevation (SSE) change to these controlling parameters was
   performed. The model predicted the spatial differentiation of accretion
   and erosion, the latter especially marked in the mudflats within mean
   sea level and low tide level and accretion was mainly in a subtidal
   channel. The average SSE change mutually depended on both the friction
   coefficient and power of the current velocity. Analysis of the average
   annual SSE change suggests that the state of intertidal and subtidal
   compartments of the estuarine system vary differently according to the
   dominant processes (erosion and accretion). As the Guadiana estuarine
   system shows dominant erosional behaviour in the context of sea-level
   rise and sediment supply reduction after the dosure of the Alqueva Dam,
   the most plausible sets of parameter values for the Guadiana Estuary are
   N = 1.8 and f = 0.8f(0), or N = 2 and f = f(0), where fo is the
   empirically estimated value. For these sets of parameter values, the
   relative errors in SSE change did not exceed 20\% in 73\% of simulation
   cells in the studied area. Such a limit of accuracy can be acceptable
   for an idealized modelling of coastal evolution in response to uncertain
   sea-level rise scenarios in the context of reduced sediment supply due
   to flow regulation. Therefore, the idealized but cost-effective HESM
   model will be suitable for estimating the morphological impacts of
   sea-level rise on estuarine systems on a decadal timescale. (C) 2018

Title = {Economical Darrieus straight bladed vertical axis wind turbine for

Abstract = {In remote and stand alone applications, the simple straight bladed
   Darrieus type vertical axis wind turbine is very practical due to its
   simple design and low cost of construction. It has the potential to
   compete effectively with the more widely used horizontal axis wind
   turbines. This project explores a Darrieus type vertical axis wind
   turbine, adapted for domestic electricity generation. Design,
   construction and modelling of a three-blade vertical axis wind turbine
   with 305 cm long blades, 55 cm chord length, which formed a symmetrical
   airfoil of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA 0018)
   profile, was performed in this study to demonstrate how used materials
   can be recycled to produce an economically feasible Darrieus type
   vertical axis wind turbine that can be utilised to produce usable
   electrical power. The double multiple streamtube model was used to
   reproduce this turbine. Materials used were chosen for practicality,
   availability within the southern Caribbean islands of Trinidad and
   Tobago, in addition to their low cost. From the performance modelling
   and performance characteristics of the automotive alternator, it was
   observed from initial testing data that wind speeds of 3-5 m s(-1)
   produced wind power up to 5400 W. The cost per watt of power generated
   was the lowest for this wind turbine (\$0.54 W-1) when compared to other
   VAWT and can even compete on cost effectiveness with traditional
   horizontal axis wind turbines.},

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Gamma ray (GR) fluctuations and potassium (K) values from downhole
   logging data obtained in the sediments of Lake Ohrid from 0 to 240 m
   below lake floor (b.l.f). correlate with fluctuations in delta O-18
   values from the global benthic isotope stack LR04 (Lisiecki and Raymo,
   2005). GR and K values are considered a reliable proxy to depict
   glacial-interglacial cycles, with high clastic input during cold and/or
   drier periods and high carbonate precipitation during warm and/or humid
   periods at Lake Ohrid. Spectral analysis was applied to investigate the
   climate signal and evolution over the length of the borehole. Linking
   downhole logging data with orbital cycles was used to estimate
   sedimentation rates and the effect of compaction was compensated for.
   Sedimentation rates increase on average by 14 \% after decompaction of
   the sediment layers and the mean sedimentation rates shift from 45 cm
   kyr(-1) between 0 and 110 m to 30 cm kyr(-1) from 110 to 240 m b.l.f.
   Tuning of minima and maxima of gamma ray and potassium values versus
   LR04 extrema, in combination with eight independent
   tephrostratigraphical tie points, allows establishing of a robust age
   model for the downhole logging data over the past 630 kyr.},

Title = {Techno-economic assessment of reversible Solid Oxide Cell integration to
   renewable energy systems at building and district scale},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {235},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Hydrogen is assuming a crescent role in the decarbonising initiatives.
   Moreover, hydrogen can supply the 3 most energy intense sectors, i.e.
   transport, heat and electricity, allowing the sector coupling. To do so,
   a production unit, the electrolyser, and a consumer one, the fuel cell,
   are needed. Actually, reversible Solid Oxide Cell technology presents
   the possibility to install only one device acting bi-directionally. It
   offers different advantages thank to its (i) compact design, thus
   ensuring space and cost savings; (ii) ability to meet thermal and
   electric demand, thus reducing emissions in both those sectors; (iii)
   possibility to store, the electricity excess coming from renewable
   sources in form of hydrogen, ensuring an unlimited and seasonal storage
   possibility. In this study, the deployment of a real reversible Solid
   Oxide Cell was simulated in different scenarios considering the data
   recorded in one year in the island of Procida, Italy. Up to date, the
   use of this technology was mostly relegated to the industrial sector or
   to prototype tests. While, this research aimed to analyse the
   functioning of near commercialization technology in civil environments
   such as hotels, offices and hospitals to understand its feasibility in
   this new context. It wants to be proved that advantages of this emerging
   technology can be exploited as well in the civil environment. Three
   economic indicators, i.e. Payback Period, Internal Return Rate and Net
   Present Value were selected to evaluate the simulated scenarios, while,
   the primary energy saving, the emission reduction and its storage
   efficacy were studied to evaluate the environmental achievements. To
   perform the simulations, the MATLAB model ConfigDym built by Sylfen was
   used. Finally, a sensitivity analysis in terms of economics was carried
   out. The results show an important decrease in emissions and an energy
   selfsufficiency increase of at least 29\% and 58\% respectively,
   differently the economic analysis returns a payback period currently
   near to its lifetime, while for the future a three years period is
   reachable.},

Abstract = {The 1998 global coral bleaching event was the largest recorded
   historical disturbance of coral reefs and resulted in extensive habitat
   loss. Annual censuses of reef fish community structure over a 12-year
   period spanning the bleaching event revealed a marked phase shift from a
   prebleach to postbleach assemblage. Surprisingly, we found that the
   bleaching event had no detectable effect on the abundance, diversity or
   species richness of a local cryptobenthic reef fish community.
   Furthermore, there is no evidence of regeneration even after 5-35
   generations of these short-lived species. These results have significant
   implications for our understanding of the response of coral reef
   ecosystems to global warming and highlight the importance of selecting
   appropriate criteria for evaluating reef resilience.},

Title = {Estimating Production Metric for Ship Assembly Based on Geometric and
   Production Information of Ship Block Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To secure technological competitiveness in shipbuilding and offshore
   industries, the continuous application and development of various
   technologies is essential. Efficient scheduling in shipyards is an
   important management task, whereby materials and manpower are allocated
   at the appropriate time and to the correct workspace. Although some
   large shipyards ensure effective scheduling and production management
   through simulations employing advanced technologies, most shipbuilding
   industries, including small- and medium-sized shipyards, continue to use
   an index based on past experiences. However, this legacy index, termed
   the basic unit, involves poor engineering logic; therefore, it does not
   appropriately reflect a shipyard's working environment, which changes
   rapidly in response to technological developments. Although this has led
   to a demand for improvements in the basic unit, a clear solution has not
   been presented thus far. In this study, a method for calculating the
   man-hours required for assembly, which is the basis for preparing the
   basic unit, is proposed. First, the assembly process is analyzed, and
   individual activities involved in the assembly process are quantified
   and formulated into working hours, which is defined as a production
   metric. Based on a ship's computerized block model, the geometric
   properties and production information required for calculating the
   metric are generated automatically as far as possible; this is to
   establish a convenient production metric calculation system. The
   proposed method features complete applicability in new shipyards through
   a customization. It also serves as a tool for predicting the metric of

Title = {Second-order wave maker theory using force-feedback control. Part I: A
   new theory for regular wave generation},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Second-order wave maker theory has long been established; the most
   extensive and detailed approach given by Scaffer {[}1996. Second-order
   wave maker theory for irregular waves. Ocean Engineering 23, 47-88].
   However, all existing theories assume the wave paddle is driven by a
   position-feedback motion controller. Early research in the wave power
   field led to the design of a force-controlled absorbing wave machine
   {[}Salter, S., 1982. Absorbing wave-makers and wide tanks. In:
   Directional Wave Spectra Applications, pp. 185-200]. In addition to
   operating as an excellent absorber, this machine seemed to introduce
   very little Spurious harmonic content when driven with a first-order
   command signal. The present paper provides a mathematical model for the
   operation of wave makers using force-feedback control and seeks to
   explain this apparent advantage. The model is developed to second-order
   so that a command signal compensating for the remaining spurious wave is
   also provided. Due to the complexity of the problem, the model has been
   limited to flap-type wave machines and the generation of regular waves.
   A variety of numerical tests in force-control mode have been conducted,
   indicating that the spurious wave content is greatly reduced when
   compared to the position-control mode. A separate experimental study
   validating the theory is presented in a part 11 paper by the same
   authors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Land Use Datasets},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Potential analyses identify possible locations for renewable energy
   installations, such as wind turbines and photovoltaic arrays. The
   results of previous potential studies for Germany, however, are not
   consistent due to different assumptions, methods, and datasets being
   used. For example, different land-use datasets are applied in the
   literature to identify suitable areas for technologies requiring open
   land. For the first time, commonly used datasets are compared regarding
   the area and position of identified features to analyze their impact on
   potential analyses. It is shown that the use of Corine Land Cover is not
   recommended as it leads to potential area overestimation in a typical
   wind potential analyses by a factor of 4.7 and 5.2 in comparison to
   Basis-DLM and Open Street Map, respectively. Furthermore, we develop
   scenarios for onshore wind, offshore wind, and open-field photovoltaic
   potential estimations based on land-eligibility analyses using the
   land-use datasets that were proven to be best by our pre-analysis.
   Moreover, we calculate the rooftop photovoltaic potential using 3D
   building data nationwide for the first time. The potentials have a high
   sensitivity towards exclusion conditions, which are also currently
   discussed in public. For example, if restrictive exclusions are chosen
   for the onshore wind analysis the necessary potential for climate
   neutrality cannot be met. The potential capacities and possible
   locations are published for all administrative levels in Germany in the
   freely accessible database (Tool for Renewable Energy
   Potentials-Database), for example, to be incorporated into energy system
   models.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {The paper presents preliminary results of monitoring the population of
   the bivalve Chamelea gallina, which is the main source of biogenic
   carbonates for the Anapa bay bar beaches (the Black Sea). It is shown
   that by 2017, the biomass of the clams decreased more than twice
   compared to 2010, but began to increase in 2018. The average sizes of C.
   gallina are clearly divided in terms ``year{''} - ``section{''} -
   ``age{''}. At the same time, interannual variations of the average size
   are very strong in all age groups. The average shell length of C.
   gallina significantly increased in 2018 compared to 2016, and especially
   - to 2017. This may be caused by the population decline of the predator
   Rapana venosa feeding on clams. Geographic differences in the shell
   length between sections are not directly related to the distribution of
   biogenic elements (nitrogen and phosphorus). The differences in
   longevity and shell size between C. gallina from the Anapa region and
   distant populations from the other parts of the distribution area are
   likely related to its significant negative correlation with the growth
   rate, which in turn negatively correlates with latitude. (C) 2019

Title = {Regional climate and patterns of phytoplankton annual succession in the
   Cheekier open waters of the Black Sea},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {44-57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The annual succession of phytoplankton of the open waters of the Black
   Sea was investigated on the basis of a database covering the 30-year
   period from 1985 to 2014. Seasonal variations of the taxonomic
   composition were analysed with regard to weather conditions and the
   physical and chemical properties of the environment. Two different
   patterns of annual phytoplankton succession were revealed for the
   post-winter period from March to November. After cold winters a
   classical annual succession of diatoms -> dinoflagellates ->
   coccolithophores -> dinoflagellates -> diatoms was observed, whereas
   after regular winters another type of succession; dinoflagellates ->
   dinoflagellates -> coccolithophores -> diatoms -> diatoms, took place.
   These two successions corresponded to seasonal dynamics of nitrate
   concentration and its share in the total inorganic nitrogen. During cold
   years these parameters decreased from spring to summer with a subsequent
   increase in autumn, whereas in regular years they were unusually high in
   summer. The enigma of this summer nitrate enrichment is well explained
   by the hypothesis of increasing cross-shelf nutrient transport. During
   regular years, weak hydrodynamic forcing occurs throughout the year,
   resulting in a large number of mesoscale eddies along the shelf in
   summer-autumn that in turn cause the intense transport of coastal waters
   rich in nitrate to the Sea interior. Development of the large-celled
   diatom Pseudosolenia calcar-avis in the sea basin observed in summer is
   in line with this hypothesis. This mechanism was also confirmed by
   positive relationships between the high sea-surface temperature, and the
   low Ekman pumping velocity and mean kinetic energy of currents in winter
   on the one hand, and the contribution of diatoms to the total
   phytoplankton biomass in summer-autumn, on the other. A case study of
   mesoscale eddies in the open waters in summer-autumn demonstrated a
   shift in species composition to large-celled diatoms inside these
   structures. Climate warming observed during the last 25 years resulted
   in a decrease in the frequency of cold winters from 30\% to 15\%, which
   has led to a decline in the annual phytoplankton standing stock. Thus,
   in the Black Sea, climate warming affects phytoplankton not directly by
   an increase in temperature, but by a decrease in the frequency of cold
   winters.},

Title = {Evaluation of a cross-border electricity interconnection: The case of
   Spain-France},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {233},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the economics of a cross-border transmission
   interconnector. The domestic spot electricity price is modelled as a
   stochastic process with mean reversion and jumps; it also includes a
   deterministic part that accounts for hourly and daily sasonalities along
   with non-working days. The two domestic spot prices are assumed to be
   correlated. As an illustration of the approach, we consider the
   particular case of the interconnector between Spain (an `electric
   island') and France. Domestic prices are first calibrated and then used
   for simulating the stochastic behavior of the price gap between the two
   countries. In addition, the actual import/export behavior as a function
   of the price gap is captured by a Tobit model fitted from observed data.
   This model is then combined with the simulated price gaps to compute a
   multiple series of hourly prices and exports/imports of electricity
   through the interconnector. Drawing on these simulations we derive the
   probability distributions of revenues and expenses from exports and
   imports, and also some risk measures. According to our results, the
   economics of this interconector depends on different domestic
   seasonalities (hourly and daily), the growing trend of the price gap and
   some stochastic idiosyncrasies. They call for an expanded link. (c) 2021

Abstract = {Due to the randomness and volatility of light intensity and wind speed,
   renewable generation and load management are facing new challenges. This
   paper proposes a novel energy management strategy to extend the life
   cycle of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) based on the state of
   charge (SOC) and reduce the total operating cost of the islanded
   microgrid (MG). In this paper, a demand response (DR) optimization model
   of independent MG is introduced considering the total cost of MG
   operation, carbon emission and new energy consumption penalty.
   Meanwhile, by analyzing the SOC of the HESS, starting and stopping
   criteria (SSC) of diesel generator (DG), residential load
   classification, an optimal energy management strategy for island grid
   operation of HESS based on DR is proposed. Then, the particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm with improved acceleration factor is
   applied to solve the optimization scheme. The simulation results show
   that a novel energy management strategy has improved the economical and
   reliable performance of the independent MG via setting the charging and
   discharging criteria of HESS and SSC of DG. Moreover, flexible
   scheduling of part controllable loads can be used to improve the
   renewable energy consumption rate and reduce the loss of load rate.},

Title = {Modeling Salt Panne Land-Cover Suitability under Sea-Level Rise},

Abstract = {Salt pannes are an ecologically important but poorly understood feature
   of the salt marsh environments. Like all coastal marshes, salt pannes
   are threatened by sea-level rise; therefore, it is important to assess
   how they will be affected by rising seas. Because of a lack of
   understanding regarding salt panne formation and the possibly stochastic
   nature of their development, a traditional and purely deterministic
   modeling approach is unsuitable for assessing the impacts of sea level
   rise on salt pannes. This research used a combination of deterministic
   and stochastic models to simulate the land cover suitability for salt
   pannes in the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve,
   Mississippi, under five sea-level rise scenarios, including a rise of
   0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m by 2100. The Sea-Level Affecting Marshes
   Model (SLAMM) simulated general land-cover at the study site. However,
   SLAMM does not include capabilities for specifically simulating salt
   panne land-cover. As such, MaxEnt used the results from SLAMM, along
   with other environmental variables, to specifically simulate the spatial
   suitability for salt panne land-cover. The results showed that the total
   wetland and upland areas are predicted to consistently decrease under
   increasing rates of sea-level rise. However, because of elevation
   plateaus in the study site, the area of land-cover specifically suitable
   for salt pannes does not follow the same pattern. The primary
   environmental driver of salt panne land-cover suitability is elevation,
   followed by topographic depressional areas. Land cover contributes very
   little to the model results. This novel use of a land-cover suitability
   model has important potential for being applied to additional studies to
   investigate drivers of land-cover change, identify transitional areas,
   and examine land-cover fitness under competition.},

Abstract = {Beach morphology, waves, tides, and current speeds were measured in a
   moderate-energy macrotidal environment of the Amazon coast (Atalaia
   beach, Brazil). The study was based on two complementary sets of data:
   (i) hydrodynamic and topographic data collected in four 25-hour
   campaigns during equinoctial and non-equinoctial periods, and (ii)
   climatological data (wind speed and direction, and rainfall) obtained
   from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology. The results indicate that
   tidal currents run predominantly to the northwest during the flood tide
   and southeast during the ebb. The highest current speeds were recorded
   during the equinoctial period, reaching a maximum of 0.5 m/s in the
   flood tide. In March and June (rainiest months), ebb tide currents
   reached a maximum speed of 0.4 m/s. The tidal cycle was weakly
   asymmetric with the ebb tide lasting up to 6 hours and 40 minutes. High
   tides ranged from 4 in (non-equinoctial) to 5.7 in (equinoctial). Wave
   energy was modulated slightly during the low tide due to wave
   attenuation on the sandbanks, but substantial changes were not observed
   during ebb and flood tides. Modal wave height (H-b) varied from 1.1 to
   1.43 m, associated with wave periods of 5.0-7.5s, with the highest
   values being recorded in November (intense winds). This beach can be
   classified as tide-modified, presenting primarily dissipative (Omega >
   5) characteristic. Wave-dominated characteristics were observed in
   November, when H-s values were around 1.5 m and tidal elevation was
   approximately 4 in (non-equinoctial period).},

Title = {High abundance of carotanes in the brackish-saline lacustrine sediments:
   A possible cyanobacteria source?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {219},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The organic-rich oil shales of low maturity and tight oils from the
   Middle Permian Lucaogou Formation were formed in a brackish-saline
   lacustrine environment in the Jimusaer Sag, Junggar Basin. They are
   characterized by remarkably abundant beta-carotane and gamma-carotane.
   The biological sources and favourable sedimentary environments of
   carotanes formation remain obscure. Organic geochemical analyses of 17
   oil shales and 20 tight oils from the Jimusaer Sag reveal that reducing,
   evaporitic and carbonate-rich, shallow water environment is favourable
   for beta-carotane accumulation. Geochemical studies show that carotane
   abundance is controlled by both source of organic matter and sedimentary
   environment rather than thermal maturity in the study area. Even though
   both higher plants and microalgae are reported to be precursors of
   carotanes, cyanobacteria may be the main biological sources of carotanes
   in the Lucaogou Formation based on cyanobacteria-derived biomarkers,
   such as the C-39 2,6-dimethyl benzene-substituted isoprenoid, 2
   alpha-methylhopanes, 7- and 8-monomethylhepadecanes. The airborne
   volcanic ash containing ample elements (e.g. Mg and Fe) caused by the
   intermittent volcanic eruptions during the Middle Permian most likely
   contributed to the flourish of cyanobacteria in the study area.},

Title = {Erosion of Carbonate Beaches on the Northeastern Coast of Cuba},

Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {339-352},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Beaches on the northeastern coast of Cuba have made this area one of the
   most important tourist destinations in the Caribbean, despite the fact
   that many beaches are visibly eroded. In this study, the causes and
   magnitude of coastal erosion on the northeastern coast of Cuba were
   evaluated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS 4.3)
   application, satellite images, and beach profiles. Time frames between 7
   and 14 years were considered from 2003 to 2017 using satellite images
   and between 11 and 18 years using beach profiles. Results of this
   investigation showed that 56\% of northeastern coast beaches tend to
   erode at a rate of less than 1.2 m/y. An increase in the recurrence of
   extreme events (hurricanes and tropical storms) during the last 39 years
   induced more beach erosion. It was furthermore observed that El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation events enhanced the sedimentary balance of the
   beaches by returning sand volumes that were transported in a westerly
   direction to their original shoreline locations. Possibly due to
   sea-level rise, which may be occurring in response to global warming,
   beaches on the northeast coast will retreat on average about 0.17 m/y.
   At this rate of shoreline recession, by the end of the twenty-first
   century, 14\% of the beaches on this littoral will be lost, and the
   width of 27\% of the other beaches will be significantly reduced.},

Abstract = {The current experimental study describes the recovery of bitumen from
   Nigerian tar sand by the supercritical carbon dioxide method, which has
   the advantages of a substantial reduction in water consumption, an
   absence of chemicals, and an upgrading of the bitumen through the
   rejection of solids, petcokes and asphaltenes. The bitumen extraction
   from 50 g piece of tar sand was carried out at 50, 60 and 65 MPa and 110
   degrees C by pure carbon dioxide and with the addition of 10 mL of fresh
   or salty water. The recovery decreased in the following order: with
   salty water, with fresh water, pure CO2. The maximum recovery of 29.6\%
   was obtained at 50 MPa with the addition of salty water declining at
   higher pressures. The heaviest fractions were extracted by pure carbon
   dioxide at 60 and 65 MPa. The presence of bisnorhopane, a biomarker
   typical for source rocks formed in marine depositional environment, was
   detected in crude bitumen and all extracts by GC-MS TIC analysis. (C)

   series of growth and climate information present the opportunity to
   identify important climatic drivers of demography and thereby understand
   the likely impact of climate change. We constructed otolith chronologies
   (a proxy for somatic growth) to examine synchrony of growth patterns
   within and between two mesopredatory fishes (Lutjanus bohar and L.
   gibbus) in the remote Chagos Archipelago, Indian Ocean. We then used
   mixed-model and pathway analysis to relate growth responses to a suite
   of climatic and environmental factors to determine the extent to which
   variation in inter-annual growth could be predicted at individual and
   population levels. Our models explained up to half the variance
   associated with annual growth at the level of populations. Significant
   environmental drivers of growth differed between species, as did the
   spatial scale of these drivers: L. gibbus exhibited a strong
   relationship with regional ocean temperature, whereas growth of L. bohar
   was correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, suggesting
   influential teleconnections between ocean basins as an underlying
   predictor of productivity of fish populations. Our results demonstrate
   that (1) synchronous growth stemming from relationships with climate
   factors may be suppressed at very low latitudes; (2) closely related
   species may respond to very different environmental stimuli; and (3)
   within the same environment, the scale of influential drivers may be
   local in nature or reflect oceanographic processes stretching across
   entire ocean basins. We demonstrate that biochronological approaches are
   effective tools for reconstructing relationships between climate
   variability and fish growth even in tropical regions where seasonality
   is low, and these methods can be valuable for forecasting
   population-level responses to projected climate change.},

Abstract = {Fire histories were compared between the southwestern United States and
   northern Patagonia, Argentina using both documentary records (1914-87
   and 1938-96, respectively) and tree-ring reconstructions over the past
   several centuries. The two regions share similar fire-climate
   relationships and similar relationships of climatic anomalies to the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In both regions, El Nino events
   coincide with above-average cool season precipitation and increased
   moisture availability to plants during the growing season. Conversely,
   La Nina events correspond with drought conditions. Monthly patterns of
   ENSO indicators (southern oscillation indices and tropical Pacific sea
   surface temperatures) preceding years of exceptionally widespread fires
   are highly similar in both regions during the 20th century. Major fire
   years tend to follow the switching from El Nino to La Nina conditions.
   El Nino conditions enhance the production of fine fuels, which when
   desiccated by La Nina conditions create conditions for widespread
   wildfires. Decadal-scale patterns of fire occurrence since the mid-17th
   century are highly similar in both regions. A period of decreased fire
   occurrence in both regions from c. 1780-1830 coincides with decreased
   amplitude and/or frequency of ENSO events. The interhemispheric
   synchrony of lire regimes in these two distant regions is tentatively
   interpreted to be a response to decadal-scale changes in ENSO activity.
   The ENSO-fire relationships of the south-western USA and northern
   Patagonia document the importance of high-frequency climatic variation
   to fire hazard. Thus, in addition to long-term trends in mean climatic
   conditions, multi-decadal scale changes in year-to-year variability need
   to be considered in assessments of the potential influence of climatic
   change on fire regimes.},

Abstract = {The fluxes of individual carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids and pigments
   have been determined in net-plankton, particulate matter and sediments
   from three sites (9 degrees N, 5 degrees N, and 0 degrees N) in the
   central equatorial Pacific to evaluate sources and reactivities of
   organic compounds. Although primary production rates vary markedly
   across this 9 degrees swath, vertical trends in biochemical compositions
   remained remarkably parallel. Together these one hundred plus
   biochemicals account for 80\% of the total organic carbon (C(org)) in
   net-plankton and particles sinking from the euphotic zone, but represent
   only 24 and 20\% of the organic carbon in deep-water particles and
   surface sediments, respectively. Scaled profiles of relative abundances,
   clearly illustrate (a) exponential losses of plankton remains and
   increases in heterotroph biomarkers throughout the water column, (b)
   elevated proportions of bacterial markers near the sediment surface, and
   (c) preservation of selected remains of bacteria, phytoplankton and
   vascular land plants deeper in the sediments. In spite of one of the
   most comprehensive analyses of major biochemicals yet applied to marine
   particulate samples, percentages of molecularly uncharacterized organic
   carbon increase progressively down the water column to values near 80\%
   in the underlying sediments. The composition, formation pathway and
   information potential of this uncharacterized fraction are among the
   most fascinating questions in marine organic geochemistry. Copyright (C)

Title = {Low net carbonate accretion characterizes Florida's coral reef},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Coral reef habitat is created when calcium carbonate production by
   calcifiers exceeds removal by physical and biological erosion. Carbonate
   budget surveys provide a means of quantifying the framework-altering
   actions of diverse assemblages of marine species to determine net
   carbonate production, a single metric that encapsulates reef habitat
   persistence. In this study, carbonate budgets were calculated for 723
   sites across the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) using benthic cover and
   parrotfish demographic data from NOAA's National Coral Reef Monitoring
   Program, as well as high-resolution LiDAR topobathymetry. Results
   highlight the erosional state of the majority of the study sites, with a
   trend towards more vulnerable habitat in the northern FRT, especially in
   the Southeast Florida region (- 0.51 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1)), which is
   in close proximity to urban centers. Detailed comparison of reef types
   reveals that mid-channel reefs in the Florida Keys have the highest net
   carbonate production (0.84 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1)) and indicates that
   these reefs may be hold-outs for reef development throughout the region.
   This study reports that Florida reefs, specifically their physical
   structure, are in a net erosional state. As these reefs lose structure,
   the ecosystem services they provide will be diminished, signifying the
   importance of increased protections and management efforts to offset
   these trends.},

Abstract = {The Paris Climate Agreement has been welcomed by many as providing a
   remarkably strong basis for global action on anthropogenically mediated
   climate change, by underpinning a highly ambitious, very clever and
   forward-looking political process. On the other hand, the sum total of
   the fresh emission reductions pledged is very small. A new
   climate-economics model is explored to help focus on two key points
   remaining at issue post-Paris, namely where are we now and where are we
   headed? The output reinforces the unpalatable finding that in the
   absence of even stronger carbon-pricing policies, temperatures and
   sea-level will, this century, rise significantly beyond what are
   currently deemed to be `dangerous' levels. Pigouvian taxes have long
   been championed by economists as providing a simple, down-to-earth
   corrective remedy for market failures, such as excessive carbon
   emissions. The Wilsonian modification, or `feebate', provides an
   attractive modern variant that could easily be implemented post-Paris.},

Title = {Hybrid algorithm for optimal operation of hybrid energy systems in
   electric ferries},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {187},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The move towards electrification of marine vessels enables the
   development of more efficient vessels by reducing fuel consumption and
   emissions. This includes incorporating electrical energy sources,
   storage systems and interfacing power electronic converters which
   increase system complexity. Therefore, an accurate and efficient power
   management system (PMS) is essential to achieve the optimum operation.
   This study aims to develop a novel hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm-based
   PMS for the fuel savings of hybrid electric ferries. The ferry power
   system used in this study comprises two diesel generator sets and a
   battery storage system. The proposed hybrid PMS method applies an
   interactive approach on the basis of a grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and
   fuzzy expert system to improve the computational efficiency of the
   algorithm. Measured load data from an existing short-haul ferry are used
   in the simulation under two load scenarios: normal and high load
   demands. The proposed fuzzy logic-grey wolf optimizer (FL-GWO) aims to
   minimize the operating cost of the proposed system while satisfying all
   operational and technical constraints of the ferry. Results show that
   the proposed FL-GWO provided a more accurate optimal solution set with
   less standard deviation than the GWO. The proposed method realized up to
   3.14\% and 1.81\% fuel savings in normal- and high-load scenarios,
   respectively, compared with GWO. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis
   indicates that charging the battery from the onboard generators in a
   more uniform rate over the entire cruising period reduces the fuel
   consumption. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) was launched on
   Envisat in March 2002. The AATSR instrument is designed to retrieve
   precise and accurate global sea surface temperature (SST) that, combined
   with the large data set collected from its predecessors, ATSR and
   ATSR-2, will provide a long term record of SST data that is greater than
   15 years. This record can be used for independent monitoring and
   detection of climate change. The AATSR validation programme has
   successfully completed its initial phase. The programme involves
   validation of the AATSR derived SST values using in situ radiometers, in
   situ buoys and global SST fields from other data sets. The results of
   the initial programme presented here will demonstrate that the AATSR
   instrument is currently close to meeting its scientific objectives of
   determining global SST to an accuracy of 0.3 K (one sigma). For night
   time data, the analysis gives a warm bias of between +0.04 K (0.28 K)
   for buoys to +0.06 K (0.20 K) for radiometers, with slightly higher
   errors observed for day time data, showing warm biases of between +0.02
   (0.39 K) for buoys to +0.11 K (0.33 K) for radiometers. They show that
   the ATSR series of instruments continues to be the world leader in
   delivering accurate space-based observations of SST, which is a key
   climate parameter. (c) 2005 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The maritime transport industry operates in an environment characterized
   by fluctuating fuel prices and low freight rates in a dynamic
   competitive market. Shipping companies must therefore adopt responsive
   supply chains whilst containing costs. This study investigates what
   extant literature can offer from an integrated digitalization and
   business process management perspective to enhance supply chain
   performance for shipping companies. The main themes identified in
   literature have been categorized according to their contributions to
   achieving responsive and efficient supply chains. Furthermore, the
   drivers of enhanced supply chain performance have been identified and an
   agenda for future research is proposed. This study therefore contributes
   to the research field of maritime transport by enfolding extant
   literature and guiding decision makers in their efforts to achieve
   responsive and adaptive shipping supply chains.},

Abstract = {Research on gas hydrate has increased recently as an alternative to
   fossil fuel. This study of marine controlled source electromagnetics
   (CSEM) is motivated by this increase, particularly in deep waters, and
   examines representative models. We present 2D models and test their
   efficacy in detection and characterization of gas hydrates. Earlier
   modeling studies used a horizontal transmitter to study the CSEM
   response-two electrical and one magnetic component-for resistive
   subsurface layers. Here we use six components-three electrical and three
   magnetic-and show that the proposed method reduces ambiguity in
   interpretation. Additionally, we show results utilizing the transmitter
   dipole in a borehole and receivers at the sea bottom. We found that CSEM
   response from a vertical transmitter helps us characterize resistive
   layers more confidently than from a transmitter moving horizontally at
   sea bottom. We conclude that in a complex environment, combining
   horizontal and vertical movements of the transmitter with sea-bottom
   receivers helps us delineate the subsurface structure more clearly and
   may help reduce drilling costs. Our models closely match the gas hydrate
   region in the Gulf of Mexico-Walker Ridge Block-313. Although this study
   examines gas hydrate, the methodology is applicable to other areas-for
   example, in monitoring gas diffusion at subsurface depths, which may
   help in CO2 sequestration.},

Title = {Dilatant shear band formation and diagenesis in calcareous, arkosic

Abstract = {The present study examines deformation bands in calcareous arkosic
   sands. The investigated units can be considered equivalent to reservoir
   units in the Matzen field in the Vienna Basin (Austria), which is one of
   the most productive oil reservoirs in central Europe. The outcrop
   exposes carbonate-free and carbonatic sediments of Badenian age
   separated by a normal fault. Carbonatic sediments in the hanging wall of
   the normal fault develop single and multistrand dilation bands with
   minor shear displacements (<2 mm). In contrast, carbonate-free sediments
   in the footwall exhibit a more pervasive system of cataclastic shear
   bands, which are frequently accumulated in clusters with up to 70 cm
   displacement. The cataclastic shear bands show a permeability reduction
   up to 3 orders of magnitude and strong baffling effects in the vadose
   zone. Carbonatic dilation bands show a permeability reduction of 1-2
   orders of magnitude and no baffling structures. We distinguished two
   types of deformation bands in the carbonatic units, which differ in
   deformation mechanisms, distribution and composition. Full-cemented
   bands form as cataclastic dilation bands with an intense syn-kinematic
   calcite cementation, whereas the younger loose-cemented bands are
   cataclastic dilatant shear bands cemented by patchy calcite and clay
   minerals. All analyzed bands are characterized by a two-staged
   petrophysical evolution: Porosity increase by dilation and grain
   fracturing is followed by a porosity and permeability reduction caused
   by authigenic cementation. The changed petrophysical properties and
   especially the porosity evolution are closely related to diagenetic
   processes driven by varying pore fluids in different diagenetic
   environments. The deformation band evolution and sealing capacity is
   controlled by the initial host rock composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The seaweedKappaphycus striatusis a well-known source of carrageenan and
   other valuable bioactive compounds. Tto improve the efficiency of
   propagation of this important natural resource, we studied the aseptic
   efficiency of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the explant sterilization
   process. We further evaluated the effects of culture media, plant growth
   regulators (PGRs), light intensity, and rotary shaking on callus
   induction and proliferation, somatic embryogenesis, and micropropagules
   regeneration of the red algaeK. striatus. The treatment with AgNPs at a
   concentration of 500 ppm optimally resulted in the absence of
   contaminations. A high explant survival rate (80.0\%) and callus
   induction rate (54.4\%) were obtained. Healthy calli were transferred
   separately into MS (Murashige and Skoog), PES (Provasoli's enriched
   seawater), and MPI media for callus proliferation. The results indicated
   that the PES medium was suitable for callus induction with higher yields
   of fresh and dry biomass (112.00 mg and 11.50 mg, respectively) compared
   with the MPI medium (79 mg fresh and 6.73 mg dry weight). Calli cultured
   using the MS medium failed to grow. The optimal condition for callus
   proliferation was the PES medium supplemented with 1.0
   mg.L(-1)1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 1.0
   mg.L(-1)6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). Somatic embryo (SE) induction was
   best obtained when cultured calli were transferred onto PES semi-solid
   medium supplemented with 1.0 mg.L(-1)NAA and 2.0 mg.L(-1)BAP. To promote
   plantlet development, SE clumps were placed in PES liquid medium on a
   rotary shaker at 100 rpm for separating individual embryos. These
   embryos were collected and allowed to develop under cool white
   fluorescent tubes at a light intensity of 55 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). The
   regenerated plantlets had a 50\% survival rate, light brown in colour
   and multibranched. The plantlets reached a length of 2 cm after 2 months

Abstract = {Long-term (<= 1 -year) records obtained by seabed observatories (BOBO)
   and repeated (24-h) CTD casts show the presence of a highly energetic
   environment in and around two cold-water carbonate-mound provinces, on
   the Southwest and Southeast Rockall Trough (SW and SE RT) margin.
   Carbonate mounds, covered with a thriving coral cover, are embedded
   mainly in the Eastern North Atlantic Water (ENAW) and are observed in a
   confined bathymetric zone between 600 and 1000 m water depth. Cold-water
   corals seem to be restricted in their growth by temperature and food
   availability. The presence of living corals on top of the carbonate
   mounds appears linked to the presence of internal waves and tidal
   currents in the water column, and consequently carbonate mound
   structures are shaped by the local hydrodynamic regime. Mound clusters
   have an elongated shape perpendicular to the regional contours and
   corresponding to the direction of the highest current speeds. On the SW
   RT margin temperature, salinity and current speed reflect a diurnal
   tidal pattern, causing maximum temperature variations at 900 m depth of
   more than 3 degrees C. Current speeds up to 45 cm s(-1) occur, and a
   residual current of 10 cm s(-1) is directed along the slope to the
   southwest. At the SE RT margin the temperature of the bottom water
   fluctuates more than I degrees C with a semi-diurnal tidal cyclicity.
   Amplitudes of average and peak current speeds here are comparable with
   those measured on the southwest margin, but the residual current in this
   area is directed to the northeast. Tidal currents and internal waves at
   both margins force the formation of intermediate and bottom nepheloid
   layers and bring fresh food particles with increased velocity to the
   mounds. The distribution of corals in both mound areas is considered
   directly related to the presence of enhanced turbidity. An increase in
   temperature can be directly related to an increase in the amount of
   particles in the water column. Current velocity increases when a
   transition occurs from cold to warm waters. High current velocities
   prevent local sedimentation but provide sufficient food particles to the
   corals, so that the corals thrive at the mound summits. (C) 2007

Abstract = {P>Serpentinization of the oceanic lithosphere contributes significantly
   to the geochemical cycle from spreading ridges to subduction zones. In
   situ trace element analysis of oceanic serpentinites from the
   Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Dominican Republic)
   shows that all serpentine minerals are enriched in fluid-mobile elements
   (FME: As, Sb, B, Li, Cs, Pb, U, Ba, Sr). We observe no loss of these
   elements from abyssal to subduction environments during prograde
   metamorphism. Moreover, the transition from lizardite/chrysotile to
   antigorite during subduction is marked by a strong over-enrichment in As
   and Sb in antigorite, indicating late contamination by a sedimentary
   source. This suggests that a second stage of serpentinization occurs in
   the earlier stages of subduction, when newly formed or reactivated
   normal faults ease fluid penetration, and/or in the subduction channel.
   Our study shows that, from spreading ridges to forearc environments,
   serpentines act as sponges for FME. We posit that, until ultimate
   antigorite breakdown, serpentinites efficiently transport significant
   amounts of FME down to great depths in the mantle.},

Abstract = {Laboratory investigation revealed that emulsified oils of Tagetes,
   sesame and (soybean + sunflower) enhanced the activity and persistence
   of the bio-product, Spinosad 24SC against the 2(nd) instar larvae of the
   cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.). Physico-chemical
   properties (suspensibility, viscosity and pH value) of Spinosad either
   alone or in combination with tested plant extracts (vegetable oils) were
   also studied under field rates. The obtained results clearly showed
   that, all the tested oils were compatible with Spinosad; they gave
   homorganic suspension and increased its viscosity and pH value. Tagetes
   oil scored the highest increase in both viscosity and pH value. The data
   proved that all the tested vegetable oils induced synergistic effect
   when mixed with Spinosad according to synergistic ratio (S.R.). The most
   evaluated promising synergism, occurred when Spinosad was combined with
   0.25\% Tagetes oil, followed by 0.5\% sesame oil, while 0.5\% (soybean +
   sunflower 1:1) oil with ratio of 1:1 was the lowest one. Spinosad +
   Tagetes oil were 3.5, 4.8 and 4.3 times more toxic for the target insect
   pest than Spinosad alone at 48, 72 and 168 hr post-exposure. Tagetes oil
   reduced LC50 of Spinosad from 30.91, 22.179 and 9.764 ppm to 8.73, 4.582
   and 2.269 ppm after 48, 72 and 168 hr, respectively. The synergistic
   effect may be due to the addition of vegetable oil that could increase
   the viscosity of Spinosad spray solution. This would increase the
   deposit on the treated plant leaves, reduce the drift and increase the
   persistence and improving the target pest control. Also, addition of
   vegetable oils inhibits respiration and thus, in turn may synergize the
   toxicity of Spinosad that can act on the nervous system.},

Abstract = {While forest plantations are a topic attracting growing interest in
   Central Africa, their undergrowth has been little studied. In order to
   assess the potential contribution of plantations of exotic species to
   the restoration of plant cover on anthropised land in Kivu (Democratic
   Republic of the Congo), the plant diversity of their understorey was
   characterised and compared in a selection of single-species plantations
   of Eucalyptus saligna and Grevillea robusta on two sites (Sake and
   Kirumba) with different altitudinal and pedoclimatic conditions. The
   variations in plant composition found by the surveys was then analysed
   according to certain ecological parameters. Finally, indicator species
   of the altitudinal and pedoclimatic conditions at each site were
   identified. The data collected in 2018 and 2020 in 12 plantations, using
   the minimum area method, showed a high degree of heterogeneity in the
   plant composition of the understorey. Although herbaceous species
   predominated, some woody and liana species were also found in these
   understoreys. The species richness did not differ significantly between
   sites or between the tree species planted. Species richness varied from
   one survey to another depending on latitude, soil pH and bioavailable
   aluminium and magnesium concentrations. Thirteen indicator species for
   the altitudinal and pedoclimatic conditions of the sites were identified
   altogether, nine for Sake and four for Kirumba. Repetition of the
   surveys increased the sampling effort even though the minimum area did
   not change significantly over two years. This study highlighted the
   contribution of exotic species plantations to the recovery of plant
   cover on potentially degraded sites in Kivu and suggested management
   measures suited to the physico-chemical properties of the soils. The use
   of indicator species of pedoclimatic conditions as predictors of site
   productivity deserves to be tested in the plantations studied, in order
   to verify whether their presence could be used as a tool for selecting
   sites for reforestation.},

Abstract = {Coastal indicators are a useful proxy in coastal zone management to
   describe the status of a physical system and to assess the effectiveness
   of possible interventions. They can he used as a basis to implement and
   evaluate coastal erosion policies, as it is done, for example, in The
   Netherlands. One often used coastal indicator is the position of the
   dune foot. In the current definition used in The Netherlands to describe
   the dune foot position, the actual geometry of the profile is, however,
   not accounted for, but this is simply based on one reference value for
   the entire coastline. In the present study, an automatic procedure for
   the detection of the dune foot position is proposed based on the actual
   shape of the cross-shore profile and on the evaluation of the first and
   second derivatives of the cross-shore topography. The methodology is
   compared to visual observations as well as satellite images for case
   studies in The Netherlands and Portugal, hence showing that the
   methodology is generally applicable. The algorithm to derive the dune
   foot position in a cross-shore profile and the database derived from
   this study are publicly available.},

   a combination of anodic dissolution (AD) and hydrogen embrittlement
   (HE). The increase of SCC susceptibility was attributed to the formation
   of a compact rust layer on steel surface that SCC microcracks can
   initiate from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer consequently.
   Moreover, hydrogen evolution was greatly enhanced with the increase of
   SO2 content, and SCC susceptibility increased rapidly as a result.},

Title = {Seismic Analysis of 10 MW Offshore Wind Turbine with Large-Diameter

Abstract = {With the increasing construction of large-scale wind turbines in
   seismically active coastal areas, the survivability of these
   high-rated-power offshore wind turbines (OWTs) in marine and geological
   conditions becomes extremely important. Although research on the dynamic
   behaviors of OWTs under earthquakes has been conducted with
   consideration of the soil-structure interaction, the attention paid to
   the impact of earthquake-induced seabed liquefaction on OWTs supported
   by large-diameter monopiles remains limited. In view of this research
   gap, this study carries out dynamic analyses of a 10 MW OWT under
   combined wind, wave, and earthquake loadings. This study uses a
   pressure-dependent multisurface elastoplastic constitutive model to
   simulate the soil liquefaction phenomenon. The results indicate that the
   motion of the large-diameter monopile leads to more extensive soil
   liquefaction surrounding the monopile, specifically in the zone near the
   pile toe. Moreover, compared with earthquake loading alone, liquefaction
   becomes more severe under the coupled wind and earthquake loadings.
   Accordingly, the dynamic responses of the OWT are apparently amplified,
   which demonstrates the importance of considering the coupling loadings.
   Compared with wind loading, the effect of wave loading on the dynamic
   response and liquefaction potential is relatively insignificant.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is an existential threat to the people of
   sinking island states. When their territories inevitably disappear,
   what, if anything, do the world's remaining territorial states owe them?
   According to a prominent `nationalist' approach to territorial rights -
   which distributes such rights according to the patterns of attachment
   resulting from people's incorporation of particular territories into
   their ways of life - the islanders are merely entitled to immigrate, not
   to reestablish territorial sovereignty. Even GHG-emitting collectives
   have no reparative duty to cede territory, as the costs of upsetting
   their territorial attachments are unreasonable to impose, even on
   wrongdoers. As long as they allow climate refugees to immigrate,
   receiving countries have done their duty, or so the nationalist argues.
   In this article, I demonstrate that the nationalist's alleged
   distributive equilibrium is unstable. When the islanders lay claim to
   new territory, responsible collectives have a duty to modify their way
   of life - gradually downsizing their territorial attachments - such that
   the islanders, in time, may receive a new suitable territory.
   Importantly, by deriving this duty from the nationalist's own moral
   commitments, I discard the traditional assumption that nationalist
   premises imply a restrictive view on what we owe climate refugees.},

Title = {Improving the provision of ecosystem services from urban forest by

   selecting process},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Due to the fact that urban environments and population demands are
   evolving rapidly and species selection is inevitable, it is possible to
   gain substantial environmental benefit by implementing more effective
   urban tree planting programs, especially with the aim of increasing the
   upcoming provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) through proper
   species selection. In this paper, we used a new approach to improve the
   potential of urban trees in optimizing more desirable environmental
   benefits. This was done by selecting the most appropriate tree species
   among a vast range of species based on their potential environmental
   function (both services and disservices) in Tabriz city, Iran. Also,
   three main planting scenarios (divided to six sub-scenarios) were
   developed so as to understand the long-term effectiveness of introducing
   the selected tree species in improving the environmental benefits (both
   urban forest structure and ES) in comparison with planting the existing
   tree species. The results indicate that regardless of the quantity of
   planting, the benefits of introducing the selected trees will be more
   than planting the existing species. Moreover, as the amount of the
   annual planting of the recommended species increases, so does the
   improvement in the projected tree characteristics and ES. This approach
   creates more opportunities which enable urban forest managers and
   policymakers to understand the importance of selecting the proper urban
   tree species when looking for a nature-based solution to promote the
   wellbeing of the urban population, to create more livable and
   ecologically sustainable cities and to mitigate urban environmental
   problems.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of Reproductive Traits in Black-Chinned Tilapia
   Females from Various Coastal Marine, Estuarine and Freshwater Ecosystems},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {The black-chinned tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron is a marine teleost
   characterised by an extreme euryhalinity. However, beyond a certain
   threshold at very high salinity, the species exhibits impaired growth
   and precocious reproduction. In this study, the relationships between
   reproductive parameters, environmental salinity and condition factor
   were investigated in wild populations of this species that were sampled
   in two consecutive years (2003 and 2004) from three locations in Senegal
   with different salinities: Guiers lake (freshwater, 0 psu), Hann bay
   (seawater, 37 psu) and Saloum estuary (hypersaline water, 66-127 psu).
   The highest absolute fecundity and spawning weight were recorded in
   seawater by comparison to either freshwater or hypersaline water whereas
   the poorest condition factors were observed in the most saline sampling
   site. These results reflect higher resource allocation to the
   reproduction due to the lowest costs of adaptation to salinity in
   seawater (the natural environment of this species) rather than
   differences in food resources at sites and/or efficiency at foraging and
   prey availability. Fecundities, oocyte size as well as spawning weight
   were consistent from year to year. However, the relative fecundity in
   the Saloum estuary varied significantly between the dry and rainy
   raisons with higher values in the wet season, which seems to reflect
   seasonal variations in environmental salinity. Such a reproductive
   tactic of producing large amounts of eggs in the rainy season when the
   salinity in the estuary was lower, would give the fry a better chance at
   survival and therefore assures a high larval recruitment. An inverse
   correlation was found between relative fecundity and oocyte size at the
   two extreme salinity locations, indicating that S. melanotheron has
   different reproductive strategies in these ecosystems. The adaptive
   significance of these two reproductive modes is discussed in regard to
   the heavy osmotic constraint imposed by extreme salinities and high
   inter-specific competition.},

Title = {The interacting effects of photosynthesis, calcification and water
   circulation on carbon chemistry variability on a coral reef flat: A
   modelling study},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {284},
Pages = {19-34},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {The diurnal fluctuations in seawater carbon chemistry that occur at
   sites within a coral reef system are due to water circulation, air-sea
   heat and gas exchange, and biogeochemical processes. The daily changes
   in dissolved carbon ion speciation and pH(T) on reefs can be larger than
   the century-scale shifts predicted for open ocean waters under climate
   change scenarios. We implement a 167 m resolution 3D hydrodynamic model
   of a coral reef (Heron Island reef, southern Great Barrier Reef,
   Australia) and couple it to a carbon biogeochemistry model. The model is
   forced by benthic fluxes calculated using a detailed habitat map and
   light and habitat-dependent parameterisations of
   calcification/photosynthesis developed from flume studies on Heron
   Island. During a two month simulation the model is able to reproduce the
   observed variability in the water temperature at 8 locations within the
   reef, demonstrating an ability of the model to capture the circulation.
   The simulation shows that the dominant processes driving the variability
   in carbonate chemistry at a location on the reef are the location of the
   different benthic communities and the path the water has taken to arrive
   at that location. A spatially-resolved age tracer indicates that the
   residence time of water over the reef varied between 16 and 60 h,
   depending on tides, winds and location. The longer transit times over
   the reef reduced the aragonite saturation state, Omega(a), in the
   overlying water to as low as 2. In the model simulation, the reef
   ecosystem reduces Omega(a) at a rate of 0.018 per hour on the reef. A
   scenario in which we removed the non-calcifying benthic microalgae from
   the reef showed a reduction in the Omega(a) in some regions from 5 to
   2.5, and an average reduction of the coral calcification by 15\%. This
   demonstrates the importance of processes that can alter the
   photosynthesis/respiration and calcification/dissolution balance when
   considering climate change impacts due to ocean acidification on corals
   at the reef scale. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Different microbial functioning in natural versus man-made Mediterranean
   coastal lagoons in relation to season},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {259},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Coastal marsh lagoons are of high ecological relevance playing a key
   role in the carbon cycle but are threatened to disappear due to global
   change effects. Restoration practices can counteract this process. This
   study compares the microbial heterotrophic functioning in three
   ``new{''} man-made lagoons (created in 2016) to that in three ``old{''}
   lagoons (two natural plus one created in 2002) from a Mediterranean
   coastal marsh. The activity of a range of microbial extracellular
   enzymes, the functional diversity, and the dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) quality, together with microbial biomass and water
   physic-chemistry were analysed seasonally in the water column of the six
   lagoons during 2017. Seasonality was a key driver for the lagoons
   microbial functioning mainly characterized by lowest microbial
   activities in winter when DOM was highly aromatic after storm events and
   an increase in organic matter degradation capabilities from winter to
   summer probably due to a rise in temperature and DOM input from primary
   production. Significant differences among lagoons appeared when they
   were less connected (summer and autumn), and old lagoons showed a
   greater utilization of proteinaceous and polysaccharidic compounds than
   new lagoons probably linked to their greater algal biomass (chlorophyll
   content), which may be supported by their larger phosphorus content. In
   autumn, there was also a greater use of allochthonous plant material in
   the old lagoons (higher XYL, and XYL/GLU ratio) probably related to
   their greater development of riparian vegetation. The functional
   diversity was the lowest in autumn when the lagoons showed distinct
   functional fingerprints and the lagoon created in 2002 was grouped with
   the new ones and distinguished from the natural ones, suggesting that it
   did not achieve complete restoration. Results indicate that microbial
   functional parameters related to organic matter use are a relevant and
   sensitive tool to study lagoon restoration processes, reflecting whole
   ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycling.},

Abstract = {The Tripolitza zone of the Hellenic orogen is closely related to the
   south Tethys passive margin. It represents the internal part of the
   Gavrovo-Tripolitza platform which crops out in the central-south
   Peloponnese, Crete and the south-east Aegean islands. From bottom to
   top, the Tripolitza sequence is composed of Triassic elastic sediments
   (Tyros beds), Triassic to upper Eocene platform carbonates and a elastic
   flysch series.
   In the present paper the sedimentation and stratigraphy of the Lower
   Cretaceous to Cenomanian carbonate succession of the Tripolitza zone in
   central Crete, are investigated. The basal beds consist of 100 m of
   laminated to brecciated dolomites with some intercalations of micritic
   limestones which are interpreted as peritidal deposits. They are of
   Early Cretaceous, probable Banemian age. They are overlain by 150 m of
   carbonates, which represent a shelf-lagoonal facies with sea-level
   fluctuations from upper subtidal to upper intertidal conditions.
   Influence of the open sea is observed towards the top of this series,
   dated as early Aptian on the basis of a fairly rich microfauna.
   The Aptian continues with 130 m of stromatolitic dolomites and dolomite
   breccia of intertidal to supratidal environments and 45 m of limestones
   reflecting a subtidal environment.
   A shallow water, subtidal limestone facies 15 m thick containing
   gastropods and rudists probably constitute the base of the Albian
   formation. It is followed by a regressive series 240 m thick. This is
   composed of laminated limestones and dolomites, gradually becoming
   stromatolitic dolomites with dolomite breccia intercalations. This
   regressive carbonate sedimentation took place during the Aptian
   p.p.(?)-Albian-early Cenomanian.
   Sedimentation during the middle-late Cenomanian had a transgressive
   character. The succession is characterized by the presence of
   rudist-reef facies as well as of low-energy subtidal-lagoonal facies.
   The latter are expressed by limestones with intercalations of dolomites.
   Locally, the microfauna and microflora are rich and of high diversity.},

Abstract = {The release of liquid effluent of nuclear power into aquatic system
   increases with the rapid development of nuclear facilities in coastal
   and inland regions. Aquatic model animals are very important for the
   study of the radiation hazards to non-human biota in water environment
   and its extrapolation of dose-effect relationship to human models.
   However, the study of the radiation dose rate calculation model of the
   aquatic animal zebrafish is still on the homogeneous isotropic model
   used for the protection of the environment. A series of zebrafish models
   (including adults, larvae and embryos, named zebrafish-family:
   ZF-family) with multiple internal organs are established in this study
   to investigate the mechanism of radiation damage effect in order to
   protect non-human species. The internal and external dose coefficients
   (DCs) of the whole body, heart and gonads of zebrafishes are calculated
   in water environment with the combination of the real experimental
   culture condition, using Monte Carlo application package GATE (Geant4
   Application for Emission Tomography) and eight nuclides, i.e., H-3,
   C-14, Sr-90, Co-60, (110)mAg, Cs-134, Cs-137, I-131, which are commonly
   found in the liquid effluent of nuclear power plants, as the source
   items, The results show that the level of nuclide gamma energy
   determines the external DCs (DCext), and Sr-90 plays the most important
   role in internal DCs (DCint). The comparison between the external DCs of
   the heart and gonad and that of the whole body shows that DCs (DCext) of
   heart and gonad for females are 80\% and 43\% lower than that of whole
   body, respectively, while for males, the DCs (DCext) of heart is 44\%
   lower than that of the whole body, and DCs (DCext) of gonad is slightly
   higher than that of the whole body for most nuclides (up to 25\%).The
   dose of internal radiation makes greater contribution than that of
   external radiation to pure beta emitter (H-3, C-14, Sr-90). This
   internal DCs of ZF-family model with complex internal structure turns
   out to demonstrate more sensitive DCs change trend and higher
   calculation values compared with the internal DCs of the simple
   ellipsoid model. In this model, the photon emitter with strong
   penetrating power has higher internal DCs, while the low-energy pure
   beta nuclide does not alter much. In conclusion, it is vital to carry
   out refined systematic modeling for model organisms, and the
   determination of DCs of model organs can promote the evaluation of the
   radiation effects on non-human species.},

Abstract = {The Tohoku region in Japan was hit by an unprecedented earthquake on
   March 11, 2011. It was a huge disaster which included a large earthquake
   with a magnitude of 7 and also a tsunami in some coastal regions. In
   addition, radioactive contamination by a hydrogen explosion at the
   Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant generated a more difficult
   situation leading to extensive damage to local communities. This would
   entail the intervention of efficient leadership on rural innovation and
   lead to some reforms in the society.
   This paper will focus on two typical cases: (1) the local direct
   response to the radioactive contaminated site and non-contaminated site
   for the comparison; and (2) a business model for a partnership of local
   government and social enterprise to alleviate the great damage of
   earthquake and tsunami through the use of renewable energy to assist
   victims in the radioactive contamination site.
   Moreover, the social problems caused by the huge disaster required rapid
   reconstruction and very strong and innovative leadership in the region.
   One of the issues addressed was the traumatic mental and physical
   experience of the people from the invisible enemy of radioactive
   contamination. This pushed the government to act on compensation for
   affected community residents.
   In this study, the role of government required in the reconstruction
   will be re-examined as a process between local government and
   enterprises from the view point of leadership that is oriented toward
   collaborative strategy as a narrative.},

Title = {Quaternary sediment dispersal in the Zambezi turbidite system (SW Indian
   Ocean)},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {428},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study investigates the Late Quaternary sediment distribution of the
   Zambezi turbidite system (Mozambique Channel, Western Indian Ocean) from
   a set of piston cores that characterizes the sedimentation in the
   Intermediate Basin and in the proximal and distal parts of the Zambezi
   Fan. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses permit to define
   variations in sediment composition, sediment accumulation rates and
   timing of turbiditic deposits over the past 720 kyr. Our study reveals
   low sediment inputs and rare turbiditic deposits in the Zambezi
   turbidite system, and the deep (> 2,500 m) Mozambique Channel in
   general, over the studied time interval. The reconstruction of the
   terrigenous flux in the upper part of the system suggests
   monsoon-related precipitation changes as the main forcing for riverine
   inputs variability in the Zambezi system. However, the occurrence of
   turbiditic deposits in the cores suggests that there is no genetic link
   between their triggering and evolving climate and sea-level conditions,
   thus emphasizing transformation of failed (slide-generated) sediment
   from the continental slope as the main initiation process for turbidity
   currents in the Zambezi system. Finally, our data highlight
   regional-scale changes in sedimentary facies through time, interpreted
   as successive `on-of switches in the activity of the distal Zambezi Fan,
   and by extension, regional-scale depocenter shifts. The last one likely
   occurred at 350 +/- 42 kyr, and is concomitant with a significant
   increase in terrigenous inputs into the proximal Intermediate Basin. It
   is speculated that this depocenter shift is related to a major southward
   migration of the Zambezi delta.},

Title = {Sines: Industrial Tourism Territory - Innovating for Tourism
   Sustainability},
Journal = {CADERNOS DE GEOGRAFIA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {41},
Pages = {43-58},
Abstract = {Industrial Tourism (IT) is a by-product of Cultural Tourism, and
   although it is a niche product it can contribute to attenuate
   seasonality, contributing to the tourist sustainability of the
   territories. Simultaneously, IT can contribute to the competitiveness of
   the territories through their diversification and differentiation they
   are able to offer. A benchmarking exercise on a global scale permits to
   identify good practices that demonstrate the positioning of this product
   within the sector of IT and that give operational and scientific
   credibility to the case study, the project ``Sines - Sustainable
   Industrial Tourism{''} (SSIT), which operationalizes the IT concept in
   one of the most dynamic industrial and economic municipalities in the
   country. With one of the most important deep- water ports in Europe,
   refineries, one thermal power plant, highly specialized industries, it
   also benefits from a natural setting of rare beauty, with its beautiful
   beaches integrated in a Natural Park. IT come up itself as a
   complementary product to the main touristic product of this territory,
   the ``Sun \& Sea{''}, maximizing the existing structures, making
   compatible two apparently antagonistic activities - Tourism and Industry
   - and taking advantage of the growing demand for different experiences
   for leisure in search of more knowledge and feedback from the general
   public, while contributing to blurring seasonality, one of the main
   threats to sustainability. This work aims to theoretically contextualize
   IT within the framework of a sustainable tourism development model and
   presents the project ``Sines - Sustainable Industrial Tourism{''} in a
   diachronic logic, describing the process and presenting the results
   achieved from its beginning.},

Title = {Do Land Use Changes Balance out Sediment Yields under Climate Change
   Predictions on the Sub-Basin Scale? The Carpathian Basin as an Example},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The issue of whether land use changes will balance out sediment yields
   induced by climate predictions was assessed for a Carpathian basin (Raba
   River, Poland). This discussion was based on the Macromodel DNS
   (Discharge-Nutrient-Sea)/SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) results
   for the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios and LU predictions. To track
   sediment yield responses on the sub-basin level the studied area was
   divided into 36 units. The response of individual sub-basins to climate
   scenarios created a mosaic of negative and positive sediment yield
   changes in comparison to the baseline scenario. Then, overlapped forest
   and agricultural areas change indicated those sub-basins where sediment
   yields could be balanced out or not. The model revealed that sediment
   yields could be altered even by 49\% in the selected upper sub-basins
   during the spring-summer months, while for the lower sub-basins the
   predicted changes will be less effective (3\% on average). Moreover, the
   winter period, which needs to be re-defined due to an exceptional
   occurrence of frost and snow cover protecting soils against erosion,
   will significantly alter the soil particle transfer among the seasons.
   Finally, it has been shown that modeling of sediment transport, based on
   averaged meteorological values and LU changes, can lead to significant
   errors.},

Title = {Modeling the biodegradation of phenolic compounds by microalgae},

Abstract = {Phenols represent a group of organic pollutants frequently found in many
   near-shore marine systems. The microbial degradation of phenols, mainly
   by bacteria and fungi, has been extensively studied both experimentally
   and theoretically, but only relatively recently the capabilities of some
   algae for phenols biodegradation gained interest. The biodegradation of
   phenols by microalgae occurs only under aerobic conditions. In this
   paper, a dynamic energy budget model is proposed for describing aerobic
   biodegradation of phenolic compounds by microalgae and qualitatively
   validated against experimental data. A microalgal cell has the ability
   to produce biomass via the autotrophic assimilation (uptake of light and
   dissolved inorganic carbon), the heterotrophic assimilation (uptake of
   dissolved organic carbon) and, to a lesser extend, via the
   biodegradation of phenols. The rules of synthesizing units are used for
   the uptake and interactions of substrates and for the merging of
   assimilates. The model is capable of making predictions under oxygen and
   carbon (inorganic and organic) limiting conditions. Model predictions
   cover a wide range of experimental evidence, but also give a possible
   explanation for the inhibition of bioremoval of phenols in the presence
   of glucose. The dissolved oxygen profiles numerically observed show low
   oxygen concentration during the intermediate phase of the biodegradation
   process and a rapid increase after the consumption of the phenolic
   compound, indicating that lack of oxygen could be a limiting factor for
   the biodegradation of phenols. The presence of glucose increases the
   specific growth rate but decreases the specific biodegradation rate of
   the phenolic compound. Model analysis suggests that this inhibition may
   be due to the competition for oxygen between glucose and phenol
   assimilation. In general, the balance between the benefits and costs of
   the different types of assimilation determines the microalgal growth
   rates as well as the phenol biodegradation rates. Being based on general
   assumptions, the model can be applied to the biodegradation of a wide
   variety of aromatic compounds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We investigated submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in a volcanic
   coastal area that hosts the world's most biodiverse reefs. Measurements
   of Rn-222 activity in coastal seawater, a tracer for groundwater,
   indicated prevalent SGD. In areas where seawater Rn-222 activity was
   generally higher, we discovered hydrothermal springs emitting acidic
   waters (pH similar to 5.4-6.0) and venting magmatic CO2 that brought
   local pCO(2) levels up to 95,000 ppm. The collection of vents raised CO2
   and lowered pH over 1-2 km of coastline. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope
   compositions of water and chloride concentration revealed that the
   springs discharge recirculated seawater mixed variably with terrestrial
   groundwater. Shallower springs and pore water have a higher proportion
   of terrestrial groundwater than deeper springs, which emit mostly
   recirculated seawater. This suggests that different SGD mechanisms are
   present. The SGD could be contributing to the evolution and function of
   the biodiverse ecosystem, but it also represents myriad pathways for
   contamination.},

Title = {Impact of seven years of organic farming on soil and produce quality and

Abstract = {Low use of chemicals in agriculture, plentiful availability of biomass
   and manure and favorable climatic conditions offer the opportunity for
   organic farming in eastern Himalayan region of India. Thus, field
   experiments were conducted in seven consecutive years from 2005 - 06 to
   2011 -12 under a raised and sunken bed (RSB) land configuration (0.3-0.4
   m height, 2 m width, 7 m length) in lowland at Meghalaya (950 m above
   sea level), India. The RSBs were constructed to facilitate drainage and
   accommodate vegetables in lowland conditions. The objectives of the
   study were (i) to identify suitable crops and cropping sequences for
   organic food production, and (ii) to assess long term impacts of organic
   farming on soil and produce quality. Rice (Otyzasativa L.) - vegetable
   sequences on raised beds and rice (varieties) - fallow (no crop)
   sequences on sunken beds were assessed under four farming practices in
   fixed plots. The four farming practices were control (only in-situ
   recycling of 2/3rd crop residues), organic (farmyard manure and rock
   phosphates), inorganic (mineral fertilizer) and integrated farming
   {[}50/50 organic and inorganic fertilizer sources (INF)]. Results
   indicated that seven-year average productivity of tomato (Solanum
   lycopersicum L.) and carrot (Daucus carota L.) under organic (22.1, and
   10.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and INF (21.9, and 10.4 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively) were significantly higher than both inorganic (17.6, and
   7.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and control (3.77, and 3.1 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively). However, yields of potato (Solanum tuberosum L) and
   French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) were the highest under INF (14.4 and
   8.7 Mg ha(-1), respectively) followed by organic (13.9 and 7.5 Mg
   ha(-1), respectively). Considering farming practices, INF (3.99 Mg
   ha(-1)), organic (3.85 Mg ha(-1)) and inorganic (3.81 Mg ha(-1)) had the
   similar rice productivity in sunken beds but all had significantly
   higher yield than that of control. After seven years, the soil available
   N on raised and sunken beds under organic farming was 133 and 4.36\%
   higher than that under inorganic and 20.8 and 18.2\% higher than that
   under control, respectively. Soil microbial biomass carbon was
   significantly higher under organic raised (177.9 mu gg(-1) dry soil) and
   sunken beds (146.77 mu gg(-1) dry soil) than that of other farming
   practices. Most of the quality parameters of tomato (lycopene content,
   total sugar, total soluble solids) and carrot (total soluble solids,
   ascorbic acid, beta carotene) were superior under organic farming
   followed by INF. Combining all these long-term results, the study
   strongly suggests several benefits of organic farming for sustainable
   productivity and improved soil and produce quality under eastern
   Himalayan condition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A linear finite-fault inversion procedure is applied to teleseismically
   recorded broadband P and SH velocity waveforms of the August 17, 1999,
   izmit earthquake, to derive spatial and temporal distributions of the
   coseismic slip over the representative three-segment model fault. The
   model fault is longer than the mapped surface rupture, and it extends
   offshore for 25 km in the west, to define the western end of the
   earthquake rupture. The teleseismically derived slip model suggests a
   bilateral rupture with a total seismic moment release of 2.6 x 10(20)
   Nm, and that the rupture was dominated by failure of two major
   asperities with peak slip amplitudes reaching 7 m. The hypocentral area
   was represented by the relatively low displacement that separated the
   large asperities. In the west, the rupture reached the eastern entrance
   of the Cinarcik basin beneath the Sea of Marmara, with an average slip
   of ca. 2 m. This indicates that the rupture propagated offshore for ca.
   20 km after crossing Hersek Peninsula. The analysis also reveals that
   the total rupture process time was 32 s, while the main seismic moment
   release, which corresponded to the rupture of the two large asperities,
   occurred between 4 s and 16 s after rupture initiation. The strong wave
   energy arrivals from the failure of the large asperities were preceded
   by weak wave arrivals in the initial section of the teleseismic
   waveforms used in this study. Along with some observations from previous
   studies, this emergent onset of the wave arrivals prompts us to discuss
   the possibility of a seismic nucleation process for this earthquake.},

Title = {Strength and Microstructural Assessment of Reconstituted and Stabilised
   Soft Soils with Varying Silt Contents},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The study of the strength of reconstituted and stabilised soft soils is
   very important in geotechnical engineering. The soil particles, such as
   clay, sand, and silt play important roles in determining the behaviour
   of soils. The behaviour of clay and sand particles are unique; however,
   the behaviour of silt particles lie in a transitional form between sand
   and clay. Therefore, this paper seeks to investigate (a) the effect of
   silt contents on the strength of soft soils; (b) the effect of silt
   content on the strength of cement-stabilised soft soils; and (c) the
   microstructure of the soft soil specimens stabilised by cement with
   varying particle size distribution. A series of tests consisting in
   consolidated, isotropic undrained (CIU) triaxial tests, unconfined
   compressive strength (UCS) tests, and scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   images were conducted in this study to achieve these objectives. In
   conclusion, the relationship between the silt content and critical state
   behaviour of soft soils (both clay and silt particles) are proposed. For
   the cement-stabilised specimens, the unconfined compressive strength
   increases with the increase in silt content when the cement content is
   10\%. However, the UCS decreases with the increase in silt content when
   cement content is 30\%. With cement content ranging from 15-25\%, the
   UCS increases at first with the increase of silt content but decreases
   once the silt content reaches a `saturation' point.},

Abstract = {Using monitoring data from 1998 to 2017, we examined the spatiotemporal
   pattern of disturbances that occurred in Sekisei Lagoon, surrounded by
   lriomote and Ishigaki islands in Okinawa, Japan. Outbreaks of
   crownof-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris), coral bleaching,
   typhoon damage, snail predation, and occurrences of growth anomalies,
   black band disease, and white syndrome were investigated using
   generalized linear models. Likelihood ratio test indicated that the type
   of coral assemblage, topographic features, and geographic range of
   research sites affected the occurrence of each disturbance. The sites
   dominated by Acropora spp. and the sites located in Sekisei Lagoon
   suffered recurrent and multiple disturbances. The impacts of
   disturbances on coral cover were evaluated using generalized additive
   models. Model averaging using Akaike information criteria revealed that
   a loss of coral cover occurred even when only a fewA. cf . solaris were
   present, when the bleaching rate was sufficiently high, or when typhoon
   damage was severe. Our study describes spatiotemporal patterns of
   disturbances over a 20-yr period and reveals their relative impacts on
   coral cover. Our findings may be useful in predicting the responses of
   coral communities to future climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) and saxitoxin (STX)-producing algae are present in
   Alaskan seas, presenting exposure risks to marine mammals that may be
   increasing due to climate change. To investigate potential increases in
   exposure risks to four pagophilic ice seal species (Erignathus barbatus,
   bearded seals; Pusa hispida, ringed seals; Phoca largha, spotted seals;
   and Histriophoca fasciata, ribbon seals), this study analyzed samples
   from 998 seals harvested for subsistence purposes in western and
   northern Alaska during 2005-2019 for DA and STX. Both toxins were
   detected in bearded, ringed, and spotted seals, though no clinical signs
   of acute neurotoxicity were reported in harvested seals. Bearded seals
   had the highest prevalence of each toxin, followed by ringed seals.
   Bearded seal stomach content samples from the Bering Sea showed a
   significant increase in DA prevalence with time (logistic regression, p
   = .004). These findings are consistent with predicted northward
   expansion of DA-producing algae. A comparison of paired samples taken
   from the stomachs and colons of 15 seals found that colon content
   consistently had higher concentrations of both toxins. Collectively,
   these results suggest that ice seals, particularly bearded seals
   (benthic foraging specialists), are suitable sentinels for monitoring
   HAB prevalence in the Pacific Arctic and subarctic.},

Title = {A protocol for an intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services

Abstract = {To support the assessments of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy
   Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the IPBES
   Expert Group on Scenarios and Models is carrying out an intercomparison
   of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios
   (BES-SIM). The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of
   land-use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services
   (i.e., nature's contributions to people) over the coming decades,
   compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple
   scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps
   through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services
   across models. BES-SIM uses three scenarios combining specific Shared
   Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways
   (RCPs) - SSP1xRCP2.6, SSP3xRCP6.0, SSP5xRCP8.6 - to explore a wide range
   of land-use change and climate change futures. This paper describes the
   rationale for scenario selection, the process of harmonizing input data
   for land use, based on the second phase of the Land Use Harmonization
   Project (LUH2), and climate, the biodiversity and ecosystem services
   models used, the core simulations carried out, the harmonization of the
   model output metrics, and the treatment of uncertainty. The results of
   this collaborative modeling project will support the ongoing global
   assessment of IPBES, strengthen ties between IPBES and the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and modeling
   processes, advise the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on its
   development of a post-2020 strategic plans and conservation goals, and
   inform the development of a new generation of nature-centred scenarios.},

Title = {Beyond Human Interventions on Complex Bays: Effects on Water and Wave
   Dynamics (Study Case Cadiz Bay, Spain)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bays are coastal environments with significant socio-economic
   importance, which has led to the development of human interventions in
   their interior that can have an important impact on the water and wave
   dynamics, which in turn modify their morphodynamics and water renewal
   capacity. In order to deepen our understanding of these impacts,
   numerical modeling was used in a bay in southern Spain to analyze the
   effect of inner harbor expansion and channel deepening, including the
   baroclinic and wave propagation effects, as well as variations in
   salinity and temperature. The results show that the deepening of the
   channel decreases the amplitude and speed of the tidal wave as it
   propagates through the bay, reducing the effects of friction and
   increasing the flushing time. The system evolves from convergent to a
   damping system that can potentially reduce the effects produced by
   projected sea level rise. In addition, the seasonal variability of
   salinity and temperature is reduced, increasing the bed shear stresses
   and resulting in increased turbidity that can affect the biogeochemistry
   of the bay. Finally, wave heights decrease along the main waterway,
   although the yearly-average wave energy flux is only slightly modified
   on the interior beaches of the bay. However, significant variations are
   observed during storms, which could affect the morphodynamics of these
   beaches.},

Title = {Ice, Fire, or Fizzle: The Climate Footprint of Earth's Supercontinental
   Cycles},
Journal = {GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Supercontinent assembly and breakup can influence the rate and global
   extent to which insulated and relatively warm subcontinental mantle is
   mixed globally, potentially introducing lateral oceanic-continental
   mantle temperature variations that regulate volcanic and weathering
   controls on Earth's long-term carbon cycle for a few hundred million
   years. We propose that the relatively warm and unchanging climate of the
   Nuna supercontinental epoch (1.8-1.3 Ga) is characteristic of thorough
   mantle thermal mixing. By contrast, the extreme cooling-warming climate
   variability of the Neoproterozoic Rodinia episode (1-0.63 Ga) and the
   more modest but similar climate change during the Mesozoic Pangea cycle
   (0.3-0.05 Ga) are characteristic features of the effects of
   subcontinental mantle thermal isolation with differing longevity. A
   tectonically modulated carbon cycle model coupled to a one-dimensional
   energy balance climate model predicts the qualitative form of Mesozoic
   climate evolution expressed in tropical sea-surface temperature and ice
   sheet proxy data. Applied to the Neoproterozoic, this supercontinental
   control can drive Earth into, as well as out of, a continuous or
   intermittently panglacial climate, consistent with aspects of proxy data
   for the Cryogenian-Ediacaran period. The timing and magnitude of this
   cooling-warming climate variability depends, however, on the detailed
   character of mantle thermal mixing, which is incompletely constrained.
   We show also that the predominant modes of chemical weathering and a
   tectonically paced abiotic methane production at mid-ocean ridges can
   modulate the intensity of this climate change. For the Nuna epoch, the
   model predicts a relatively warm and ice-free climate related to mantle
   dynamics potentially consistent with the intense anorogenic magmatism of
   this period.},

Abstract = {Kyoto is an old city blessed with beautiful natural and cultural
   landscapes. With the long history of the various events and responses to
   them, Kyoto is expected to offer some insight into how to create a
   sustainable city with resilience relevant to its historical inheritances
   and biodiversity. In this paper, we attempt to describe some concepts of
   developments and responses that could mitigate the negative impact of
   urbanization on its biodiversity and ecosystem services. (1) Modern city
   planning considering natural amenities as well as old Feng-shui geomancy
   theory could conserve the surrounding mountains. Down-zoning and vistaed
   view preservation are examples. (2) Inside the city areas, the theory of
   island biogeography is applicable for biodiversity planning, and the
   size of the isolated greenery is the most important factor for species
   richness of all taxonomic groups. However, a single large patch is not
   always sufficient to conserve as many species as possible. Moreover, the
   heterogeneity of the environment, which is formed by its design and
   management, plays an important role in species richness. Japanese
   gardens and the created wildlife habitat park are good solutions for
   biodiversity. (3) The nature of rivers and wetland systems has been
   severely degraded in the urbanization process. However, the excellent
   Katsura detached palace garden and Oguraike wetland system, which were
   one-time national monuments with high biodiversity, suggest a smart
   adaptation to the increasing risk of flooding by climate change: ``Do
   you Kyoto{''}?.},

Abstract = {This paper models and analyzes the consumption and trading patterns of
   electrical energy in islanded microgrids when the generation is
   restricted to renewable resources such as photovoltaic (PV) panels. With
   the producers and consumers of the grid represented as agents, the
   impact of the following two scenarios on the agents' utilities as well
   as the social welfare are investigated during the islanded period: (i)
   trading with fixed price; (ii) trading with variable price. In order to
   reflect real-world behavior, Nash equilibrium (NE) in user (agent)
   behavior is established by means of evolutionary optimization i.e.
   Genetic Algorithm (GA), such that each user maximizes its individual
   utility. The users' utilities consider both income from trade as well as
   the monetary equivalent of satisfaction derived from energy consumption.
   The latter is sufficiently generalized as it incorporates fixed loads
   whose utility curves are modeled as saturating nonlinearities, as well
   as discrete shiftable loads that can be scheduled over any time interval
   during the isolation period. Simulation results of this study are
   expected to have widespread ramifications in designing the future
   distribution systems.},

Year = {2004},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {We examined the radial growth-climate association of a disjunct
   population of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) at its southern
   limit of distribution. Forty-four white spruce tree islands were sampled
   over four mixed-grass prairie preserves in the Spruce Woods Provincial
   Park located in the forest-prairie boundary of southwestern Manitoba.
   Reduced radial growth occurred during the 1910s, 1930s, early 1960s, and
   the late 1970s to the early 1980s and corresponded to periods of drought
   on the Canadian prairies, and the Great Plains of the United States.
   Correlation and response function coefficients indicated that conditions
   in the summer and fall of the previous year (t-1), and the summer of the
   current year (t) strongly influenced white spruce growth. Growth was
   positively correlated with August-September (t-1) and May-June-July (t)
   precipitation and moisture index (precipitation minus potential
   evapotranspiration). Radial growth was positively associated with
   June-July-August (t) river discharge. Growth was most correlated with
   maximum and mean temperature compared with minimum temperature.
   Precipitation and maximum temperature accounted for the greatest
   variation in radial growth (61\%). The results suggest that white spruce
   growth is sensitive to climatic fluctuations because growth is
   restricted by moisture deficiency exacerbated by temperature-induced
   drought stress.},

   without any significant changes. Accessories produced by mass production
   usually do not have removable parts because they prioritize ease and
   efficiency of production. This research focuses on the development of
   the waste potentials which is reviewed with a visual strategy and uses
   the Interchangeable Elements design method. The method conducted has
   relevance between fluctuations in market share changes and production
   flexibility. This helps to find out the parameters for applying visuals
   to jewelry and enhances self-charm by using removable parts of jewelry
   as adjustments to achieve optimal visual quality.},

Title = {Large-area hysteresis-free perovskite solar cells via temperature

Abstract = {Hybrid perovskites have emerged as the most promising thin-film
   photovoltaic technology with efficiencies exceeding 20\% merely in the
   last five years. Most high-efficiency perovskite solar cells reported in
   the recent years have relatively small device area in comparison to that
   required for commercial photovoltaic modules. While these results are
   excellent from an academic perspective, scaling up the overall cell
   device area is crucial for achieving practical utility for hybrid
   perovskite based thin-film solar cells. In this paper, we present a
   comprehensive study on the use of temperature-controlled doctor blading
   technique for the growth of large island, crystalline perovskite
   thin-films. Specifically, we elucidate the physical conditions such as
   substrate temperature, solution volume, and blade speed under ambient
   conditions that control the growth of large area perovskite thin-films
   with desired island size, thickness, uniformity and crystallinity. Using
   these doctor-bladed thin-films we fabricated devices of 1 cm2 area in
   air that yielded an average efficiency of 7.32\% with negligible
   hysteresis in the current-voltage scans. Further improvements in
   efficiency can be expected by reproducing the perovskite thin-film
   growth using doctor-blading in a controlled environment, through
   compositional tuning of the band-gap, or by selecting electron and hole
   transport layers with better band alignment with the perovskite
   electronic energy level. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Volume = {8},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Since the implementation of market oriented economic reform in 1978,
   China has been on the track of rapid urbanization. The unprecedented
   urbanization in China has resulted in substantial cultivated land loss
   and rapid expansion of urban areas. The cultivated land loss due to
   urbanization not only threatens food security in China, but has also led
   to ecological system degradation to which close attention should be
   paid. Therefore, we examined the effects of the conversion from
   cultivated to urban areas on the ecosystem service in the North China
   Plain on the basis of a net primary productivity based ecosystem service
   model (NESM) and a buffer comparison method. Cultivated land loss due to
   urbanization in the North China Plain led to a total loss of ecosystem
   service value of 34.66\% during the period 1988-2008. Urban expansion
   significantly decreased the ecosystem service function of water
   conservation (-124.03\%), nutrient cycling (-31.91\%), gas regulation
   (-7.18\%), and organic production (-7.18\%), while it improved the soil
   conservation function (2.40\%). Land use change accounted for 57.40\% of
   the changes in ecosystem service and had a major influence on the
   changes in nutrient cycling and water conservation. However, climate
   change mainly determined the changes in gas regulation, organic
   production, and soil conservation.},

Title = {A sustainable acoustic customization of open porous materials using
   recycled plastics},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Foams are commonly used as sound absorbers and thermal insulators for
   many industrial and construction applications. The insulating materials
   market is currently dominated by inorganic fibres like glass and mineral
   wool, as well as plastic foams. However, worldwide plastics consumption
   produces huge amounts of waste, generating concerns about soil, air and
   especially seawater pollution. Hence, new methods for recycling marine
   microplastic litter according to cleaner production criteria are being
   sought. This paper presents a novel, sustainable and eco-friendly foamy
   material made of microplastic waste, namely polyethylene terephthalate
   (PET) and polystyrene (PS), incorporated into a bio-based matrix.
   Samples with different compositions were prepared and then characterized
   for sound absorption properties. Evidence is presented of very good
   acoustic performances and of how the acoustic characteristics of the end
   product can be customized using different microplastic content and type.
   This allows envisioning many industrial and civil applications for this
   novel open-cell material.},

Abstract = {SH guided wave detection technology is a new type of weld inspection
   technology. In order to solve non derivable problem of the SH guided
   wave at the defects, an integral equation of SH guided wave in the weld
   seam is established based on the peridynamics theory. This integral
   equation of guided wave can synchronously represent the wave motion
   state at the weld and the defects. It can also simulate the wave
   propagation characteristics at the weld. In the simulation, when there
   is no defect in the weld, the group velocity of SH guided wave is around
   2886 m/s, however, defects in the weld will attenuate the guided wave,
   increase dispersion and slow down group velocity. By comparing the
   experimental and simulated data, the simulated and experimented results
   are in good agreement with each other and show that the peridynamics can
   simulate the SH guided wave at the weld and defects, which provides a
   theoretical basis for the study of SH guided wave at weld.},

Abstract = {Within a bilateral project of the meteorological services in Germany and
   Slovakia, time series of phenological phases in both countries have been
   analysed and compared for the time period 1951-2000. Phases of plants
   from all seasons which are available in both countries have been
   selected for a sample of eight representative stations from the
   observation networks of the meteorological services. The investigation
   comprises trend analysis, comparison of medians of the phase onset date
   and its year-to-year variability, their changes between the subperiods
   1951-1985 and 1986-2000 and correlation with monthly averaged air
   temperature near surface. Differences between the phase onset dates in
   Germany and Slovakia can be found especially for early spring, when the
   onset dates are sooner and the year-to-year variability is higher in
   Germany compared to Slovakia. Later on in the year, differences between
   maritime and more continental regions within Germany become more
   important than differences between the two countries. The trend analysis
   shows that trends to sooner onset dates in spring and summer for the
   period 1951-2000 can be detected in general clearly in Germany, while in
   Slovakia trends of different sign and weaker trends can more often be
   found. Since the correlation between phenological phases and temperature
   is strong in both countries and also certain patterns of variability
   appear in both countries, the variability of phenological phases
   reflects large-scale climate change and its impact on vegetation. A
   future international action on a European basis is suggested to create a
   phenological reference data set for the area of Europe, providing a data
   base for climate monitoring applications and climate change impact
   research.},

Title = {The vertical distribution of climate forcings and feedbacks from the

Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {941-951},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The radiative forcings and feedbacks that determine Earth's climate
   sensitivity are typically defined at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) or
   tropopause, yet climate sensitivity itself refers to a change in
   temperature at the surface. In this paper, we describe how TOA radiative
   perturbations translate into surface temperature changes. It is shown
   using first principles that radiation changes at the TOA can be equated
   with the change in energy stored by the oceans and land surface. This
   ocean and land heat uptake in turn involves an adjustment of the surface
   radiative and non-radiative energy fluxes, with the latter being
   comprised of the turbulent exchange of latent and sensible heat between
   the surface and atmosphere. We employ the radiative kernel technique to
   decompose TOA radiative feedbacks in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report
   climate models into components associated with changes in radiative
   heating of the atmosphere and of the surface. (We consider the
   equilibrium response of atmosphere-mixed layer ocean models subjected to
   an instantaneous doubling of atmospheric CO2). It is shown that most
   feedbacks, i.e., the temperature, water vapor and cloud feedbacks, (as
   well as CO2 forcing) affect primarily the turbulent energy exchange at
   the surface rather than the radiative energy exchange. Specifically, the
   temperature feedback increases the surface turbulent (radiative) energy
   loss by 2.87 W m(-2) K-1 (0.60 W m(-2) K-1) in the multimodel mean; the
   water vapor feedback decreases the surface turbulent energy loss by 1.07
   W m(-2) K-1 and increases the surface radiative heating by 0.89 W m(-2)
   K-1; and the cloud feedback decreases both the turbulent energy loss and
   the radiative heating at the surface by 0.43 and 0.24 W m(-2) K-1,
   respectively. Since changes to the surface turbulent energy exchange are
   dominated in the global mean sense by changes in surface evaporation,
   these results serve to highlight the fundamental importance of the
   global water cycle to Earth's climate sensitivity.},

Abstract = {Identifying the drivers that control the reproductive success of a
   population is vital to forecasting the consequences of climate change in
   terms of distribution shift and population dynamics. In the present
   study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the environmental
   conditions that allowed the colonization of the Pacific oyster,
   Crassostrea gigas, in the Bay of Brest since its introduction in the
   1960s. We also aimed to evaluate the potential consequences of future
   climate change on its reproductive success and further expansion.
   Three reproductive traits were defined to study the success of the
   reproduction: the spawning occurrence, synchronicity among individuals
   and individual fecundity. We simulated these traits by applying an
   individual-based modeling approach using a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB)
   model. First, the model was calibrated for C. gigas in the Bay of Brest
   using a 6-year monitoring dataset (2009-2014). Second, we reconstructed
   past temperature conditions since 1960 in order to run the model
   backwards (hindcasting analysis) and identified the emergence of
   conditions that favored increasing reproductive success. Third, we
   explored the regional consequences of two contrasting IPCC climate
   scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) on the reproductive success of this
   species in the bay for the 2100 horizon (forecasting analysis). In both
   analyses, since phytoplankton concentration variations were, at that
   point, unknown in the past and unpredicted in the future, we made an
   initial assumption that our six years of observed phytoplankton
   concentrations were informative enough to represent ``past and future
   possibilities{''} of phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay of Brest.
   Therefore, temperature is the variable that we modified under each
   forecasting and hindcasting runs.
   The hindcasting simulations showed that the spawning events increased
   after 1995, which agrees with the observations made on C. gigas
   colonization. The forecasting simulations showed that under the warmer
   scenario (RCP8.5), reproductive success would be enhanced through two
   complementary mechanisms: more regular spawning each year and
   potentially precocious spawning resulting in a larval phase synchronized
   with the most favorable summer period. Our results evidenced that the
   spawning dates and synchronicity between individuals mainly relied on
   phytoplankton seasonal dynamics, and not on temperature as expected.
   Future research focused on phytoplankton dynamics under different
   climate change scenarios would greatly improve our ability to anticipate
   the reproductive success and population dynamics of this species and
   other similar invertebrates.},

Title = {CANCER RATES AFTER THE THREE-MILE-ISLAND NUCLEAR ACCIDENT AND PROXIMITY

Abstract = {Background: In the light of a possible link between stress and cancer
   promotion or progression, and of previously reported distress in
   residents near the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear power plant, we
   attempted to evaluate the impact of the March 1979 accident on community
   cancer rates.
   Methods: Proximity of residence to the plant, which related to distress
   in previous studies, was taken as a possible indicator of accident
   stress; the postaccident pattern in cancer rates was examined in 69
   ``study tracts{''} within a 10-mile radius of TMI, in relation to
   residential proximity.
   Results: A modest association was found between postaccident cancer
   rates and proximity (OR = 1.4; 95\% CI = 1.3, 1.6). After adjusting for
   a gradient in cancer risk prior to the accident, the odds ratio
   contrasting those closest to the plant with those living farther out was
   1.2 (95\% CI = 1.0, 1.4). A postaccident increase in cancer rates near
   the Three Mile Island plant was notable in 1982, persisted for another
   year, and then declined. Radiation emissions, as modeled mathematically,
   did not account for the observed increase.
   Conclusion: Interpretation in terms of accident stress is limited by the
   lack of an individual measure of stress and by uncertainty about whether
   stress has a biological effect on cancer in humans. An alternative
   mechanism for the cancer increase near the plant is through changes in
   care-seeking and diagnostic practice arising from postaccident concern.},

Abstract = {Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are considered as promising alternatives to
   quantum dots in III-V semiconductors, e.g., for the use as spin qubits.
   However, this potential has not been realized in experiments so far,
   calling for a more fundamental investigation of GQDs including a full
   control of the wave function properties during transport spectroscopy.
   Here, we review the recent success in mapping wave functions of GQDs by
   scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We show that GQDs on Ir(111) are
   softly confined rendering the wave functions more regular. The wave
   function mapping is disturbed by a sp-type surface state from Ir(111),
   which can be improved by Au intercalation or adequate Fourier analysis.
   Edge states are absent on Ir(111), but reappear after intercalating Au
   and coupling the sigma-bonds of the zig-zag edges to BN. Finally, we
   show how the goal of probing such wave functions during transport
   spectroscopy might be achieved. Therefore, we present transport
   spectroscopy of GQDs on SiO2 which are prepared in a STM compatible
   fashion.

Title = {Coral cover and rubble cryptofauna abundance and diversity at outplanted
   reefs in Okinawa, Japan},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Global climate change is leading to damage and loss of coral reef
   ecosystems. On subtropical Okinawa Island in southwestern Japan, the
   prefectural government is working on coral reef restoration by
   outplanting coral colonies from family Acroporidae back to reefs after
   initially farming colonies inside protected nurseries. In order to
   establish a baseline for future comparisons, in this study we documented
   the current status of reefs undergoing outplanting at Okinawa Island,
   and nearby locations where no human manipulation has occurred. We
   examined three sites on the coast of Onna Village on the west coast of
   the island; each site included an outplanted and control location. We
   used (1) coral rubble sampling to measure and compare abundance and
   diversity of rubble cryptofauna; and (2) coral reef monitoring using
   Line Intercept Transects to track live coral coverage. Results showed
   that rubble shape had a positive correlation with the numbers of animals
   found within rubble themselves and may therefore constitute a reliable
   abundance predictor. Each outplanted location did not show differences
   with the corresponding control location in terms of rubble cryptofauna
   abundance, but outplanted locations had significantly lower coral
   coverage. Overall, differences between sites (Maeganekul, Maeganeku2 and
   Manza, each including both outplanted and control locations) were
   significant, for both rubble cryptofauna and coral coverage. We
   recommend (1) to outplant colonies from more stress-resistant genera in
   place of Acropora, and (2) to conduct regular surveys to monitor the
   situation closely. With a lack of baseline data preceding impacts,
   rigorous monitoring over time can highlight trends towards increases or
   decreases in evaluated variables, allowing to obtain a clearer idea of
   the effects of transplants and on the trajectory of impacts due to
   climate change and local stressors . Finally, we also recommend (3) to
   establish conservation and sustainable practices that could aid the
   ongoing restoration efforts such as installing anchoring buoys to reduce
   impacts from anchoring, which could reduce coral mortality of both
   outplanted and native coral colonies.},

Abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms have developed vital strategies which allow
   them to switch from a light-harvesting to an energy dissipative state at
   the level of the antenna system in order to survive the detrimental
   effects of excess light illumination. These mechanisms are particularly
   relevant in diatoms, which grow in highly fluctuating light environments
   and thus require fast and strong response to changing light conditions.
   We performed transient absorption spectroscopy on FCPa, the main
   light-harvesting antenna from the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana, in the
   unquenched and quenched state. Our results show that in quenched FCPa
   two quenching channels are active and are characterized by differing
   rate constants and distinct spectroscopic signatures. One channel is
   associated with a faster quenching rate (16 ns(-1)) and virtually no
   difference in spectral shape compared to the bulk unquenched
   chlorophylls, while a second channel is associated with a slower
   quenching rate (2.7 ns(-1)) and exhibits an increased population of
   red-emitting states. We discuss the origin of the two processes in the
   context of the models proposed for the regulation of photosynthetic
   light-harvesting. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:

Abstract = {Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have great potential for
   applications as a drug delivery system (DDS) due to their unique
   properties such as large pore size, high surface area, biocompatibility,
   biodegradability, and stable aqueous dispersion. The MSN-mediated DDS
   can carry chemotherapeutic agents, optical sensors, photothermal agents,
   short interfering RNA (siRNA), and gene therapeutic agents. The
   MSN-assisted imaging techniques are applicable in cancer diagnosis.
   However, their synthesis via a chemical route requires toxic chemicals
   and is challenging, time-consuming, and energy-intensive, making the
   process expensive and non-viable. Fortunately, nature has provided a
   viable alternative material in the form of biosilica from marine
   resources. In this review, the applications of biosilica nanoparticles
   synthesized from marine diatoms in the field of drug delivery,
   biosensing, imaging agents, and regenerative medicine, are highlighted.
   Insights into the use of biosilica in the field of DDSs are elaborated,
   with a focus on different strategies to improve the physico-chemical
   properties with regards to drug loading and release efficiency, targeted
   delivery, and site-specific binding capacity by surface
   functionalization. The limitations, as well as the future scope to
   develop them as potential drug delivery vehicles and imaging agents, in
   the overall therapeutic management, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Regional atmospheric modeling has been utilised in an attempt to resolve
   mesoscale spatial variations in wind stress forcing over the southern
   Benguela. The regional atmospheric model MM5 was used to simulate
   low-level coastal winds at high resolution (3 km) over the southern
   Benguela upwelling system for the March 2001 period and to assess the
   sensitivity to different resolution sea surface temperature (SST)
   forcing. The ability of a regional atmospheric model to resolve the
   mesoscale spatial variability in the local wind field which results from
   the adjustment of the large scale flow to regional topography and
   thermal gradients is demonstrated. The model output has been validated
   quantitatively through comparison with limited observations and
   qualitatively through comparison with wind fields observed in aircraft
   surveys conducted during previous summers. The regional model was
   capable of reproducing the qualitative effect of topographic forcing and
   thermal gradients on the equatorward flow. Local enhancement of
   low-level wind speed due to the interaction of the synoptic equatorward
   flow with both the Cape Peninsula and Cape Columbine was reproduced with
   associated bands of wind maxima, while lighter winds were seen in the
   lee of these capes. Increasing the spatial resolution of SST forcing to
   resolve cold SST's induced by upwelling is seen to enhance the mean
   response of low-level winds to coastal topography during the March 2001
   event. These wind variations have important implications for coastal
   ocean dynamics and the development of extreme events in the region such
   as harmful algal blooms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {100},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The influence of a polynya, a persistent ice-free region, on water
   column production and subsequent transport to the shallow continental
   shelf benthos of the Bering Sea was evaluated by studying spatial
   patterns of organic material deposition, benthic biomass, community
   sediment metabolism, benthic population structure, and other potential
   indicators of enhanced organic carbon transport to benthic communities
   underlying the St. Lawrence Island Polynya. Despite suggestions that
   polynyas may be important localized centers of primary production in
   polar waters, we found that the St. Lawrence Island Polynya does not
   obviously enhance the biomass of benthic communities directly below the
   polynya. However, southward flowing, baroclinic currents generated as a
   result of brine injection at the polynya edge do appear to have an
   influence on the biomass and ecological structure of Bering Sea benthic
   communities south of St. Lawrence Island. These currents appear to
   affect mean sediment oxygen consumption, surface organic carbon/nitrogen
   ratios, total organic content, and bottom water ammonia by sweeping
   phytodetrital matter south and to the west of the island. A
   particle-reactive, short-lived, natural radioisotope, Be-7, used as an
   indicator of rapid (days to weeks) deposition of particulate material
   from the water column, was detected only in surface sediments to the
   southwest of the island, indicating enhancement of particle deposition
   to the southwest of the island. Finally, the O-18 content of tunicate
   cellulose was highest in the polynya region, consistent with increased
   filter feeding in the late winter when the polynya is present, and
   presumably promoting primary production in the open water. The Anadyr
   Current, consisting of nutrient-rich, deeper Bering Sea water that is
   upwelled onto the shelf in the Gulf of Anadyr, flows west to east in the
   region south of St. Lawrence Island throughout the year and is the major
   forcing function for high production in the region. The interaction of
   Anadyr Water with the winter/spring ephemeral polynya and associated
   baroclinic currents combine to positively influence benthic communities.},

   macrotidal estuaries of northeastern Brazil},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {191},
Number = {9},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {The present work aims to observe the spatial distribution of metals
   associated with carbon forms (fraction < 2 mm) in surface sediments of
   two macrotidal estuaries, Sao Marcos Bay and Anil River Estuary, which
   are located within the transition region between the Amazonian and the
   semi-arid northeast regions. Grain size, metal content (Al, Fe, Mn, Cu,
   Pb, Cr, Zn, and Ni), organic matter, and calcium carbonate content were
   determined. Grain size analyses showed the predominance of the
   sand-sized fraction < 2 mm due to the local hydrodynamic conditions.
   Anil River Estuary sediments exhibited high organic matter content due
   to both the mangrove outwelling and domestic sewage discharge. They also
   presented high calcium carbonate content as a result of abundant
   remnants of gastropod shells. Organic matter acted as the primary
   geochemical carrier for most metals in both estuaries, while calcium
   carbonate acted as the secondary carrier. Enrichment factors indicated
   Mn sediment contamination in Sao Marcos Bay and Fe, Pb, and Zn
   contamination in the Anil River Estuary. These results also suggest that
   Sao Marcos Bay is influenced by harbor activities, mostly ore shipment,
   whereas Anil River Estuary sediments are enriched in these metals as a
   result of domestic and hospital effluents reaching the urbanized
   drainage basin.},

Abstract = {The standards of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system and the cause
   of islanding in formation are introduced at first, and then common
   passive and active detecting islanding methods are discussed in this
   paper. Considering the shortcomings of traditional methods, such as
   failing to detect islanding, larger non-detection zone and poor quality
   of output power of the inverter, etc., a novel detecting method which is
   called as positive power feedback disturbance is proposed, so as to
   overcome these problems. The proposed method has the characteristics of
   no non-detection zone, little influence on power quality and rapid
   respond. Finally, according to professional standards of IEEE Std.
   2000-929 and UL1471, the simulation as well as the experiment of the
   proposed method was carried out. The results of simulation and
   experiment showed the good expressions from the novel method.},

Title = {Application of a synthetic cyclone method for assessment of tropical

Abstract = {Tropical cyclone-induced storm surges cause damaging impacts in coastal
   regions. The present study uses a stochastic cyclone modelling approach
   to evaluate the likelihoods of storm tides, the combination of storm
   surges and astronomical tides, for Samoa. Cyclones that occurred in the
   vicinity of Samoa from 1969 to 2009 are used to build a stochastic
   tropical cyclone data set, and an analytic cyclone model and
   hydrodynamic model are used to model storm tides under average, La Nia
   and El Nio cyclone and sea level conditions for present climate
   conditions as well as cyclone and sea level conditions relevant for
   2055, and storm tide return periods are estimated. We find that extreme
   storm tides exhibit relatively modest variation around the coastline of
   Samoa owing to the uniform width of the shelf surrounding the coastlines
   of two main islands of Savai'i and Upolu. The frequency of cyclones and
   hence storm tides during El Nio conditions is similar to the frequency
   for all seasons, but is considerably lower in La Nia conditions. For the
   future, tropical cyclones are assumed to undergo decreased frequency and
   increased intensity. This is found to lower the storm tide height for
   return periods < 100 years and increase it for return periods greater
   than about 200 years. Sea level rise is shown to have a larger influence
   on storm tides than future changes to tropical cyclones. Considering the
   aggregated probabilities of storm tides occurring at the national scale,
   we find that the likelihood of a storm tide occurring that locally
   exceeds a 1-in-100-year level (i.e. an event with a 1 \% annual
   exceedance probability) has a 6 \% probability of occurring somewhere
   along the entire coastline of Samoa. Such information may be useful for
   those involved in coastal management and disaster response for which
   there may be a need to consider the overall likelihood that a nation may
   have to respond to such a disaster.},

Title = {Development of a three-dimensional geological model, based on Quaternary

Abstract = {Among the few positive impacts of climate warming in cold regions,
   permafrost degradation can increase the availability of groundwater as a
   potential source of drinking water for northern communities. Near the
   Inuit community of Umiujaq in Nunavik, Canada, a watershed in a valley
   in the discontinuous permafrost zone was instrumented to monitor the
   impacts of climate change on permafrost and groundwater, and assess the
   groundwater availability and quality. Based on Quaternary chronology,
   knowledge of periglacial processes, and an investigation carried out in
   the valley (including mapping of Quaternary deposits and ice-rich
   permafrost distribution, drilling and sampling of deposits, and
   geophysical surveys), a three-dimensional (3D) geological model of the
   watershed was built into GoCAD to assess the hydrogeological context in
   this degrading permafrost environment. In total, six units were
   identified within the watershed including an upper aquifer in marine
   sediments, a lower aquifer at depth in glaciofluvial and glacial
   sediments, and the bedrock acting as a low-permeability boundary. An
   aquitard, made of frost-susceptible silty sand and discontinuously
   invaded by ice-rich permafrost, confines the lower aquifer. This 3D
   geological model clarifies the local stratigraphic architecture and
   geometries of Quaternary deposits, especially the stratigraphic
   relationship between the two aquifers, aquitard, and bedrock, and the
   extent of ice-rich permafrost within the watershed. It is the
   cornerstone to understand the groundwater dynamics within the watershed
   and to carry out numerical modelling of coupled groundwater flow and
   heat transfer processes to predict the impacts of climate change on
   groundwater resources in this degrading permafrost environment.},

Title = {Maternal laminarin supplementation decreases Salmonella Typhimurium
   shedding and improves intestinal health in piglets following an
   experimental challenge with S.Typhimurium post-weaning},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {During the period immediate post-weaning (PW), piglets become vulnerable
   to pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella Typhimurium, the most common
   Salmonella serovar. Laminarin (LAM),. a beta-glucan derived froth
   seaweed, is known to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity
   when supplemented maternally or directly to the piglet. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the effects of supplementing sows and/or
   piglets post-weaning with LAM after an experimental challenge with S.
   Typhimurium. Gestating sows (n=24) were supplemented with LAM (0 vs. 1.0
   g/d) from day 107 of gestation until weaning (day 20). The lactation and
   PW diet were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial to provide four treatment
   groups: (1) pigs weaned from basal fed sows and offered a basal diet
   post-weaning (n=12; BB); (2) pigs weaned from basal fed sows and offered
   a LAM supplemented diet post-weaning (n=12; BL);. (3) pigs weaned from
   LAM supplemented sows and offered a basal diet post-weaning (n =12; LB);
   (4) pigs weaned from LAM supplemented sows and offered a LAM
   supplemented diet post-weaning (n=12; LL). The LAM supplemented
   post-weaning diets contained 300 ppm LAM/t of feed. On day 10 PW,
   piglets were challenged with 10(8) CFU. S. Typhimurium and euthanized on
   day 26 PW to facilitate sample collection for microbial populations,
   volatile fatty acid (VFA) and immune related gene expression analysis.
   Pigs were weighed at birth, at weaning, at challenge and at slaughter
   and feed intake post-weaning was recorded. Faeces were visually scored
   for diarrhoea. Piglets weaned from LAM supplemented sows had improved
   average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency post-challenge (P < 0.05).
   The faecal score was improved when LAM was supplemented maternally or
   post-weaning (P < 0.001). Maternal supplementation of LAM reduced faecal
   counts of S. Typhimurium by 0.35 log gene copy numbers post-challenge
   (measured on day 2, 5 and 7; P < 0.05). Total VFA production in the
   colon was increased after maternal or post-weaning LAM supplementation
   (P < 0.05). The expression of IL-22 in the colon was reduced after
   maternal LAM supplementation (P < 0.05). It can be concluded that, after
   an experimental challenge with S. Typhimurium, maternal LAM
   supplementation resulted in improved feed efficiency, faecal scores and
   increased the VFA production in the colon, while reducing faecal counts
   of S. Typhimurium and gene expression of IL-22 in the colon. Published

Abstract = {Although various special materials have been exploited for enhancing
   evaporation performance of a solar vapor generation system, their
   practical applications could be greatly limited by structure destruction
   due to the seawater corrosion and external mechanical forces. In this
   work, we have developed a carbon black/polyethyleneimine-bacterial
   cellulose (CPB) membrane with vacuum filtration method to simultaneously
   enhance the strength and evaporation performance of solar vapor
   generation system, by applying carbon blacks as the photo-thermal
   conversion material, bacterial cellulose as the skeleton material for
   enhancing the structure strength, and polyethyleneimine (PEI) for
   tailoring the water absorption capacity. Effects of carbon black
   particle concentrations and PEI concentrations were probed,
   respectively, for optimizing the light absorption capacity and water
   absorption capacity in laboratory. Furthermore, the outdoor experiments
   were carried out to evaluate the strength and evaporation performances
   of CPB membrane. Results show that the evaporation efficiency of the CPB
   membrane could reach about 85.05\% and 81.89\% in the lab and outdoor
   under one sun irradiation. Additionally, a force of 59.37 MPa and
   folding more than 100 times will not break the structure of CPB
   membrane, which confirms the preferable structure strength. This
   superior CPB membrane, together with its low cost, simple fabrication,
   excellent mechanical properties, scalability and desalination ability,
   provides a feasible way for practical applications.},

Abstract = {Power regulation of all converter units in a microgrid should not be
   only determined by load demand, but also by the available power of each
   unit, i.e. a converter fed by a battery. Energy management control is
   essential in order to handle the variety of prime movers which may
   include different types of renewable energy sources (RES) and energy
   storage systems (ESS). Specifically, the recharging process of secondary
   battery, the most prominent ESS, should be done in a specific manner to
   preserve its life-time, microgrid line voltage must be kept within the
   bounds and the energy offered by RES should be utilized as efficiently
   as possible. This paper proposes a coordinated control strategy based on
   power-line signaling (PLS), instead of common communications, for a
   single-phase minigrid in which each unit can operate in different
   operation modes taking into account the resource limitation. The whole
   system is explained ahead and finally, simulation results obtained in
   Simulink are presented to validate the proposed control strategy.
   On the other hand, the proposed loads are several electromagnetic
   ballast driving high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps. Although this kind of
   ballast are not installed nowadays, this paper is proposed for a recent
   installation where is not worth to change these devices due to lack of
   amortization.},

Title = {Technology for Preventing the Wax Deposit Formation in Gas-Lift Wells at
   Offshore Oil and Gas Fields in Vietnam},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Within the past few decades, the production of high-wax oils at offshore
   fields in Vietnam has been fraught with severe problems due to the
   intense formation of asphalt-resin-paraffin deposits (ARPD) in the
   downhole oil and gas equipment. The formation of organic wax deposits in
   the tubing string led to a significant decrease in gas-lift wells
   production, efficiency of compressor units, transport capacity of the
   piping systems, along with an increase in equipment failure.
   Subsequently, the efficiency of gas-lift wells dramatically decreased to
   less than 40\% as a whole. The existing methods and technologies for
   combating organic wax deposit formation in downhole equipment have many
   advantages. However, their use in producing high-wax anomalous oil does
   not entirely prevent the wax formation in the tubing string and leads to
   a significant reduction in oil production, transport capacity, and
   treatment intervals. The results of theoretical and experimental studies
   presented in this article demonstrate that a promising approach to
   improve the efficiency of gas-lift wells during the production of
   high-wax oil is to use the technology of periodic injection of hot
   associated petroleum gas (APG) into the annulus of an oil-producing
   well. The effectiveness of the proposed method of combating wax
   formation in gas-lift wells highly depends on the combination of a few
   factors: the determination of wax deposit formation intensity in the
   well and the implementation of a set of preparatory measures to
   determine the optimal injection mode of hot APG (flow rate and injection
   depth) into the annulus between tubing strings and technological pipes.
   The injection depth of the hot APG should not be less than the depth of
   wax formation in the tubing string. The optimal injection rate of hot
   APG is determined by analyzing and mathematically modeling the APG
   injection system based on well-known thermodynamic laws.},

Abstract = {A two-dimensional numerical model was used to study appropriate
   conditions at the open boundaries for a regional model forced by
   parameters from a global tidal model (Schwiderski, 1981; 1983).  The
   open boundary condition of Reid and Bodine (1968) was applied to
   regional models of the north-central Gulf of Mexico and of the western
   Florida shelf. A number of tests were conducted to determine how well
   forcing using the tidal constants from the 1-degree X 1-degree
   Schwiderski global model could reproduce the M2 and O1 tides as
   determined from observations and the 15' X 15' Gulf of Mexico model of
   Reid and Whitaker (1981). The Reid and Bodine formulation was quite
   effective in driving the regional models while still allowing wave
   energy to propagate through the open boundaries and out of the model. 
   Tests with one open boundary of the north-central Gulf regional model
   having just a radiation or a zero-gradient condition (but no tidal
   forcing for either) failed to reproduce the known tides. Apparently, the
   pure radiation or zero-gradient condition along one open boundary can
   result in interior solutions to the tidal forcing that can be quite
   different from the actual tides.  The results indicate that tidal
   forcing is required at all open boundaries to reproduce observed and
   model-predicted tidal variations.
   The western Florida shelf is known to resonate with the M2 tide.  Under
   such circumstances, the bottom friction becomes quite important in
   obtaining correct predictions of the observed tidal amplitudes.  Several
   bottom friction schemes with varying drag coefficients were tested for
   both the central Gulf and Florida models.  The results are discussed in
   light of the fact that we seek one scheme that would be applicable for
   both resonant and non-resonant situations.},

Title = {Groundfish assemblages diversity in upwelling ecosystems: insights from
   the Mauritanian Exclusive Economic Zone},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},

Abstract = {Upwelling ecosystems exhibit strong spatio-temporal variations of
   environmental conditions that drive the dynamics of marine diversity and
   ressources. Yet little is known in these ecosystems concerning the
   diversity of groundfishes. We studied the effects of environment (sea
   surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration and bathymetric strata)
   and fishing pressure on this variability in the Mauritanian Exclusive
   Economic Zone (MEEZ), based on abundance data collected from 2158 hauls
   from scientific surveys performed on the continental shelf (15-200 m)
   between 1997 and 2010. First, for each haul (i.e. alpha-diversity),
   Species richness S and Berger Parker dominance D-bp were used as proxies
   of two complementary groups of nine indices, belonging to three main
   components of diversity (species number, evenness and taxonomic
   diversity), identified by a principal component analysis based on
   Spearman correlation coefficient. Thus the set of diversity indices used
   in this work suggests that a single component of diversity cannot
   represent the biodiversity of MEEZ groundfish. Second, generalized
   linear models (GLM) highlighted the stability of both indices for
   environmental variables, fishing effort and time, while, as shown by a
   previous study in the MEEZ, these variables influence species
   composition (i.e. beta-diversity). A longitudinal gradient of S and D-bp
   was highlighted, with coastal strata being richer in species and
   abundances more evenly distributed among species than offshore strata.
   Overall, this study provides a baseline of groundfish diversity in the
   MEEZ, that is also useful for comparison to other upwelling ecosystems,
   and essential for monitoring its potential shifts faced to climate
   change.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VISUALIZATION},
Year = {2003},

Number = {1},
Pages = {41-51},
Abstract = {The optical technology based on Mach-Zehnder interferometry was
   successfully applied to a high-pressure liquid CO2 and water system to
   measure CO2 solution density. Experiments were carried out at a pressure
   range of from 5.0 to 12.5 MPa, temperatures from 273.25 to 284.15 K, and
   CO2 mass fraction in solution up to 0.061. CO2 solution density data
   were obtained from two sets of experiments. These data were calculated
   through the fringe shifts induced by density changes inside of the
   high-pressure vessel, which were directly recorded during the
   experiments, and a modified version of Lorentz-Lorenz formulation. The
   experimental results indicated that the density ratio of CO2 solution to
   that of pure water at the same pressure and temperature is monotonically
   linear with the CO2 concentration in the solution. The slope of this
   linear function, calculated by the experimental data fitting, is 0.275.},

Title = {Cenozoic climatic changes drive evolution and dispersal of coastal
   benthic foraminifera in the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The Antarctic coastal fauna is characterized by high endemism related to
   the progressive cooling of Antarctic waters and their isolation by the
   Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The origin of the Antarctic coastal fauna
   could involve either colonization from adjoining deep-sea areas or
   migration through the Drake Passage from sub-Antarctic areas. Here, we
   tested these hypotheses by comparing the morphology and genetics of
   benthic foraminifera collected from Antarctica, sub-Antarctic coastal
   settings in South Georgia, the Falkland Islands and Patagonian fjords.
   We analyzed four genera (Cassidulina, Globocassidulina, Cassidulinoides,
   Ehrenbergina) of the family Cassidulinidae that are represented by at
   least nine species in our samples. Focusing on the genera
   Globocassidulina and Cassidulinoides, our results showed that the first
   split between sub-Antarctic and Antarctic lineages took place during the
   mid-Miocene climate reorganization, probably about 20 to 17 million
   years ago (Ma). It was followed by a divergence between Antarctic
   species similar to 10 Ma, probably related to the cooling of deep water
   and vertical structuring of the water-column, as well as broadening and
   deepening of the continental shelf. The gene flow across the Drake
   Passage, as well as between South America and South Georgia, seems to
   have occurred from the Late Miocene to the Early Pliocene. It appears
   that climate warming during 7-5 Ma and the migration of the Polar Front
   breached biogeographic barriers and facilitated inter-species
   hybridization. The latest radiation coincided with glacial
   intensification (similar to 2 Ma), which accelerated geographic
   fragmentation of populations, demographic changes, and genetic
   diversification in Antarctic species. Our results show that the
   evolution of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic coastal benthic foraminifera
   was linked to the tectonic and climatic history of the area, but their
   evolutionary response was not uniform and reflected species-specific
   ecological adaptations that influenced the dispersal patterns and
   biogeography of each species in different ways.},

Title = {Evaluating legacy contaminants and emerging chemicals in marine
   environments using adverse outcome pathways and biological
   effects-directed analysis},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},
Pages = {517-525},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Natural and synthetic chemicals are essential to our daily lives, food
   supplies, health care, industries and safe sanitation. At the same time
   protecting marine ecosystems and seafood resources from the adverse
   effects of chemical contaminants remains an important issue. Since the
   1970s, monitoring of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (FBI)
   chemicals using analytical chemistry has provided important spatial and
   temporal trend data in three important contexts; relating to human
   health protection from seafood contamination, addressing threats to
   marine top predators and finally providing essential evidence to better
   protect the biodiversity of commercial and non-commercial marine
   species. A number of regional conventions have led to controls on
   certain PBT chemicals over several years (termed `legacy contaminants';
   e.g. cadmium, lindane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {[}PAHs] and
   polychlorinated biphenyls {[}PCBs]). Analytical chemistry plays a key
   role in evaluating to what extent such regulatory steps have been
   effective in leading to reduced emissions of these legacy contaminants
   into marine environments. In parallel, the application of biomarkers
   (e.g. DNA adducts, CYP1A-EROD, vitellogenin) and bioassays integrated
   with analytical chemistry has strengthened the evidence base to support
   an ecosystem approach to manage marine pollution problems. In recent
   years, however, the increased sensitivity of analytical chemistry,
   toxicity alerts and wider environmental awareness has led to a focus on
   emerging chemical contaminants (defined as chemicals that have been
   detected in the environment, but which are currently not included in
   regulatory monitoring programmes and whose fate and biological impacts
   are poorly understood). It is also known that natural chemicals (e.g.
   algal biotoxins) may also pose a threat to marine species and seafood
   quality. Hence complex mixtures of legacy contaminants, emerging
   chemicals and natural biotoxins in marine ecosystems represent important
   scientific, economic and health challenges. In order to meet these
   challenges and pursue cost-effective scientific approaches that can
   provide evidence necessary to support policy needs (e.g. the European
   Marine Strategy Framework Directive), it is widely recognised that there
   is a need to (i) provide marine exposure assessments for priority
   contaminants using a range of validated models, passive samplers and
   biomarkers; (ii) integrate chemical monitoring data with biological
   effects data across spatial and temporal scales (including quality
   controls); and (iii) strengthen the evidence base to understand the
   relationship between exposure to complex chemical mixtures, biological
   and ecological impacts through integrated approaches and molecular data
   (e.g. genomics, proteomics and metabolomics). Additionally, we support
   the widely held view that (iv) that rather than increasing the
   analytical chemistry monitoring of large number of emerging
   contaminants, it will be important to target analytical chemistry
   towards key groups of chemicals of concern using effects-directed
   analysis. It is also important to evaluate to what extent existing
   biomarkers and bioassays can address various classes of emerging
   chemicals using the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) approach now being
   developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
   (OECD) with respect to human toxicology and ecotoxicology. Crown

Abstract = {The characterization of organic matter (OM) and trace elements (TEs) was
   conducted in bulk precipitation samples collected in an urban area of
   Croatia (Zagreb center), from January 2009 to October 2011 (N = 31).
   Characterization of OM was performed by measurement of dissolved (DOC)
   and particulate forms of organic carbon (POC), as well as surface-active
   substances, copper complexing capacity and reduced sulfur species which
   were determined electrochemically. Concentrations of TEs (Al, Fe, Zn,
   Cr, Ba, Mn, Cu, Sr, Ti, Pb, V, Ni, Rb, Sb, As, Sn, Se, Co, Cd, Mo) were
   analyzed by HR ICP-MS. The most important outcome of this study is
   confirmed relatively low concentrations of DOC (0.69-4.86 mgC L-1) and
   TEs. Daily fluxes of Zn, Pb, Ni, As, and Cd were two to three times
   lower than that of those reported for an urban industrial site in
   Europe. Additionally, this study shows that the value and reactivity of
   rainwater DOC has not considerably changed if compared with the results
   from the 1998-1999 study (0.78-4.39 mgC L-1). High traffic density and
   thermal power plants are assumed to be the main local sources of
   pollutants in Zagreb. Using Al as a reference element, it was found that
   Cd, Sb, and Cu were associated with anthropogenic sources. The
   solubility of Sr, Zn, Cd, Ni, Cr, As, and Rb was higher than 70\%.
   Another critical characteristic of precipitation composition is episodic
   variation in POC concentration because of Saharan dust transport.
   Obtained data can be valuable for environmental quality assessment, as
   well as for insight into atmospheric deposition processes.},

Abstract = {Concern within society regarding both environmental \& health and safety
   issues, has resulted in the introduction of new legislation in Britain.
   These regulations have forced the British paint industry to revise their
   formulations and develop a new generation of modern coating systems.
   This paper describes the cost model developed for calculating the total
   life cycle cost for offshore fabric maintenance painting. The model
   compares the difference of the life cycle cost between fabric
   maintenance painting using modern coating technology, with that of
   traditional coating technology, on a offshore platform underdeck and
   jacket.
   The results of the study show that the modern coating technology is not
   only less harmful to both the natural environment and applicator, but
   has a significant lower life cycle cost.},

Abstract = {Pollen extracted from ocean and wetland sediments cored from the eastern
   Canadian Margin, James Bay region, and Atlantic provinces of Canada have
   been radiocarbon dated and results are reported here. Pollen dates from
   ocean sediments were compared with marine carbonate (mollusk shells or
   foraminifera) dates from the same core levels, dates for which validity
   was assessed via correlations with other cores, and for which reworking
   has been excluded. Pollen samples from 3 tidal wetlands were taken from
   levels dated with Cs-137 and Pb-210 profiles. Pollen dates from 2
   additional wetlands were compared with C-14 dates of botanical
   macrofossils. Most pollen dates disagree with C-14 dates based on
   macrofossils or carbonates, with age differences typically exceeding 250
   yr and reaching 4000 yr in one instance. In some cores, pollen dates
   show age reversals. Significant proportions of reworked pollen grains in
   ocean and wetland samples are associated with pollen dates that are too
   old. Prolonged core storage could result in pollen C-14 ages that are
   too young, possibly because of growth of fungi or other microbes, but
   more work is needed to verify this hypothesis. Despite the problems we
   encountered, some pollen dates are consistent with other C-14 dates from
   the same core levels, suggesting this dating method can work, but at
   present, more work is needed to understand the conflicting results
   obtained.},

Title = {Large-scale passive acoustic monitoring of fish sound production on the
   West Florida Shelf},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {484},
Pages = {173-188},
Abstract = {Sounds from toadfish Opsanus sp., and 4 other suspected fish sounds were
   identified in passive acoustic recordings from fixed recorders and
   autonomous underwater vehicles in the eastern Gulf of Mexico between
   2008 and 2011. Data were collected in depths ranging from 4 to 984 m
   covering approximately 39000 km(2). The goals of this research were to
   map the spatial and temporal occurrence of these sounds. Sound
   production was correlated to environmental para meters (water depth,
   lunar cycle, and dawn and dusk) to understand the variability in
   seasonal calling. Toadfish `boatwhistles' were recorded throughout the
   diel period, with peaks observed between 15:00 and 04:00 h. Annual peaks
   coincided with the spawning period in the late spring to early summer.
   The 4 unknown sounds were termed: `100 Hz Pulsing', `6 kHz Sound', `300
   Hz FM Harmonic', and `365 Hz Harmonic'. The 100 Hz Pulsing had the
   temporal characteristics of a cusk-eel call with frequencies below 500
   Hz. Sound production was observed mainly at night with annual peaks in
   the spring and fall. The 6 kHz Sound was observed exclusively at night
   between 15 and 50 m bottom depths; occurrence decreased significantly in
   the winter. The 6 kHz Sound peak frequencies correlated positively to
   satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and negatively to
   chlorophyll concentration. The 300 Hz FM Harmonic was observed largely
   (89\%) at night and appeared offshore (40-200 m depth). The 365 Hz
   Harmonic was observed 98\% of the time at night, inshore (<40 m depth).
   The fundamental frequency of the 365 Hz Harmonic was positively
   correlated with SST, reflecting a temperature-driven increase in sonic
   muscle contraction rate; conversely, call duration was negatively
   correlated. The ubiquity of these 4 unknown sounds illustrates how
   little is known about biological communication in the marine
   environment.},

Title = {Temporal assemblage turnovers of intertidal foraminiferal communities

   regions},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {204},

Abstract = {This is the first quantitative study of temporal assemblage turnovers of
   the relationships between intertidal foraminifera. Time series datasets
   collected from tropical Caroni Swamp and Claxton Bay (Trinidad, SE
   Caribbean) and temperate Cowpen Marsh (NE England, U.K.) and Bay of
   Cadiz (SW Spain) were used. The assemblage turnover index (ATI) examined
   species interrelationships through comparisons of monthly or biweekly
   species proportional abundances over one or two years. Species
   contributing to major assemblage turnovers (All > x + sigma) were
   identified using the conditioned on-boundary index (CoBI). Foraminiferal
   species are heterogeneously distributed within the sediment; multiple
   sample stations at a study location cumulatively represent the
   foraminiferal metacommunity and clusters represent foraminiferal
   assemblages. The ATI and CoBI were applied to the proportional
   abundances of live specimens recorded for the metacommunity and
   assemblages at each location. At Caroni Swamp and Claxton Bay, major
   assemblage turnovers were driven by the most abundant species and the
   majority coincided with seasonal change or the arrival of the seasonal
   Orinoco plume in the Gulf of Paria. Seasonal turnovers of the
   foraminiferal metacommunities at temperate Cowpen Marsh and Bay of Cadiz
   occurred during the summer and winter. Major assemblage turnovers in the
   upper Cowpen Marsh occurred in the summer, and the lower marsh in the
   winter. Foraminiferans are useful bioindicators for monitoring the
   health of coastal environments. Understanding foraminiferal population
   dynamics will allow cyclical changes to be differentiated from abrupt
   and persistent changes, which are related to anthropogenic disturbances
   or long-term climate change. The ATI and CoBI are useful indices for
   quantitatively exploring relationships of foraminiferal populations over
   time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Modem and Pleistocene polar carbonates occur in East Antarctica in
   shelf, coast, lakes and marginal to underneath glaciers, associated
   mainly with glacigene muds, boulder tills and diamictites. Shelf
   carbonates (in Prydz Bay) are calcitic and unlithified, and consist
   mainly of sponges, bryozoans, echinoderms, bivalves and diatoms. Coastal
   carbonates (in the Vestfold Hills) are calcitic and contain faunal
   assemblages similar to those on the shelf, with calcareous algae,
   microbial mats, minor peloids and cements. Lake carbonates are
   aragonitic micrites and peloids. Carbonates close to glaciers (the Loken
   Moraines) are aragonitic and contain abundant ooids with intragranular
   fibrous cements. Subglacial carbonates are aragonitic micrites and
   peloids. Carbonate mineralogy changes from mainly low-Mg calcite in
   marine shelf to aragonite in brackish to freshwater dominated inland
   regions. Antarctic carbonate delta(18)O values (4.5 to -47 parts per
   thousand PDB) vary markedly due to frigid temperatures (0 to -2 degrees
   C) and salinity (0 to 35 parts per thousand) changes, as a result of
   meltwater dilution from adjacent glaciers. Their delta(13)C values (-9
   to 8 parts per thousand PDB) also vary markedly due to exposure to
   atmospheric CO2, the circulation of water masses and reaction of
   carbonate with CO2 trapped in glacial ice. The regional distribution of
   carbonate sediments and their sedimentology, mineralogy, and delta(18)O
   and delta(13)C compositions indicate three types of glacial environments
   of formation. The first corresponds to a glacial stage and the formation
   of subglacial and bank carbonates, when the Antarctic ice sheet expanded
   onto the inner shelves. The second corresponds to interglacial stages
   and the formation of ice-marginal carbonates, during the retreat of the
   ice sheet from the inner shelf grounding line and accompanying the
   discharge of appreciable meltwater. The third corresponds to an
   interglacial oasis and the formation of coastal carbonates, proximal to
   distal lacustrine carbonates, and distal subglacial carbonates.},

Title = {GLOBAL SEA-RISE: AN EARLY WARNING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {14-23},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {One of the most important problems facing coastal communities today is
   the effects of a global sea-rise on coastline habitat and
   infrastructure. Such a rise could inundate lowlands and wetlands, erode
   beaches, and exacerbate coastal flooding. Furthermore, rising sea level
   can influence the rate of salt-water intrusion into coastal aquifers,
   cause expansion of the salt-water wedge in estuaries, and increase the
   probability of damage from storm surges along coastlines. Predicting
   shoreline retreat and land loss rates is critical to planning future
   coastal zone management strategies and assessing biological impacts due
   to changes in or destruction of habitat. To date long-term coastal
   planning has been done piecemeal, if at all (NRC, 1995). Consequently,
   facilities are being located and entire communities are being developed
   without consideration to the potential costs to relocate and/or protect
   them from the effects of sea-level rise, flooding, and/or loss of
   natural resources.
   An average rise in global ocean levels of just a few inches could have
   devastating effects on coastal towns, cities, and ecosystems worldwide.
   More than 100 million people live within I meter (3.28 feet) of the mean
   sea level (Douglas \& Kearney, 2001). The problem is exceptionally
   urgent and serious for the low-lying small island nations of the world.
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2006 that by
   2100 the sea-level could rise as much as 0.58 meters (23 inches)
   (Solomon et al., 2007). Current estimates of sea-level rise by 2100
   range between 0.30-0.91 meters (1-3 feet). The range reflects
   uncertainty about global temperature projections and how rapidly ice
   sheets will melt or slide into the ocean in response to the warmer
   temperatures.
   Regardless of the future uncertainty, the current rate of sea-level rise
   is more than double the average sea-level rise seen over the past few
   centuries. Equally alarming is the fact that the rate of sea-level rise
   appears to have increased exponentially over the past few decades.},

Title = {Gas-Driven Tensile Fracturing in Shallow Marine Sediments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The flow of gas through shallow marine sediments is an important
   component of the global carbon cycle and affects methane release to the
   ocean and atmosphere as well as submarine slope stability. Seafloor
   methane venting is often linked to dissociating hydrates or gas
   migration from a deep source, and subsurface evidence of gas-driven
   tensile fracturing is abundant. However, the physical links among
   hydrate dissociation, gas flow, and fracturing have not been rigorously
   investigated. We used mercury intrusion data to model the capillary
   drainage curves of shallow marine muds as a function of clay content and
   porosity. We combined these with estimates of in situ tensile strength
   to determine the critical gas saturation at which the pressure of the
   gas phase would exceed the pressure required to generate tensile
   fractures. Our work showed that fracturing is favored in the shallowest
   38 m of sediment when the clay-sized fraction is 0.2, but fracturing may
   be possible to a depth of 132 m below seafloor (mbsf) with a clay-sized
   fraction of 0.5 and to a depth of nearly 500 mbsf with a clay-sized
   fraction of 0.7. Dissociating hydrate may supply sufficient quantities
   of gas to cause fracturing, but this is only likely near the updip limit
   of the hydrate stability zone. Gas-driven tensile fracturing is probably
   a common occurrence in the upper 10-20 mbsf regardless of clay-sized
   fraction, does not require much gas (far less than 10\% gas saturation),
   and is not necessarily an indication of hydrate dissociation.},

Abstract = {Hydroxyl radical (OH) is an important oxidant in atmospheric aqueous
   phases such as cloud and fog drops and water-containing aerosol
   particles. We find that numerical models nearly always overestimate
   aqueous hydroxyl radical concentrations because they overpredict its
   rate of formation and, more significantly, underpredict its sinks. To
   address this latter point, we examined OH sinks in atmospheric drops and
   aqueous particles using both new samples and an analysis of published
   data. Although the molecular composition of organic carbon, the dominant
   sink of OH, is extremely complex and poorly constrained, this sink
   behaves very similarly in different atmospheric waters and even in
   surface waters. Thus, the sink for aqueous OH can be estimated as the
   concentration of dissolved organic carbon multiplied by a general
   scavenging rate constant {[}k(C,OH) = (3.8 +/- 1.9) x 10(8) L (mol
   C)(-1) s(-1)], a simple process that should significantly improve
   estimates of OH concentrations in atmospheric drops and aqueous
   particles.},

Title = {Multi-specific small-scale fisheries rely on few, locally essential,
   species: Evidence from a multi-area study in the Mediterranean},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1299-1312},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Achieving sound management of small-scale fisheries (SSFs) is globally
   recognized a key priority for sustaining livelihoods, local economies,
   social wealth and cultural heritage in coastal areas. The paucity of
   information on SSFs often prevents the proper assessment of different
   socio-ecological aspects, potentially leading to draw inappropriate
   conclusions and hampering the development and adoption of effective
   policies to foster SSF sustainability. To respond to the growing global
   call to assess these fisheries, we carried out a multi-disciplinary and
   data-rich assessment of SSFs at 11 areas in 6 Mediterranean EU
   countries, combining the analysis of 1292 SSF fishing operations and 149
   semi-structured surveys of fishers. Specifically, we aimed at assessing
   (1) landed species contribution to SSF catches and revenues and (2) the
   spatial variability in a set of fishery socio-ecological descriptors.
   Results highlighted that, in spite of a high species diversity,
   Mediterranean SSFs actually rely economically upon a very limited number
   of species with catch and revenues per unit of effort mostly determined
   by less than 5 species, that can guarantee high and stable catches and
   revenues over time. Moreover, some fishing communities were found to
   rely on a restricted number of gears. These evidences suggest, that some
   SSFs' properties often assumed, but never broadly verified, should be
   carefully reconsidered, especially when viewed from a broader
   socio-ecological perspective, as in the case of the diversified
   portfolio or of the polyvalence of fishing gears. Taking the local scale
   into proper account is likely to reduce the risk of implementing
   management strategies potentially generating socio-ecological
   inequalities.},

Title = {Understanding and responding to climate-driven non-economic loss and
   damage in the Pacific Islands},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {Communities throughout the Pacific Islands region have experienced, and
   will continue to experience, extensive non-economic loss and damage
   (NELD) from climate change. Assessments of loss and damage, however,
   often fall short on their coverage of these non-economic dimensions,
   which can distort our understanding of climate change impacts, discount
   the experiences of some and skew future decision-making. This paper
   explores how stakeholders in the Pacific Islands understand NELD and
   what they perceive to be the best ways of responding to it. An
   open-ended questionnaire was used to collect qualitative and
   quantitative data from representatives from governments, donors and
   development partners, civil society, intergovernmental organisations,
   and relevant others. This study found that NELD in the Pacific Islands
   is understood, perceived and experienced through the lens of intangible
   values, identity and cultural landscapes, and this is encapsulated by a
   typology with eight interconnected core dimensions. These eight
   dimensions include: health and wellbeing, ways of being, future ways of
   being, cultural sites and sacred places, Indigenous and local knowledge,
   life sustaining tools, biodiversity and ecosystem services, and
   connection to land and sea. NELD is complex, entangled and
   interconnected, thereby significantly undermining entire
   socio-ecological systems. Moving forward, responding to NELD in the
   Pacific Islands region will require a comprehensive approach that
   protects, conserves and restores complex socio-ecological systems, and
   provides opportunities to work through loss and damage by means of
   education and training, safeguarding knowledge systems, community
   activities, cultural connection and maintenance, and strong
   relationships with land and sea.},

Abstract = {Increasing the sustainability of the transportation sector yields great
   potential in the fight against climate change. Container terminal
   logistics is one of the main potential areas to focus on, as the
   heavy-duty vehicles involved in container transportation can be operated
   electrically. Incorporating information systems into this setting, this
   is a promising area for smart grid applications. Free battery capacities
   of vehicles, that are currently unused, can serve as frequency
   stabilizing flexibilities in the energy grid. Against this background,
   this paper provides insight into the configuration of costs drivers that
   arise in the context of the implementation of a virtual power plant in a
   container terminal by means of a structured scenario analysis approach.},

Abstract = {Black carbon (BC) contents were measured in recent sediments in five
   high altitude remote alpine lakes, i.e. Lake Krisko Sup., Lake Ledvica,
   Lake Planina, Lake Krn and Lovrensko Lake, and the eutrophic subalpine
   Lake Bled in Slovenia to follow the history of atmospheric pollution of
   fossil fuel and local biomass burning in Alps. Organic carbon (OC), its
   C-13 values, total nitrogen and sedimentation rates using Pb-210
   activity data were also measured. The highest BC contents, reaching 20
   mg/gdw, were noted in remote alpine lakes while in the subalpine Lake
   Bled sediment the concentrations were lower reaching 5 mg/gdw. Lower
   BC/OC ratios, ranging between 4\% and 8\%, were typical for remote
   alpine lakes and increased to about 10\% in subalpine Lake Bled. The
   latter clearly shows the marked importance of local direct pollution
   sources in comparison to remote atmospheric input which decreases in a
   W-E direction in parallel with decreasing amounts of precipitation.
   Based on Pb-210 sedimentation data, the minimal BC accumulation rates in
   sediment cores were detected in the pre-industrialisation period. In the
   last decades of 20th century the BC contents decreased probably due to
   reduced emission of pollutants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {Scale-dependent relationships between native richness, resource
   stability and exotic cover in dock fouling communities of Washington,
   USA},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aim
   In terrestrial plant communities, the relationship between native
   species diversity and exotic success is typically scale-dependent. It is
   often proposed that within local neighbourhoods, high native diversity
   limits resources, thereby inhibiting exotic success. However,
   environmental variation that manifests over space or time can create
   positive correlations between native diversity and exotic success at
   larger scales. In marine habitats, there have been few multi-scale
   surveys of this pattern, so it is unclear how diversity, resource
   limitation and the environment influence the success of exotic species
   in these systems.
   Location
   Washington, USA.
   Methods
   I analysed nested spatial and temporal surveys of fouling communities,
   which are assemblages of sessile marine invertebrates, to test whether
   the relationships between native richness, resource availability and
   exotic cover supported the diversity-stability and diversity-resistance
   theories, to test whether these relationships changed with
   spatio-temporal scale, and to explore the temperature preferences of
   native and exotic fouling species.
   Results
   Survey data failed to support diversity-stability theory: space
   availability actually increased with native richness at the local
   neighbourhood scale, and neither space availability nor variability
   decreased with native richness across larger spatio-temporal scales. I
   did find support for diversity-resistance theory, as richness negatively
   correlated with exotic cover in local neighbourhoods. Unexpectedly, this
   negative correlation disappeared at intermediate scales, but emerged
   again at the regional scale. This scale-dependent pattern could be
   partially explained by contrasting water temperature preferences of
   native and exotic species.
   Main conclusions
   Within local neighbourhoods, native diversity may inhibit exotic
   abundance, but the mechanism is unlikely related to resource limitation.
   At the largest scale, correlations suggest that native richness is
   higher in cooler environments, whereas exotic richness is higher in
   warmer environments. This large-scale pattern contrasts with the typical
   plant community pattern, and has important implications for coastal
   management in the face of global climate change.},

   concentrations of Ca, Mg, and K. No consistent effects were observed on
   the Cu, Mn, or Zn concent rations. Most; of the Al in solution was bound
   to organic matter. Within the fraction ``labile aluminium{''}, the
   concentration of Al-OH complexes decreased and the Al-F complexes

Abstract = {A one-dimensional (1-D), thermodynamic sea-ice model with parameterized
   ice dynamics is coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model and driven with
   prescribed atmospheric forcings for the central Arctic. The model is
   used to calculate the sensitivity of the ice pack to various
   parameterizations that have traditionally been neglected or considered
   only implicitly in large-scale sea-ice models. The model includes melt
   ponds, leads (with summertime stratification), an ice-export term, a
   stability-dependent air-sea heat-exchange coefficient, a prognostic
   ocean-ice heat exchange, a crude ice-thickness distribution, and a
   sophisticated albedo parameterization.
   The ice pack is sensitive to the partitioning of solar energy between
   lateral melting and mixed-layer warming, with the most realistic
   simulations occurring when the heat is nearly evenly divided between
   these two processes. Conversely, ice thickness and coverage are fairly
   insensitive to the amount of lateral mixing within the upper ocean,
   vertical mixing within leads, and to the partitioning of mixed-layer
   heat content between warming the water and melting the ice bottom. The
   ice concentration during summer is strongly dependent on the assumed
   ice-thickness distribution: the amount of open water during summer is
   less than half the size of the empirically based distribution used here,
   compared with one in which ice floes are distributed uniformly across a
   range of thicknesses.},

Abstract = {Turbulence is an important factor for planktonic predator-prey
   interrelationships, as it increases the contact rate between the
   relatively immobile planktonic: organisms, Actual turbulent scales in
   planktonic predator-prey relationship are those less than the typical
   planktonic separation distance, For fish larvae feeding on copepod
   nauplii of concentrations 1-50 nauplii/l the effective turbulence scale
   is smaller than 10 cm.
   In regions where the wind-induced turbulence dominates, empirical
   relationships between wind mixing and wind speed may be applied to
   calculate rough estimates of the turbulent energy dissipation rate
   epsilon. In regions where other sources of turbulent energy (tidal
   mixing, convection, swell in shallow regions and internal breaking
   waves) are important, the available empirical data are poor, and direct
   measurements of the turbulence and the derived turbulent frequency
   spectra are needed.
   During spring 1995 and 1996 direct turbulence measurements were carried
   out in Lofoten, Northern Norway, above a shallow plateau of 20-35 m
   depth where turbulent mixing is mainly generated by tidally- and
   swell-induced mixing, Lofoten is an important feeding area for cod
   larvae, The turbulence measurements were conducted front a fixed point
   at the top of 6.5 m high submarine tower sitting on the sea bed, Three
   types of ultrasonic current meters, one Doppler current meter and two
   travel time current meters with different sampling volume were used in
   the experiment. The results indicate that both instrument types can he
   used to resolve small scale turbulence. However-Doppler noise limits the
   performance of the Doppler current meter, while the acoustic pathlength
   limits the performance of travel time current meters.},

Title = {The role of beach state and the timing of pre-storm surveys in
   determining the accuracy of storm impact assessments},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {425},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Dune erosion principally occurs when water level exceeds the elevation
   of the beach and predicting erosion is progressively becoming more
   important for management as coastal populations increase, sea level
   rises, and storms become more powerful. This study assesses storm
   impacts using a simple model from Stockdon et al. (2007) configured with
   oceanographic information from the ADCIRC + SWAN model and frequently
   collected beach profiles. We applied that model to barrier islands in
   North Carolina including: Core Banks with a more dissipative beach
   morphology and Shackleford Banks and Onslow Beach with intermediate
   beach morphologies. The study periods captured 10 events where wave
   collision with the dunes and/or overwash were either predicted or
   observed, including large multiple-day events caused by hurricanes and
   smaller events caused by onshore winds and high tide. Comparing model
   output with a time series of beach photographs shows the predictive
   power and sensitivity of the model was consistently high at the Core
   Banks Site with its wide and low-gradient beach, high-elevation dunes
   (2.58 m), and high resistance to overwash. Model predictive power and
   sensitivity was lowest at the Shackleford Banks Site because frequent
   and large changes to beach slope and intermediate dune elevation
   (0.54-1.25 m) caused small variations of modeled total water level to
   either overpredict or underpredict storm impacts. In addition, storm
   impacts were always overpredicted during hurricanes at the Shackleford
   Banks Site, which was likely due to storm waves decreasing the beach
   slope from what was measured prior to the event and used as model input.
   Like Shackleford Banks, the beach slope of the Onslow Beach Site was
   steep and variable, but the low-elevation dunes (0.24-0.28 m) made
   resistance to overwash low and the predictive power and sensitivity of
   the model higher than at the Shackleford Banks Site. Results suggest
   that storm impacts and the associated potential for dune erosion is
   predicted more accurately at beaches where the threshold for overwash is
   high or low because total water level during most events will commonly
   fall short of or exceed the overwash threshold, respectively. The
   accuracy of predicting the storm impact regime is sensitive to beach
   slope. The slope of intermediate beaches is more variable than
   dissipative beaches and requires frequent measurement if it is to be
   represented accurately in the model, but this can be impractical and
   costly even using the latest drone-surveying methods. To maximize the
   accuracy of predicting storm impacts, intermediate beach morphology
   should be constrained by surveying at seasonal or yearly time scales and
   used as input to numerical models that estimate beach slope over short
   time scales (hours during an event or daily), configured with the latest
   wave and water-level forecasts.},

Abstract = {This study is the first to use the observation data of a fog monitor, a
   visibility meter, and an automatic weather station to carry out a
   comprehensive observation experiment from the perspective of
   microphysics on a severe sea fog process in Beilun District, China, from
   14 to 15 June 2021. The results show the following: (1) Temperature is
   closely related to nucleation, condensation growth, and other processes.
   The decrease (increase) in temperature is the main reason for the
   enhancement (weakening) of nucleation and the growth of condensation
   (evaporation of droplets), which leads to an increase (or decrease) in
   microphysical quantities, such as droplet number concentration and
   liquid water content. (2) The average droplet number spectral
   distribution roughly conforms to the Gamma distribution, and the
   spectral distribution of the fog process presents a ``multi-peak{''}
   structure, with peak diameters of 6 mu m, 12 mu m, 16 mu m, 24 mu m, and
   44 mu m. Droplets with a diameter of less than 16 mu m account for 75\%
   of the droplet size distribution. (3) During this sea fog process, three
   microphysical parameters, namely, number concentration, liquid water
   content, and average diameter, are all positively correlated in pairs,
   but the positive correlation between the number concentration and the
   average diameter is weak. This shows that the condensation nucleation
   and the condensation growth of droplets are the main processes in this
   sea fog process and that the collision process occurs but is not the
   dominant process. The sea fog comprehensive observation experiment
   provides an important demonstration of the microphysics research of sea
   fog in the eastern coastal areas of China and provides more reference
   information for sea fog research and equipment comparisons between
   different regions. At the same time, it also provides an essential
   scientific basis for the short-term forecast of sea fog in the future
   and for the optimization of the microphysical parameters of related
   models.},

Title = {Fluctuation of Glacial Retreat Rates in the Eastern Part of Warszawa
   Icefield, King George Island, Antarctica, 1979-2018},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Antarctica is a region of the world where climate change is visible in
   the rapid melting of glaciers. This is particularly evident in marginal
   zones, where the pace of glacial retreat has systematically accelerated.
   The effective mapping of these changes is possible with the use of
   remote sensing methods. This study assesses changes in glacier margin
   positions between 1979 and 2018 in the Antarctic Specially Protected
   Area 128 (ASPA-128) on King George Island, South Shetland Islands,
   Antarctica. In 1979, 19.8 km(2) of the study area was glaciated. Over
   the following 39 years, an area of 6.1 km(2) became ice-free, impacting
   local ecosystems both on land and in Admiralty Bay. The reduction in
   glacier extent was different in time and depended on the glacier type.
   Land-terminating glaciers had the fastest retreat rates below 200 m
   a.s.l. and were influenced mostly by surface melting. The reduction of
   tidewater glaciers occurred primarily in areas below 100 m a.s.l., with
   the most pronounced ice extent decreases occurring below 50 m a.s.l. The
   observed rates of front retreat suggest that glacier retreat rates were
   fastest between 1989-2001 and 2007-2011, with reduced retreat rates
   between 2001 and 2007. During the last 7 years, the lowest rate of
   regression was recorded in the entire analysed period (1979-2018).
   Changes in the areal extent of glaciers were compared with the climate
   record available for King George Island. The observed fluctuations in
   glacier retreat rates could be correlated to oscillations in annual
   Positive Degree-Days. The spatial analyses were based on aerial
   photographs (1956, 1979), theodolite measurements (1989), GPS survey
   (2001, 2007), and satellite images (2011, 2018).},

Abstract = {Understanding habitat use of critically endangered North Pacific right
   whales (NPRWs, Eubalaena japonica) is important to better evaluate the
   potential effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change on this
   species. Satellite transmitters were deployed on individual right whales
   in 2004, 2008 and 2009 to investigate whether their space-use patterns
   in the Southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) were influenced by environmental
   conditions and to assess habitat use in areas of human interest. Whales
   were monitored for an average of 40 d (range 29-58 d) between July and
   October, a period in which they inhabited the SEBS shelf. Individuals
   tagged in 2008-2009 (cold years) remained in the middle shelf domain,
   travelled at a slower rate and showed a spatially more restricted
   habitat use than a whale tagged in 2004 (a warm year). Monte Carlo tests
   suggested that NPRWs associated with the cold pool (remnant winter water
   in the bottom layer of the middle shelf domain) during cold years, which
   is likely due to higher copepod abundance and reduced competition with
   other copepod predators within the cold pool. Telemetry data indicated
   that a Critical Habitat designated by the US National Marine Fisheries
   Service encompasses the main feeding range of NPRWs in the Bering Sea.
   Two whales briefly visited the North Aleutian Basin, an area previously
   considered for oil and gas development. Small sample sizes precluded
   conclusive comparisons of space-use patterns among years with
   significantly different temperature regimes, but we hypothesize that
   habitat use in the SEBS varies with these regimes because of concomitant
   changes in the abundance of the whales primary copepod prey. Long-term
   evaluation of space-use patterns of NPRWs is required to further
   understand their habits in the feeding grounds in light of global
   warming and the potential for increased anthropogenic activities.},

Abstract = {Imidazopyrazinone is a typical scaffold present in marine
   bioluminescence, in which thermal energy is converted into excitation
   energy in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In fact, the imidazopyrazinone
   scaffold is a common link among organisms of eight phyla. The
   characterization of the light emission mechanism is essential for the
   development of future applications in bioimaging, bioanalysis and
   biomedicine. Herein, we have studied the chemiluminescent reaction of
   three commercially-available imidazopyrazinones (Cypridina luciferin,
   Coelenterazine and Coelenterazine-e) in several aprotic solvents at
   different pH. We have found that at acidic pH only DMF and DMSO
   consistently present high light emission, while chemiluminescence in
   other solvents is negligible. We have attributed this to the inability
   of most solvents to allow for the deprotonation of the imidazopyrazinone
   core, thereby preventing the oxygenation step. We have also observed
   that increasing the pH of the solution leads to the inhibition of
   chemiluminescence, which we attributed to the deprotonation of the
   dioxetanone intermediate, as the neutral species is the one associated
   with efficient chemiexcitation. We have also observed that the pK(a) of
   dioxetanone increases with the dielectric constant of the medium.
   Finally, our work indicated that the chemiexcitation yield increases
   with increasing polarity of the medium, due to a reduced transition
   dipole moment associated with S-0 -> S-1 transition.},

Title = {Replacing kelp meal (Macrocystis pyrifera) with a winery by-product in a
   balanced diet for green abalone (Haliotis fulgens)},

Abstract = {Kelp meal made from Macrocystis pyrifera is a common ingredient in
   abalone diets (Haliotis fulgens); however, a greater demand for this
   ingredient as feed supplement for domestic animals has led to a
   considerable increase in price and it has become costly to use in
   balanced diets. Hence, the aim of the present work is to study the
   possibility of replacing kelp meal in the abalone diet with a regional
   winery by-product. Five diets were formulated in which kelp meal was
   substituted from 0\% to 100\%, at a maximum of 33\% of the total of
   ingredients; 375 abalone (15.09 +/- 0.38 mm and 0.434 +/- 0.03 g) were
   used, randomly distributed in fifteen 8-L plastic buckets. After 60 days
   of experimentation, significant differences were detected in the slopes
   of the different treatments for both length and weight. Since the
   inclusion of the winery by-product resulted in a lower feed ingestion
   but the feed conversion efficiency remained constant, a factor of low
   palatability can be attributed to the winery by-product and not an
   antinutritional factor. It is concluded that the winery by-product can
   be substituted for kelp meal in 16\% of the total diet without having a
   negative effect on the growth of the organisms.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions and climate change are two of the largest threats
   to biodiversity, and this is especially true for island ecosystems that
   have largely evolved in isolation. The house mouse is considered to have
   been introduced to sub-Antarctic Marion Island by sealers in the early
   1800s. It is currently widespread across the island and has a large
   impact on the indigenous biota. To date, little information is available
   on genetic aspects of biological invasions in the sub-Antarctic. Ten
   specimens of the house mouse were collected from two geographically
   separated localities on Marion Island. Sequences of the mitochondrial
   DNA control region revealed only two haplotypes, separated by a single
   site change. More importantly, these haplotypes are shared between the
   eastern and western side of Marion Island. By comparing our sequences to
   data available on GenBank, we provide evidence that house mice on Marion
   Island is Mus musculus domesticus (Rutty 1772), and most closely related
   to haplotypes characterizing this species from Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
   and northern Germany.},

Title = {Optimization of selective breeding through analysis of morphological

Journal = {GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Determining correlations between certain traits of economic importance
   constitutes an essential component of selective activities. In this
   study, our aim was to provide effective indicators for breeding programs
   of Lateolabrax maculatus, an important aquaculture species in China. We
   analyzed correlations between 20 morphometric traits and body weight,
   using correlation and path analyses. The results indicated that the
   correlations among all 21 traits were highly significant, with the
   highest correlation coefficient identified between total length and body
   weight. The path analysis indicated that total length (X-1), body width
   (X-5), distance from first dorsal fin origin to anal fin origin (X-10),
   snout length (X-16), eye diameter (X-17), eye cross (X-18), and slanting
   distance from snout tip to first dorsal fin origin (X-19) significantly
   affected body weight (Y) directly. The following multiple- regression
   equation was obtained using stepwise multiple-regression analysis: Y =
   -472.108 + 1.065X(1) + 7.728X(5) + 1.973X(10) - 7.024X(16) - 4.400X(17)
   - 3.338X(18) + 2.138X(19), with an adjusted multiple-correlation
   coefficient of 0.947. Body width had the largest determinant
   coefficient, as well as the highest positive direct correlation with
   body weight. At the same time, high indirect effects with six other
   morphometric traits on L. maculatus body weight, through body width,
   were identified. Hence, body width could be a key factor that
   efficiently indicates significant effects on body weight in L.

Abstract = {The restingas of coastal Brazil are vegetation mosaics that include
   forests and open woodlands. One of the most common restinga vegetation
   types in Rio de Janeiro state, an open woodland, is dominated by the
   crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) tree Clusia hilariana Schltdl.
   (Clusiaceae). We provide allometric equations and biomass estimation for
   this species on three sites varying woody plant cover. Estimated
   aboveground biomass stock of C. hilariana plus the litter accumulated
   underneath the canopy of these plants ranged from 0.64 to 8.63 t ha(-1)
   depending on plant cover. These values are often comparable to those of
   the entire woody component of many neotropical savannas, which have been
   claimed to have important impact on global carbon cycles. The
   litter-layer represents 31\% of aboveground biomass, which is very high
   when compared to other tropical savannas. This indicates that slow
   decomposition may play an important role on carbon accumulation at the
   studied ecosystem. Thus, C. hilariana, despite its conservative strategy
   of carbon acquisition via CAM, gives a high contribution to biomass
   stock in this nutrient-poor coastal vegetation in the tropics. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Production dynamics of eelgrass, Zostera marina was examined in two bay
   systems (Koje Bay and Kosung Bay) on the south coast of the Korean
   peninsula, where few seagrass studies have been conducted. Dramatically
   reduced eelgrass biomass and growth have been observed during summer
   period on the coast of Korea, and we hypothesized that the summer growth
   reduction is due to increased water temperature and/or reduced light and
   nutrient availabilities. Shoot density, biomass, morphological
   characteristics, leaf productivities, and tissue nutrient content of
   eelgrass were measured monthly from June 2001 to April 2003. Water
   column and sediment nutrient concentrations were also measured monthly,
   and water temperature and underwater irradiance were monitored
   continuously at seagrass canopy level. Eel-grass shoot density, biomass,
   and leaf productivities exhibited clear seasonal variations, which were
   strongly correlated with water temperature. Optimal water temperature
   for eelgrass growth in the present study sites was about 15-20 degrees C
   during spring period, and eelgrass growths were inhibited at the water
   temperature above 20 degrees C during summer. Daily maximum underwater
   photon flux density in the study sites was usually much higher than the
   light saturation point of Z. marina previously reported. Densities of
   each terminal, lateral, and reproductive shoot showed their unique
   seasonal peak. Seasonal trends of shoot densities suggest that new
   eelgrass shoots were created through formation of lateral shoots during
   spring and a part of the vegetative shoots was transformed into
   flowering shoots from March. Senescent reproductive shoots were detached
   around June, and contributed to reductions of shoot density and biomass
   during summer period. Ambient nutrient level appeared to provide an
   adequate reserve of nutrient for eelgrass growth throughout the
   experimental period. The relationships between eelgrass growth and water
   temperature suggested that rapid reductions of eelgrass biomass and
   growth during summer period on the south coast of the Korean peninsula
   were caused by high temperature inhibition effects on eelgrass growth
   during this season.},

Title = {Algorithm for the remote sensing of the Baltic ecosystem (DESAMBEM).

Pages = {451-508},
Abstract = {This article is the first of two papers on the remote sensing methods of
   monitoring the Baltic ecosystem, developed by our team. Earlier, we had
   produced a series of detailed mathematical models and statistical
   regularities describing the transport of solar radiation in the
   atmosphere-sea. system, the absorption of this radiation in the water
   and its utilisation in a variety of processes, most importantly in the
   photosynthesis occurring in phytoplankton cells, as a source of energy
   for the functioning of marine ecosystems. The, comprehensive DESAMBEM
   algorithm, presented in this paper, is a synthesis of these models and
   regularities. This algorithm enables the abiotic properties of the
   environment as well as the state and the functioning of the Baltic
   ecosystem to be assessed on the basis of available satellite data,. It
   can be used to determine a good number of these properties: the sea
   surface temperature, the natural irradiance of the sea surface, the
   spectral and spatial distributions of solar radiation energy in the
   water, the surface concentrations and vertical distributions of

Abstract = {Pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) is a method for converting salinity
   gradients to power by allowing water to flow through a semi-permeable
   membrane against an applied hydraulic pressure. PRO already has a long
   history, starting from the middle of the last century, and has rapidly
   improved in recent years. In this paper, we present a historical
   development of PRO since its inception: the development of this
   renewable energy process has gone through several stages, depending on
   technological developments, worldwide energy demands, and environmental
   concerns. The technological progress of the process is also studied, as
   well as its cost viability and environmental impact. Finally, some ideas
   to further develop the PRO process and mitigate its detrimental effects
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Mountainous basins like the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) of Gilgit Baltistan
   (GB) are dependent on seasonal snowmelt and glacier melt. Monitoring of
   the snow-covered area (SCA) is not only vital for the overall hydrology
   of the Indus basin but also important to the sustainable agriculture and
   hydropower system. The snow-covered area in the UIB of GB was
   investigated for changes over the last 18 years using the Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow product. The study
   area was divided into five elevation zones ranging from 877-8564 meters
   above sea level (m ASL). In contrast to the global cryosphere related
   studies, SCA in the UIB is slightly increasing. Elevation based SCA
   analysis also indicated that SCA is slightly increasing in each
   elevation zone. However, a significant amount of snow is concentrated in
   areas above 5000 m ASL. Due to the strong correlation between SCA and
   precipitation, the precipitation data also follow a similar trend.
   Analysis of the climatic data suggests a statistically significant
   increase in total monthly precipitation and relative humidity, a slight
   decrease in mean monthly temperature and a significant upward tendency
   in monthly solar irradiance data. All these trends in combination with
   the increasing trend in global precipitation, winter westerly
   disturbances and orographic precipitation are the important factors
   behind the slightly increasing SCA in the study area. Our results though
   constrained by short observation period mainly contribute to the
   understanding of advancing snow cover and glaciers in Hindukush
   Karakoram.},

Abstract = {Small mountain glaciers have short mass balance response times to
   climate change and are consequently very important for short-term
   contributions to sea level. However, a distinct research and knowledge
   gap exists between (1) wider regional studies that produce overview
   patterns and trends in glacier changes, and (2) in situ local scale
   studies that emphasise spatial heterogeneity and complexity in glacier
   responses to climate. This study of a small glacier in central Austria
   presents a spatiotemporally detailed analysis of changes in glacier
   geometry and changes in glaciological behaviour. It integrates
   geomorphological surveys, historical maps, aerial photographs, airborne
   LiDAR data, ground-based differential global positioning surveys and
   Ground Penetrating Radar surveys to produce three-dimensional glacier
   geometry at 13 time increments spanning from 1850 to 2013. Glacier
   length, area and volume parameters all generally showed reductions with
   time. The glacier equilibrium line altitude increased by 90 m between
   1850 and 2008. Calculations of the mean bed shear stress rapidly
   approaching less than 100 kPA, of the volume-area ratio fast approaching
   1.458, and comparison of the geometric reconstructions with a 1D
   theoretical model could together be interpreted to suggest evolution of
   the glacier geometry towards steady state. If the present linear trend
   in declining ice volume continues, then the odenwinkelkees will
   disappear by the year 2040, but we conceptualise that non-linear effects
   of bed overdeepenings on ice dynamics, of supraglacial debris cover on
   the surface energy balance, and of local topographically driven
   controls, namely wind-redistributed snow deposition, avalanching and
   solar shading, will become proportionally more important factors in the
   glacier net balance.},

Abstract = {Diverse management techniques have been used to mitigate conflicts
   between humans and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus)
   including harassment methods supplemented by lethal take. In this study
   we evaluated impacts of programs to harass spring migrating cormorants
   on the walleye (Sander vitreus) fishery in Brevoort Lake and the yellow
   perch (Perca flavescens) and walleye fisheries at Drummond Island.
   Cormorant foraging declined significantly (p<0.05) at both locations
   subsequent to initiation of harassment programs. Overall harassment
   deterred 90\% of cormorant foraging attempts while taking less than 6\%
   lethally on average at each site. Yellow perch were a predominate prey
   item in number and biomass at both locations. Walleye made up a small
   proportion of the diet at both locations. However, both walleye and
   yellow perch abundance increased significantly (p<0.05) at Drummond
   Island. Walleye abundance at age 3 increased to record levels in 2008
   following 3 years of cormorant management at Brevoort Lake. The
   estimated cormorant consumption of age-1 walleye in the absence of
   management at Brevoort Lake during 2005 would account for 55\% of the
   record 2006 age-1 walleye population. These results support the
   hypothesis that cormorant predation on spawning aggregations of
   sportfish was a significant mortality factor and cormorant management
   reduced sportfish mortality and increased abundance at both locations.
   Continuation of harassment programs and fishery assessments will
   determine whether improvement of targeted sport fisheries through
   control of spring migrating cormorants is sustainable. Published by

Volume = {14},
Number = {9},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Changes in total solar irradiance can be linked to changes in regional
   precipitation.  A possible mechanism responsible for this linkage begins
   with the absorption of varying amounts of solar energy by the tropical
   oceans, which creates ocean temperature anomalies.  These anomalies are
   then transported by major ocean currents to locations where the stored
   energy is released into the atmosphere, thereby altering atmospheric
   pressure and moisture patterns, which can ultimately affect regional
   precipitation.
   Correlation coefficients between annual differences in empirically
   modelled solar-irradiance variations and annual State-divisional
   precipitation in the USA for the period 1950-1988 were computed with lag
   times of 0 to 7 years.  The most significant correlations occur in the
   Pacific North-west, with a lag time of 4 years, which is approximately
   equal to the travel time of water within the Pacific gyre from the
   western tropical Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Alaska.  Precipitation in
   the Desert South-west correlates significantly with solar irradiance
   lagged 3 and 5 years, which suggests a link with ocean-water temperature
   anomalies transported by the Equatorial Counter Current as well as the
   North Pacific gyre.  With the correlations obtained, droughts coincide
   with periods of negative irradiance differences (dry high-pressure
   development), and wet periods coincide with periods of positive
   differences (moist low-pressure development).},

Title = {Export of particulate organic carbon by themountainous tropical rivers
   of Western Ghats, India: Variations and controls},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {751},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Transport of organic carbon by small mountainous rivers is essential,
   but the poorly constrained component of the global carbon cycle. In the
   current research, we sampled and analyzed particulate organic carbon
   (POC) contents from 70 sizeable tropical coastal rivers, draining the
   Western Ghats (WG) of India. This study aimed to investigate the
   spatiotemporal variability in POC contents, to estimate flux and to
   identify environmental controls on POC sources and transport
   characteristics across the region. The averaged value of organic carbon
   (OC) in the particulate samples is 3.24\%, and the mean POC
   concentration is 2.86 mg l(-1). We classified the samples based on total
   suspended matter (TSM) classes for source appropriation. Litter/riparian
   (42.5\%) pools are the largest source of organic matter, followed by
   autochthonous (36\%) and soil (21.5\%) for the WG region. However,
   locally autochthonous sources contribute exceptionally to POC pools,
   indicating a favorable environmental condition for the growth of algae
   and phytoplankton. Land-use \& land-cover, climate, topography, and
   sediment erosion seems to be determining the local variability in
   sources to POC pools and fluxes. The POC export rates suggest that
   within the region, the POC yields of the Deccan Trap (DT) and the
   Western Dharwar Craton (WDC) blocks are about two times higher than that
   of the Southern Granulite Terrain (SGT) region. With POC yield of 7.0 g
   m(-2) yr(-1), this region exports 0.79 Tg C (similar to 0.5\% of the
   global POC) to the Arabian Sea annually. The POC flux of the WG region
   (covering 0.25\% of Asia's land area) is approximately 1.0\% of Asia's
   riverine POC flux to the ocean. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Delineating the molecular responses of a halotolerant microalga using
   integrated omics approach to identify genetic engineering targets for
   enhanced TAG production},

Abstract = {BackgroundHarnessing the halotolerant characteristics of microalgae
   provides a viable alternative for sustainable biomass and
   triacylglyceride (TAG) production. Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 is a fast
   growing fresh water microalga that has the capability to thrive in high
   saline environments. To understand the microalga's adaptability, we
   studied its physiological and metabolic flexibility by studying
   differential protein, metabolite and lipid expression profiles using
   metabolomics, proteomics, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and
   lipidomics under high salinity conditions.ResultsOn exposure to
   salinity, the microalga rewired its cellular reserves and
   ultrastructure, restricted the ions channels, and modulated its surface
   potential along with secretion of extrapolysaccharide to maintain
   homeostasis and resolve the cellular damage. The algal-omics studies
   suggested a well-organized salinity-driven metabolic adjustment by the
   microalga starting from increasing the negatively charged lipids, up
   regulation of proline and sugars accumulation, followed by direction of
   carbon and energy flux towards TAG synthesis. Furthermore, the omics
   studies indicated both de-novo and lipid cycling pathways at work for
   increasing the overall TAG accumulation inside the microalgal
   cells.ConclusionThe salt response observed here is unique and is
   different from the well-known halotolerant microalga; Dunaliella salina,
   implying diversity in algal response with species. Based on the
   integrated algal-omics studies, four potential genetic targets belonging
   to two different metabolic pathways (salt tolerance and lipid
   production) were identified, which can be further tested in
   non-halotolerant algal strains.},

Abstract = {Securing decarbonized economies for energy and commodities will require
   abundant and widely available green H-2. Ubiquitous wastewaters and
   nontraditional water sources could potentially feed water electrolyzers
   to produce this green hydrogen without competing with drinking water
   sources. Herein, we show that the energy and costs of treating
   nontraditional water sources such as municipal wastewater, industrial
   and resource extraction wastewater, and seawater are negligible with
   respect to those for water electrolysis. We also illustrate that the
   potential hydrogen energy that could be mined from these sources is
   vast. Based on these findings, we evaluate the implications of
   small-scale, distributed water electrolysis using disperse
   nontraditional water sources. Techno-economic analysis and life cycle
   analysis reveal that the significant contribution of H-2 transportation
   to costs and CO2 emissions results in an optimal levelized cost of
   hydrogen at small-to moderate-scale water electrolyzer size. The
   implications of utilizing nontraditional water sources and decentralized
   or stranded renewable energy for distributed water electrolysis are
   highlighted for several hydrogen energy storage and chemical feedstock
   applications. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for
   mining H-2 from nontraditional water sources to achieve resilient and
   sustainable economies for water and energy.},

Journal = {GEOFIZIKA},

Volume = {26},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {115-143},
Abstract = {Fifteen open-sea time-series observations of tidal velocities and tidal
   bottom pressures for more than six months duration provide a new
   database for North Adriatic tides. The observations show nearly
   reversing tidal currents at most locations and increasing tidal-current
   strength near Istria. Tidal elevation amplitudes and phases respectively
   increase northwestward and counter-clockwise, strongly for semidiurnal
   tides and weakly for diurnal tides. The data are used for optimal
   determination of boundary conditions for a linear strong-constraint
   variational data assimilation model and the resulting average rms
   difference errors for tidal elevations and currents are below 1 cm and
   0.5 cm/s, respectively. The Q factors from the model are 14.0 for M-2
   and 22.4 for K-1, but comparisons between frictional dissipation
   estimated from the model and from the data suggest that model
   dissipation values could be too high by a factor of two and Q factors
   too small. Model potential energy is 1.5 times kinetic energy for M-2
   and 6.1 times kinetic energy for K-1. Observational and modeling results
   suggest that energy fluxes from Kvarner Bay are significant in the North
   Adriatic tidal energy balance. M-2 energy fluxes support the concept of
   an incident and reflected Kelvin wave in the North Adriatic with some
   modification. K-1 energy fluxes show a northeastward cross-basin flux
   near the 50 m isobath where the bathymetric slope is particularly steep,
   with Kelvin-wave-like structures north of the ridge and departures from
   Kelvin-wave structure south of the ridge.},

Abstract = {The development of an inorganic carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) in
   relation to the expression of extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA(ext))
   in cells from the stationary phase of Emiliamia huxleyi cultures was
   investigated. Unlike exponential phase cells, those in the stationary
   phase showed a high affinity for CO2: the K-0.5{[}CO2] (i.e. the CO2
   concentration required for half-maximal rate of photosynthesis) was 1.6
   mu M at pH 8.3. Measurement of the internal inorganic carbon
   concentration by the silicone oil centrifugation technique showed that,
   with 1 mM external dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), the intracellular
   inorganic carbon concentration was sixfold greater at pH 7.5 and twofold
   greater at pH 8.3, than the external concentration. The potent CA(ext)
   inhibitor, dextran-bound sulphonamide (DBS), gave an 80\% inhibition of
   DIC-dependent photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Similarly, DBS decreased
   the intracellular DIC concentration and inhibited photosynthetic
   (CO2)-C-14 fixation. The lipid-permeable CA inhibitor, ethoxyzolamide
   (EZ), increased the intracellular DIC concentration but inhibited
   photosynthetic (CO2)-C-14 fixation. The observed intracellular DIC
   concentrations indicated that the stationary phase cells have the
   capacity to transport CO2 actively against a concentration gradient.},

   management: Critical review and research directives. Journal of Coastal
   Research, 38(3), 654???672. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.
   Coastal regions mainly rely on sources of local fresh groundwater for
   domestic, irrigational, and industrial usages, which are vulnerable to
   high-risk of getting intruded by saltwater. Excessive pumping of fresh
   groundwater initiates advances of saltwater-freshwater interface inward
   due to hydraulic equilibrium and continuity. This introduces saline
   water intrusion into coastal aquifers. This is also caused by natural
   hazards like sea-level rise and storm-surge. The saltwater intrusion in
   coastal aquifers contaminates the freshwater storage, thereby emerging
   as a major environmental issue. To incorporate adequate coastal
   groundwater control and management techniques that are effective and
   conveniently implementable, understanding the phenomenon of saline water
   intrusion and the risk assessment is of utmost importance. Several
   scientific contributions including theoretical (analytical and
   numerical) solutions, experimental (laboratory and field) results,
   design recommendations, and risk analysis are available, indicating
   remarkable advances in the research area. The authors have attempted to
   summarize the significant contributions over the last few decades in
   each of these study aspects through extensive literature survey and
   critical analysis of the existing knowledge. It is observed that risk
   prevention and control methodologies such as qanat-well structure,
   shallow and deep wells might not be effective in many coastal areas as
   the complex intrusion process is yet to be understood clearly. Moreover,
   the high intensity coastal hazards that often occur due to climate
   change continue to make aquifers more vulnerable, adversely affecting
   the coastal groundwater management. The paper presents a critical
   overview of existing studies on saline water intrusion into coastal
   aquifers and associated risks and management techniques. Furthermore,
   adequate research directives with recommendations for future development
   are also provided.},

Title = {Burrowing herbivores alter soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a

Abstract = {Activities of burrowing herbivores, including movement of soil and
   litter and deposition of waste material, can alter the distribution of
   labile carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil, affecting spatial patterning
   of nutrient dynamics in ecosystems where they are abundant. Their role
   in ecosystem processes in surface soil has been studied extensively, but
   effects of burrowing species on processes in subsurface soil remain
   poorly known. We investigated the effects of burrowing and grazing by
   plains vizcachas (Lagostomus maximus, Chinchilidae), a large colonial
   burrowing rodent native to South America, on the distribution and
   dynamics of C and N in soil of a semi-arid scrub ecosystem in central
   Argentina. In situ N mineralization (N-min), potential N-min and CO2
   emissions were measured in surface soil (0-10 cm) and soil at the mean
   depth of burrows (65 +/- 10 cm; mean +/- 1 SD) in five colonial burrow
   systems and adjacent grazed and ungrazed zones. Decomposition and N
   dynamics of vizcacha feces on the soil surface and in burrow soil was
   assessed using litterbags. Total C and N in soil in burrows were 1.6 and
   5.5 times greater than in undisturbed soil at similar depths, and
   similar to amounts in surface soil. Inorganic N, particularly NO3-, was
   consistently highest in burrows, intermediate in surface soil on burrow
   systems, and relatively low in all other zones. Despite high C and N
   content in all burrows, in situ net Nmin was highly variable in burrow
   soil. Feces decomposed and released N more rapidly in burrow soil.
   Laboratory incubations indicated that soil moisture limited Nmin under
   conditions that typically characterize burrow microclimate, and that
   rates increased dramatically at soil moisture contents >25\% field
   capacity, which likely occurs during pulsed rainfall events. Thus, the
   high and seasonally stable NOT content in burrow soil likely originated

   Burrowing and waste deposition by vizcachas produced ``resource
   islands{''} at the landscape scale. At a measured density of 0.3 burrow
   systems per hectare, colonial burrow soil contained an amount of
   inorganic N equal to 21\% and 30\% of plant-available N in surface soil
   and subsurface soil, respectively, in an area that represented only
   0.35\% of the landscape. Our study indicates that burrowing and
   deposition of waste results in a highly active subsurface layer in which
   C and N dynamics function much like surface soil when soil moisture is
   not limiting. (C) Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the use of numerical simulations for the design
   and optimization of parts with complicated shapes made from composite
   materials. An airbox designed for a light single-seat racing car was
   chosen as a representative example. The numerical analysis is primarily
   focused on the maximum reduction of the mass of the component while
   retaining adequate stiffness and strength and also taking into account
   the manufacturing technology of the component. Carbon composite fabrics
   in combination with high performance epoxy resin were used to ensure the
   maximum stiffness of the part. In order to find the best option, an
   advanced CAE simulation based on the Finite Element Method was used with
   a special module designated directly for creating models from
   alternative materials. Zone-based and ply-based FE models were created
   to find the optimal layout of the individual plies of the laminate.
   Maximum stress failure criterion was used to evaluate the strength of
   the part. A 3D model for the numerical simulation follows all the layers
   of the composite materials, including cuts, notches, resin drops and
   precise calculation of the main directions of the fibres and their
   distortion or overlap caused by more complex shaped surfaces.},

Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {47},

Pages = {329-351},
Abstract = {The role of organic carbon input, sedimentation rate and bottom water
   oxygenation (BWO) for organic matter (OM) degradation was investigated
   using surface sediments collected from above, within and below the
   oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) within varying sedimentary regimes along the
   Pakistan continental margin. For this, samples from 47 box cores and
   multi cores were analyzed for their bulk component (organic carbon,
   total nitrogen, carbonate, opal) and amino acid concentrations, The
   results are compared to plankton net samples from the Arabian Sea,
   sinking particles collected at the Pakistan continental margin, cultured
   sedimentary deep-sea bacteria, and data from the deep Arabian Sea
   basins. High organic carbon and amino acid concentrations were found in
   the laminated sediments of the OMZ, in bioturbated sediments immediately
   below the OMZ, and below regions of high productivity in the western
   Arabian Sea. The contribution of amino acids to organic carbon and total
   nitrogen as well as the molar contribution of certain non-protein amino
   acids do not mirror these differences in OC contents. No clear trend in
   relation to sediment structure or water depth is observed. In contrast
   to these established indicators of OM degradation, the molar
   contribution of the aromatic amino acid tyrosine (Tyr) exhibits a
   distinct pattern. Its contribution is relatively high in sediments at
   depths above the OMZ and further increases towards the center of the
   OMZ. Below the OMZ, it decreases continuously with increasing water
   depth. In addition, for samples from similar depths and bottom water
   oxygen contents Tyr shows systematic differences between varying
   sedimentary regimes. The lack of a distinct trend for the established
   indicators does not support the idea of a predominant control of BWO on
   quantitative OM preservation. Nevertheless, the variability of Tyr in
   relation to water depth or the sedimentary regime suggests that (i) the
   productivity-related OC input, (ii) the bulk accumulation rate, and
   (iii) BWO influence the alteration of the sedimentary OM by controlling
   its oxygen exposure rime. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {What is a larva, if it is not what survives of an ancestor's adult,
   compressed into a transient pre-reproductive phase, as suggested by
   Haeckel's largely disreputed model of evolution by recapitulation? A
   recently published article hypothesizes that larva and adult of
   holometabolous insects are developmental expressions of two different
   genomes coexisting in the same animal as a result of an ancient
   hybridization event between an onychophoran and a primitive insect with
   eventless postembryonic development. More likely, however, larvae
   originated from late embryonic or early post-embryonic stages of
   ancestors with direct development. Evolutionary novelties would thus be
   intercalary rather than terminal, with respect to the ancestor's
   ontogenetic schedule. This scenario, supported by current research on
   holometabolous insects and marine invertebrates with complex life
   cycles, offers a serious alternative to the traditional scenario ('what
   is early in ontogeny is also early in phylogeny') underlying the current
   perception of the evolution of genetic regulatory networks.},

Title = {Green synthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles via plant
   extracts: an overview},
Journal = {MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recently, a biological approach to synthesizing materials via
   environmentally friendly green chemistry-based techniques involving
   natural materials such as plants, bacteria, fungi, seaweed,
   polysaccharides, biodegradable polymers, plant-derived materials and
   algae has been employed as an alternative method for the synthesis of
   metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. With increasing enthusiasm for
   efficient green chemistry, biosynthetic routes for fabricating
   nanoparticles have aroused much interest because they are
   environmentally benign, simple, economic, and clean technology; they do
   not involve hazardous chemicals, and they have zero contaminants and
   by-products. Of these bio-entities, plant extracts have received great
   attention due to their ability to reduce and stabilize metal
   nanoparticles in a single-step synthesis using their distinct natural
   traits. Due to their diverse and complex compositions, natural organic
   phytoconstituent biomolecules existing in plant extracts such as
   alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, terpenoids and tannins act as
   reducing and stabilizing agents. This paper provides an updated review
   of recent literature on metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, such as
   those containing silver, gold, palladium, platinum, zinc oxide, iron,
   titanium, ceria and magnetite, and the transformations, directions and
   current uses of green synthesis methods using plant extracts. The
   challenges, limiting factors and future direction of the plant-based
   synthesis of metal nanoparticles are also highlighted in this review.},

Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization and environmental protection
   agencies have formulated relevant treaties to control SOX emissions from
   ships for air pollution; however, the current technology application has
   not achieved effective online detection. To adapt to the future trend of
   development, this research develops a marine diesel SOX online detection
   system based on LabVIEW. This paper first discusses the principle of SOX
   detection, then designs the overall scheme of marine diesel engine SOX
   online detection system based on LabVIEW, and finally develops the
   hardware and software of the detection system. The detection system
   includes two parts: hardware and software. The hardware is mainly
   composed of a gas pretreatment module, a SOX sensor module, a USB CAN
   analysis module and PC and so on. Two types of software are developed:
   the USB CAN analysis module software and the upper computer software
   based on LabVIEW. With the help of USB CAN analysis module software, the
   problem that SOX sensor module cannot communicate with PC directly by
   USB interface is solved effectively. The SOX online detection system of
   marine diesel engine based on LabVIEW reduces the development cost and
   cycle, and its upper computer interface is intuitive and easy to

   geothermal systems},
Journal = {GEOTHERMAL ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mechanical (flexural and uniaxial compressive strengths) and physical
   (thermal conductivity) properties of two new bentonitic grouts doped
   with 5 and 10\% of graphite powder are discussed in this work and
   evaluated for their potential use in low-enthalpy geothermal
   applications. The same tests have been also conducted on a pure starting
   material (bentonitic grout) already present on the market and used to
   seal geothermal probes into boreholes. Experimental data show that the
   addition of 5 and 10\% of graphite powder positively alters the
   mechanical properties of the doped bentonitic grouts, i.e., both
   flexural and uniaxial compressive strengths increased with respect to
   those of the pure material. Thermal conductivity also improved up to
   60\% in the doped bentonitic grouts. A simple analysis of the
   cost/benefit ratio suggests, however, that the bentonitic grouts doped
   with 5\% of graphite powder is more suitable and competitive for a
   launch on the market and utilization as a sealing material in boreholes
   aimed at low-enthalpy geothermal installations. Implementation of
   thermal properties of the grout material implicates a reduction of the
   total borehole length of 15-20\%.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to investigate spectral solar radiation effect on
   the air flow and temperature distributions in a passenger compartment.
   For achieving this goal, transmittance and reflectance for different
   glass types were measured to analyze the spectral characteristics of
   windshield by using a spectrophotometer. Using the measurement data,
   extensive CFD simulations were conducted for three different cases by
   using the commercial CFD software (ANSYS Fluent 13.0) based on the
   discrete ordinates method in solving radiative energy transfer equation.
   It was found that 99\% of solar energy intensively existed in the
   wavelength range between 280 nm and 2500 nm on the basis of the standard
   solar spectrum (ASTM G173). In particular, strong deflection of air
   flows were observed near the front seat and it could generate higher
   mixing region due to the complex vortical flows. Considering the
   spectral effect, the predicted temperature in the compartment increased
   by approximately 3 degrees C, resulting from spectral variation of
   transmittance and reflectance. Therefore, the spectral solar radiation
   effect should be considered for more accurate prediction of air flow and
   thermal fields in the compartment. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Title = {Peculiar diffusion of C-60 on In-adsorbed Si(111)root 3 x root 3-Au
   surface},

Abstract = {In-accumulated Si(111)root 3 x root 3-Au surface represents a
   highly-ordered homogeneous Au/Si(111) reconstruction with a
   two-dimensional gas of In adatoms on it. Regularities of C-60 migration
   on this surface have been elucidated through analysis of C-60 island
   density as a function of growth temperature and deposition rate in the
   framework of the rate equation theory and simulation of C-60 migration
   using density-functional-theory calculations. The critical cluster size
   has been found to be i = 1 for the whole temperature range studied, from
   110 to 240 K, while activation energy for C-60 diffusion varies from (99
   +/- 18) meV at 110 divided by 140 K to (370 +/- 24) meV at 160 divided
   by 240 K. This finding has been accounted to the peculiarity of C-60
   migration in a labyrinth built of In adatoms on the Si(111)root 3 x root
   3-Au surface, namely, at low temperatures C-60 migration is confined
   within the labyrinth channels, while at high temperatures C-60 molecules
   possess enough thermal energy to surmount the labyrinth walls. (C) 2013

Abstract = {According to long-term wind speed measurements the Aegean Archipelago
   possesses excellent wind potential, hence properly designed wind energy
   applications can substantially contribute to fulfill the energy
   requirements of the island societies. On top of this, in Most islands
   the electricity production cost is extremely high, while significant
   insufficient power supply problems are often encountered, especially
   during the summer. Unfortunately, the stochastic behaviour of the wind
   and the important fluctuations of daily and seasonal electricity load
   pose a strict penetration limit for the contribution of wind energy in
   the corresponding load demand. The application of this limit is
   necessary in order to avoid hazardous electricity grid fluctuations and
   to protect the existing thermal power units from operating near or below
   their technical minima. In this context, the main target of the proposed
   study is to present an integrated methodology able to estimate the
   maximum wind energy penetration in autonomous electrical grids on the
   basis of the available wind potential existing in the Aegean Archipelago
   area. For this purpose a large number of representative wind potential
   types have been investigated and interesting conclusions have been
   derived. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Photosynthetic primary production, the basis of most global food chains,
   is inhibited by UV radiation, Evaluating UV inhibition is therefore
   important for assessing the role of natural levels of UV radiation in
   regulating ecosystem behavior as well as the potential impact of
   stratospheric ozone depletion on global ecosystems, As both
   photosynthesis and UV fluxes :are subject to diurnal variations, we
   examined the diurnal variability of the effect of UV radiation on
   photosynthesis in three diverse algal mats, In one of the mats
   (Cyanidium caldarium) a small mean decrease in primary productivity over
   the whole day occurred when both UVA and UVB were screened out. In two
   of the mats (Lyngbya aestuarii and Zygogonium sp,) we found a mean
   increase in the total primary productivity over the day when UVB alone
   was screened and a further increase when UVA and UVB were both screened
   out. Variations in the effects of UV radiation were found at different
   times of the day. This diurnal variability may be because even under the
   same solar radiation flux, there are different factors that may control
   photosynthetic rate, including nutritional status and other
   physiological processes ill the cell. The results show the importance of
   assessing the complete diurnal productivity. For some of the time points
   the increase in the mean was still within the standard deviations in
   primary productivity, illustrating the difficulty in dissecting UV
   effects from other natural variations.},

Abstract = {The Magdalena River mouth in Colombia is studied as a candidate site for
   a renewable power plant via osmotic energy technology, using pressure
   retarded osmosis. This power generation plant would operate through the
   controlled mix of two flows with different salinities (river water and
   seawater in this case study). A preliminary design of a pressure
   retarded osmosis power plant is proposed here by means of experimental
   data acquisition on-site at the river mouth. The obtained net power
   production is shown to reach 6 MW, with adequate membrane power
   densities above 5 W/m(2). These promising results consider energetic
   losses involved in the process, which have been further analysed to
   propose improvement targets in pretreatment processes and membrane

Title = {Modeling the state of marine ecosystems: A case study of the Okhotsk Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {194},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We provide an efficient tool for the processing of a large volume of
   data (big data) from a marine ecosystem and predicting its status,
   including its complex and nonlinear biological structure (biocomplexity)
   and its ability to remain alive or continue to exist (survivability).
   The Geoecological Information-Modeling System developed earlier by the
   authors of this paper is used for the first time as a basis for the
   development of the Sea Ecosystem Model that parameterizes the energy
   exchange between major trophic components of the sea with spatial
   resolution 1/6 degrees x 1/6 degrees taking into account natural and
   anthropogenic factors. In particular, the dependence of energy exchange
   processes on environmental factors is modeled with a minimum level of
   uncertainty. The biological components are modeled using traditional
   trophic balance equations, whose coefficients are determined from
   observational data. The simulation results for the Okhotsk Sea show the
   critical ecosystem states that prevail when the biocomplexity and
   survivability of this ecosystem reach dangerous levels. The prediction
   of the ecosystem status is carried out to 2100 with an accuracy of
   better than 79.9\%. For this purpose, the complex model proposed
   recently by the same authors, entitled ``nature-society system
   model{''}, was used. Among the main results that have emerged is that
   the biocomplexity and survivability characteristics of this marine
   ecosystem will be stable over the next 100 years, regardless of the
   expected climate change.},

Title = {Predicting the risk of cedar leaf blight (Didymascella thujina) in

Year = {2013},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {152-163},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Cedar leaf blight (Didymascella thujina) is considered to be the most
   important disease of western redcedar in British Columbia. The disease
   is most prevalent in warm-moist coastal low-elevation environments
   causing mortality among seedlings and significant loss of incremental
   growth and branch death among mature trees. In this study we used a
   principle component regression model to spatially project the disease
   risk under observed climate (2003-2008) and multiple future climate
   scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. We found that while the
   majority of future climate scenarios predicted coastal environments will
   continue to favor occurrence of the disease, intensity is predicted to
   decrease toward the 2080s. Projected reductions of available summer
   climate moisture (cumulative precipitation - potential
   evapotranspiration), corresponding to the time of ascospore discharge
   and germination, contribute significantly to this finding. Disease
   intensity is however, projected to increase under moderate temperature
   and precipitation increases for the 2020s. We therefore recommend
   current reforestation efforts deploy disease resistant western redcedar
   seedlots in high risk environments common to hypermaritime coastal
   regions such as Haida Gwaii and northern maritime, to avoid significant
   mortality and growth reduction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Robust extraction of baseline signal of atmospheric trace species using

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2613-2624},
Abstract = {The identification of atmospheric trace species measurements that are
   representative of well-mixed background air masses is required for
   monitoring atmospheric composition change at background sites. We
   present a statistical method based on robust local regression that is
   well suited for the selection of background measurements and the
   estimation of associated baseline curves. The bootstrap technique is
   applied to calculate the uncertainty in the resulting baseline curve.
   The non-parametric nature of the proposed approach makes it a very
   flexible data filtering method. Application to carbon monoxide (CO)
   measured from 1996 to 2009 at the high-alpine site Jungfraujoch
   (Switzerland, 3580 ma.s.l.), and to measurements of 1,1-difluoroethane
   (HFC-152a) from Jungfraujoch (2000 to 2009) and Mace Head (Ireland, 1995
   to 2009) demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The characteristics of the urban heat island effect and the climate
   change in Shanghai and its possible mechanism are analyzed based on
   monthly meteorological data from 1961 to 1997 at 16 stations in Shanghai
   and its adjacent areas. The results indicate that Shanghai City has the
   characteristics of a heat island of air temperature and maximum and
   minimum air temperature, a cold island of surface soil temperature, a
   weak rainy island of precipitation, and a turbid island of minimum
   visibility and aerosols, with centers at or near Longhua station (the
   urban station of Shanghai). Besides theses, the characteristics of a
   cloudy island and sunshine duration island are also obvious, but their
   centers are located in the southern part of the urban area and in the
   southern suburbs. A linear trend analysis suggests that all of the above
   urban effects intensified from 1961 to 1997. So far as the heat island
   effect is concerned, the heat island index (difference of annual
   temperature between Longhua and Songjiang stations) strengthens
   (weakens) as the economic development increases (decreases). The authors
   suggest that the heating increase caused by increasing energy
   consumption due to economic development is a main factor in controlling
   the climate change of Shanghai besides natural factors. On the other
   hand, increasing pollution aerosols contribute to the enhancement of the
   turbid island and cooling. On the whole, the heating effect caused by
   increasing energy consumption is stronger than the cooling effect caused
   by the turbid island and pollution aerosols.},

Title = {Development of Waterborne Heavy-Duty Anticorrosive Coatings with
   Modified Nanoscale Titania},
Journal = {COATINGS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The steel structures of coastal engineering in the moist tropics and
   subtropics are always under a C5/CX level corrosion environment with
   high temperature, high humidity, and high salt fog. Anticorrosive
   waterborne coatings with high weatherability and reliability are
   urgently to be developed. In this work, one kind of waterborne
   heavy-duty anticorrosive coatings, with the advantages of excellent
   corrosion resistance, self-repairing ability, self-cleaning ability, and
   high film compactness, was successfully achieved through modifying the
   side chains on the surface morphologies of the spherical nanoscale
   titania. The micromorphology and structure of the coating were
   characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission
   electron microscope (TEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM). The
   anticorrosion characteristics and forming mechanism of the modified
   nanoscale titania coating were analyzed. The salt spray tests showed
   that the neutral salt spray resistance time of the modified nanoscale
   titania coating was 1440 h. Its durability reached the H level and met
   the design requirements for 15 years of anticorrosion lifetime. The
   modified nanoscale titania coatings had been large-scale commercially
   applied at some typical steel structures under an extreme harsh
   corrosion environment in one coastal thermal power plant. The results
   showed that no rusting, peeling, or crack phenomena were observed after
   3 years of service under different harsh coastal corrosion conditions.},

Title = {Relative performance of tracking versus fixed tilt photovoltaic systems

Volume = {22},

Pages = {1302-1315},

Abstract = {Tracking systems can increase the amount of electricity generated by
   photovoltaic (PV) modules, by actively orienting each module to
   intercept more solar energy. We find that horizontal one-axis tracking
   systems can increase PV generation by 12-25\% relative to south-facing
   fixed mount PV systems with 25 degrees tilts in the contiguous USA, and
   two-axis tracking systems can increase PV generation by 30-45\% relative
   to fixed mount systems. Tracking systems increase PV generation more
   significantly in arid regions such as the southwest USA than in humid
   regions with persistent cloud cover such as the Pacific Northwest and
   coastal Atlantic states. We find that fixed and tracking PV systems have
   similar interannual variability in their generation profiles, and this
   variability is primarily driven by project location. Tracking PV
   projects cost more than fixed tilt systems, per unit capacity, and we
   explore how much more tracking projects could cost while generating
   similar levelized costs of energy as fixed tilt systems. We define this
   as the breakeven additional cost of tracking and find that it is
   primarily driven by three factors: (i) regional tracking performance,
   (ii) fixed tilt system costs that tracking projects compete against, and
   (iii) additional tracking operation and maintenance costs. Using this
   framework, we explore the relative competitiveness of tracking systems
   for a range of fixed and tracking PV prices and evaluate how tracking
   competitiveness varies by region. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {Exploration for placer deposits, especially for ilmenites, has been
   undertaken systematically in the southern coast of Tamil Nadu, India. On
   the basis of drainage network. Coastal landforms, lithology, and
   neotectonics, the study area has been grouped into five sectors:
   Mandapam, Valinokkam, Tuticorin, Manappad, and Kanyakumari. Ilmenites
   are abundant in Kanyakumari (Max. 53.39 wt\%) and Tuticorin (Max. 20.88
   wt\%) sectors, negligible in Manappad (Max. 0.60 wt\%) and Valinokkam
   (Max. 3.88 wt\%) sectors and absent in the Mandapam sector. The abnormal
   enrichment of ilmenites in the Kanyakumari sector in the absence of any
   drainage network points to the possibility of a relict source. Literary
   and scientific evidence corroborates the existence of an Eastern
   Gondwana land called Lemuria, South of Kanyakumari which was later
   submerged in the Flandrian transgression. The association of other heavy
   minerals with ilmenites like overgrown and outgrown zircon supplements
   the idea of a longer stay of ilmenites in the depositional basin.
   Ilmenites from these fossil strandlines must have been reworked by the
   present day coastal processes and deposited in favorable bay-like NE-SW
   coastal configurations in Kanyakumari-Kuttankuli and Kallar-Vaippar
   regions under high energy wave conditions. The present study has
   disclosed the enrichment of ilmenites up to 1m in depth in the above two
   zones which can be commercially exploited. The present study also calls
   for confirming part of the lost continent called Lemuria or Eastern
   Gondwana by systematic scientific investigations.},

Title = {Cryptic lineage differentiation among Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins

Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Phylogeography can provide insight into the potential for speciation and
   identify geographic regions and evolutionary processes associated with
   species richness and evolutionary endemism. In the marine environment,
   highly mobile species sometimes show structured patterns of diversity,
   but the processes isolating populations and promoting differentiation
   are often unclear. The Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) are a striking
   case in point and, in particular, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.).
   Understanding the radiation of species in this genus is likely to
   provide broader inference about the processes that determine patterns of
   biogeography and speciation, because both fine-scale structure over a
   range of kilometers and relative panmixia over an oceanic range are
   known for Tursiops populations. In our study, novel Tursiops spp.
   sequences from the northwest Indian Ocean (including mitogenomes and two
   nuDNA loci) are included in a worldwide Tursiops spp. phylogeographic
   analysis. We discover a new `aduncus' type lineage in the Arabian Sea
   (off India, Pakistan and Oman) that diverged from the Australasian
   lineage similar to 261 Ka. Effective management of coastal dolphins in
   the region will need to consider this new lineage as an evolutionarily
   significant unit. We propose that the establishment of this lineage
   could have been in response to climate change during the Pleistocene and
   show data supporting hypotheses for multiple divergence events,
   including vicariance across the Indo-Pacific barrier and in the
   northwest Indian Ocean. These data provide valuable transferable
   inference on the potential mechanisms for population and species
   differentiation across this geographic range.},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {In many coastal locations, seagrass meadows are part of a greater
   seascape that includes both marine and terrestrial elements, each linked
   to the other via the foraging patterns of consumers (both predators and
   herbivores), and the passive drift of seagrass propagules, leaves, roots
   and rhizomes, and seagrass-associated macroalgal detritus. With
   seagrasses declining in many regions, the linkages between seagrass
   meadows and other habitats are being altered and diminished. Thus, it is
   timely to summarize what is known about the prevalence and magnitude of
   cross-habitat exchanges of seagrass-derived energy and materials, and to
   increase awareness of the importance of seagrasses to adjacent and even
   distant habitats. To do so we examined the literature on the extent and
   importance of exchanges of biomass between seagrass meadows and other
   habitats, both in the form of exported seagrass biomass as well as
   transfers of animal biomass via migration. Data were most abundant for
   Caribbean coral reefs and Australian beaches, and organisms for which
   there were quantitative estimates included Caribbean fishes and North
   American migratory waterfowl. Overall, data from the studies we reviewed
   clearly showed that seagrass ecosystems provide a large subsidy to both
   near and distant locations through the export of particulate organic
   matter and living plant and animal biomass. The consequences of
   continuing seagrass decline thus extend far beyond the areas where
   seagrasses grow.},

Abstract = {The anchorage system for mid-ocean loading or production consists of an
   articulated tower for mooring the tanker.  Flexible risers are also
   essential components of the anchorage system.  The present paper
   provides a state-of-the-art review on articulated storage systems and
   flexible risers, giving theoretical background for the development of
   computer software for the static analysis of flexible risers.
   In the state-of-the-art review for flexible risers, various analysis
   techniques for elastic lines and flexible risers under self-weight,
   current and wave forces are presented.  The dynamic response of the
   flexible riser, including vortex-induced oscillations, is also outlined.
   The literature concerning the articulated tower and tanker is relatively
   scarce.  Available works relate only to dynamic responses of articulated
   towers.  The combined response of tower and tanker is only studied by
   Chakrabarti and Cotter {[}(1978), Analysis of a tower-tanker system.  In
   Proceedings of the 10th Offshore Technology Conference, OTC 3202, pp.
   1301-1310] in a limited sense.  The review of these works is summarised
   relevant to this paper.
   In the end, the static analysis of the flexible riser under its
   self-weight and current is presented using a finite difference approach.
   The problem essentially involves geometrical non-linearity, which is
   tackled with the help of an iterative solution based on modified
   Newton-Raphson technique.  The theoretical formulation presented is
   being used to develop the computer software for the static analysis of
   the flexible risers.},

Abstract = {Mesoscale variability and eddy shedding in the Tasman Sea, particularly
   of the East Australian Current (EAC), is studied through the analysis of
   remotely sensed observations and outputs from a global ocean model.
   Previous observations of the western boundary current separation from
   the coast showed strong variability at periods ranging between 90 and
   140 days. We show from satellite altimetric observations that rapid
   northward migration of the separation point of the EAC follows the
   formation of large eddies at periods of similar to 100 days. After an
   eddy separation event the normally southward flowing current swiftly
   assumes a more zonal configuration near the separation latitude, with a
   cyclonic circulation developing inshore. The formation of large
   separation eddies is preceded by the southward propagation of sea level
   anomalies along the east Australian continental slope. From 25 degrees
   S, sea level anomalies grow as they travel south, eventually being
   pinched off in the form of large anticyclones at similar to 32 degrees
   S, in the current retroflection area. Energy conversion terms in a
   global ocean model and in altimetric data suggest both barotropic and
   baroclinic instability may account for the growth of these anomalies as
   they propagate south. East of the main EAC jet there is evidence that
   eddies may be feeding potential energy back to the mean flow.},

Title = {Deep Carbon Cycling Over the Past 200 Million Years: A Review of Fluxes
   in Different Tectonic Settings},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Carbon is a key control on the surface chemistry and climate of Earth.
   Significant volumes of carbon are input to the oceans and atmosphere
   from deep Earth in the form of degassed CO2 and are returned to large
   carbon reservoirs in the mantle via subduction or burial. Different
   tectonic settings (e.g., volcanic arcs, mid-ocean ridges, and
   continental rifts) emit fluxes of CO2 that are temporally and spatially
   variable, and together they represent a first-order control on carbon
   outgassing from the deep Earth. A change in the relative importance of
   different tectonic settings throughout Earth's history has therefore
   played a key role in balancing the deep carbon cycle on geological
   timescales. Over the past 10 years the Deep Carbon Observatory has made
   enormous progress in constraining estimates of carbon outgassing flux at
   different tectonic settings. Using plate boundary evolution modeling and
   our understanding of present-day carbon fluxes, we develop time series
   of carbon fluxes into and out of the Earth's interior through the past
   200 million years. We highlight the increasing importance of
   carbonate-intersecting subduction zones over time to carbon outgassing,
   and the possible dominance of carbon outgassing at continental rift
   zones, which leads to maxima in outgassing at 130 and 15 Ma. To a
   first-order, carbon outgassing since 200 Ma may be net positive,
   averaging similar to 50 Mt C yr(-1) more than the ingassing flux at
   subduction zones. Our net outgassing curve is poorly correlated with
   atmospheric CO2, implying that surface carbon cycling processes play a
   significant role in modulating carbon concentrations and/or there is a
   long-term crustal or lithospheric storage of carbon which modulates the
   outgassing flux. Our results highlight the large uncertainties that
   exist in reconstructing the corresponding in- and outgassing fluxes of
   carbon. Our synthesis summarizes our current understanding of fluxes at
   tectonic settings and their influence on atmospheric CO2, and provides a
   framework for future research into Earth's deep carbon cycling, both
   today and in the past.},

Title = {Particle size distribution and estimated carbon flux across the Arabian
   Sea oxygen minimum zone},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Number = {16},
Pages = {4541-4557},
Abstract = {The goal of the Arabian Sea section of the TARA oceans expedition was to
   study large particulate matter (LPM > 100 mu m) distributions and
   possible impact of associated midwater biological processes on vertical
   carbon export through the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of this region. We
   propose that observed spatial patterns in LPM distribution resulted from
   the timing and location of surface phytoplankton bloom, lateral
   transport, microbial processes in the core of the OMZ, and enhanced
   biological processes mediated by bacteria and zooplankton at the lower
   oxycline. Indeed, satellite-derived net primary production maps showed
   that the northern stations of the transect were under the influence of a
   previous major bloom event while the most southern stations were in a
   more oligotrophic situation. Lagrangian simulations of particle
   transport showed that deep particles of the northern stations could
   originate from the surface bloom while the southern stations could be
   considered as driven by 1-D vertical processes. In the first 200 m of
   the OMZ core, minima in nitrate concentrations and the intermediate
   nepheloid layer (INL) coincided with high concentrations of 100 mu m <
   LPM < 200 mu m. These particles could correspond to colonies of bacteria
   or detritus produced by anaerobic microbial activity. However, the
   calculated carbon flux through this layer was not affected. Vertical
   profiles of carbon flux indicate low flux attenuation in the OMZ, with a
   Martin model b exponent value of 0.22. At three stations, the lower
   oxycline was associated to a deep nepheloid layer, an increase of
   calculated carbon flux and an increase in mesozooplankton abundance.
   Enhanced bacterial activity and zooplankton feeding in the deep OMZ is
   proposed as a mechanism for the observed deep particle aggregation.
   Estimated lower flux attenuation in the upper OMZ and re-aggregation at
   the lower oxycline suggest that OMZ may be regions of enhanced carbon
   flux to the deep sea relative to non OMZ regions.},

Abstract = {Beaded streams are prominent across the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of
   Alaska, yet prey flow and food web dynamics supporting fish inhabiting
   these streams are poorly understood. Arctic grayling (Thymallus
   arcticus) are a widely distributed upper-level consumer on the ACP and
   migrate into beaded streams to forage during the short 3-month
   open-water season. We investigated energy pathways and key prey
   resources that support grayling in a representative beaded stream, Crea
   Creek. We measured terrestrial invertebrates entering the stream from
   predominant riparian vegetation types, prey types supporting a range of
   fish size classes, and how riparian plants and fish size influenced
   foraging habits. We found that riparian plants influenced the quantity
   of terrestrial invertebrates entering Crea Creek; however, these
   differences were not reflected in fish diets. Prey type and size
   ingested varied with grayling size and season. Small grayling (<15 cm
   fork length (FL)) consumed mostly aquatic invertebrates early in the
   summer, and terrestrial invertebrates later in summer, while larger fish
   (>15 cm FL) foraged most heavily on ninespine stickleback (Pungitius
   pungitius) throughout the summer, indicating that grayling can be
   insectivorous and piscivorous, depending on size. These findings
   underscore the potential importance of small streams in Arctic
   ecosystems as key summer foraging habitats for fish. Understanding
   trophic pathways supporting stream fishes in these systems will help
   interpret whether and how petroleum development and climate change may
   affect energy flow and stream productivity, terrestrial-aquatic linkages
   and fishes in Arctic ecosystems.},

Title = {Climate-based prioritization of data collection for monitoring wintering

Abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the threat that climate change poses to
   species, as areas of climatic suitability contract or shift across the
   landscape. North American Neotropical long-distant migrant bird species
   present a unique problem compared to sedentary species because climate
   change may differ significantly across their breeding and wintering
   grounds. Studying the potential future distributions of these birds is
   challenging on many levels, including the fact that our understanding of
   the wintering grounds of these species is quite poor. To address this
   issue, we analyse available eBird data during the winter season in the
   Western Hemisphere in an effort to further promote and direct citizen
   science efforts to focus on areas that are climatically undersampled. We
   used Mobility-Oriented Parity (MOP) to understand the areas where
   climates are most dissimilar from climates sampled by existing eBird
   checklists, creating a map that ranks the western hemisphere at a 10 km
   resolution for climatic sampling during the winter season. We found that
   parts of Mexico and Central America, areas of Colombia, almost the
   entire Amazon Basin, coastal Peru and Chile, and northern Argentina are
   climatically undersampled. As a test case, we then used the map of
   survey priorities to simulate additional sampling in Colombia and
   recalculated the rankings. Guiding additional sampling with the
   priorities reduced climate dissimilarities between sampled and unsampled
   grid cells more than when additional sampling expanded in proportion to
   current sampling efforts or based on geographic undersampling. Analyses
   of sampling coverage in environmental space, such as this, will be a
   useful tool for targeting monitoring effort for bird species.},

Abstract = {In an underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) link, power
   fluctuations over finite-sized collecting lens are investigated for a
   horizontally propagating Gaussian beam wave. The power scintillation
   index, also known as the irradiance flux variance, for the received
   irradiance is evaluated in weak oceanic turbulence by using the Rytov
   method. This lets us further quantify the associated performance
   indicators, namely, the aperture averaging factor and the average
   bit-error rate (<BER>). The effects on the UWOC link performance of the
   oceanic turbulence parameters, i.e., the rate of dissipation of kinetic
   energy per unit mass of fluid, the rate of dissipation of mean-squared
   temperature, Kolmogorov microscale, the ratio of temperature to salinity
   contributions to the refractive index spectrum as well as system
   parameters, i.e., the receiver aperture diameter, Gaussian source size,
   laser wavelength and the link distance are investigated. (c) 2017

Title = {Genetic mapping and comparative genomics to inform restoration
   enhancement and culture of southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Background: Southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, historically
   support a substantial fishery along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the
   southern United States. Low year-class strengths over the past few years
   in the western Gulf of Mexico have raised concern that spawning stocks
   may be overfished. Current management of the resource includes releasing
   hatchery-raised juveniles to restock bays and estuaries; additionally,
   there is a growing interest in the potential for commercial aquaculture
   of the species. Currently, genomic resources for southern flounder do
   not exist. Here, we used two hatchery-reared families and double-digest,
   restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to create a
   reduced-representation genomic library consisting of several thousand
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located throughout the genome.
   Results: The relative position of each SNP-containing locus was
   determined to create a high-density genetic map spanning the 24 linkage
   groups of the southern flounder genome. The consensus map was used to
   identify regions of shared synteny between southern flounder and seven
   other fish species for which genome assemblies are available. Finally,
   syntenic blocks were used to localize genes identified from transcripts
   in European flounder as potentially being involved in ecotoxicological
   and osmoregulatory responses, as well as QTLs associated with growth and
   disease resistance in Japanese flounder, on the southern flounder
   linkage map.
   Conclusions: The information provided by the linkage map will enrich
   restoration efforts by providing a foundation for interpreting spatial
   genetic variation within the species, ultimately furthering an
   understanding of the adaptive potential and resilience of southern
   flounder to future changes in local environmental conditions. Further,
   the map will facilitate the use of genetic markers to enhance
   restoration and commercial aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Integration of renewable energy with desalination technologies is a
   strongly emerging field in many regions of the world having drinking
   water and energy crisis. This study presents the results of a
   techno-economical investigation of a small scale, photovoltaic (PV)
   powered hybrid nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane
   system for the brackish water treatment. Optimization experiments of six
   commercially available small scale RO and NF membranes were carried out
   using central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology
   (RSM). Experiments employing optimized input conditions validate the
   developed RSM model. Predictive model, using multiple response
   optimizations, revealed that CSM RO and NF250 membranes showed the
   optimal efficiency with 20.24\% and 18.98\% water recovery, 90.22\% and
   70.64\% salt rejection and 17.87 and 9.35 kWh/m(3) of SEC respectively.
   Comparison of membranes was also carried out by membrane
   characterization duly supported by experimental observations. Membrane
   surface was characterized by AFM, contact angle measurement and FTIR.
   Hybrid experiments were performed with NF and RO membranes in
   concentrate and permeate staging configurations. Results also suggested
   that techno-economic performance of the hybrid PV-NF/RO system was
   affected by factors like mode of integration of NF and RO membranes,
   recovery ratio, daily average operating hours and government subsidy.

Title = {Optimal hydrodynamic design of tubular photobioreactors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {88},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tubular photobioreactors are being considered for growing
   microalgae to produce renewable fuel oils via photosynthesis. Such
   bioreactors need to be highly energy efficient, or the energy captured
   in the fuel oil through photosynthesis will barely compensate for the
   fossil energy required to operate the photobioreactor.
   RESULTS: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the flow in a
   conventional tubular loop photobioreactor is used to reveal the
   existence of substantial dead zones in the typically used U-bends and 90
   degrees. elbows. Fluid circulation in these dead zones leads to
   increased energy consumption, formation of deposits, wall growth and
   potentially reduced productivity. Alternative designs of U-bends and 90
   degrees. elbows are evaluated by CFD modeling. Optimal design of a
   U-bend and a 90 degrees. elbow are identified and shown to substantially
   reduce the development of dead zones. Use of the proposed new
   configurations of bends is shown to reduce the energy consumption for
   fluid circulation in the loop by up to 15\% relative to a conventionally
   designed tubular loop photobioreactor, for turbulent flow of seawater.
   CONCLUSION: For a typical tubular loop made of a tube of 0.1 m in
   diameter, the optimal configuration of a U-bend had a radius of
   curvature of 0.35 m and an angle of the arc of 210 degrees. The optimal
   configuration of a 90 degrees. elbow was found to have a radius of
   curvature of 0.3 m. (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry},

Title = {Finger-like plumes of suspended sediment in the Colorado River Delta,
   Gulf of California},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {245},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {The present investigation focused on solving the significance of tidal
   currents in the sediment resuspension process revealed by satellite
   imagery in the tidal basin of the Colorado River Delta, located in the
   northernmost part of the Gulf of California. A depth-integrated finite
   difference hydrodynamic model, coupled with a suspended sediment
   transport module, has been applied to calculate the velocity field and
   potential suspended sediment changes in the delta region. Prescribed
   values of tidal harmonics were used to force the model at the open
   boundary of the model domain. The experiments revealed that sediment
   plumes are generated by the interaction of the tidal flow and the
   seabed, exposing a remarkable agreement between the crest of sandbanks
   existing in the delta and the potential sediment resuspension. Close to
   spring tides, the instantaneous potential transport of sediment in
   suspension reaches values up to 0.05 m(3), integrated over each cell of
   280 m x 280 m. The calculations showed that in the shallow coastal area
   at the gulfs head, sandbank presence is critical for the energy
   dissipation processes. The crests of sandbanks dissipate much of the
   energy. The simulated processes are strong evidence that the frictional
   effect of tidal flow during the initial stages of the spring tides
   contributes significantly to the sediment's picking up from the seabed
   going into suspension. These processes shape the plumes of suspended
   sediment, which extended in the same direction as the sandbanks.
   Comparison between satellite imagery and modeled distribution of
   sediment revealed a good agreement between observed and modeled
   finger-like plumes of sediment. The undulating topography's effect is
   reflected in the horizontal distributions of energy dissipation, current
   speed, and kinetic energy.},

Title = {Characterising thermal behaviour of buildings and its effect on urban

Abstract = {The heat island phenomenon in major cities is partly due to the
   excessive use of concrete and brick, which causes many problems
   regarding thermal comfort and energy expenditure. The thermal behaviour
   of the envelope wall material depends on its density, heat capacity, and
   thermal conductivity, and its effect on the heat island intensity (HII)
   is reported in this paper. Experiments and simulations were carried out
   on the four most popular building materials: brick, aerated concrete,
   wood with glass-wool insulation, and glass fibre-reinforced concrete
   with glass-wool insulation, with each material having a dimension of 1 m
   x 1 m. Experiments to analyse the thermal behaviour of the wall
   materials were performed by exposing each material to heat radiation
   from 2 x 1000 W halogen lamps for 4 h, followed by 4 h of cooling. The
   HII simulations were carried out in a simple urban kampong in a tropical
   area using Energy2D software. Heat flow analyses confirmed the thermal
   behaviour of the four walls, which can be categorised into two types:
   heat storage of block wall (BW) type and heat flow inhibition of
   insulated sandwich wall (ISW) type. The BW type showed 0.32 degrees C
   higher indoor air temperature than the ISW type, while the HII
   simulation showed ISW to be 0.74 degrees C higher than BW; however, both
   types increase the intensity and need mitigation treatment. The results
   of this study are important for the technological approach for dealing
   with local warming to lower the energy expenditure of poor people in an
   urban area.},

Title = {Critical and near-critical reflections of near-inertial waves off the
   sea surface at ocean fronts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {765},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In a balanced oceanic front, the possible directions of the group
   velocity vector for internal waves depart from the classic Saint
   Andrew's cross as a consequence of sloping isopycnals and the associated
   thermal wind shear. However, for waves oscillating at the Coriolis
   frequency f, one of these directions remains horizontal, while the other
   direction allows for vertical propagation of energy. This implies the
   existence of critical reflections from the ocean surface, after which
   wave energy, having propagated from below, cannot propagate back down.
   This is similar to the reflection of internal waves, propagating in a
   quiescent medium, from a bottom that runs parallel to the group velocity
   vector. We first illustrate this phenomenon with a series of linear
   Boussinesq numerical experiments on waves with various frequencies,
   omega, exploring critical (omega = f), forward (omega > f), and backward
   (omega < f) reflections. We then conduct the nonlinear equivalents of
   these simulations. In agreement with the classical case, backward
   reflection inhibits triadic resonances and does not exhibit prominent
   nonlinear effects, while forward reflection shows strong generation of
   harmonics that radiate energy away from the surface. Surprisingly
   though, critical reflections are associated with oscillatory motions
   that extend down from the surface. These motions are not freely
   propagating waves but instead take the form of a cluster of non-resonant
   triads which decays with depth through friction.},

Abstract = {Increasing availability and extent of biological ocean time series (from
   both in situ and satellite data) have helped reveal significant
   phenological variability of marine plankton. The extent to which the
   range of this variability is modified as a result of climate change is
   of obvious importance. Here we summarize recent research results on
   phenology of both phytoplankton and zooplankton. We suggest directions
   to better quantify and monitor future plankton phenology shifts,
   including (i) examining the main mode of expected future changes
   (ecological shifts in timing and spatial distribution to accommodate
   fixed environmental niches vs. evolutionary adaptation of timing
   controls to maintain fixed biogeography and seasonality), (ii) broader
   understanding of phenology at the species and community level (e.g. for
   zooplankton beyond Calanus and for phytoplankton beyond chlorophyll),
   (iii) improving and diversifying statistical metrics for indexing timing
   and trophic synchrony and (iv) improved consideration of spatio-temporal
   scales and the Lagrangian nature of plankton assemblages to separate
   time from space changes.},

Abstract = {The population dynamics and production of the Scyphomedusa Aurelia
   aurita (Lam.) were examined within two contrasting ecosystems on the
   south coast of England; Southampton Water, an open productive estuary,
   and Horsea Lake, an enclosed, brackish, man-made body of water. Annual
   A. aurita production in Southampton Water ranged between 31 and 58 mg C
   m(-3) year(-1) in different years (1990-94); while at Horsea Lake,
   annual production was 76 mg year(-1) in 1994. The potential impact of A.
   aurita on the mesozooplankton communities was estimated through C m(-3)
   measurements of in situ secondary production and transfer efficiency
   between the two populations. Using literature-based estimates for
   mesozooplankton production, the annual transfer efficiency between the
   mesozooplankton and A. aurita populations in Southampton Water ranged
   between 9 and 26\% in different years, and in Horsea Lake was 73\% in
   1994. These data imply that the abundant A. aurita population may have a
   significant impact on the mesozooplankton community of Horsea Lake, and
   in turn, the very small A. aurita sizes observed indicate a severely
   food limited population. The ecological role of A. aurita in Horsea Lake
   is discussed in View of the very low chi a and mesozooplankton numbers
   present. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

Abstract = {Lignin-derived phenols, C/N ratios and ratios of refractory to total

   diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter along estuary, river bank, and
   salt marsh systems. The Changjiang Estuary showed a higher signal of
   terrestrial organic matter at the river mouth which decreased farther
   offshore. The locations along the Qiantang River were affected by their
   adjacent surroundings, and the Andong salt marsh showed higher
   terrestrial organic matter signal at the upper marsh compared to the
   lower marsh. All studied areas showed slight increases in organic matter
   decomposition farther downstream and towards the sea. Study of these
   three different systems will improve our understanding on their
   ecotoxicological impact. The Changjiang Estuary had higher pollutant
   levels near the river mouth, which decreased farther offshore due to
   dilution. The midstream Qiantang River was most likely affected by
   pollution from their adjacent surroundings. Pollutants were likely to be
   accumulated in the Andong salt marsh due to the presence of marsh plants
   and small-sized particles. Organic pollutants were likely to be
   decomposed during transport along the systems. The ability of the
   sediments to release inorganic pollutants was determined by whether
   these systems were oxic or anoxic.},

Title = {A New Paradigm for Continental US Summer Rainfall Variability:
   Asia-North America Teleconnection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {20},
Pages = {7313-7327},

Abstract = {The present study reveals a close relationship between the leading mode
   of continental U.S. (CONUS) summer rainfall and the East Asian
   subtropical monsoon rainfall (viz., mei-yu in China, baiu in Japan, and
   changma in the Korean peninsula). The East Asian subtropical monsoon
   rainfall and the CONUS dipole rainfall patterns are connected by an
   upper-level Asia-North America (ANA) teleconnection. The Rossby wave
   energy propagates along the path of the westerly jet stream (WJS) from
   East Asia to North America, affecting the CONUS summer rainfall.
   Mechanisms through which East Asian summer monsoon heating influence
   North American rainfall are illustrated by idealized anomaly atmospheric
   general circulation model experiments. In boreal winter, because of the
   southward shift of the WJS, the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern can
   be excited by the tropical central/eastern Pacific heating associated
   with El Nino, affecting the rainfall over CONUS. In boreal summer,
   because the WJS is weaker and locates farther to the north, an
   equatorial heating anomaly cannot directly perturb the WJS. A
   perturbation heating over subtropical East Asia, however, can trigger an
   ANA pattern along the path of the WJS, affecting the rainfall over North
   America. The season-dependent teleconnection scenario illustrates that
   the predictability source of CONUS rainfall variability is different
   between winter and summer. While the PNA pattern generated by El Nino is
   critical for CONUS rainfall in northern winter, the CONUS dipole
   rainfall variation in boreal summer is mainly governed by the remote
   forcing over subtropical East Asia via the ANA teleconnection.},

Abstract = {The Royal Society of Canada coordinates the International
   Geosphere-Biosphere Program (Global Change) in Canada. Currently, a
   research agenda that will extend beyond the next decade is being
   developed. It includes the use of remote sensing and geographical
   information systems in support of Global Change research, and the study
   of issues related to change and variability in the Canadian Arctic.
   This paper reviews the use of remotely sensed data to study the nature
   of atmosphere-cryosphere interactions in the Polar Basin and how they
   contribute to an understanding of climate change and variability. A
   conceptual framework for aspects of atmosphere-cryosphere interaction is
   presented through a discussion of feedback scenarios. The role of remote

Title = {Integrated flood vulnerability assessment of villages in the Waimanu
   River Catchment in the South Pacific: the case of Viti Levu, Fiji},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {This paper uses a holistic approach within a catchment scale, through
   the application of both climatic and non-climatic parameters, to analyze
   the impacts of river floods on the human security needs of rural
   riverine communities in the Waimanu Catchment situated in Nausori, Fiji.
   Consideration of both climatic and non-climatic factors is required
   since non-climatic factors could be controlled to build resilience
   against floods. The indicator-based flood vulnerability index
   methodology is applicable worldwide, but the indicators used in this
   study were specifically related to the Pacific Island context. In the
   context of fluvial flood vulnerability, effects of land management and
   climate change are not mutually exclusive of each other. Consequently,
   vulnerability assessments should consider the connection between
   people's actions and ecosystems for the entire catchment area since
   upstream land use practices influence flood vulnerabilities downstream.
   In our research, a community-based flood vulnerability index system in
   conjunction with rainfall variability and land use assessments was used
   to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the flood vulnerability, and
   it was found that increased rainfall, poor agricultural practices,
   gravel extraction, and improper waste management predominantly increased
   the exposure and sensitivity of midstream and downstream communities to
   river floods by modifying river morphology. Midstream communities in the
   Waimanu Catchment were most vulnerable to river floods due to their very
   low adaptive capacity in terms of poor ecosystem health and lack of
   natural resources to cope with the subsequent impacts of floods, being
   most sensitive to changes in land use and land cover.},

Title = {Widespread inundation of Pacific islands triggered by distant-source
   wind-waves},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {128-138},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {It is essential to understand the causes of sea level extremes in order
   to anticipate and respond to coastal flooding (inundation), and to adapt
   to sea level rise. We investigate a series of inundation events which
   occurred across the western Pacific over several consecutive days during
   December 2008, causing severe impacts to five Pacific Island nations.
   These events were not associated with commonly identified causes:
   tropical cyclones or unusually large astronomical tides. Instead, the
   dissipation of wind-waves generated by distant extra-tropical cyclones
   (swell) was the main cause, although regional sea level variability,
   including recent accelerated rise, significantly contributed to the
   severity of impact experienced at many locations. The implication of
   recent sea level rise in the severity of these events suggests that
   episodic swell will increasingly cause major impacts of the nature
   described herein, although such impacts will continue to be modulated by
   El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in the region.
   Significantly, tide gauges recorded little evidence of extreme sea
   levels during the event, implying that causes of extreme sea levels
   inferred from tide gauge analysis are unlikely to include this important
   cause of inundation. Therefore, any assessment of inundation risk
   predicated on tide gauge information (as well as larger scale sea level
   information such as satellite altimetry) may fail at many locations in
   the Pacific. To be accurate, such efforts must include information on
   the relationship between wave climate, wave forecasts and local extreme
   water levels. Further development of related early warning systems will
   become more pertinent as modern SLR continues to add to the magnitude of
   extremes. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Number = {2},
Pages = {157-167},
Abstract = {As part of the ``All Taxa Biodiversitv Inventories{''} (ATBIs)
   coordinated by the European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy (EDIT), we
   analysed diatom communities colonizing different habitats of the Valasco
   Valley (Maritime Alps Natural Park). The aim of this research was to
   shed light on the diatom richness in an Alpine context through i) the
   collection of data concerning diatom communities inhabiting an
   unexplored watershed of the Maritime Alps Natural Park, including all of
   the most important aquatic habitats (comparison among river, springs and
   peat bogs) and assemblages (epilithic and epiphytic diatom communities);
   i( analysis of the main environmental factors driving the development of
   diatom communities in different habitats. We completed a list of 174
   diatom taxa. In general. river samples were poorer in terms of species
   richness than spring and peat bog ones, probably due to the selective
   role of the fast flow, while springs sheltered the highest biodiversity
   of the Valasco Valley. Peat bog communities were mainly composed of
   acidophilous taxa, sometimes planktonic and forming colonies. Epilithic
   and epiphytic samples did not show significant differences in terms of
   composition and biodiversity, even though it was statistically possible
   to identify indicator species for each assemblage. The study also
   highlighted the presence of several taxa included in the German Red List
   as endangered or decreasing, especially in the epiphytic samples. Since
   the water nutrient level and substrate geology were similar among
   habitats, the main environmental factors shaping Valasco diatom
   communities were water velocity and pH.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Papilio alexanor Esper, {[}1800] is a threatened European butterfly
   species listed in Annex IV of the Habitats Directive and in Appendix II
   of the Bern Convention, being considered extremely vulnerable to climate
   change. According to some projections (e.g., Bambu, a scenario of
   moderate climate change), it would be expected to lose 63\% of its
   European climatic niche by the year 2050 and 77\% by 2080. The few
   remaining populations are expected to become concentrated in the
   Maritime Alps. In 2009 and 2010, we studied what is probably the densest
   P. alexanor population in the Italian part of this area. It occurs in a
   series of dry, xerothermic grasslands, also partially occupied by an
   abandoned limestone quarry, where the larval food plant is Ptychotis
   saxifraga (L.) Loret \& Barrandon. Females lay eggs in July, choosing
   patches where the food plants are higher and more abundant. The habitat
   preference, conservation status and survival of the early instars larvae
   of P. alexanor have been investigated in order to draw up conservation
   strategies for this species in the Italian Maritime Alps.},

Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {199-206},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A comparative study of the pyrolysis of a macroalgae industrial solid
   waste (algae meal) in an electrical conventional furnace and in a
   microwave furnace has been carried out. It was found that the chars
   obtained from both pyrolyses are similar and show good properties for
   performing as a solid bio-fuel and as a precursor of activated carbon.
   Bio-oils from conventional pyrolysis have a greater number of phenolic,
   pyrrole and alkane compounds whereas benzene and pyridine compounds are
   more predominant in microwave pyrolysis with a major presence of light
   compounds. The bio-gas fraction from micro-wave pyrolysis presents a
   much higher syngas content (H-2 + CO), and a lower CO2 and CH4
   proportion than that obtained by conventional pyrolysis. Yields are
   similar for both treatments with a slightly higher gas yield in the case
   of microwave pyrolysis due to the fact that microwave heating favors
   heterogeneous reactions between the gases and the char. (C) 2013

   condition during 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2010. The net change in mangrove
   cover during 1990-2020 shows distinct loss and gain regions across the
   study region. The shoreline change analysis shows that nearly 90 km(2)
   of mangroves were lost on the seaward side due to coastal erosion.
   Whereas, 50 km(2 )of newly developed mangroveswere observed in western
   parts of Southern Parganas due to accretion and no loss/gain was
   recorded in the rest of the areas. A significant positive correlation
   (coefficients 0.76 at p=0.01) was recorded between the increase in the
   extent of the mangrove region and bio-carbon fluxes for the years of
   normal and high-stress level condition as the dominant classes.
   Conversely, correlation is insignificant for the years dominated by

   identified three humic-like components (FDOMH) and one protein-like
   component (FDOMP). DOC was extremely deficient in the FGW (35 +/- 13 mu
   M) and positively correlated with salinity in the coastal environment,
   indicating oceanic DOC contribution. The FDOMP pattern was similar to
   that of DOC, suggesting that marine biological production is a primary
   DOC source in this region. Particularly, significant FDOMP correlations
   in the coastal waters with the fluxes of dissolved inorganic phosphorus
   (DIP; R-2 = 0.31) and dissolved silicon (R-2 = 0.46) from the FGW
   demonstrated that in situ biological production is facilitated by
   FGW-borne nutrient addition. However, the absence of a correlation
   between the fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and FDOMP (R-2
   <0.01) indicated that anthropogenic DIN is not essential for DOC
   production under the P-limited nutrient conditions and diatom-dominant
   conditions prevailing on the coastal Jeju Island. Here, we calculated
   the potential capacity of carbon fixation by marine biological activity
   based on the Redfield ratio of carbon and phosphorus with DIP fluxes.
   The flux accounts for approximately 2\% of the terrestrial carbon uptake
   in South Korea. Therefore, optical properties of FDOM may be good
   indicators of coastal DOC origin, and nutrient speciation may be linked
   to the carbon cycle.},

Abstract = {Hybrid technology in marine vehicles can significantly reduce fuel
   consumption and local CO2 emissions. It has been applied successfully to
   several ship-types, mostly with conventional, rule-based, strategies. To
   further improve performance, intelligent control strategies are
   necessary. This work, inspired by automotive research in Energy
   Management Strategies, applies the Equivalent Consumption Minimisation
   Strategy (ECMS) to a ship powered by a hybrid propulsion plant with
   hybrid power supply that can be recharged with renewable shore power.
   This hybrid configuration has the additional challenge to determine the
   optimal power-split between three or more different power sources, in
   real-time, and to optimally deplete the battery packs over the mission
   profile. To this end, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear optimisation Problem is
   formulated and solved by combining Branch \& Bound and Convex
   optimisation. Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to benchmark the
   real-time strategies, which are also compared to the current rule-based
   (RB) controller. Simulation results of a case study tugboat with
   validated models show that, with unknown load demand, 6\% additional
   fuel savings can be achieved with ECMS.},

Abstract = {The creation of reservoirs and the modification of stream channels are
   common practices used to facilitate the efficient production of
   cranberries. The potential impacts to hydrologic and geomorphic aspects
   of streamflow and channel structure have not been adequately assessed.
   In this study, the streamflow regime of 12 streams and the channel
   morphologies of 11 streams were compared for study sites in the
   Pinelands region of New Jersey with upstream active-cranberry bogs,
   upstream abandoned-cranberry bogs, and basins with no apparent
   agricultural history. Flow regime metrics included measures of low-flow,
   median-flow, and bankfull discharge, two measures of streamflow
   variability (spread and a modified Richards-Baker Flashiness index), and
   the frequency of overbank flooding. Stream-channel morphology metrics
   included average bank slope, average bankfull width, average bankfull
   depth, average bankfull width-to-depth ratio, and average bankfull area.
   No significant differences between stream types were apparent for any of
   the metrics. Basin-area normalized streamflow values of all 12 study
   sites were highly correlated to each other. Significant relationships
   existed between some of the flow-regime and channel-morphology metrics.
   Due to the lack of significant differences between stream types, it
   appears that neither historic nor current cranberry agricultural
   practices considerably influence flow regimes or the channel morphology
   of streams in the New Jersey Pinelands.},

Title = {Balancing risks of injury and disturbance to marine mammals when pile
   driving at offshore windfarms},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Offshore windfarms require construction procedures that minimize
   impacts on protected marine mammals. Uncertainty over the efficacy of
   existing guidelines for mitigating near-field injury when pile-driving
   recently resulted in the development of alternative measures, which
   integrated the routine deployment of acoustic deterrent devices (ADD)
   into engineering installation procedures without prior monitoring by
   marine mammal observers. 2. We conducted research around the
   installation of jacket foundations at the UK's first deep-water offshore
   windfarm to address data gaps identified by regulators when consenting
   this new approach. Specifically, we aimed to (a) measure the
   relationship between noise levels and hammer energy to inform
   assessments of near-field injury zones and (b) assess the efficacy of
   ADDs to disperse harbour porpoises from these zones. 3. Distance from
   piling vessel had the biggest influence on received noise levels but,
   unexpectedly, received levels at any given distance were highest at low
   hammer energies. Modelling highlighted that this was because noise from
   pin pile installations was dominated by the strong negative relationship
   with pile penetration depth with only a weak positive relationship with
   hammer energy. 4. Acoustic detections of porpoises along a gradient of
   ADD exposure decreased in the 3-h following a 15-min ADD playback, with
   a 50\% probability of response within 21.7 km. The minimum time to the
   first porpoise detection after playbacks was > 2 h for sites within 1 km
   of the playback. 5. Our data suggest that the current regulatory focus
   on maximum hammer energies needs review, and future assessments of noise
   exposure should also consider foundation type. Despite higher piling
   noise levels than predicted, responses to ADD playback suggest
   mitigation was sufficiently conservative. Conversely, strong responses
   of porpoises to ADDs resulted in far-field disturbance beyond that
   required to mitigate injury. We recommend that risks to marine mammals
   can be further minimized by (1) optimizing ADD source signals and/or
   deployment schedules to minimize broad-scale disturbance; (2) minimizing
   initial hammer energies when received noise levels were highest; (3)
   extending the initial phase of soft start with minimum hammer energies
   and low blow rates.},

Abstract = {Solid phase and pore water chemical data collected in a sediment of the
   Haringvliet Lake are interpreted using a multi-component reactive
   transport model. This freshwater lake, which was formed as the result of
   a river impoundment along the southwestern coast of the Netherlands, is
   currently targeted for restoration of estuarine conditions. The model is
   used to assess the present-day biogeochemical dynamics in the sediment,
   and to forecast possible changes in organic carbon mineralization
   pathways and associated redox reactions upon salinization of the bottom
   waters. Model results indicate that oxic degradation (55\%),
   denitrification (21\%), and sulfate reduction (17\%) are currently the
   main organic carbon degradation pathways in the upper 30 cm of sediment.
   Unlike in many other freshwater sediments, methanogenesis is a
   relatively minor carbon mineralization pathway (5\%), because of
   significant supply of soluble electron acceptors from the well-mixed
   bottom waters. Although ascorbate-reducible Fe(III) mineral phases are
   present throughout the upper 30 cm of sediment, the contribution of
   dissimilatory iron reduction to overall sediment metabolism is
   negligible. Sensitivity analyses show that bioirrigation and
   bioturbation are important processes controlling the distribution of
   organic carbon degradation over the different pathways. Model
   simulations indicate that sulfate reduction would rapidly suppress
   methanogenesis upon seawater intrusion in the Haringvliet, and could
   lead to significant changes in the sediment's solid-state iron
   speciation. The changes in Fe speciation would take place on time-scales
   of 20-100 years. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {GAP is a multi-sectoral and integrated regional development project
   based on the concept of sustainable development. Its basic aim is to
   eliminate regional development disparities by raising people's income
   level and living standards; and to contribute to such national
   development targets as social stability and economic growth by enhancing
   the productive and employment generating capacity of the rural sector.
   In this study, the concepts of regional and sustainable development are
   explained. The background and current position of GAP project is given.
   The benefits of the cities within the region are also considered in the
   study in terms sustainable development. Regional development accelerates
   development of trade activities and the increasing need for logistics
   and transportation services. The paper examines transportation
   facilities of the outcome and income of the GAP project for the cities
   within the region.
   With the completion of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP),
   agricultural production and the corresponding exports are expected to
   increase considerably, accelerating the maritime trade in the region.
   The model that is explained and evaluated in this paper consists of
   three phases. These are land container terminals in selected cities,
   railway and motorway connection between land container terminals and
   port development. The results and future expectations from the maritime
   transport model are discussed.},

   Molecular isotopic evidence for anaerobic oxidation of methane},
Journal = {GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Analyses of C-13 contents of individual organic molecules in a marine
   sediment show that crocetane, 2,6,11,15-tetramethylhexadecane, an isomer
   of phytane, is produced by microorganisms that use methane as their main
   source of carbon. The sediments lie at a water depth of 68 m in the
   Kattegat, the strait between Denmark and Sweden. Crocetane appears first
   185 cm below the sediment-water interface, in the zone marking the
   transition from sulfate reduction to methanogenesis. Its delta C-13
   value is -90 +/- 10 parts per thousand versus Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite
   (VPDB). Its structure, which includes four isoprene units arranged
   symmetrically around a tail-to-tail linkage, suggests that it is
   produced by a member of the archaea. Growing at the intersection of the
   diffusion gradients for sulfate and methane in sedimentary pore waters,
   the source organism apparently function as a methane-consuming member of
   the microbial consortium responsible for the anaerobic oxidation of
   methane {[}Hoehler et al., 1994], in which, as first demonstrated
   quantitatively in these sediments {[}Iversen and Jorgensen, 1985],
   electrons are transferred from methane to sulfate. The presence of
   archaeal biomass throughout the sediment section is indicated by
   significant concentrations of 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI) and
   of ether-bound phytane and biphytane. The PMI reaches a minimum delta
   value of -47 parts per thousand well below the transition zone. Its
   isotopic depletion could reflect either methanogenic or methanotrophic
   sources. The ether-bound lipids are isotopically uniform throughout the
   section and are presumed to derive from archaea that utilize a carbon
   source unaffected by the oxidation of methane.},

Abstract = {The partition coefficients of potassium, D-K, between molten sanidine,
   KAlSi3O8, and molten roedderite, K2Mg5Si12O30, With FeS-rich alloy and
   pure Fe metal liquids have been investigated in a multi-anvil press,
   between 5 and 15 GPa, at a temperature of 2173 K, and at an oxygen
   fugacity between 0.5 and 3 log units below the iron-wustite (IW) buffer.
   No pressure dependence of the D-K coefficients in sulphur-free and
   sulphur-bearing systems was found within the investigated pressure
   range. We also observed minor effect of the silicate melt composition
   for an nbo/t (non-bridging oxygen to tetrahedral cation ratio) higher
   than 0.8 +/- 0.4. In contrast, the partitioning of potassium varies
   strongly with the metallic phase composition, with an increase of
   K-solubility in the metallic liquid for high sulphur and oxygen
   contents.
   We review all available high-pressure data to obtain reliable D-K
   coefficients for the interaction between molten silicates and Fe-alloy
   liquids at pressures and temperatures relevant to those of core
   formation in a terrestrial magma ocean. The dominant controlling
   parameters appear to be the temperature and the chemical composition of
   the metallic phase, with D-K coefficients significantly increased with
   temperature, and with the sulphur and oxygen contents of the Fe-alloy
   liquid. Our considerations distinguish two extreme cases, with an S-free
   or S-bearing iron core, which yield K contents of similar to 25 or
   similar to 250 ppm, respectively. These two extreme values have very
   different consequences for thermal budget models of the Earth's core
   since its formation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article describes a multiple benefit/multiple use approach to
   implementing vegetated buffers, using as an example a program adopted by
   the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program. The multiple
   benefit/multiple use approach capitalizes on the inherent ability of
   vegetated buffers to perform multiple functions, such as pollutant
   removal, habitat protection, scenic improvement, erosion control, and
   historic/archaeological site presentation. These benefits provide a more
   robust means for justifying vegetated buffer implementation, and should
   help develop a broader constituency for the adoption of vegetated buffer
   policies. Application of vegetated buffers for residential and other
   developing lands has not been adequately addressed in existing vegetated
   buffer implementation efforts. We present one solution to implementing
   vegetated buffers on residential and developing lands. The approach and
   background information should prove useful for the application of
   vegetated buffers outside of coastal regions, and promotes a move
   holistic and integrated view of management practices as well as the
   concept of management for sustainable ecosystems.},

Title = {Skeletal growth capacity as a measure of coral species and community
   resilience},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Accretion and erosion of scleractinian (stony coral) carbonate skeletons
   determine whether a colony will increase or decrease in size with
   potential consequences for ecosystem processes, functions and services.
   The capacity for skeletal growth can be estimated by comparing a
   colony's rate of calcification with its rate of erosion. Calcifi-cation
   depends on the species-specific metabolic activity of living tissue, and
   erosion depends primarily on the availability and density of barren
   skeleton, those areas on the colony where polyps have died. Assessment
   of skeletal growth capacity requires data on calcification rates,
   erosion rates and both live and barren colony surface area. Rates of
   calcification and erosion are documented for many Caribbean species and
   others can be estimated from existing data. Three-dimensional surface
   area of colonies can be determined from data collected during
   demographic surveys, which identify species, measure dimensions, and
   estimate the proportion of live tissue on a colony. Data from
   demographic surveys conducted in the U.S. Virgin Islands are used to
   calculate the skeletal growth capacity (GC) as an indicator of coral
   species and community resilience. Scleractinia are the primary
   architects of coral reefs, and the gain or loss of skeletal framework is
   vitally important to reef ecosystem processes that lead to valued goods
   and services. Estimates of GC reflect stony coral resilience, which is
   the capacity to recover from disturbances by returning to previous
   physical and functional levels. GC can also provide insight to the
   effects of stressors such as ocean acidification, and can inform several
   management de-cisions, including restoration site selection and
   threatened species designation.},

Title = {Floodplain influence on carbon speciation and fluxes from the lower
   Pearl River, Mississippi},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {186},
Pages = {189-206},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {To investigate the floodplain influence on carbon speciation and export
   to the northern Gulf of Mexico, water samples were collected monthly
   from two sites in the East Pearl River (EPR) basin during 2006-2008.
   Additionally, four spatial surveys in the river basin between those two
   sites were also conducted. Compared with the upstream sampling site at
   Bogalusa, MS, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and particulate organic
   carbon (POC) concentrations were 36\% and 55\% lower, respectively, and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was 49\% higher at the
   downstream Stennis Space Center (SSC) site. In addition, the bulk DOC
   pool at SSC had a higher colloidal fraction than at Bogalusa (75\% vs.
   68\%). Detailed spatial surveys revealed the differences between the
   upstream and downstream stations resulted both from input from
   Hobolochitto Creek, a tributary of the EPR, and from influence of the
   swamp-rich floodplain. The contributions from Hobolochitto Creek to the
   carbon pool in the EPR basin were lowest during a high flow event and
   reached a maximum during the dry season. Meanwhile, the floodplain in
   the EPR basin acted as a significant sink for DOC, POC and particulate
   nitrogen during summer and for suspended sediment during a high flow
   event. However, the floodplain was converted into a source of suspended
   sediment, DOC, and POC to the EPR during winter, revealing a dynamic
   nature and seasonality in the floodplain influence. Consistent with its
   dominant forest coverage, abundant wetlands along the river corridor,
   and mild anthropogenic disturbance, the Pearl River basin above Bogalusa
   generally had higher yields of DOC and POC (1903 and 1386 kg-C km(-2)
   yr(-1), respectively), but a lower yield of DIC (2126 kg-C km(-2)
   yr(-1)) compared to other North American rivers. An estimation based on
   a mass balance approach suggests the interactions between floodplain and
   the main river stem could reduce the annual DIC and POC export fluxes
   from downstream of the EPR by 24\% and 40\%, respectively, but enhance
   the annual riverine DOC export by 25\%. Similar scenarios likely occur
   in other wetland-rich coastal rivers and are capable of significantly
   altering the current estimation of riverine carbon export. (C) 2016

Title = {Long-term effects of global and local changes on benthic
   macroinvertebrate communities in multi-stressed large rivers: the
   example of the Rhone River during the last 30 years},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {416},
Abstract = {The study of biological traits have enhanced the understanding of the
   changes in the macroinvertebrate communities of the Rhone River during
   the last thirty years, as well as the potential effects of hydroclimatic
   factors and thermal discharges on the structure and the functioning of
   these communities at the regional scale. If every section of the Rhone
   had specific features, we observed over time a trend towards a higher
   uniformisation of invertebrate communities, especially in the Lower
   section. The strong impacts of the alien species and the water warming
   subsequent to the 2003 heat wave have been detected in the Lower Rhone
   and the Middle Rhone: the communities of the Middle Rhone gradually
   exhibit profiles closer to those of the communities of the Lower Rhone.
   The Upper Rhone was less colonized by alien species but was impaired by
   the global warming: its communities exhibited biological profiles closer
   to those of communities of further-downstream zones. In this site, the
   thermal discharges have led to a lower diversity of the communities and
   a higher occurrence of eurythermic species. Hence the benthic macrofauna
   of the Rhone River seems to have reacted quickly and strongly to
   environmental changes and to the arrival of invasive species. However
   numerous trait adaptations being common to Mediterranean and alien
   species, it seems complex to evaluate the respective weight of each of
   these potential sources of impairment. Predicting trends in invertebrate
   community composition is a complex objective because of the competition
   between native and/or invasive species in addition to man-induced
   environmental variation (flow, temperature). However, if biological
   invasion does not occur continuously but only based on specific events
   (especially hydroclimatology), we can legitimately believe that this
   drift will continue with the arrival of new Ponto-Caspian species via
   the Danube-Main Canal, their usual way to western and southern Europe.
   The common feature of these different species is that they are
   essentially predators or filterers, thermophilic and euryecic, and
   efficient functional competitors. Finally, this study once again
   emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring in the study of
   biological communities in the context of global warming.},

Abstract = {Uptake of dissolved ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, urea and amino acids was
   studied in the Scheldt estuary in different seasons over a salinity
   gradient. The importance of inorganic nitrogen sources was compared to
   that of urea and amino acids and the relative use of urea and amino acid
   nitrogen and carbon was studied. Urea and amino acids constituted up to
   43 and 29\% of total nitrogen uptake, respectively, and were of similar
   importance as inorganic substrates. Ammonium oxidation by nitrifiers and
   ammonium uptake by algae and bacteria were of similar magnitude. In
   January, April and November, amino acids constituted a source of both
   nitrogen and carbon while urea mainly constituted a source of carbon.
   During the summer months, amino acids were used mainly as a source for
   nitrogen, while urea was a source for both carbon and nitrogen; urea was
   rarely used as nitrogen substrate alone. Due to this seasonal uncoupling
   of nitrogen and carbon assimilation, dually labeled substrates are
   necessary to assess the importance of urea and amino acids as substrates
   for organic nitrogen and carbon.},

Title = {Comparative Assessment of Priority Listing and Mixed Integer Linear
   Programming Unit Commitment Methods for Non-Interconnected Island

Abstract = {The generation management concept for non-interconnected island (NII)
   systems is traditionally based on simple, semi-empirical operating rules
   dating back to the era before the massive deployment of renewable energy
   sources (RES), which do not achieve maximum RES penetration, optimal
   dispatch of thermal units and satisfaction of system security criteria.
   Nowadays, more advanced unit commitment (UC) and economic-dispatch (ED)
   approaches based on optimization techniques are gradually introduced to
   safeguard system operation against severe disturbances, to prioritize
   RES participation and to optimize dispatch of the thermal generation
   fleet. The main objective of this paper is to comparatively assess the
   traditionally applied priority listing (PL) UC method and a more
   sophisticated mixed integer linear programming (MILP) UC optimization
   approach, dedicated to NII power systems. Additionally, to facilitate
   the comparison of the UC approaches and quantify their impact on systems
   security, a first attempt is made to relate the primary reserves
   capability of each unit to the maximum acceptable frequency deviation at
   steady state conditions after a severe disturbance and the droop
   characteristic of the unit's speed governor. The fundamental differences
   between the two approaches are presented and discussed, while daily and
   annual simulations are performed and the results obtained are further
   analyzed.},

Title = {HURRICANE KATRINA SEDIMENT SLOWED ELEVATION LOSS IN SUBSIDING BRACKISH
   MARSHES OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA},

Abstract = {Although hurricanes call damage or destroy coastal wetlands. they may
   play a beneficial role in reinvigorating marshes by delivering sediments
   that raise soil elevations and stimulate organic matter production.
   Hurricane Katrina altered elevation dynamics of two subsiding brackish
   marshes in the Mississippi River deltaic plain by adding I to 8 cm of
   sediment to the soil surface in August 2005. Soil elevations at both
   Sites subsequently declined due to continued Subsidence, but net
   elevation gain was Still positive at both Pearl River (+1.7 cm) and Big
   Branch (+0.7 cm) marshes two years after the hurricane. At Big Branch
   where storm sediments had higher organic matter and water contents,
   post-storm elevation loss was more rapid Clue to initial compaction of
   the storm Liver in combination with root-zone collapse. In contrast,
   elevation loss was slower at Pearl River where file storm deposit (high
   sand content) did not compact and the root zone did not collapse.
   Vegetation Lit both Sites fully recovered within one year, and
   accumulation of root matter at Big Branch increased 10-fold from 2005 to
   2006, suggesting that the hurricane stimulated belowground productivity.
   Results of this Study imply that hurricane sediment may benefit
   subsiding marshes by slowing elevation loss. However, long-term effects
   of hurricane sediment oil elevation dynamics will depend not only oil
   the amount of sediment deposited. but Oil sediment texture and
   resistance to compaction as well as on changes in organic matter
   accumulation in the Wars following the hurricane.},

Abstract = {We present results from continued investigations into the fidelity of
   covariance- based climate field reconstruction (CFR) approaches used in
   proxy-based climate reconstruction. Our experiments employ synthetic
   ``pseudoproxy{''} data derived from simulations of forced climate
   changes over the past millennium. Using networks of these pseudoproxy
   data, we investigate the sensitivity of CFR performance to
   signal-to-noise ratios, the noise spectrum, the spatial sampling of
   pseudoproxy locations, the statistical representation of predictors
   used, and the diagnostic used to quantify reconstruction skill. Our
   results reinforce previous conclusions that CFR methods, correctly
   implemented and applied to suitable networks of proxy data, should yield
   reliable reconstructions of past climate histories within estimated
   uncertainties. Our results also demonstrate the deleterious impact of a
   linear detrending procedure performed recently in certain CFR studies
   and illustrate flaws in some previously proposed metrics of
   reconstruction skill.},

Abstract = {The shoreline is one of the most important dynamic linear features on
   the earth's surface, thus the shoreline detection and monitoring are an
   important task. The study of coastal system processes and coastal zone
   management (CZM) requires information about the shoreline and their
   changes. The reason for shoreline changes in the coastal zones mainly
   focuses on, various activities such as natural and anthropogenic
   activities. This study describes the utilization of satellite and an
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing (R/S) to detect shoreline
   changes between 1989 and 2017 and identify the rate of change of
   shoreline for similar to 8.7 km of Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu,
   India. UAV R/S is used to acquire the high resolution of aerial nadir
   image with low cost and short time periods for on-demand areas. Visual
   interpretation method has been employed to delineate the shoreline from
   different periods of satellite and UAV images with various resolutions.
   The vector overlay technique (VOT) assess the area of shoreline changes
   for different periods between 1989 and 2017. The tool named as digital
   shoreline analysis system (DSAS) was utilized to find the rate of
   shoreline changes. This study concludes changes of regression and
   transgression by using end point rate (EPR) is between - 5.3 m and +
   5.99 m. The plus sign (+) indicates regression (sea converted to land)
   and minus sign (-) represents the transgression (land converted to sea)
   of shoreline. Each and every period of shoreline change were arranged in
   a continuous frame to make a video and published in webGIS. In future
   coastal management studies, UAV and R/S can be effective alternative
   methods to the traditional aerial surveys.},

Abstract = {Understanding how climate change and increasing human impacts may exert
   pressure on ecosystems and threaten biodiversity requires efficient
   monitoring programs. Indicator species have been proposed as useful
   tools, and predators and their diet may be particularly suitable. The
   vast and remote arctic tundra represents a good case study as shifts in
   ecosystem states are presently occurring, and monitoring is a major
   challenge. Here we assess what stable isotopes reflecting the diet of
   the arctic fox, a widespread and highly flexible top predator, can
   contribute to effective monitoring of the vertebrate prey basis of
   Arctic tundra. We used data collected over 2-5 years from six sites in
   the Eurasian Arctic and Greenland. Stable isotope signatures of arctic
   fox winter fur reflected both spatial and temporal variability in the
   composition of the vertebrate prey basis. Clear contrasts were apparent
   in the importance of marine resources, as well as of small rodents and
   their multiannual density fluctuations. Some important resources could
   however not be separated because of confounding isotopic signatures.
   Moreover, except for preferred prey, the proportions of prey in the diet
   may not necessarily reflect the relative importance of species in the
   community of available prey. Knowing these limitations, we suggest that
   the arctic fox diet as inferred from stable isotopes could serve as one
   of several key targets in ecosystem-based monitoring programs.},

Abstract = {The ability of one-dimensional hydrodynamic models to reproduce
   dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and velocity profiles for
   conditions of whitecapping waves in a shallow water, tide- and
   wind-forced environment was assessed. The models were forced with the
   conditions experienced during a month-long field experiment in a shallow
   estuarine embayment, and the results were compared with the observed
   dissipation and mean velocity profiles. Three turbulence models were
   assessed: the k-omega model and two k-l models, with different
   prescribed bilinear relationships for the turbulent length scale, l. The
   k-omega turbulence model was found to best replicate the measured decay
   of dissipation with depth with a surface roughness length, z(0s) =
   1.3H(s), and wave energy parameter, alpha = 60. The k-l model achieved
   equally as good reproduction of the observations as the k-omega model
   when the proportionality constant in the prescribed linear length scale
   relationship for the upper half of the water column was modified from
   the traditionally employed von Karman's constant, k = 0.4, to 0.25. The
   model results show that the whitecapping waves often supplied the
   dominant source of turbulent kinetic energy over the majority of the
   water column in the shallow, tide- and wind-forced system.},

   desalination and wastewater treatment. However, it remains a huge
   challenge to simultaneously achieve a high light-to-heat conversion
   efficiency (g) and multi-media evaporation applications. In this study,
   a highly efficient Janus hydrogel photothermal film was developed using
   yolk-like non-stoichiometric nickel sulfide (NiS2-x) microspheres and
   agar hydrogel. The NiS2-x immobilized in the agar hydrogel has
   full-spectrum absorption characteristics at 200-2500 nm, which can
   perform efficient light-to-heat conversion and regulate water transport
   channels. Additionally, the pure agar in the bottom can transport water
   effectively and avoid heat loss. By the pouring method, the Janus
   hydrogel film can be easily prepared into various shapes; hence, it can
   be adjusted depending on the environment in which it is used. The
   optimized Janus hydrogel film (Janus hydrogel-1) possessed good
   hydrophilicity and showed an excellent solar evaporation rate of 1.45 kg
   m(-2)h(-1), and a high g of 97\% under one-sun irradiation. Theoretical
   simulation results showed that the outstanding water evaporation
   performance of Janus hydrogel-1 was mainly due to its relatively free
   water transport channels. Janus hydrogel(-1) can be used for water
   evaporation applications in various media, including seawater, heavy
   metal ion/organic wastewater, and domestic sewage. Our work highlights
   the great potential of Janus hydrogel-1 for realizing a highly effective
   solar energy-driven interface water evaporation and multi-media
   purification. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We discuss the potential variations of the biological pump that can be
   expected from a change in the oceanic circulation in the ongoing global
   warming. The biogeochemical model is based on the assumption of a
   perfect stoichiometric composition (Redfield ratios) of organic
   material. Upwelling nutrients are transformed into organic particles
   that sink to the deep ocean according to observed profiles. The physical
   circulation model is driven by the warming pattern as derived from
   scenario computations of a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model. The
   amplitude of the warming is determined from the varying concentration of
   atmospheric CO2. The model predicts a pronounced weakening of the
   thermohaline overturning. This is connected with a reduction of the
   transient uptake capacity of the ocean. It yields also a more effective
   removal of organic material from the surface which partly compensates
   the physical effects of solubility. Both effects are rather marginal for
   the evolution of atmospheric pCO(2). Running climate models and carbon
   cycle models separately seems to be justified.},

   yeast enhances growth and immune response in Lates calcarifer},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Marine antimicrobial peptide tilapia piscidin (TP) 4 possesses
   antibacterial and immune regulatory activities, making it a potentially
   valuable feed supplement in aquaculture. In this study, we expressed the
   TP4 peptide, originally identified from Oreochromis niloticus, in yeast
   (Pichia pastoris) under the control of an alcohol oxidase (Aox) 1
   promoter. Recombinant (r)TP4 expression was induced by methanol.
   Transformation was confirmed by PCR, and expression was confirmed by
   colony hybridization. For scalable production, transformed yeast was
   cultured and induced in a bench-top fermenter bioreactor system under
   controlled conditions. The rTP4-expressing yeast cells were then
   pelleted and fed to 28-day-old Lutes calcarifer as a 0, 1, 3 or 5 \%
   supplement to the normal diet. Growth performance and immune response
   were monitored in the fish for four weeks. The 3 and 5 \% rTP4-yeast
   groups showed significant improvements in weight gain, feed efficiency,
   survival, protein efficiency ratio, and hepatosomatic index. In
   addition, rTP4-yeast increased the levels of IgM, which plays a critical
   role in innate immunity. Furthermore, rTP4-yeast-containing diet
   elevated SOD, GPx and catalase activities. Since feeding L. calcarifer
   with bioreactor-produced rTP4-expressing yeast significantly enhanced
   growth and immunity, rTP4 should be considered for use as a functional
   feed supplement to replace excessively administered antibiotics in
   farmed fish.},

Abstract = {Offshore field development relies on multiple optimization techniques
   targeting a feasible and cost-effective production solution yet are
   focused on the field itself. While so, advancements in offshore
   engineering bring increasingly complex subsea infrastructures to depths
   in the excess of 3,500 m. Many offshore production topsides which
   currently rely on costly and harmful onboard thermal-based power
   generation are turning to high voltage power-from-shore electrification
   solutions to cope with the challenges being brought by subsea
   infrastructures. An optimal electrification of these subsea templates is
   a challenge on its own as the seafloor morphology and well distribution
   is far from consistent. This paper presents a combined k-means and
   genetic-algorithm optimization to assess how the combined deployment of
   high voltage umbilical, wellheads and subsea substations can be
   optimized for the lowest cost possible. Results show a significant
   improvement in optimization of the total umbilical length as well as the
   substation positioning on the seabed.},

Abstract = {The renewable offshore energy sector is currently growing rapidly and
   there is a vast interest in optimization of the design procedures for
   the offshores wind turbines. Mono-Bucket can be a breakthrough in the
   sphere of offshore wind turbines foundations due to its lightness and
   fast installation and consequently cost-effectiveness compared to other
   common solutions.
   The long-term cyclic loading can cause degradation of soil-bucket system
   stiffness, which yields into accumulated and permanent deformations.
   Despite of the advantages, there is no standard procedure to design the
   foundation especially for assessing the accumulated deformations under
   environmental long-term loading. However, numerical and semi-empirical
   methods already used for offshore foundations can be adopted to take
   into account the effect of cyclic loading on Mono-Buckets. Among them,
   load-displacement techniques as cyclic p-y curves are of interest for
   its simplicity, however, they cannot normally consider the load
   frequency as well as soil real response due to pore-pressure
   development. On the other hand, numerical analyses including
   sophisticated constitutive soil models which account for the more
   realistic response are available. The numerical analysis are able to
   simulate the soil behavior to the cyclic loading with more details,
   although they are typically time consuming and sometimes not applicable
   for the design purposes. Therefore using a fast and quite accurate
   method with eliminating the complexity of detailed numerical calculation
   is highly demanded at the different design phases.
   The intention of the current study is to present, review and summarize
   the existing techniques to assess the effect of cyclic loading on
   Mono-Bucket foundations while emphasizing the advantage and disadvantage
   of each of them. Additionally, the need for the future research which is
   aligned with a rather fast and accurate design procedure is elaborated
   through this study.},

Abstract = {Roads, bridges, causeways, impoundments, and dikes in the coastal zone
   often restrict tidal flow to salt marsh ecosystems. A dike with tide
   control structures, located at the mouth of the Herring River salt
   marsh-estuarine system (Wellfleet, Massachusetts) since 1908, has
   effectively restricted tidal exchange, causing changes in marsh
   vegetation composition, degraded water quality, and reduced abundance of
   fish and macroinvertebrate communities. Restoration of this estuary by
   reintroduction of tidal exchange is a feasible management alternative.
   However, restoration efforts must proceed with caution as residential
   dwellings and a golf course are located immediately adjacent to and in
   places within the tidal wetland. A numerical model was developed to
   predict tide height levels for numerous alternative openings through the
   Herring River dike. Given these model predictions and knowledge of
   elevations of flood-prone areas, it becomes possible to make responsible
   decisions regarding restoration. Moreover, tidal flooding elevations
   relative to the wetland surface must be known to predict optimum
   conditions for ecological recovery. The tide height model has a
   universal role, as demonstrated by successful application at a nearby
   salt marsh restoration site in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Salt marsh
   restoration is a valuable management tool toward maintaining and
   enhancing coastal zone habitat diversity. The tide height model
   presented in this paper will enable both scientists and resource
   professionals to assign a degree of predictability when designing salt
   marsh restoration programs.},

Abstract = {Coastal zones are constantly changing in response to meteorological and
   hydrodynamic conditions. Water levels associated with storms, coupled
   with wind-driven waves, can significantly reshape coastal and deltaic
   geomorphology. Conversely, coastal wetlands attenuate waves, surge, and
   currents. These interactions have profound implications for ecosystem
   function and human infrastructure. This article discusses how predictive
   numerical models and remote-sensing techniques can advance understanding
   of the dominant process response (and feedbacks) of coastal and deltaic
   systems to a wide range of natural and anthropogenic changes.
   Remote-sensing techniques can provide valuable information at large
   spatial scales (101-103 km(2)) and at temporal scales ranging from days
   to decades that can be used to parameterize and validate numerical
   models, especially in regions such as the Mekong Delta where in situ
   data are sparse. Applications to the Mekong Delta system illuminate how
   modeling tools can reliably predict and describe system dynamics.
   Numerical modeling supported by remote-sensing information is an
   effective approach for evaluating and examining restoration and
   protection strategies, and for ameliorating the effects of climate
   change, natural hazards, and anthropogenic alterations to coastal
   ecosystems and human communities.},

Abstract = {The characteristics of wave and turbulence velocities created by a
   broad-banded irregular wave train breaking on a 1:35 slope were studied
   in a laboratory wave flume. Water particle velocities were measured
   simultaneously with wave elevations at three cross-shore locations
   inside the surf zone. The measured data were separated into
   low-frequency and high-frequency time series using a Fourier filter. The
   measured velocities were further separated into organized wave-induced
   velocities and turbulent velocity fluctuations by ensemble averaging.
   The broad-banded irregular waves created a wide surf zone that was
   dominated by spilling type breakers. A wave-by-wave analysis was carried
   out to obtain the probability distributions of individual wave heights,
   wave periods, peak wave velocities, and wave-averaged turbulent kinetic
   energies and Reynolds stresses. The results showed that there was a
   consistent increase in the kurtosis of the vertical velocity
   distribution from the surface to the bottom. The abnormally large
   downward velocities were produced by plunging breakers that occurred
   from time to time. It was found that the mean of the highest one-third
   wave-averaged turbulent kinetic energy values in the irregular waves was
   about the same as the time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy in a
   regular wave with similar deep-water wave height to wavelength ratio. It
   was also found that the correlation coefficient of the Reynolds stress
   varied strongly with turbulence intensity. Good correlation between u `
   and w ` was obtained when the turbulence intensity was high; the
   correlation coefficient was about 0.3-0.5. The Reynolds stress
   correlation coefficient decreased over a wave cycle, and with distance
   from the water surface. Under the irregular breaking waves, turbulent
   kinetic energy was transported downward and landward by turbulent
   velocity fluctuations and wave velocities, and upward and seaward by the
   undertow. The undertow in the irregular waves was similar in vertical
   structure but lower in magnitude than in regular waves, and the
   horizontal velocity profiles under the low-frequency waves were
   approximately uniform. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Journal = {CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The environmentally friendly materials fabricated from renewable marine
   resources have aroused worldwide concerns. Here, for the first time,
   tunicate cellulose was dissolved in LiOH/urea aqueous solution at -12
   degrees C after ball-milling, and its molecular weight was determined
   with laser light scattering. Hydrogels were fabricated from the
   cellulose solution by regenerating in ethanol, and beta-FeOOH
   nanoparticles (NPs) were in-situ synthesized to obtain
   beta-FeOOH/cellulose composite hydrogels (TCH-Fe). The tunicate
   cellulose hydrogels (TCH) not only disperse uniformly and immobilize
   firmly the beta-FeOOH NPs, but also acted as structural materials for
   continuous flow photocatalytic system. The photocatalytic degradation of
   methylene blue (MB) over TCH-Fe achieved up to 99.89\% in 30 min under
   visible-light irradiation, and maintained as high as similar to 98\%
   after treatment for 8 h, indicating a highly efficient photodegradation
   of MB. We provided a low-cost and facile method to construct new
   sustainable materials derived from marine biomass with highly efficient
   photocatalytic properties.},

Title = {Global Biogeochemical Cycle of Lithium},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The total human mobilization of Li from the Earth's crust, >1,000 x
   10(9) g/year, is much larger than Li mobilized by the natural processes
   of chemical and mechanical weathering (94 and 132 x 10(9) g/year,
   respectively), representing a similar to 500\% perturbation of the
   global cycle of Li by human activities. The anthropogenic perturbation
   of the global Li cycle shows enhanced releases to freshwaters from
   oil-produced water (46 x 10(9) g/year), leaching of coal ash (7-20 x
   10(9) g/year), and extraction of groundwaters (29 x 10(9) g/year). The
   sum of these anthropogenic sources more than doubles the natural
   transport of dissolved Li to the sea in rivers (69 x 10(9) g/year).
   Currently, releases from the excretion of therapeutic drugs and disposal
   of lithium-ion batteries are a small component of the transport of Li in
   rivers, although the latter may increase markedly as lithium-ion
   batteries dominant global energy storage. Human emissions of Li
   particles to the atmosphere-55 x 10(9) g/year from coal
   combustion-comprise about 38\% of the emission of Li to the atmosphere
   from various sources. The inputs to the atmosphere are more than the
   estimated deposition of Li from the atmosphere, which is poorly
   constrained by available data.},

Abstract = {Seaweeds have been used in many biotechnological applications including
   animal feed, human food, cosmetics, fertilizers, and bioremediation.
   With respect to bioremediation, seaweeds contaminated with heavy metals
   have limited applications and most suited for biofuel production. The
   present study aimed to evaluate the potential of seaweeds for dual use
   in heavy metal biosorption and biofuel production. Three dominant
   seaweed genera were collected representing the three macroalgal phyla,
   namely Ulva spp. (Chlorophyte), Gracilaria spp. (Rhodophyte), and
   Sargassum spp. (Phaeophyte). The later showed the highest cumulative
   copper (Cu2+) biosorption with 80\% removal efficiency, which increased
   to 94.6\% after process optimization. Comparative fermentation of raw
   biomass (RB) and Cu-sorbed biomass (BHM) showed the highest bioethanol
   yield of 289.2 mg g-1 for RB at 72 h fermentation, which was 24.3\%
   higher than that of BHM. In addition, the presence of Cu2+ in the BHM
   showed significant reduction in biogas and biomethane yields by 18.4\%
   and 5.2\%, respectively, with respect to RB. However, fermented BHM
   showed higher biogas and biomethane yields than the fermented RB. Due to
   dual bioethanol and biogas production, sequential fermentation and
   anaerobic digestion of Cu-sorbed biomass showed the highest energy
   output of 1597.3 GJ year- 1. The present study suggests a novel approach
   that provides an integrated method for efficient utilization of seaweeds
   biomass in wastewater treatment and sustainable energy recovery.},

Abstract = {As an effort to mitigate the water scarcity and to achieve a water
   security status in remote coastal communities with few or no hydraulic
   systems, or in places with compromised services due to natural
   disasters, a new semi portable wave driven desalination device is being
   developed and tested using a state of the art numerical model. In this
   early stage of development, the main challenge is to further optimize
   mechanisms that allow to adjust to tidal and wave variations and to
   efficiently resist the stresses exerted by cycle motions. The solution
   is partially handled through the use of a taut-line mooring mechanism
   which allows the device to work at large range of wave conditions. This
   prototype consists of two subsystems: a point absorber WEC conformed by
   a single buoy, and a standard reverse osmosis (RO) system. When
   interacting with the incoming waves, the mooring line is pulled and
   pressurizes seawater enough to drive it through several filters
   including the RO membranes. The FLOW-3D numerical model was used to test
   the efficiency of the WEC subsystem under several sea states associated
   with low energy wave conditions. The displacements and motions of the
   WEC as well as the forces in its anchor line were calculated. The
   results suggest that it provides the necessary force to pressurize the
   seawater for the desalination process. Further testing is needed to
   improve the reliability and survivability of the system which in turn
   will help to scale the prototype in order to obtain greater quantities
   of freshwater and thus be competitive with other technologies.},

Abstract = {We are living in a world that is increasingly polarized, filled with the
   outcries of marginalized voices and the plight of the Global South.
   Digital storytelling is thus becoming a vital tool to communicate the
   big issues of our time. Commissioned by the British Council for the 26th
   United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), Songs
   of the Earth is a musical animation film co-developed by Earth Day
   Network, its team of environmentalists, and British production company
   Soumik Datta Arts. Bringing together a hub of musicians, animators, and
   scientists, this ten-month project was envisioned by multi-disciplinary
   artist Soumik Datta. Together, they present the adventure of an Indian
   climate refugee who crosses flood banks and wildfires in search of her
   missing father, raising awareness about the environment by featuring a
   suite of original climate anthems including ``Oceans Rising{''}and
   ``Fields of Hope.{''}},

Title = {Termite diversity and abundance across fire-induced habitat variability
   in a tropical moist savanna (Lamto, Central Cote d'Ivoire)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {323-334},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {At Lamto, little is known about animal community responses to habitat
   variability resulting from fires and the mosaic pattern of the
   vegetation in general and in particular about that of termites which
   play key roles in this ecosystem. With a standardized method, data were
   collected on termites from four habitats differing in their vegetation
   cover and fire-history: annually burned savanna, savanna woodland,
   forest island and gallery forest. A range of environmental variables was
   measured and correlated with species abundances. The number of termite
   species collected in the savanna woodland was very close to that found
   in the gallery forest while the forest island was the richest habitat.
   The species richness of the savanna woodland and forest island seemed
   partly due to their heterogeneous and transitional vegetation structures
   and variable food resources. With regard to the fire-history of
   habitats, Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis offers an
   explanation for differences in the patterns of habitat-specific species
   richness. Variation in species abundances was significantly correlated
   with only two environmental variables (soil pH and woody plant species
   richness). The pH appeared as the most influential factor for
   fungus-growers while tree invasion in the savanna strongly reduces the
   abundance of grass-feeding species (e.g. Trinervitermes geminatus).
   Although not significantly correlated with species abundances, soil
   carbon showed a positive correlation with the dominant soil-feeder
   Basidentitermes potens. As for wood-feeders, they were not strongly
   correlated with woody plant species richness; this fact might be linked
   to their use for other sources of nourishment. Overall, it appears that
   habitat variability in the Lamto reserve contributes to the maintenance
   of different subsets of the termite community.},

Title = {Phylogeography and trans-Pacific divergence of the rocky shore gastropod
   Nucella lima},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {615-627},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {AimWe have used phylogeographical and multilocus coalescent population
   genetic methods to reconstruct the Pleistocene biogeographical history
   of a broadly distributed north Pacific rocky shore gastropod, Nucella
   lima.
   LocationNorthern Pacific rim, from south-eastern Alaska to Hokkaido
   Island.
   MethodsWe gathered DNA sequence data from three loci from N.lima, whose
   current distribution spans the entire North Pacific rim. We used a
   combination of population genetic summary statistics (Tajima's D, Fu's
   F-S and (ST)), isolation-with-migration divergence models, and extended
   Bayesian skyline plots to reconstruct the recent biogeographical history
   of this species.
   ResultsThe largest values of phi(ST) across all loci were always between
   eastern and western samples. Population divergence models indicated no
   gene flow and mid-Pleistocene divergence times (>600ka) between eastern
   and western populations. Mitochondrial DNA diversity in the east was
   low, and coalescent-based estimates of effective population size were
   significantly smaller in the east 20,000years ago, at the end of the
   last glacial period.
   Main conclusionsThe results are consistent with a hypothesis in which
   north Pacific populations were separated into eastern and western
   refugia by 317ka with no gene flow since the split. Eastern populations
   probably underwent a severe bottleneck in population size during the
   last glacial period. The contrasting demographic histories of eastern
   and western populations are consistent with the general
   palaeobiogeographical pattern of greater climate-related extinction of
   marine taxa in the eastern Pacific.},

Title = {Potential of Underutilized Marine Organisms for Aquaculture Feeds},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {The supply of land-based agricultural products as aquafeed raw materials
   is challenged by limitations on space and water, and by environmental
   damage. Marine environments offer a vast opportunity for the expansion
   of aquaculture, including the production of feed raw materials. Besides
   fishmeal and fish oil, which are generated from capture fisheries, the
   use of marine-based feed raw materials from aquaculture production is
   not yet in common practice. Here, we discuss the potential of
   underutilized marine organisms that can be cultured by extracting
   nutrients from their environment and are nutritionally compatible for
   use as alternative feed materials in aquaculture. We identify marine
   organisms such as blue and green mussels, Ulva spp., and microbial floc
   that are nutritionally suitable as aquafeed raw material and may further
   act as bioremediators. However, environmental factors that affect
   productivity and the risk of pollutant accumulations, which would
   potentially reduce the safety of aquaculture products for human
   consumption, may pose challenges to such applications of extractive
   organisms. Therefore, the development of pretreatment and processing
   technologies will be critical for improving the nutritional quality and
   safety of these raw materials for aquafeed production.},

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {359},

Abstract = {To understand the effect of sulfate ions on the chloride-induced
   corrosion of reinforced concrete, this study focuses on the
   electrochemical behavior and surface analysis of standarded carbon steel
   that was exposed to simulated pore solutions, with different
   combinations of high and low chloride and sulfate concentrations. Linear
   scanning voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were
   used to monitor the corrosion reaction. Steel surface was characterized
   by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron
   mi-croscopy. Results indicate that the presence of sulfate affects the
   electrochemical behavior of steel corrosion at a low and high chloride
   concentration, where the capability of the corrosion protective layer
   was influenced by the increase of the sulfate and chloride content.
   Calcium carbonate deposits were observed at the surface of corroded
   samples, where higher precipitation of calcium carbonate crystals on
   carbon steel surface is associated with higher rates of localized
   corrosion.},

Title = {Water Resources in Africa under Global Change: Monitoring Surface Waters
   from Space},
Journal = {SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS},
Abstract = {The African continent hosts some of the largest freshwater systems
   worldwide, characterized by a large distribution and variability of
   surface waters that play a key role in the water, energy and carbon
   cycles and are of major importance to the global climate and water
   resources. Freshwater availability in Africa has now become of major
   concern under the combined effect of climate change, environmental
   alterations and anthropogenic pressure. However, the hydrology of the
   African river basins remains one of the least studied worldwide and a
   better monitoring and understanding of the hydrological processes across
   the continent become fundamental. Earth Observation, that offers a
   cost-effective means for monitoring the terrestrial water cycle, plays a
   major role in supporting surface hydrology investigations. Remote
   sensing advances are therefore a game changer to develop comprehensive
   observing systems to monitor Africa's land water and manage its water
   resources. Here, we review the achievements of more than three decades
   of advances using remote sensing to study surface waters in Africa,
   highlighting the current benefits and difficulties. We show how the
   availability of a large number of sensors and observations, coupled with
   models, offers new possibilities to monitor a continent with scarce
   gauged stations. In the context of upcoming satellite missions dedicated
   to surface hydrology, such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography
   (SWOT), we discuss future opportunities and how the use of remote
   sensing could benefit scientific and societal applications, such as
   water resource management, flood risk prevention and environment
   monitoring under current global change.},

Title = {Population trends in boreal birds: Continuing declines in agricultural,
   northern, and long-distance migrant species},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {99-107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {When many environmental changes take place simultaneously, one of the
   first challenges for conservation efforts is to identify the species and
   environments that are in the most need of conservation measures. We
   studied whether there are differences in the population growth trends of
   94 boreal bird species according to their migration strategies, breeding
   distributions (northern or southern), or breeding habitats. To this end,
   we examined recent trends in bird census data covering >1000 km along a
   north-south transect in Finland, from the deciduous forests on the
   southern coast through the boreal taiga forest to the alpine fell area
   in the north. Our results show that long-distance migrants (species
   wintering in western or eastern Africa or Asia), northern species, and
   species living in agricultural environments are in decline in
   north-eastern Europe. The results were the same for both the long-term
   (27 years; 19862012) and the short-term (12 years, the most recent
   reporting period of the EU bird directive; 20012012) data set.
   Additionally, species breeding mainly in urban/sub-urban environments,
   coniferous forests, or wetlands showed negative growth trends,
   especially over the short-term. These results provide updated
   information that can be used to determine the targets of conservation
   efforts focused on Northern Palaearctic birds. Several different
   conservation measures may be needed to help these populations, ranging
   from protecting habitat in the migration and wintering grounds to
   changing climate and agricultural policies at a national and/or
   international level. In addition, further research is needed to identify
   the particular mechanisms underlying the population trends. (C) 2013

Abstract = {The interactions between soil organic matter (SOM) and micro-topography
   and vegetation drive the ecology of wetland ecosystems. We investigated
   the distribution pattern of SOM and its relationships with elevation,
   slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), and normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) in Poyang Lake, the largest
   freshwater lake of China. The local parameters were obtained by applying
   a geographically weighted regression model. Local parameter differences
   were analyzed between two dominant wetland types (dish-shaped pit
   wetland and delta wetland) and among nine land-cover types (deep water,
   shallow water, very shallow water, mudflat, meadow, sparse grassland,
   Carex-Phalaris community, Phragmites-Triarrhena community, and
   Artemisia-Cynodon community). The SOM response to elevation was most
   sensitive in the dish-shaped pit wetland and mudflat, whereas the
   effects of slope on SOM were more significant in the delta wetland and
   vegetated land-cover types. Relatively weaker correlations were observed
   between SOM and aspect in all study zones. Positive correlations were
   found between SOM and TWI, which was strongest in dish-shaped pit
   wetland and deep water. NDVI was positively related to SOM in most
   areas, but the relationships were not significant in the southern area
   and in the mudflat. This study helps to better understand the spatial
   heterogeneity of Poyang Lake.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {135-147},

Abstract = {Statoil is a completely integrated oil and gas Norwegian company which
   established in 1972. The company is one of the most technology-intensive
   world's leading energy producers and covers more than 35 countries
   across the globe. This study proposes how Statoil coordinate with
   environmentally friendly, cost efficient and effective sea transport
   supplier. The study used the theories of supply chain management such as
   model of industrial purchasing process, model of strategic triangle and
   Kraljic purchasing portfolio model. The result of the study identified
   that the emission of environmentally harmful gases from sea transport
   are dependent on the size and the speed of the ships, and the type of
   fuel they consume. The best solution for Statoil to get environmentally
   friendly sea transport service is using suppliers that are certified by
   the preferred standard of ITTC 7.5-04-01-01.2 or ISO 15016:2002. The
   requirement of environmentally friendly sea transport supplier by
   Statoil maximizes the suppliers' risk. Therefore, making partnership
   with the supplier is the effective and giving the contract with a cost
   reimbursable agreement of fuel price adjustment (escalation clause) is
   the cost efficient coordination of Statoil. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Ecological time series and integrative taxonomy unveil seasonality and
   diversity of the toxic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia H. Peragallo in the
   northern Adriatic Sea},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Pseudo-nitzschia H. Peragallo (1900) is a globally distributed genus of
   pennate diatoms that are important components of phytoplankton
   communities worldwide. Some members of the genus produce the neurotoxin
   domoic acid, so regular monitoring is in place. However, the
   identification of toxic members in routine samplings remains
   problematic. In this study, the diversity and seasonal occurrence of
   Pseudo-nitzschia species were investigated in the Gulf of Trieste, a
   shallow gulf in the northern Adriatic Sea. We used time series data from
   2005 to 2018 to describe the seasonal and inter-annual occurrence of the
   genus in the area and its contribution to the phytoplankton community.
   On average, the genus accounted for about 15 \% of total diatom
   abundance and peaked in spring and autumn, with occasional outbreaks
   during summer and large inter-annual fluctuations. Increased water
   temperature and decreased salinity positively affected the presence of
   some members of the genus, while strong effects could be masked by an
   unsuitable definition of the species complexes used for monitoring
   purposes. Therefore, combining morphological (TEM) and molecular
   analyses by sequencing the ITS, 28S and rbcL markers, eight species were
   identified from 83 isolated monoclonal strains: P. calliantha, P.
   fraudulenta, P. delicatissima, P. galaxiae, P. mannii, P. multistriata,
   P. pungens and P. subfraudulenta. A genetic comparison between the
   isolated strains and other strains in the Mediterranean was carried out
   and rbcL was inspected as a potential barcode marker in respect to our
   results. This is the first study in the Gulf of Trieste on
   Pseudo-nitzschia time series from a long-term ecological research (LTER)
   site coupled with molecular data. We show that meaningful ecological
   conclusions can be drawn by applying integrative methodology, as opposed
   to the approach that only considers species complexes. The results of
   this work will provide guidance for further monitoring efforts as well
   as research activities, including population genetics and genomics,
   associated with seasonal distribution and toxicity profiles.},

Title = {One-step spontaneous growth of NiFe layered double hydroxide at room
   temperature for seawater oxygen evolution},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Electrochemical seawater splitting is a promising technique because it
   addresses two major challenges, clean energy production and seawater
   desalination, at the same time. Therefore, seeking out a facile and
   cost-effective way to synthesize highly active and stable
   seawater-splitting catalysts is of great interest to both the research
   community and industry. Here we developed an Fe2+-driven, one-step, and
   spontaneous fabrication method for a seawater-oxygen-evolution-active
   NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) at room temperature. The NiFe LDH
   was found to exhibit very high activity and stability toward the oxygen
   evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline natural seawater electrolyte,
   delivering current densities of 100 and 500 mA/cm(2) at low
   overpotentials of 247 and 296 mV, respectively, and with no significant
   degradation observed over long-term stability testing of 96 h under a
   large current density of 500 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH seawater electrolyte.
   After coupling with a good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst,
   NiMoN, the two-electrode electrolyzer was found to achieve current
   densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA/cm(2) at voltages of 1.477, 1.533, and
   1.665 V, respectively, in alkaline natural seawater with good durability
   over 100 h at 500 mA/cm(2). The oxidation of Fe2+ is the driving force
   for the growth of NiFe LDH, and this mechanism is universal to the
   fabrication of other Fe-based hydroxides as efficient OER catalysts. (C)

Title = {Balanced mesoscale motion and stratified turbulence forced by convection},

Volume = {123},

Abstract = {Numerical experiments are carried out with a large-eddy simulation model
   to investigate the production of stratified turbulence and gravity wave
   energy in the atmospheric mesoscale by deep convection. Relatively long
   integrations (typically about 2.5 days) are carried out, so that
   statistical equilibrium might be achieved for an atmosphere subject to
   fixed cooling and a ground surface maintained at constant temperature.
   The main simulations may be considered as representing convective
   activity in a cold airstream passing over warm seas. The transfer of
   updraught kinetic energy into quasi-horizontal rotational energy, and
   its subsequent cascade to larger scales, is examined in the context of
   the production of balanced motion and stratified turbulence theory.
   Experiments are carried out to examine the effects of the Coriolis
   force, a wave-damping stratosphere, boundary-layer vertical wind shear,
   and precipitation.
   An inverse mesoscale energy cascade is observed in experiments both with
   and without background rotation (the Coriolis effect), although weaker
   in the latter case. Mean boundary-layer vorticity is found to be the
   principal source of the horizontal rotational energy created by deep
   convection, although the dipole character of the vorticity thereby
   produced frustrates the inverse energy cascade. At the level of
   convective detrainment, potential-vorticity anomalies have a small
   monopolar element in the rotating case and this implies a direct forcing
   of energy at large scales. It also promotes a more efficient inverse
   energy cascade through long-range influence. The inverse energy cascade
   arises primarily because of the quasi-two-dimensional, divergence-free
   nature of the flow at scales larger than the convective forcing, which
   is maintained by the stable stratification. Even in the absence of
   background rotation balanced flow arises, especially in the upper
   troposphere and in the decay phase of the simulations when the surface
   fluxes and atmospheric cooling driving the convection are removed. In
   these cases potential-vorticity inversion can be quite successful in
   determining the other field variables, with contributions from both
   geostrophic and cyclostrophic balance. Suppression of precipitation
   (i.e. removing the liquid-water phase) increases the net convective mass
   transfer through the elimination of convective downdraughts, which leads
   to a higher efficiency of balanced-flow energy production and upscale
   energy transfer. Intense `meso-vortices', with warm core structure, form
   spontaneously after about 2.5 days integration in these runs.},

Title = {Income Maximisation in a Maltese Household Photovoltaic System by Means
   of Output and Consumption Simulations},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the Maltese Islands
   plays an important role in allowing Malta to increase its share in
   renewable energy to meet the set European Union targets. In the Maltese
   residential sector, PV systems are generally installed on rooftops of
   households with a south-facing orientation and a 30 degrees inclination
   angle. The scope of this study is to present a methodology to maximise
   the income for residents from electricity generated, by comparing the
   output of electricity generation with the electricity consumption
   patterns of different household types and consequently identifying the
   most favourable installation configurations of these PV systems. The
   research was carried out by simulating the monthly electricity
   generation of a 3 kilowatt-peak PV system for a year, as well as the
   hourly electricity generation for a day in each season of the year using
   the PVsyst software package. A total of 21 configurations were studied
   by altering the orientation and inclination angles used to install the
   PV system. This study confirms that a south-facing PV system inclined at
   30 degrees generates the most electricity in a year. However, when
   compared with electricity consumption patterns of low-, medium- and
   high-consumption households, it is shown that a south-facing PV system
   inclined at 40 degrees provides a better income for residents.},

Title = {Stability Mechanism and Control Factors on Equipment Removal Area under
   ``Goaf-Roof-Coal{''} Structure},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {One of the main difficulties in longwall mining (LM) is the movement of
   mining equipment from one panel to the next panel during mining process.
   The shields of the LM face may be damaged by the collapse of the roof in
   shallow coal seam under the ``Goaf-Roof-Coal{''} (GRC) structure,
   especially when moving the shields from the current panel to the next
   panel. In order to solve this problem, the stability mechanism and its
   control factors during the LM equipment removal were investigated by
   using comprehensive methods including theoretical analysis, numerical
   simulation, and field validation based on the working conditions of
   Panel 31102 in Liangshuijing Coal Mine. The numerical simulations
   demonstrate that four different failure zones, shear failure zone,
   tension failure zone, partly elastic zone, and plastic failure zone,
   appear around the area due to the position of rock and the arrangements
   of the supports. The shear failure zone, which is controlled by shield
   working resistance and roof supporting strength, is the main cause of
   the failure in the removal area. To minimize the shear failure zone,
   several measures such as optimizing the end position for LM face,
   decreasing the width of removal area, and increasing the amount of cable
   support were taken to ensure the stability of surrounding rock in
   removal area, which have successfully controlled the damage of roof and
   equipment in Panel 31102. The field observation confirms that the
   proposed stability mechanism and control measures are effective under
   GRC structure.},

Abstract = {One of the effective methods for increasing reliability and reducing
   power losses is the use of distributed generation (DG) based on
   renewable energy. Because of the cost of proper installation and low
   cost of operation, these resources are one of the means of providing
   energy in the event of a definite occurrence and preventing the creation
   of islanding mode in the network. In this paper, three solar energy
   sources, wind turbines and batteries are reviewed to improve reliability
   and reduce power losses in distribution systems. Two reliability
   indicators are included in the objective function, which are: system
   average interruption duration index (SAIDI) and system average
   interruption frequency index (SAIFI). Two objective functions are
   defined which, in both functions, is the ultimate objective of improving
   reliability and reducing the loss of power of the distribution system.
   In the first objective function, the minimization of total network costs
   was prioritized, while in the second objective function, normalizing the
   values, the minimization was done parametrically. This problem has been
   minimized using the Improved Group Search Optimization (IGSO) algorithm.
   The model is implemented on a standard 30-bus network and several
   scenarios have been defined based on the number of units placed, and the
   performance of the model and the proposed algorithm has been evaluated.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in Jazan region of south-western Saudi Arabia.
   Vegetation cover, frequency, abundance and soil characteristics were
   analysed at three locations with different quantitative and descriptive
   vegetation characteristics. Plant species were classified into three
   primary communities dominated by Salvadora persic, Acacia tortilis and
   Ziziphus spini-Christi. The results indicated that the distribution of
   plant species is controlled by soil characteristics. Very limited water
   resources are also limiting factor in vegetation growth. Among the three
   studied sites, desert and coastal environments are affected by
   desertification. Rehabilitation of the degraded lands requires
   collaborative efforts and support from the different related
   governmental sectors. Ecological conservation and sustainable

Abstract = {In the process of geothermal development of high-temperature rock mass
   in ocean plate, there are three coupling effects of seepage field,
   stress field and temperature field. Combining with the thermal fracture,
   temperature field variation and heat convection exchange law of
   high-temperature rock mass around reservoir, a geothermal-fluid-solid
   coupling damage model of high-temperature rock mass is established, and
   the energy loss in the coupling process is calculated by using the
   model. A mathematical model of energy loss in the process of heat energy
   acquisition is constructed by studying the internal structure of
   collector. Based on the study of geothermal development and application
   process of high temperature rock mass and the above model, an energy
   loss assessment model for geothermal development of high temperature
   rock mass in Ocean plate is constructed, and optimized by particle swarm
   optimization and interior point hybrid optimization algorithm. Particle
   swarm optimization and interior point penalty constraints are used to
   reduce the computational complexity of the assessment process and
   improve the accuracy of energy loss assessment results. The feasibility
   of the proposed method is verified by comparing the experimental results
   with the current methods and expert assessment results.},

Title = {Bamboo coral Ba/Ca: Calibration of a new deep ocean refractory nutrient
   proxy},

Abstract = {It is poorly understood how intermediate water masses are affected by
   decadal scale climate via biogeochemical cycling, export production, and
   changes in circulation/ventilation. To this end, a geochemical nutrient
   proxy from deep-sea bamboo corals would provide decadal to centennial
   scale records of deep and intermediate-water nutrient dynamics. Seawater
   barium (Ba-SW) has a nutrient-like distribution in the water-column
   (similar to silicate), so Ba/Ca records in foraminifera, shallow water
   surface corals, and other deep-sea corals have been used to trace
   refractory nutrients. Here we present the first calibration of a
   nutrient proxy from skeletal barium preserved in the calcitic internodes
   of deep-sea bamboo corals, collected from intermediate water depths. A
   calibration was calculated from a broadly distributed suite of Isidella
   and Keratoisis corals spanning a silicate and Ba-SW gradient (n=33
   corals; 300-2800 m):
   Ba/Ca-bamboo (coral)(mu mol/mol) = (0.079 +/- 0.008) {*} Ba-SW(nmol/kg)
   + (4.205 +/- 0.870) (r(2) = 0.77; n = 33)
   The strong linear correlation between Ba/Ca-bamboo coral and Ba-SW
   suggests that coral Ba/Ca is a reliable recorder of seawater barium
   (and, therefore, silicate). We find a distribution coefficient (D-Ba)
   for Ba/Ca-bamboo coral of 1.3 +/- 02, similar to that of other corals
   (surface and deep-sea dwelling) and inorganic calcium carbonate
   precipitation experiments (D-Ba = 1.2-1.5). This suggests that Ba
   incorporation is primarily driven by cationic substitution in bamboo
   corals and holds promise as a globally applicable refractory nutrient
   proxy. We find interannual-decadal scale variability in a Ba/Ca-bamboo
   coral timeseries from a California Margin coral (San Juan Seamount; 1295
   m). These data suggest that additional high-resolution Ba/Ca-bamboo
   coral records may reveal a connection between regional-scale
   intermediate water biogeochemistry and low-latitude surface
   ocean/atmospheric climate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A method for measuring three components of the CO2 system, pH,
   alkalinity (A(t)) and total CO2 (TCO2) in coastal seawater is presented.
   The measurements are sufficiently precise to register CO2 changes of
   biological origin in surficial and coastal waters or in culture media.
   The method is based on a modified potentiometric titration of seawater
   with acid in a custom-built cell with the data plotted as a difference
   derivative, giving two peaks from which total carbonate and alkalinity
   can be computed. pH is calculated directly from the initial millivolt
   reading of the sample. One important aspect of this technique is that,
   unlike a Gran titration, the measured values of pH, A(t) and TCO2 are
   independent of any pre-conceived seawater model. In this work we
   demonstrate that the relative position of the two peaks (used for
   determining TCO2) is relatively insensitive to interferences from
   dissolved organic matter to about 1 x 10(-4) M, while peak height is
   sensitive to it. This last observation permits the detection of organic
   bases which might be included in the measurement of alkalinity. (C) 1999

Abstract = {The biogeochemical transformation of carbon, and the exchange of carbon
   dioxide and oxygen over the sea-air interface were evaluated from
   measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, dissolved
   oxygen and nitrate in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The
   investigation was carried out. along longitude 6degreesE from December
   1997 to January 1998 and was focused on three areas; the Spring Ice Edge
   (SIE), the Winter Ice Edge (WIE) and the Antarctic Polar Front (APF).
   The method is based on the assumption that differences between preformed
   and measured concentration of any property, are attributable to
   biological processes and sea-air exchange. By correcting the deficit of
   carbon and excess of oxygen observed in the surface mixed layer for the
   biological activity, the sea-air exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen
   is estimated. In the SIE and the APF, a net release of carbon dioxide to
   the atmosphere of 0.1 and 0.5 mol m(-2), respectively, was calculated
   over a time scale of several months (from austral winter to January). In
   the WIE a net oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide was calculated, with a
   sea-air exchange of -0.1 mol m(-2). The calculated sea-air exchange of
   oxygen in the APF indicated an oceanic net release of oxygen to the
   atmosphere of 1.2 mol m(-2). In the SIE and the WIE the sea-air exchange
   of oxygen was -0.3 and -1.4 mol m(-2), respectively, from austral winter
   to January. Averaging the integrated sea-air exchanges indicated that
   the entire region acted as a weak oceanic source of carbon dioxide, from
   austral winter to January. The corresponding oxygen sea-air exchange
   showed a sink. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As an indispensable equipment in thermal power plants, the high-power
   coolant pump is necessary for high hydraulic performance with good
   structural safety for transferring of heat produced by fuels. However,
   the design of blade thickness for coolant pump especially at the
   off-design condition is still empirical and arbitrary. In the present
   work, the hydraulic performance, internal flow pattern, and structural
   response arising from the variations of blade thickness in coolant pump
   have been investigated using computational fluid dynamics and
   fluid-structure interaction methods. The numerical results have been
   verified by experimental performance and found to be good. To improve
   the accuracy of head calculation at the overload condition, a modified
   equation is proposed with the help of multi-island genetic algorithm and
   the average deviation is reduced from 58.50 to 1.59\%. With the blade
   thickening process, the hydraulic performance is gradually deteriorated
   especially at the overload condition, and the flow behavior is changed
   with the proportion of high velocity near the pressure surface
   enlarging, the proportion of low velocity near the suction surface
   decreasing, and the pressure fluctuation intensity rising. Besides,
   increasing the blade thickness beyond 23.0 mm, the stress reduction is
   not effective. However, it helps to increase the natural frequency for
   suppressing the resonance. Finally, considering the optimal hydraulic
   and structural performances, the blade thickness is optimized to 23.0
   mm.},

Abstract = {Momentum and kinetic energy fluxes associated with low-latitude
   transient disturbances at upper-levels play an important role in the
   general circulation of the atmosphere. They are related to eastward and
   equatorward propagating, positively tilted wave trains from the
   extratropics. Theoretical, modelling and observational studies show that
   this particular kind of tropical-extratropical interaction is most
   common in regions of mean upper-level westerlies at low latitudes, i.e.
   over the central and eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans during boreal
   winter and spring. The penetration of an upper-level trough into the
   Tropics is often associated with enhanced convection and the formation
   of an east- and poleward stretching elongated band of upper- and
   midlevel clouds, usually referred to as a `tropical plume' (TP).
   The present study provides an overview of various aspects related to the
   penetration of upper-level disturbances to low latitudes, including a
   description of the involved meteorological phenomena, climatological
   aspects, interannual variability, linear Rossby-wave and critical line
   theory, results from barotropic and higher-complexity modelling studies,
   the vertical structure of the disturbances as well as sources for the
   wave energy. In addition, the dynamical relation of the upper-troughs to
   convection, moisture transports and precipitation in the subtropics will
   be discussed. The paper concludes with a number of research perspectives
   for future investigations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cancer cells release their DNA into the patient's bodily fluids and
   cancer-specific signatures can be recognized in the circulating DNA. The
   aberrant methylation of CpG-rich regions in gene promoter sequences is
   an early marker of cell transformation whose specificity and optimal
   sensitivity can be achieved by assessing the methylation status of
   multiple genes ('methylation profiling'). Most of the current
   technologies for methylation analysis rely upon the combination of
   chemical conversion of the DNA and PCR analysis for the detection of
   methylated and unmethylated alleles. However, the small amount of
   circulating DNA, and its fragmentation, dramatically reduces the
   template DNA molecules making difficult the methylation profiling. To
   overcome this limitation, we have developed the Meth-DOP-PCR assay, a
   combination between a modified degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR
   (DOP-PCR) and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), for the high-throughput
   methylation analysis of trace-amount of circulating DNA. We have
   demonstrated the concordance between Meth-DOP-PCR and MSP and shown the
   application of this technique for the methylation analysis of DNA
   extracted from the serum of lung cancer patients. We have estimated that
   through this procedure it is possible to obtain at least a 25-fold
   increase of the number of determinations allowing the methylation
   profiling from less than 1 ml of serum. Thus, Meth-DOP-PCR appears as a
   simple, cost-effective and efficient technique, for the development of
   novel methylation-based diagnostic assays.},

Abstract = {Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is, arguably, the
   most impactful disease on the North American swine industry. The Swine
   Health Monitoring Project (SHMP) is a national volunteer initiative
   aimed at monitoring incidence and, ultimately, supporting swine disease
   control, including PRRS. Data collected through the SHMP currently
   represents approximately 42\% of the sow population of the United
   States. The objective of the study here was to investigate the
   association between geographical factors (including land elevation, and
   land coverage) and PRRS incidence as recorded in the SHMP. Weekly PRRS
   status data from sites participating in the SHMP from 2009 to 2016 (n =
   706) was assessed. Number of PRRS outbreaks, years of participation in
   the SHMP, and site location were collected from the SHMP database.
   Environmental features hypothesized to influence PRRS risk included land
   coverage (cultivated areas, shrubs and trees), land altitude (in meters
   above sea level) and land slope (in degrees compared to surrounding
   areas). Other risk factors considered included region, production system
   to which the site belonged, herd size, and swine density in the area in
   which the site was located. Land-related variables and pig density were
   captured in raster format from a number of sources and extracted to
   points (farm locations). A mixed-effects Poisson regression model was
   built; and dependence among sites that belonged to a given production
   system was accounted for using a random effect at the system level. The
   annual mean and median number of outbreaks per farm was 1.38 (SD: 1.6),
   and 1 (IQR: 2.0), respectively. The maximum annual number of outbreaks
   per farm was 9, and approximately 40\% of the farms did not report any
   outbreak. Results from the final multivariable model suggested that
   increments of swine density and herd size increased the risk for PRRS
   outbreaks (P < 0.01). Even though altitude (meters above sea level) was
   not significant in the final model, farms located in terrains with a
   slope of 9\% or higher had lower rates of PRRS outbreaks compared to
   farms located in terrains with slopes lower than 2\% (P < 0.01).
   Finally, being located in an area of shrubs/herbaceous cover and trees
   lowered the incidence rate of PRRS outbreaks compared to being located
   in cultivated/ managed areas (P < 0.05). In conclusion, highly inclined
   terrains were associated with fewer PRRS outbreaks in US sow farms, as
   was the presence of shrubs and trees when compared to cultivated/managed
   areas. Influence of terrain characteristics on spread of airborne
   diseases, such as PRRS, may help to predicting disease risk, and
   effective planning of measures intended to mitigate and prevent risk of
   infection.},

Title = {New insight into proactive goaf inertisation for spontaneous combustion

Abstract = {Spontaneous heating in the active goaf area during normal mining
   processes poses increased threats to mine productivity and safety, as
   evidenced in events induced by spontaneous combustion of coal. To
   control and mitigate this engineering problem, there is a need to gain
   critical knowledge of spontaneous combustion in the longwall goaf area,
   which can be achieved through a combination of field tests and numerical
   modeling. This paper introduces the spontaneous combustion management
   system widely used in Australia and presents Computational Fluid
   Dynamics (CFD) models for the simulation of gas flow dynamics in the
   goaf area, based on the site conditions of an underground coal mine
   where coal seam gas is predominantly comprised of carbon dioxide. The
   models were validated with gas monitoring data and used to conduct
   parametric studies for proactive goaf inertisation optimization.
   Qualitative and quantitative analysis of simulation results indicated
   that better goaf inertisation could be achieved when nitrogen was
   injected via cut-through at 250 m on the maingate (MG) side and surface
   boreholes at 100 m and 700 m on the tailgate (TG) side, with a total
   injection rate greater than 1750 l/s. The oxygen concentration on the MG
   and TG side dropped below 5\% at distances of 120 m and 75 m behind the
   longwall face, with an oxidation zone area of 35375 m2, which was
   approximately one-third of the oxidation zone area of the scenario
   without inert gas injection. Simulation results help shed light on
   improving current goaf inertisation practices to effectively reduce the
   risk of heating in goaf areas and improve mining process safety based on
   Australian conditions and practices.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {The effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) under future expected
   conditions of acidification and increase in nutrient inputs were studied
   on a post-bloom phytoplankton and bacterioplankton community of
   Patagonian coastal waters. We performed an experiment using microcosms
   where two environmental conditions were mimicked using a cluster
   approach: present (ambient nutrients and pH) and future (increased
   nutrients and acidification), and acclimating the samples for five days
   to two radiation treatments (full solar radiation {[}+UVR] and exclusion
   of UVR {[}-UVR]). We evaluated the short-term (hours) sensitivity of the
   community to solar UVR through chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters
   (e.g. the effective photochemical quantum yield of PSII {[}Phi(PSII)])
   at the beginning, at the mid-point and at the end of the acclimation
   period. Primary production and heterotrophic bacterial production (HBP)
   were determined, and biological weighting functions were calculated, at
   the beginning and at the end of the acclimation period. Mid-term effects
   (days) were evaluated as changes in taxonomic composition, growth rates
   and size structure of the community. Although the UVR-induced inhibition
   on Phi(PSII) decreased in both clusters, samples remained sensitive to
   UVR after the 5 days of acclimation. Also, under the future conditions,
   there was, in general, an increase in the phytoplankton carbon
   incorporation rates along the experiment as compared to the present
   conditions. Bacterioplankton sensitivity to UVR changed along the
   experiment from inhibition to enhancement of HBP, and future
   environmental conditions stimulated bacterial growth, probably due to
   indirect effects caused by phytoplankton. Those changes in the microbial
   loop functioning and structure under future global change conditions
   might have important consequences for the carbon pump and thus for the
   carbon sequestration and trophodynamics of Patagonian coastal waters.},

Title = {Glacier-groundwater stress gradients control alpine river biodiversity},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1263-1275},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In alpine river networks, water source (i.e. snow, ice or groundwater)
   plays a major role in influencing flow regimes, benthic habitat and
   macro-invertebrate community structure. Across these systems, a natural
   stress gradient can be conceptualized, from rivers fed exclusively by
   meltwater (harsh habitat) to those with no melt input (relatively
   benign, groundwater fed). However, despite the current context of rapid
   glacier retreat, our understanding of linkages between meltwater
   contributions, physico-chemical habitat and biodiversity remains
   limited. To address this research gap, habitat characteristics and
   macro-invertebrate community structure were studied at 26 sites (five
   river basins) in the French Pyrenees across a meltwater gradient from
   0\% to 99\%. A combination of generalized regression models and
   multivariate analyses showed that the stress gradient was associated
   with the following: (i) linear responses of key physico-chemical habitat
   variables, in particular bed stability, (ii) unimodal responses at the
   community level (e.g. richness and total density peaks at 40-60\%
   meltwater contribution), and (iii) both unimodal and monotonic responses
   at the level of individual taxa. Sites characterized by high
   contributions of meltwater, although species poor, were important for
   beta diversity because of their specialist endemic fauna. Our findings
   suggest that continued glacier and snowpack retreat due to expected
   future climate change are likely to lead to more homogeneous alpine
   river habitats (i.e. reduced meltwater-groundwater stress gradient
   breadth). As a result, increased alpha diversity is expected as
   previously harsh habitats become more favourable; however, an associated
   decrease in beta diversity is likely as glacial stream specialists
   become replaced by generalists. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {A critical evaluation of the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 and the

Volume = {225},

Abstract = {The marine conservation strategy focused on the establishment of marine
   protected areas (MPAs) has been adopted widely in the Mediterranean, in
   line with the main international conservation conventions and
   agreements. Of particular relevance is the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11
   of the Convention on Biological Diversity, where signature countries
   agreed to protect and effectively manage 10\% of coastal and marine
   areas by 2020. The convention also specifies a number of qualitative
   elements that MPAs should encompass in order to be effective. But as
   2020 approaches, this objective is far from being achieved and the
   deadline is necessitating a pace of planning, declaration, management
   and evaluation of the Mediterranean network of MPAs that is unattainable
   for most of the Southeast Mediterranean riparian states. The Aichi
   target 11 objectives encompass countries with remarkably different
   economical, historical and cultural backgrounds and varying degrees of
   technical capacity and political stability. Here we explore how the
   area-based conservation policy at both the national and international
   level is evolving In the Mediterranean in relation to the Aichi target
   11 objectives. We evidence strong shortcomings in the Mediterranean MPAs
   highlight potential risks derived from conservation policy failure, and
   propose alternatives towards effective conservation. We suggest that the
   prevailing area based strategy in the Mediterranean should be
   substituted by a procedure that is not time-limited and that is based on
   environmental and social sciences, supported by marine spatial planning
   and balancing the scientific and socioeconomic drivers of change in a
   specific national or sub-regional context.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, energy and water are some of the most important issues facing
   the mining industry. Many mines are located in desert areas, and they
   need to pump water from isolated wells or from the ocean. Therefore, in
   order to satisfy the water demand, many high-power water pump stations
   are required. The operation of these systems is expensive due to the
   high energy cost. This paper presents a case of study of a solar
   photovoltaic (PV) system to assist the operation of a water pump station
   of a mineral processing operation in Chile. An economical analysis is
   carried out with respect to different design variables and the
   percentage of the total power required for operating the system in the
   less favorable conditions (degree of assistance). It is demonstrated
   that the maximum net present value is obtained for the maximum
   assistance, i.e., supplying the full energy in the less favorable
   conditions. However, the internal rate of return will be maximized at
   the point where the system only supplies the energy to satisfy the full
   demand at the most favorable conditions. Finally, the study shows that
   from an economical point of view, PV technology is an attractive
   alternative to support the mining operation at present time.},

Abstract = {Aragonite was synthesized inorganically using a seeded-growth technique
   to characterize precipitation kinetics for the heterogeneous growth of
   solid from dilute solutions (ionic strength: 0.05-0.07 mol l(-1)). The
   concentration of all aqueous constituents, including Ca (similar to 5-15
   mmol l(-1)), Na (similar to 10-35 mmol l(-1)), Cl (similar to 30-35 mmol
   l(-1)), and carbon (as total alkalinity: similar to 10 to 17 meq l(-1)),
   was held constant by the addition of titrants that contained excess
   solute concentrations to balance the growth of solid phase during the
   precipitation reaction, and a CO(2)/N(2) gas mixture (0.009-0.178) was
   bubbled through each solution to facilitate mass exchange between
   gaseous and aqueous carbon species. Forty-three experiments were
   conducted at 10A degrees (similar to n = 13), 25A degrees (n = 21), and
   40A degrees C (n = 9), over a range of average saturation states with
   respect to aragonite from 8.3 to 28.5, 2.9 to 19.6 and 2.0 to 12.2, and
   average precipitation rates from 10(2.8) to 10(3.8), 10(2.3) to 10(4.0),
   and 10(2.5) to 10(4.1) micromol m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Reaction
   orders averaged 1.7 +/- A 0.10 at 10A degrees, 1.7 +/- A 0.07 at 25A
   degrees and 1.5 +/- A 0.06 at 40A degrees, and they were independent of
   temperature while rate constants averaged 10(1.3) +/- A 0.12, 10(1.9)
   +/- A 0.06, and 10(2.6) +/- A 0.04 micromol m(-2) h(-1), respectively,
   increasing one-half order of magnitude for each 15A degrees C rise in
   temperature. From these data, an Arrhenius activation energy of 71.2 kJ
   mol(-1) is calculated for the heterogeneous precipitation of aragonite.
   This value is comparable to a sole independent measurement of 80.7 kJ
   mol(-1) reported for the solid-solution recrystallization of
   monohydrocalcite to aragonite (Munemoto and Fukushi in J Mineral Petrol
   Sci 103: 345-349, 2008).},

Title = {Genesis of limestone megabreccias and their significance in carbonate
   sequence stratigraphic models: a review},
Journal = {SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {112},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {163-193},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A re-appraisal of the factors controlling the deposition of carbonate
   megabreccias and their sequence stratigraphic significance is presented
   based on an examination of the mechanisms for instigating carbonate
   seafloor slope instability and a review of the depositional settings of
   these distinctive rock deposits. Limestone megabreccias have classically
   been interpreted as formed by the catastrophic collapse of high-angle
   metastable `oversteepened' carbonate platform margins. However, a review
   of megabreccia occurrence shows that these deposits formed on a broad
   range of carbonate slope angles and that metastable oversteepened slopes
   are not necessary for their genesis. A re-evaluation constructed from
   first principles of mechanisms promoting submarine gravitational
   instability indicates that pore-water overpressure of confined aquifer
   horizons beneath the seafloor rather than slope oversteepening, is the
   critical control on megabreccia deposition. Catastrophic release of
   overpressure may initiate gravitational instability of previously
   kinematically stable slopes.
   The relative importance of endogenic processes intrinsically linked to
   the depositional system and exogenic processes operating independently
   in generating megabreccias is assessed. Two particularly important
   mechanisms in generating megabreccias are endogenic processes causing
   overpressure at discrete hydrologically confined horizons beneath the
   seafloor during relative sea-level falls, and increases in stress as
   pore-fluid drains from the sediment when the platform-top becomes
   subaerially exposed during relative lowstands of sea-level. The
   increased likelihood of megabreccia genesis during relative sea-level
   falls is supported by an empirical trend identified from a review of the
   stratigraphic distribution of documented megabreccias. Exogenic causes
   of gravitational instability with inherently random periodicity,
   especially seismicity, may account for the small number of documented
   megabreccias that do not conform to this underlying trend.
   The proposed endogenic pattern favouring megabreccia deposition during
   relative sea-level falls is important in a sequence stratigraphic
   context. Megabreccia deposits may build volumetrically significant
   toe-of-slope wedges and aprons during relative lowstands of sea-level,
   partially compensating for the decrease/loss in the supply of fresh
   granular sediment as the platform-top carbonate factory contracts.
   Lowstand wedges and aprons in carbonate systems therefore generally
   differ in composition from equivalent highstand deposits in being
   composed not of calciturbidite deposits but of megabreccias cannibalized
   from the upper slope.},

Title = {Contrasting shifts in coral assemblages with increasing disturbances},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {783-793},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Increasing incidence of major disturbances is contributing to extensive
   and widespread coral loss, thereby undermining the biodiversity,
   structure and function of reef ecosystems. The composition of coral
   assemblages is already changing due to selective effects of recurrent
   disturbances, combined with marked differences in the underlying
   life-history dynamics of corals, which affects their recovery. This
   study quantifies the effects of varying disturbance regimes on two
   groups of corals with divergent life histories: short-lived species with
   rapid growth (bushy and tabular Acropora) and long-lived species with
   slow growth (massive and columnar Porites). Inter-decadal shifts in the
   coral assemblages across four locations suggest that a high frequency of
   moderate disturbances favours Porites, whereas infrequent, but severe
   disturbances favour rapidly replenishing Acropora. Using empirical
   modelling, we expand these observations to show that Acropora continues
   to dominate so long as the interval between major disturbances is > 2
   years. The only disturbance regime we considered that favoured Porites
   was high frequency (2-year recurrence) of moderate disturbance, whereas
   high frequency of severe disturbances led to local extirpation of both
   Acropora and Porites. Our results show that increasing incidence of
   major disturbances will not necessarily lead to selective loss of
   species that are most susceptible to disturbance, as long as these
   species can continue to colonise vacant space and grow quickly in the
   aftermath of such disturbances. This study highlights the need to
   consider the sensitivity of taxa to changes in both disturbance
   frequency and severity when forecasting changes in the composition of
   coral assemblages under new disturbance regimes.},

Abstract = {Solutions to current global environmental problems throughout
   fundamental ecological understandings are only reached through
   international programmatic and scientific collaborations. Both
   scientists and policymakers recognize the importance of the role of
   carbon cycle science (CCS) in North America, however regional ecological
   studies in North America often do not include the role of Mexico. Given
   the sharp ecological, climatic and socioeconomic differences among the
   three countries conforming North America it is fundamental to
   incorporate Mexico's unique contributions toward regional CCS. We
   provide a synthesis of opportunities and challenges for advancing land
   and ocean research in Mexico in order to move toward a complete North
   American continental scale CCS. First, we provide the socio-ecological
   context of Mexico relevant to CCS. Second, we compare the existing
   relationships among scientific/governmental entities and funding
   agencies that contribute to CCS in the United States and Mexico. Third,
   we discuss Mexico's state-of-the-art CCS, and synthesize its recent
   advances with emphasis on land- and ocean-atmosphere interactions. We
   highlight continental-scale opportunities toward a tri-national carbon

Title = {What are the likely changes in mercury concentration in the Arctic
   atmosphere and ocean under future emissions scenarios?},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {836},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Arctic mercury (Hg) concentrations respond to changes in anthropogenic
   Hg emissions and environmental change. This manuscript, prepared for the
   2021 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme Mercury Assessment,
   explores the response of Arctic Ocean Hg concentrations to changing
   primary Hg emissions and to changing sea-ice cover, river inputs, and
   net primary production. To do this, we conduct a model analysis using a
   2015 Hg inventory and future anthropogenic Hg emission scenarios. We
   model future atmospheric Hg deposition to the surface ocean as a flux to
   the surface water or sea ice using three scenarios: No Action, New
   Policy (NP), and Maximum Feasible Reduction (MFR). We then force a
   five-compartment box model of Hg cycling in the Arctic Ocean with these
   scenarios and literature-derived climate variables to simulate
   environmental change. No Action results in a 51\% higher Hg deposition
   rate by 2050 while increasing Hg concentrations in the surface water by
   22\% and <9\% at depth. Both ``action{''} scenarios (NP and MFR),
   implemented in 2020 or 2035, result in lower Hg deposition ranging from
   7\% (NP delayed to 2035) to 30\% (MFR implemented in 2020) by 2050.
   Under this last scenario, ocean Hg concentrations decline by 14\% in the
   surface and 4\% at depth. We find that the sea-ice cover decline exerts
   the strongest Hg reducing forcing on the Arctic Ocean while increasing
   river discharge increases Hg concentrations. When modified together the
   climate scenarios result in a <= 5\% Hg decline by 2050 in the Arctic
   Ocean. Thus, we show that the magnitude of emissions induced future
   changes in the Arctic Ocean is likely to be substantial compared to
   climate-induced effects. Furthermore, this study underscores the need
   for prompt and ambitious action for changing Hg concentrations in the
   Arctic, since delaying less ambitious reduction measures-like NP-until
   2035 may become offset by Hg accumulated from pre 2035 emissions.},

Title = {What is the role of zooxanthellae during coral bleaching? Review of
   zooxanthellae and their response to environmental stress},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are diverse and productive but sensitive ecosystems. Due to
   the impact of climate change, these organisms are in danger of dying
   out, mainly through the process of coral bleaching, which is the process
   by which zooxanthellae (algal endosymbionts) are expelled from their
   respective coral hosts, causing the coral to lose colour and become
   white. Coral bleaching has been linked to increases in sea surface
   temperatures as well as an increase in light intensity. We reviewed the
   different zooxanthellae taxa and their ecological traits, as well as the
   information available on the protective mechanisms present in
   zooxanthellae cells when they experience environmental stress
   conditions, such as temperature fluctuations, specifically concentrating
   on heat shock proteins and their response to antioxidant stress. The
   eight clades (A-H) previously recognised were reorganised into seven
   existing genera. Different zooxanthellae taxa exhibit different
   ecological traits such as their photosynthetic stress responses to light
   and temperature. Zooxanthellae have the ability to regulate the number
   and type of heat shock proteins (Hsps) they produce during a heat
   response. They can also regulate the host's respective Hsps. Antioxidant
   responses that can prevent coral hosts from expelling the zooxanthellae,
   can be found both within exposed coral tissue and the zooxanthellae
   cells. Despite the lower likelihood of bleaching in South African coral
   reefs, genetic engineering presents a useful tool to understand and
   adapt traits within zooxanthellae genotypes to help mitigate coral
   bleaching in the future.
   Significance:
   Coral bleaching is the expulsion of zooxanthellae (algal symbionts) from
   the respective coral host, mainly due to elevated sea surface
   temperatures and light intensities, but numerous other factors, such as
   changes concerning salinity (ocean acidification), may also cause coral
   bleaching, although to a much lesser extent.
   A specific clade of zooxanthellae can be linked to their coral host's
   susceptibility to variation in oceanic temperatures, most probably by
   regulating both the host's respective heat shock proteins as well as
   their own.
   South African reefs have not experienced coral bleaching to the same
   degree as elsewhere in the world, mainly due to their unique reef
   topography and oceanic currents.
   Genetic bioengineering of zooxanthellae cells provides a plausible
   solution to save southern African coral reefs before it is too late.},

Title = {Chemical and isotopic compositions of fluids at Cumbal Volcano,
   Colombia: evidence for magmatic contribution},

Abstract = {We present chemical and isotopic data for fumarolic vapor and thermal
   spring discharges from Cumbal Volcano, SW Colombia. In 1988 Cumbal
   showed signs of apparent reactivation. Gases and steam condensates were
   sampled from summit fumaroles (83-375 degreesC) of Cumbal in 1988-1996
   and discharges from thermal springs (15-37 degreesC) on its flanks in
   1995-1996. Based on relative CO2, total S (H2S+ SO2), and HCl contents,
   fumarolic discharges are principally magmatic in composition. Fumarolic
   steam condensates (1993-1996) have delta O-18 values of -11.4 to +2.5
   parts per thousand and deltaD values of -91 to -43 parts per thousand.
   delta O-18 and deltaD compositions indicate mixing between local
   meteoric and magmatic waters. He-3/He-4 ratios in 1993-1996 samples
   (5.3-7.9 R-cor) are consistent with addition of mantle-derived helium.
   delta C-13(CO2) values for 1996 samples (-6.7 to -5.0 parts per
   thousand) likely indicate contribution of marine-carbonate, organic
   sediment, and mantle-derived CO2. delta S-34(total) compositions (-4.6
   to +5.6 parts per thousand) of 1988-1996 fumarolic discharges have
   magmatic signatures and may reflect cycles of deposition and
   remobilization of native sulfur. Thermal waters are acid-sulfate or
   bicarbonate in composition. concentrations of chemical constituents
   Relative of thermal waters imply that the composition of waters is
   controlled by absorption of magmatic volatiles into shallow ground- and
   surface waters, dilution with meteoric waters along flow paths, and
   dissolution of host rocks. delta O-18 and deltaD compositions are
   consistent with a meteoric origin of waters. delta S-34(Stotal) values
   for thermal spring gas discharges (9.6-10.5 parts per thousand) suggest
   deposition of delta S-34-depleted sulfur minerals along flow paths.
   Chemical and isotopic compositions of 1988-1995 fumarolic discharges
   provide evidence for input of magmatic volatiles into the Cumbal
   hydrothermal system. From 1995 to 1996, geochemical data show increasing
   hydrothermal signatures, suggesting a decline in magmatic volatile
   input.},

Abstract = {We used a stochastic Lagrangian model to study how behaviour contributes
   to copepod grazing success. The model simulates distinct foraging
   behaviours of Clausocalonus furcatus, Paracalonus aculeatus, and Oithona
   plumifera. Three sets of simulations were performed to investigate the
   effects of (a) prey-size preference; (b) variation in prey-size spectra;
   and (c) turbulence intensity on these species' grazing rates. The size
   preference simulations demonstrate that, compared with copepodites,
   mature females have cell ingestion rates that are an order of magnitude
   lower, while carbon uptake is reduced by 35\%. A prey spectrum that is
   skewed towards cells <6 mu m promotes copepodite success because the
   basal metabolic needs of the adult females require a prey concentration
   of 850-1000 cells ml(-1). Variations in turbulence intensity reveal
   distinct ecological niches, with stronger mixing favouring O. plumifera
   and stable conditions favouring C.furcatus. Differences in theoretically
   derived and simulated prey-encounter rates demonstrate that the hopping
   behaviour of O. plumiferci provides an order of magnitude increase in
   prey encounter, whereas the feeding behaviour of C. furcatus can result
   in localized depletion of prey. These simulations highlight the
   importance of species-specific feeding behaviour in defining oceanic
   copepod distributions.},

Title = {Frequency regulation of hybrid shipboard microgrid system using
   butterfly optimization algorithm synthesis fractional-order controller},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL MODELLING-ELECTRONIC NETWORKS DEVICES
   AND FIELDS},
Abstract = {Inclusion of intermittent natured renewable energy resources in
   microgrid to reduce global warming, especially in shipboard power system
   and due to highly fluctuating propulsion load, frequency control
   strategy of isolated shipboard hybrid microgrid (ISHMG) is major point
   of attraction. Hence, a power system of marine vessel with dish-stirling
   solar thermal system (DSTS), wind-driven generation (WDG), solid oxide
   fuel cell (SOFC), super-conducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), two
   different AC-loads, and propulsion loads are considered as an ISHMG. The
   main objective of this paper is reducing the mismatch between generation
   and demand with the help of fractional-order proportional
   integral-derivative (FOPID) controller. To improve the frequency
   control, the tuning of the controller coefficients plays a major role as
   the controller's performance fully dependent on the parameters.
   Accordingly, the recently developed butterfly optimization algorithm
   (BOA) has been used to optimize the FOPID controller's parameters.
   Comparative analysis of several techniques like FA, PSO, GOA, SSA, and
   BOA used for PID, PI, FOPID controllers' optimization, and sensitivity
   analysis under different parametric variation has been presented to
   prove the stability of the ISHMG model. Analyzing all the results, it is
   found that BOA-based FOPID controller is performing the frequency
   control far better than other techniques.},

Title = {Patterns of Transcript Abundance of Eukaryotic Biogeochemically-Relevant
   Genes in the Amazon River Plume},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {The Amazon River has the largest discharge of all rivers on Earth, and
   its complex plume system fuels a wide array of biogeochemical processes,
   across a large area of the western tropical North Atlantic. The plume
   thus stimulates microbial processes affecting carbon sequestration and
   nutrient cycles at a global scale. Chromosomal gene expression patterns
   of the 2.0 to 156 mu m size-fraction eukaryotic microbial community were
   investigated in the Amazon River Plume, generating a robust dataset
   (more than 100 million mRNA sequences) that depicts the metabolic
   capabilities and interactions among the eukaryotic microbes. Combining
   classical oceanographic field measurements with metatranscriptomics
   yielded characterization of the hydrographic conditions simultaneous
   with a quantification of transcriptional activity and identity of the
   community. We highlight the patterns of eukaryotic gene expression for
   31 biogeochemically significant gene targets hypothesized to be valuable
   within forecasting models. An advantage to this targeted approach is
   that the database of reference sequences used to identify the target
   genes was selectively constructed and highly curated optimizing
   taxonomic coverage, throughput, and the accuracy of annotations. A
   coastal diatom bloom highly expressed nitrate transporters and carbonic
   anhydrase presumably to support high growth rates and enhance uptake of
   low levels of dissolved nitrate and CO2. Diatom-diazotroph association
   (DDA: diatoms with nitrogen fixing symbionts) blooms were common when
   surface salinity was mesohaline and dissolved nitrate concentrations
   were below detection, and hence did not show evidence of nitrate
   utilization, suggesting they relied on ammonium transporters to aquire
   recently fixed nitrogen. These DDA blooms in the outer plume had rapid
   turnover of the photosystem D1 protein presumably caused by
   photodegradation under increased light penetration in clearer waters,
   and increased expression of silicon transporters as silicon became
   limiting. Expression of these genes, including carbonic anhydrase and
   transporters for nitrate and phosphate, were found to reflect the
   physiological status and biogeochemistry of river plume environments.
   These relatively stable patterns of eukaryotic transcript abundance
   occurred over modest spatiotemporal scales, with similarity observed in
   sample duplicates collected up to 2.45 km in space and 120 minutes in
   time. These results confirm the use of metatranscriptomics as a valuable
   tool to understand and predict microbial community function.},

Title = {Influence of reduced carbon emissions and oxidation on the distribution
   of atmospheric CO2: Implications for inversion analyses},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {{[}1] Recent inverse analyses constraining carbon fluxes using
   atmospheric CO2 observations have assumed that the CO2 source from
   atmospheric oxidation of reduced carbon is released at the surface
   rather than distributed globally in the atmosphere. This produces a bias
   in the estimates of surface fluxes. We used a three-dimensional (3D)
   atmospheric chemistry model (GEOS-CHEM) to evaluate the magnitude of
   this effect on modeled concentrations and flux estimates. We find that
   resolving the 3D structure of the atmospheric CO2 source, as opposed to
   emitting this reduced carbon as CO2 at the surface, yields a decrease in
   the modeled annual mean interhemispheric gradient (N-S) of 0.21 ppm.
   Larger adjustments ( up to - 0.6 ppm) are apparent on a regional basis
   in and downwind of regions of high reduced carbon emissions. We used
   TransCom3 annual mean simulations from three transport models to
   evaluate the implications for inversion estimates. The main impacts are
   systematic decreases in estimates of northern continental land uptake
   (i.e., by 0.22 to 0.26 Pg C yr(-1)), and reductions in tropical land
   carbon efflux with smaller changes over oceans and in the Southern
   Hemisphere. These adjustments represent a systematic bias in flux
   estimates, accounting for changes of 9 to 27\% in the estimated northern
   land CO2 sink for the three models evaluated here. Our results highlight
   the need for a realistic description of reduced carbon emission and
   oxidation processes in deriving inversion estimates of CO2 surface
   fluxes.},

Abstract = {The essence of architectural design rests upon in kind of manipulation
   between dualism central core and external envelope of any architectural
   composition; there are some compositions that are concerned with the
   external envelope, while other compositions the outer shell is result of
   the interned division. Besides there are other compositions that blend
   the central core and the external envelope in a harmonious dialogue.
   This combination between central core and the external envelope touch
   this diversity in houses of Biskra city through different periods of
   time to create a comfortable thermal environment. The dry areas, which
   are distributed on a large scale over the space of Algeria,
   characterized by climate is hot and dry. We found Morphological
   diversity in houses of this region that reflects primarily adaptation to
   climatic conditions, social and economic through different periods.
   In our research, we depend on the experimental method through digital
   simulation technology program ECOTECT to calculate data, for various
   thermal models. in addition in the selection of network studied models
   we adopted to the variables morphology of both core and the external
   envelope of the dwelling which are: 1) the oceanic layer, 2) type of the
   core 3) type of the external envelope. Then we calculated the
   temperature of various houses layers to make comparisons between various
   layers and various models.
   The results of this study came to show the laws that control heat in the
   atmosphere and that is affected by alphabet elements of local
   architecture of Biskra region. These laws allow the architect to
   manipulate to these elements to search for improved thermal yield of the
   building and control of energy consumption in the range of what is
   available to him. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal changes of a mangrove-saltmarsh ecotone in the

Abstract = {General circulation models predict warming trends and changes in
   temperature and precipitation patterns that have the potential to alter
   the structure and function of coastal habitats. The purpose of this
   study was to quantify the expansion and contraction of mangroves and
   saltmarsh habitats and assess the impact of climate on these landscape
   changes. The study was conducted in a mangrove/saltmarsh ecotone in
   Flagler County, FL, near the northern range limit of mangroves along the
   Atlantic coast of North America. We used time series of historical
   aerial photography and high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery
   from 1942 to 2013 to quantify changes in the extent of mangrove and
   saltmarsh vegetation and compared these changes to climate variables of
   temperature and precipitation, temperature-seasonality, as well as
   historical sea-level data. Results showed increases in mangrove extent
   of 89\% between 1942 and 1952, and a continuous increase from 1995 to
   2013. Largest decrease in saltmarsh extent occurred between 1942 and
   1952 (-136\%) and between 2008 and 2013 (-81\%). We found significant
   effects of precipitation, temperature, seasonality, and time on mangrove
   and saltmarsh areal extent. The statistical effect of sea-level was
   rather small, but we speculate that it might have ecological impacts on
   these two coastal ecosystems. Results also showed a cyclical dynamism as
   well as a reversal in habitat dominance, which may be the result of
   complex interactions between plant habitats and several environmental
   drivers of change such as species interactions, and hydrological changes
   induced by sea-level rise, in addition to temperature and precipitation
   effects. Our results on mangrove/saltmarsh expansion and contraction may
   contribute to the improvement of management and conservation strategies
   for coastal ecosystems being impacted by climate change. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {The detrital components of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the Northern
   Carcareous Alps reflect the early Alpine geodynamic evolution of the
   Austroalpine microplate. Two contrasting source areas are distinguished
   on the base of light and heavy mineral analysis. The first source area
   is located at the southeastern margin of the Austroalpine and is
   composed of Palaeozoic sediments and metamorphic rocks, Mesozoic
   carbonate rocks, and ultrabasic rocks derived from the suture zone of
   the Vardar/Meliata Ocean. The second source area is located in the
   northwest in a Lower Austroalpine position near the transpressive plate
   margin that juxtaposes Austroalpine and Penninic units. This source area
   comprises Palaeozoic low-grade metamorphic rocks including high-pressure
   (HP) rocks, late Palaeozoic (meta)sediments, Mesozoic carbonate rocks,
   and ultrabasic rocks from obducted slices of Penninic oceanic crust.
   Chemical analyses of detrital white mica, amphibole and garnet support
   the discrimination between the two source areas. Tourmaline chemistry
   calls for a significant amount of metasedimentary rocks in the source
   area. Granitoid rocks and high-grade metamorphic rocks are rare. Blue
   amphibole, phengite, and chloritoid composition suggest the erosion of
   lower blueschist facies rocks in the northwestern source area. We
   suggest a modified model of Austroalpine Valanginian to Coniacian
   tectono-sedimentary evolution which is based on (1) an onset of
   subduction of the Penninic Ocean no earlier than Late Cretaceous, (2)
   deposition of the analyzed sedimentary rocks in piggyback basins, and
   (3) a reconstruction of provenance as proposed in this study. (C) 1999

Abstract = {Fisheries survey ECOAO 13, including the collection of surface sediment
   samples and acoustic propagation measurements, was carried out off the
   Senegalese coast in February 2013. The bottom acoustic properties were
   determined by geoacoustic inversion using the noise of R/V Antea as a
   noise sound source of opportunity. The vessel moved on a straight course
   with constant engine speed (1627 RPM) while the generated noise field
   was recorded by a vector sensor array deployed from a reinforced hull
   inflatable boat launched from the vessel. The multi-wavelength array,
   designed and built at EHL, is composed of four pressure sensors with
   different spacing combinations and two pressure gauges. The inversion
   approach estimates the bottom geoacoustic properties from observation of
   range-dependent features of vertical impedance at multiple frequencies
   and optimization based on a genetic algorithm. As compared to our
   previous two-element array, deployed offshore Amazon, the newly designed
   array provides more comprehensive observables and therefore more
   reliable geoacoustic inversion results. For this first trial, the
   vertical impedance data at the spectral lines of 140 Hz, 280 Hz and 321
   Hz were extracted from pairs of adjacent array elements and jointly
   processed. The bottom compression speed (1640 m/s) and density (1.96
   g/cm(3)) deduced from the posterior probability density functions
   suggest a sandy seabed. The acoustic inversion results are in general
   agreement with the grain size analysis of two sediment grab samples,
   which indicate that more than 80\% of the material is composed of
   well-distributed sand particles of different sizes, the remaining part
   being shell fragments and silt/clay mixtures.},

Abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (delta(13)C,
   delta(15)N, and delta(34)S) in bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli and white
   perch Morons americana from Delaware Bay were a function of capture
   location and, for restored tidal salt marshes, possibly a function of
   the relative position of the marsh restoration trajectory. White perch
   collected in polyhaline restoration and reference (Moore's Beach) sites
   had stable isotope signatures that reflected contributions from both
   benthic microalgae and Spartina alterniflora. Isotope values from white
   perch captured at the reference site were slightly enriched compared
   with those captured at the restoration sites. At upper estuary
   oligo-mesohaline locations, Phragmites australis contributed to the
   isotopic composition of both species. Although P. australis was not
   dominant at the reference marsh (Mad Horse Creek), it also seemed to
   influence the dow of nutrients into these species. White perch were not
   collected in open waters of Delaware Bay, but bay anchovy were abundant
   at offshore sampling stations. A striking result of this study was that
   stable isotopes that originated in macrophytes and benthic microalgae of
   salt marshes occurred ubiquitously among bay anchovy collected several
   kilometers from shore. Interestingly, fish from Mad Horse Creek, a
   reference marsh where Phragmites was abundant only along creek banks,
   were intermediate in their isotopic composition. Although benthic
   microalgal signatures varied both within and among sites, the isotopic
   composition of bay anchovy and white perch was clearly influenced by
   these primary producers across all marsh types. Particulate organic
   matter (POM) appeared to play a lesser role in bay anchovy and white
   perch nutrition, although depletion of POM sulfur due to the presence of
   inorganic sulfur may have led to underestimates of the contribution of
   phytoplankton. Further studies are required to elucidate the relative
   role of phytoplankton in the trophodynamics of these species.},

Title = {Seasonal and annual variations in the volumetric sediment balance of a
   macro-tidal salt marsh},

Abstract = {This paper examines the spatial and temporal variability in the
   volumetric sediment balance of Allen Creek marsh, a macro-tidal salt
   marsh in the Bay of Fundy. The volumetric balance was determined as the
   balance of inputs of sediments and organic matter via accretion on the
   marsh surface and Outputs of sedimentary material primarily due to
   erosion of the marsh margin. Changes in marsh surface elevation were
   measured at 20 buried plates and 3 modified sediment elevation tables
   from 1996 - 2002, and detailed margin surveys were conducted in 1997,
   1999 and 2001 using a differential global positioning system. Changes in
   surface area were calculated using GIS overlay analysis and used in
   Conjunction with accretion and erosion data to derive volumetric
   estimates of gains and losses of sedimentary material in the marsh
   system.
   Currently the volumetric sediment balance at Allen Creek marsh is
   positive. However the processes of erosion and accretion demonstrate
   seasonal, annual and spatial variability. Inputs to the system include
   deposition oil the marsh surface from sediment laden waters and from ice
   rafting of sediments. Sediment is deposited onto the marsh surface year
   round, even during the winter when vegetation cover is sparse, and the
   amount of deposition in general is not significantly correlated with the
   frequency of tidal inundations. Based oil the data from 1996 to 2002,
   the mid and high marsh zones experience mean accretion rates of
   approximately 1.4 cm year(-1) whereas accretion rates in the low marsh
   region are statistically significantly lower (0.8 cm year(-1)). The
   absolute amount of accretion varies between seasons and from year to
   year. The main loss to the marsh is through erosion of the marsh margin
   cliffs which can remove a comparatively large Volume of sedimentary
   material in one mass wasting event and which also decreases the
   vegetated surface area available for deposition from sediment laden
   waters. The volume of material removed from the marsh margin almost
   tripled between 1997 (169 m(3)) and 2001 (502 m(3)) following breaching
   of the side of a tidal creek channel, altering the patterns of margin
   erosion and deposition in the marsh system. During this time, however,
   other sheltered areas of the marsh system, such as along the tidal creek
   banks, showed evidence of new vegetation growth, increasing the amount
   of vegetated surface area available for deposition.
   The processes of erosion and deposition on the marsh surface exhibit
   considerable spatial variability, with different regions of the marsh
   being more or less sensitive to seasonal variability in the dominant
   controls influencing sediment deposition and erosion in this system,
   namely wave activity, vegetation, ice and water depths. A key factor in
   predicting how a marsh will evolve and respond to a number of different
   controls, e.g. sea-level rise or reduced sediment supply, is to quantify
   both accretion of the marsh surface and erosion of the marsh margin,
   evaluating the marsh system as a volumetric whole. This study
   demonstrates that a marsh system should be assessed in three dimensions
   rather than simply as a surface of accumulation. This is particularly
   important for open coastal marshes exposed to the erosive action of
   waves. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rigths reserved.},

Title = {Effects of noise and by-catch on a Danish harbour porpoise population},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {272},

Abstract = {Ships and wind turbines generate noise, which can have a negative impact
   on marine mammal populations by scaring animals away. Effective
   modelling of how this affects the populations has to take account of the
   location and timing of disturbances. Here we construct an
   individual-based model of harbour porpoises in the Inner Danish Waters.
   Individuals have their own energy budgets constructed using established
   principles of physiological ecology. Data are lacking on the spatial
   distribution of food which is instead inferred from knowledge of
   time-varying porpoise distributions. The model produces plausible
   patterns of population dynamics and matches well the age distribution of
   porpoises caught in by-catch. It estimates the effect of existing wind
   farms as a 10\% reduction in population size when food recovers fast
   (after two days). Proposed new wind farms and ships do not result in
   further population declines. The population is however sensitive to
   variations in mortality resulting from by-catch and to the speed at
   which food recovers after being depleted. If food recovers slowly the
   effect of wind turbines becomes negligible, whereas ships are estimated
   to have a significant negative impact on the population. Annual by-catch
   rates >10\% lead to monotonously decreasing populations and to
   extinction, and even the estimated by-catch rate from the adjacent area
   (approximately 4.1\%) has a strong impact on the population. This
   suggests that conservation efforts should be more focused on reducing
   by-catch in commercial gillnet fisheries than on limiting the amount of
   anthropogenic noise. Individual-based models are unique in their ability
   to take account of the location and timing of disturbances and to show
   their likely effects on populations. The models also identify
   deficiencies in the existing database and can be used to set priorities
   for future field research. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Interannual variability of the summer wind energy over China: A
   comparison of multiple datasets},

Abstract = {Because of the increase in the nation's need for wind energy, the
   impacts of climate change on wind energy have been investigated. In
   addition to long-term changes, wind energy also shows robust interannual
   variations, but little effort has been devoted to understanding the
   underlying mechanisms. In this study, the impact of El Nino on the
   summer mean wind power density (WPD) over China is investigated. The
   abilities of five sets of reanalysis data in measuring the interannual
   variability of the WPD over China are assessed. Encouraging results are
   seen for all reanalysis datasets, with the MERRA and ERA-Interim
   datasets showing the best performance. The relationship between El Nino
   and the following summer WPD is identified over China. During El Nino
   decaying year summers, the WPD over south of the Yangtze River valley
   increases, whereas the WPD over north of the Yangtze River valley
   decreases. The WPD changes are dominated by an anomalous anticyclone
   located in the northwestern Pacific. The anticyclone leads to strong
   southerly winds in southern China and thereby enhances the WPD. In
   regions north of the Yangtze River valley, the low surface pressure
   gradient causes a reduction in wind speed and thereby a weak WPD.
   Because the year-by-year variation in El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) is highly predictable, our results shed light on the seasonal
   prediction of wind power over China.},

Title = {Efficiency and Effectivity of a Biological-Epidemiological Fungal
   Disease Management System in Wheat-A Study of 26 Years},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Foliar diseases are a major threat to worldwide wheat production,
   especially during the vegetative period in maritime climates. Despite
   advancements in agronomic practices, infestations by foliar diseases are
   possible under favourable weather conditions, thus, fungicides are
   essential for maintaining control. Stage-oriented applications are
   therefore common in farm practices. The optimization of fungicide use
   according to biological-epidemiological thresholds reduces the total
   amount of fungicides used, which is of political interest, especially in
   the European Union. Therefore, the efficiency and effectivity of the
   fungicides used to control the six major foliar diseases (Septoria
   tritici blotch, glume blotch, tans spot, powdery mildew, stripe rust,
   and leaf rust) were analysed in a long-term study of 26 years in
   northern Germany under favourable maritime conditions. Of those
   diseases, Septoria tritici blotch was the most dominant recurring
   disease, with high severity noted in every year of the study. The
   threshold-based disease management system was compared to a fungicide
   untreated control and a healthy-standard fungicide treatment (according
   to growth stages). The usage of the threshold-based system reduced the
   disease severities significantly compared to the fungicide untreated
   control, without any loss of yield compared to the healthy-standard
   fungicide treatment. Thereby, the use of fungicides was reduced by two
   thirds compared to the stage-oriented healthy-standard treatment. Thus,
   the advantages of the threshold-based system were obvious, and this
   approach will be an important tool for future evaluations of current
   farm practices.},

Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {519},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Biofouling is a challenge in global sea-based salmon farming. Norway's
   salmon-growing industry relies primarily on copper-based antifouling
   coatings. However, copper is an increasingly recognised environmental
   hazard, and there is a need to develop alternative antifouling products
   to prevent biofouling in marine aquaculture. Using field experiments,
   this study compared the efficacy of six novel antifouling coatings for
   fish farm nets (two with reduced copper content, three with alternative
   biocides and one biocide-free coating) against a popular commercial
   copper coating and uncoated samples. The performance of one of the new
   coatings with lower copper content was more similar to the commercial
   copper control while the rest were colonised by biofouling faster and/or
   at higher abundances. However, none of the tested products were able to
   prevent biofouling entirely, underlining the importance of the search
   for alternative and improved antifouling technologies.},

Title = {Conserving the Stage: Climate Change and the Geophysical Underpinnings
   of Species Diversity},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {Conservationists have proposed methods for adapting to climate change
   that assume species distributions are primarily explained by climate
   variables. The key idea is to use the understanding of species-climate
   relationships to map corridors and to identify regions of faunal
   stability or high species turnover. An alternative approach is to adopt
   an evolutionary timescale and ask ultimately what factors control total
   diversity, so that over the long run the major drivers of total species
   richness can be protected. Within a single climatic region, the
   temperate area encompassing all of the Northeastern U. S. and Maritime
   Canada, we hypothesized that geologic factors may take precedence over
   climate in explaining diversity patterns. If geophysical diversity does
   drive regional diversity, then conserving geophysical settings may offer
   an approach to conservation that protects diversity under both current
   and future climates. Here we tested how well geology predicts the
   species diversity of 14 US states and three Canadian provinces, using a
   comprehensive new spatial dataset. Results of linear regressions of
   species diversity on all possible combinations of 23 geophysical and
   climatic variables indicated that four geophysical factors; the number
   of geological classes, latitude, elevation range and the amount of
   calcareous bedrock, predicted species diversity with certainty (adj. R-2
   = 0.94). To confirm the species-geology relationships we ran an
   independent test using 18,700 location points for 885 rare species and
   found that 40\% of the species were restricted to a single geology.
   Moreover, each geology class supported 5-95 endemic species and
   chi-square tests confirmed that calcareous bedrock and extreme
   elevations had significantly more rare species than expected by chance
   (P<0.0001), strongly corroborating the regression model. Our results
   suggest that protecting geophysical settings will conserve the stage for
   current and future biodiversity and may be a robust alternative to
   species-level predictions.},

   Bay of Bengal},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {Flow of barotropic tidal currents over topographic features, such as
   continental slopes and submarine ridges, generates internal gravity
   waves at tidal periods known as internal tides. Amplitude of these waves
   are generally large near the generation regions. Analysis of Sea Surface
   Height (SSH) data, derived from satellite altimeter revealed the
   amplification of internal tides in the semidiurnal period in the
   north-central Bay of Bengal (BoB) (around 89 degrees E, 16 degrees N),
   which is about 450 km away from their generation sites. SSH signals
   found in the north-central BoB (similar to 3 cm) were comparable to the
   maximum amplitudes (2.5 to 3.5 cm) observed near their potential
   generation sites in the BoB such as continental slopes in the head of
   the bay and Andaman-Nicobar (AN) Ridge. Simulations from a
   high-resolution regional ocean model also confirmed the presence of
   large internal tide amplitude in the north-central BoB. Our study
   revealed that convergence of internal tides, which were generated along
   the concave-shaped source (continental slopes in the head of the bay and
   the northern parts of AN Ridge), into its focal region caused their
   amplification in the north-central BoB. It was also found that internal
   tide energy dissipation rates in this focal region were about 10 times
   larger than those in other open ocean regions.},

Abstract = {Foraminifera host diverse microbial communities that can shift in
   response to changing environmental conditions. To characterize climate
   change impacts on the foraminifera microbiome across life stages, we
   exposed adult Marginopora vertebralis (Large Benthic Foraminifera) to
   pCO(2) and temperature scenarios representing present-day, 2050 and 2100
   levels and raised juveniles under present-day and 2050 conditions. While
   treatment condition had no significant effect on the seawater microbial
   communities, exposure to future scenarios significantly altered both
   adult and juvenile microbiomes. In adults, divergence between
   present-day and 2050 or 2100 conditions was primarily driven by a
   reduced relative abundance of Oxyphotobacteria under elevated
   temperature and pCO(2). In juveniles, the microbial shift predominantly
   resulted from changes in the proportion of Proteobacteria. Indicator
   species analysis identified numerous treatment-specific indicator taxa,
   most of which were indicative of present-day conditions.
   Oxyphotobacteria, previously reported as putative symbionts of
   foraminifera, were indicative of present-day and 2050 conditions in
   adults, but of present-day conditions only in juveniles. Overall, we
   show that the sensitivity of the M. vertebralis microbiome to climate
   change scenarios extends to both life stages and primarily correlates
   with declines in Oxyphotobacteria and shifts in Proteobacteria under
   elevated temperature and pCO(2).},

Title = {Wave friction factors from energy flux comparisons outside of the surf

Abstract = {Pressure, sonar profiling, and current measurements were recorded at
   5.5-, 8-, and 13-m water depths in the outer surf zone and inner
   continental shelf region off the coast of Duck, North Carolina. This
   unique data set was analyzed to investigate wave evolution by comparing
   estimates from linear wave theory with field measurements. Energy flux
   calculations combining shoaling and refraction theory showed smaller
   measured than predicted energy flux values at the two inshore locations
   (sometimes by more than one third), emphasizing the importance of
   considering energy loss in engineering design and planning calculations.
   A wave friction factor for each record was determined by accounting for
   frictional energy loss in the energy flux calculation, using velocity
   time series measured 0.20, 0.55, and 1.50 m above the sea floor.
   Calculated friction factors varied throughout storm events, but most
   fell within a range of 0 to 0.1. Wave friction factors calculated using
   the total measured velocity time series showed a narrower range (0 to
   0.05) than those calculated from demeaned velocities (0 to 0.1).
   Representative wave friction factors of 0.053 (demeaned velocity) and
   0.0209 (total velocity) were identified for this location using a least
   squares fit between energy flux decay and vertical bar u(b)vertical
   bar(3)Delta x over all storm events.},

Title = {Southern high latitude dune fields on Mars: Morphology, aeolian
   inactivity, and climate change},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {121},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {98-121},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {In a study area spanning the martian surface poleward of 50 degrees S.,
   1190 dune fields have been identified, mapped, and categorized based on
   dune field morphology. Dune fields in the study area span similar to 116
   400 km(2), leading to a global dune field coverage estimate of similar
   to 904 000 km(2), far less than that found on Earth. Based on distinct
   morphological features, the dune fields were grouped into six different
   classes that vary in interpreted aeolian activity level from potentially
   active to relatively inactive and eroding. The six dune field classes
   occur in specific latitude zones, with a sequence of reduced activity
   and degradation progressing poleward. In particular, the first signs of
   stabilization appear at similar to 60 degrees S., which broadly
   corresponds to the edge of high concentrations of water-equivalent
   hydrogen content (observed by the Neutron Spectrometer) that have been
   interpreted as ground ice. This near-surface ground ice likely acts to
   reduce sand availability in the present climate state on Mars,
   stabilizing high latitude dunes and allowing erosional processes to
   change their morphology. As a result, climatic changes in the content of
   near-surface ground ice are likely to influence the level of dune
   activity. Spatial variation of dune field classes with longitude is
   significant, suggesting that local conditions play a major role in
   determining dune field activity level. Dune fields on the south polar
   layered terrain, for example, appear either potentially active or
   inactive, indicating that at least two generations of dune building have
   occurred on this surface. Many dune fields show signs of degradation
   mixed with crisp-brinked dunes, also suggesting that more than one
   generation of dune building has occurred since they originally formed.
   Dune fields superposed on early and late Amazonian surfaces provide
   potential upper age limits of similar to 100 My on the south polar
   layered deposits and similar to 3 Ga elsewhere at high latitudes. No
   craters are present on any identifiable dune fields, which can provide a
   lower age limit through crater counting: assuming all relatively
   stabilized dune fields represent a single noncontiguous surface of
   uniform age, their estimated crater retention age is <similar to 10000
   years. An average-sized uncratered dune field (94 km(2)) has a crater
   retention age <similar to 8 My. This apparent youth suggests that
   present-day climate conditions are responsible for the observed
   degradation and reduced level of aeolian activity. A lack of observed
   transport pathways and the absence of large dune fields in the largest
   basins (Hellas and Argyre Planitiae) are consistent with the previously
   proposed idea that dune sands are not typically transported far from
   their source regions on Mars.(C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Coral reefs in the Gilbert Islands of Kiribati: Resistance, resilience,
   and recovery after more than a decade of multiple stressors},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are increasingly affected by a combination of acute and
   chronic disturbances from climate change and local stressors. The coral
   reefs of the Republic of Kiribati's Gilbert Islands are exposed to
   frequent heat stress caused by central-Pacific type El Nino events, and
   may provide a glimpse into the future of coral reefs in other parts of
   the world, where the frequency of heat stress events will likely
   increase due to climate change. Reefs in the Gilbert Islands experienced
   a series of acute disturbances over the past fifteen years, including
   mass coral bleaching in 2004-2005 and 2009-2010, and an outbreak of the
   corallivorous sea star Acanthaster cf solaris, or Crown-of-Thorns
   (CoTs), in 2014. The local chronic pressures including nutrient loading,
   sedimentation and fishing vary within the island chain, with highest
   pressures on the reefs in urbanized South Tarawa Atoll. In this study,
   we examine how recovery from acute disturbances differs across a
   gradient of human influence in neighboring Tarawa and Abaiang Atolls
   from 2012 through 2018. Benthic cover and size frequency data suggests
   that local coral communities have adjusted to the heat stress via shifts
   in the community composition to more temperature-tolerant taxa and
   individuals. In densely populated South Tarawa, we document a phase
   shift to the weedy and less bleaching-sensitive coral Porites rus, which
   accounted for 81\% of all coral cover by 2018. By contrast, in less
   populated Abaiang, coral communities remained comparatively more diverse
   (with higher percentages of Pocillopora and the octocoral Heliopora)
   after the disturbances, but reefs had lower overall hard coral cover
   (18\%) and were dominated by turf algae (41\%). The CoTs outbreak caused
   a decline in the cover and mean size of massive Porites, the only taxa
   that was a `winner' of the coral bleaching events in Abaiang. Although
   there are signs of recovery, the long-term trajectory of the benthic
   communities in Abaiang is not yet clear. We suggest three scenarios:
   they may remain in their current state (dominated by turf algae),
   undergo a phase shift to dominance by the macroalgae Halimeda, or
   recover to dominance by thermally tolerant hard coral genera. These
   findings provide a rare glimpse at the future of coral reefs around the
   world and the ways they may be affected by climate change, which may
   allow scientists to better predict how other reefs will respond to
   increasing heat stress events across gradients of local human
   disturbance.},

Title = {Three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics of a H-shaped vertical axis wind
   turbine over the full operating range},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Vertical-axis wind turbines have great potential for harvesting energy
   with high conversion efficiency both in small-scale distributed
   installations and in the emerging floating offshore technology;
   nevertheless, their complex unsteady flow field makes design and
   optimization very challenging. This paper documents an extensive CFD
   study on a H-shaped VAWT over the entire range of operation. First, a
   direct 2D-3D comparison of the prediction capability of CFD models over
   the entire turbine operational curve is presented, highlighting the
   range of operation in which 3D effects become crucial and, instead, the
   range of TSR for which a 2D approximation is acceptable. The simulations
   are systematically compared to a wide and accurate experimental data set
   of wind-tunnel experiments in controlled conditions. The combination of
   CFD results with measured data allowed to assess the turbine performance
   and time-resolved velocity measurements in the wake. Furthermore, the
   paper proposes a totally novel approach in analysing the computed
   non-periodic unsteadiness in the wake. Finally, a tracking of the
   unsteady tip vortex is also proposed, with remarkable similarity to
   experimental results documented in the literature. This fact suggests
   that URANS discretization permits to approximate the dynamic and
   evolution of the tip vortex, at least in the near wake region.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Morphological and histological adaptation of chestnut leaves at the
   different altitudes and edaphoclimate conditions were shown. The study
   was carried out on Castanea sativa Mill. var. `Judia'. The growth range
   altitudes of `Judia' were between 709 m a.s.l. and 860 m a.s.l. (above
   sea level), corresponding to a variation in the sum of temperatures
   (expressed in degree-day values - degrees D) of 2751 degrees D to 2316
   degrees D in 2006 and 2338 degrees D to 1700 degrees D in 2007, between
   May and October. In 2007 the thickest leaves (319.9 mu m), the highest
   stomata density (469.1 stomata mm(-2)), one of the largest leaf areas
   (69.2 cm(2)) and the highest fruit size (71.7 fruit kg(-1)) were
   observed in Alfandega da Fe (759 m a.s.l., 2186 degrees D, during the
   May-October period) whereas in 2006 the highest fruit size (86.8 fruit
   kg(-1)) was observed in Valpacos (860 m a.s.l., 2316 degrees D, during
   the same period).
   Additionally, the leaves of the trees grown in this locality (Valpacos)
   displayed one of the largest areas (57.0 cm(2)). Overall results suggest
   that annual climate conditions do significantly influence both fruit and
   leaf biometric characteristics, and that the range of temperatures from
   2100 degrees D to 2300 degrees D (between May and October) correspond to
   the optimal temperature sum, which can be ascribed to different places,
   depending on the year in question. Concerning the molecular
   characterisation using nuclear microsatellites, the individuals more
   distant are those from Macedo de Cavaleiros and Alfandega da Fe (genetic
   distance = 0.227), while the ecotypes with closer similarities were
   those collected in Murca and Vinhais (genetic identity = 1.171). The
   current results suggest that the morphological and phenological
   differences among ecotypes are not related to the small genetic
   differences, but are simply phenotypic adaptations to diffent climatic
   conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aerated fluids have a potential to increase rate of penetration,
   minimize formation damage, minimize lost circulation, reduce drill pipe
   sticking, and, therefore, assist in improving the productivity. The
   technology of drilling using aerated fluids in the area of offshore
   drilling is very common. The use of compressible drilling fluids in
   offshore technology has found applications in old depleted reservoirs
   and in the new fields with special drilling problems. However, the
   drilling performed with gas-liquid mixture, calculating the pressure
   losses and the performance of cutting transportation is more difficult
   than single-phase fluid due to the characteristics of multi-phase fluid
   flow. In case configured drilling is directional or horizontal, these
   types of calculations are becoming more difficult depending on the slope
   of the wells. Both hydraulic behavior and mechanism of cutting
   transportation of the drilling fluids formed by gas-liquid mixture are
   not fully understood yet, especially there is a large uncertainty in
   selection of most appropriate flow regarding two phases. In this study,
   gas-liquid flow inside horizontal eccentric annulus is simulated using
   an Eulerian-Eulerian computational fluid dynamics model for two-phase
   flow patterns in an annulus, i.e., dispersed bubble, dispersed annular,
   plug, slug, wavy annular. A flow loop was constructed in order to
   conduct experiments using air-water mixtures for various in-situ air and
   water flow velocities. A digital high speed camera is used for recording
   each test dynamically for identification of the liquid holdup and flow
   patterns.},

Title = {Amino Acid Analog Induces Stress Response in Marine Synechococcus},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Characterizing the cell-level metabolic trade-offs that phytoplankton
   exhibit in response to changing environmental conditions is important
   for predicting the impact of these changes on marine food web dynamics
   and biogeochemical cycling. The timeselective proteome-labeling
   approach, bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), has
   potential to provide insight into differential allocation of resources
   at the cellular level, especially when coupled with proteomics. However,
   the application of this technique in marine phytoplankton remains
   limited. We demonstrate that the marine cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp.
   and two groups of eukaryotic algae take up the modified amino acid
   L-homopropargylglycine (HPG), suggesting that BONCAT can be used to
   detect translationally active phytoplankton. However, the impact of HPG
   addition on growth dynamics varied between groups of phytoplankton. In
   addition, proteomic analysis of Synechococcus cells grown with HPG
   revealed a physiological shift in nitrogen metabolism, general protein
   stress, and energy production, indicating a potential limitation for the
   use of BONCAT in understanding the cell-level response of Synechococcus
   sp. to environmental change. Variability in HPG sensitivity between
   algal groups and the impact of HPG on Synechococcus physiology indicates
   that particular considerations should be taken when applying this
   technique to other marine taxa or mixed marine microbial communities.
   IMPORTANCE Phytoplankton form the base of the marine food web and
   substantially impact global energy and nutrient flow. Marine
   picocyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus comprise a large portion of
   phytoplankton biomass in the ocean and therefore are important model
   organisms. The technical challenges of environmental proteomics in mixed
   microbial communities have limited our ability to detect the cell-level
   adaptations of phytoplankton communities to a changing environment. The
   proteome labeling technique, bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid
   tagging (BONCAT), has potential to address some of these challenges by
   simplifying proteomic analyses. This study explores the ability of
   marine phytoplankton to take up the modified amino acid,
   L-homopropargylglycine (HPG), required for BONCAT, and investigates the
   proteomic response of Synechococcus to HPG. We not only demonstrate that
   cyanobacteria can take up HPG but also highlight the physiological
   impact of HPG on Synechococcus, which has implications for future
   applications of this technique in the marine environment.},

Title = {Marine Natural Products: A Promising Source of Environmentally Friendly
   Antifouling Agents for the Maritime Industries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {Biofouling in the marine environment refers to an unwanted build-up of
   marine organisms on subsea surfaces including harbor docks, hulls of
   ships and offshore installations. The first stage of marine fouling
   occurs as a microbial biofilm which forms via the aggregation of
   bacterial, algal, and fungal cells. This biofilm provides a favorable
   substrate for the larval settlement of larger organisms such as mussels,
   barnacles and hard corals which accumulate to uncontrollable extents,
   causing issues for the maritime industries. Since the ban of tributyltin
   (TBT) in 2008 by the International Maritime Organisation, alternative
   antifouling agents have been used such as algaecides and copper-based
   coatings. Recent studies are showing that these can accumulate in the
   marine environment and have toxic effects against non-target species.
   Marine microbes and invertebrates are known to be prolific producers of
   bioactive molecules, including antifouling active compounds. These
   compounds are often produced by marine organisms as a means of chemical
   defense to deter predators and prevent fouling of their own surfaces,
   making them a promising source of new antifouling agents. This article
   discusses the effects of biofouling on the maritime industries, the
   environmental dangers of currently used antifouling compounds and why
   natural products from marine organisms could be a source of
   environmentally friendly antifouling agents.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {The eastern Ross Sea is a key area to understand the role of the
   Amundsen Sea inflow of freshwater that can influence the Ross Sea water
   properties and salt budget. A survey was carried out in the eastern Ross
   Sea during the austral summer 2019-20 to evaluate the contribution of
   the Amundsen Sea Water (ASW) to the salinity variability. A total of 248
   seawater samples were collected f\textbackslash{}or the analysis of
   total alkalinity (A(T)) and pH. The data collected were used together
   with temperature and salinity to obtain a full description of the
   carbonate system properties including total inorganic carbon (C-T), CO2
   partial pressure (pCO(2)), calcium carbonate saturation state of
   aragonite and calcite (ohm), and Revelle factor. Moreover, we estimated
   the anthropogenic carbon (C-ant) throughout the TrOCA method to better
   understand the carbon cycle, also considering the effect of atmospheric
   CO2 uptake on ocean acidification. We used principal component analysis
   (PCA) to investigate the major controls on the carbonate system
   parameters with the aim of defining their sensitivity as chemical
   tracers. The changes in carbonate chemistry in surface waters were
   mainly due to the physical properties. A(T) and pH traced the entry of
   the ASW showing limited mixing between water masses on the shelf area.
   Shelf waters were enriched in C-ant, which resulted lower than the
   estimated value for shelf waters produced in western Ross Sea.},

Abstract = {The triple oxygen isotope signature Delta O-17 in atmospheric CO2, also
   known as its ``O-17 excess,{''} has been proposed as a tracer for gross
   primary production (the gross uptake of CO2 by vegetation through
   photosynthesis). We present the first global 3-D model simulations for
   Delta O-17 in atmospheric CO2 together with a detailed model description
   and sensitivity analyses. In our 3-D model framework we include the
   stratospheric source of Delta O-17 in CO2 and the surface sinks from
   vegetation, soils, ocean, biomass burning, and fossil fuel combustion.
   The effect of oxidation of atmospheric CO on Delta O-17 in CO2 is also
   included in our model. We estimate that the global mean Delta O-17
   (defined as Delta O-17=ln(delta O-17+1)-lambda RL center dot ln(delta
   O-18+1) with lambda(RL) = 0.5229) of CO2 in the lowest 500m of the
   atmosphere is 39.6per meg, which is similar to 20per meg lower than
   estimates from existing box models. We compare our model results with a
   measured stratospheric Delta O-17 in CO2 profile from Sodankyla
   (Finland), which shows good agreement. In addition, we compare our model
   results with tropospheric measurements of Delta O-17 in CO2 from
   Gottingen (Germany) and Taipei (Taiwan), which shows some agreement but
   we also find substantial discrepancies that are subsequently discussed.
   Finally, we show model results for Zotino (Russia), Mauna Loa (United
   States), Manaus (Brazil), and South Pole, which we propose as possible
   locations for future measurements of Delta O-17 in tropospheric CO2 that
   can help to further increase our understanding of the global budget of
   Delta O-17 in atmospheric CO2.},

Abstract = {In a drillcore sample of serpentinized harzburgite from the uppermost
   oceanic crust (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, ODP Leg 209, Site 1270), we
   demonstrate using high-resolution 3D-microtomography that micron-sized
   open cavities are present. The development of porosity is interpreted to
   result from dissolution of brucite and/or olivine. Petrographic
   observations indicate that voids are integrated in a network of
   carbonate veins, the formation of which is linked to changing alkalinity
   in conjunction with dissolution reactions. Partial carbonate filling of
   pore spaces indicates that under static conditions low-temperature
   carbonation leads to clogging of fluid pathways and thus to a reduction
   in permeability. Electron microprobe analyses show that the inner walls
   of open voids are lined with Fe-rich precipitates. We propose that the
   iron in those phases was released by brucite or olivine dissolution and
   was subsequently oxidized and precipitated as ferric hydroxide.
   Thermodynamic computations show that this process may be a potential
   source of catabolic energy for microorganisms inhabiting serpentinites.
   The proposed carbonation mechanism implies that carbonate precipitation
   may start soon after exposure of the abyssal peridotites, when
   dissolution of brucite and weathering of olivine begin, and continue
   until the phases become inaccessible to seawater. Predicting carbonation
   rates of abyssal peridotites will hence require understanding of
   permeability reactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Coulomb energy losses in the solar corona and the proton energy budget

Abstract = {It has recently been proposed, on the basis of measurements of the flux
   in the Ne-20 1.634 MeV line, that the energy budget for nonthermal
   protons in solar hares may be significantly larger than previously
   assumed. The argument is founded on the fact that the 1.634 MeV feature
   has a (proton) excitation threshold energy significantly lower than that
   of the C and O lines in the 4-6 MeV range. Hence the observed enhanced
   level of emission in the 1.634 MeV line requires a higher flux of
   low-energy (similar to 1 MeV) protons than would be obtained from a
   backward extrapolation of the similar to 10 MeV spectrum using canonical
   (i.e., modified Bessel function) spectral forms and so a greater overall
   energy content. In this paper we check the effects on this conclusion of
   two significant factors omitted from the previous analysis, which was
   based on a `'cold'' chromospheric target model. While such a model may
   be appropriate for protons of similar to 10 MeV energies, protons of
   similar to 1 MeV may undergo a significant part of their energy loss in
   the hot corona, which is ionized and also `'warm'' for beam protons of
   these energies. The ionization results in a Coulomb logarithm (and
   energy loss rate) almost 3 times higher than in the neutral
   chromosphere. On the other hand, the warm target effect results in
   energy losses a factor of 1-10 times lower than in a cold target. Thus,
   if beam protons underwent a substantial part of their energy loss in the
   corona (depending on the column density encountered), previous
   conclusions from the Ne-20 line flux could be either enhanced or
   negated, depending on which effect dominates. We show that for likely
   flare coronal temperatures and column densities that the net
   consequences for the Ne-20 flux are in fact small, unless the low-energy
   protons are preferentially trapped in an improbably hot dense magnetic
   island.},

Title = {Juvenile rockfish show resilience to CO2-acidification and hypoxia
   across multiple biological scales},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {California's coastal ecosystems are forecasted to undergo shifting ocean
   conditions due to climate change, some of which may negatively impact
   recreational and commercial fish populations. To understand if fish
   populations have the capacity to respond to multiple stressors, it is
   critical to examine interactive effects across multiple biological
   scales, from cellular metabolism to species interactions. This study
   examined the effects of CO2-acidification and hypoxia on two naturally
   cooccurring species, juvenile rockfish (genus Sebastes) and a known
   predator, cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus). Fishes were exposed to
   two PCO2 levels at two dissolved oxygen (DO) levels: similar to 600
   (ambient) and similar to 1600 (high) mu atm PCO2 and 8.0 (normoxic) and
   4.5 mgl(-1) DO (hypoxic) and assessments of cellular metabolism, prey
   behavior and predation mortality rates were quantified after 1 and 3
   weeks. Physiologically, rockfish showed acute alterations in cellular
   metabolic enzyme activity after 1 week of acclimation to elevated PCO2
   and hypoxia that were not evident in cabezon. Alterations in rockfish
   energy metabolism were driven by increases in anaerobic LDH activity,
   and adjustments in enzyme activity ratios of cytochrome c oxidase and
   citrate synthase and LDH:CS. Correlated changes in rockfish behavior
   were also apparent after 1 week of acclimation to elevated PCO2 and
   hypoxia. Exploration behavior increased in rockfish exposed to elevated
   PCO2 and spatial analysis of activity indicated short-term interference
   with anti-predator responses. Predation rate after 1 week increased with
   elevated PCO2 ; however, no mortality was observed under the
   multiple-stressor treatment suggesting negative effects on cabezon
   predators. Most noteworthy, metabolic and behavioral changes were
   moderately compensated after 3 weeks of acclimation, and predation
   mortality rates also decreased suggesting that these rockfish may be
   resilient to changes in environmental stressors predicted by climate
   models. Linking physiological and behavioral responses to multiple
   stressors is vital to understand impacts on populations and community
   dynamics.},

Title = {Environmental Factors Affecting Recent Summertime Eelgrass Diebacks in
   the Lower Chesapeake Bay: Implications for Long-term Persistence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Number = {55},
Pages = {135-147},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {We investigated the effects of several environmental factors on eelgrass
   abundance before, during, and after wide,I-Oft oft spread eelgrass
   diebacks during the unusually hot summer of 2005 in the Chesapeake Bay
   National Estuarine Research Reserve in Virginia. Systematic sampling
   with fixed transects was used to investigate changes in eelgrass
   abundance at downriver and upriver regions of the York River Estuary.
   Concurrently, continuous and discreet measurements of water quality were
   made at fixed stations in each area within the eelgrass beds from 2004
   through 2006. Results indicate nearly complete eelgrass vegetative
   dieback during the July-August period of 2005, in contrast to the more
   seasonal and typical declines in the summer of 2004. Losses were
   greatest in the deeper areas of the beds and at the upriver site where
   light availabilities were lowest. Recovery of eelgrass during 2006 was
   greater in the downriver area, especially at mid-bed depths. By the fall
   of 2006, no shoot vegetation remained at the upriver site. In 2005, the
   frequency and duration of water temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C were
   significantly greater than that of 2004 and 2006. Additionally, the
   frequencies of low dissolved oxygen excursions of 1-3 mg L-1 during this
   period were greater in 2005 than 2004 or 2006. These results suggest
   that eelgrass populations in this estuary are growing near their
   physiological tolerances. Therefore, the combined effects of short-term
   exposures to very high summer temperatures, compounded by reduced oxygen
   and light conditions, may lead to long-term declines of this species
   from this system.},

Abstract = {The coniferous forests of Siberia contain a significant fraction of the
   world's terrestrial C. We have assessed organic matter storage and
   potential metabolic activities in one of these forest stands by
   determining C and N pools, microbial properties and C and N
   mineralization at different temperatures in litter and a sandy mineral
   soil (a Pergelic Cryochrept) from a 215-y old forest of Pinus sylvestris
   L. Relationships between CO2-C production in the laboratory and field
   were also assessed. The site was near Zotino in central Siberia at 61
   degrees N, 89 degrees E and has an average air temperature of ca. -4
   degrees C and an annual precipitation of ca. 620 mm; it is subject to
   water deficits during summer and to recurrent fires. Results were
   evaluated by comparisons with data from other coniferous forests,
   including those with sandy or sandy loam soils at three temperate sites
   under Pinus radiata D. Don in New Zealand. The very acid (pH 4.1) litter
   (ca. 3 cm depth) from the Zotino site contained (to 50 cm depth of
   mineral soil) ca. 41\% of the total C (2.8 kg m(-2)), 34\% of the total
   N (86 g m(-2)) and about 50\% of the microbial biomass and respiratory
   and net N-mineralizing activity. The low values in the mineral soil
   were, except for total N which was lowest at this Zotino site, generally
   similar to those in two young coastal sands under P. radiata in New
   Zealand. Rates of C and net N mineralization in the Zotino mineral soil
   declined proportionately more between 13.5 and 5.5 degrees C than
   between 25 and 13.5 degrees C. Use of temperature relationships
   suggested that less than half of the CO2-C produced from the soil
   profile in the field under well-watered conditions during summer would
   have originated from microbial respiration. In litter and in mineral
   soil, ratios of microbial C and N-to-total C and N, microbial
   C-to-microbial N, rates of CO2-C and net mineral-N production on a total
   C and N basis, and metabolic quotients (qCO(2) values) were all similar
   to at least some of the values found for the temperate pine-forest
   soils. Our results strongly suggest that soil organic matter content is
   low at this Zotino site, not because of distinctive metabolic potentials
   of the microbial populations, but because of environmental constraints
   on ecosystem processes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In field experiments to study the response of intertidal flats to the
   burial of organic carbon, we loaded southern North Sea sandy sediments
   with varying amounts of starch. The loaded areas temporarily turned
   black due to sulphate-reducing degradation of the organic burden. The
   appearance and disappearance of black sediment surfaces were monitored
   over a period of 12 months by means of pore-water and particulate-matter
   analysis; organic-matter degradation was traced by delta(13)C (TOC).
   Biogeochemical data showed the duration and severity of `black-spot
   disease' to depend on the amount of organic carbon buried. Results met
   expectations in a qualitative manner; several causes of the absence of
   linear correlations between the initial organic-carbon load and DOC or
   sulphate concentrations are discussed. The critical experimental load
   that caused black spots ranged between 0.4 and 0.8 kg m(-2) C-org for a
   single organic-carbon entry. Given a situation of annually repeated
   entries, we estimate the critical load to be less than 0.4 kg m(-2)
   a(-1) C-org. Depth profiles indicate OM-caused enrichment in sulphur and
   pyritisation below 20 cm depth. This study emphasises the conditions of
   recovery. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The leaching of oxolinic acid (OA) and oxytetracycline (OTC) from
   medicated feeds, as well as the palatability and digestibility of these
   drugs were investigated in seabass Dicentrarchus labrax L. (350 g) at 16
   degrees C and 24 degrees C water temperature. Oil-coated OA and OTC on
   feeds were greatly affected by leaching at 16 degrees C (losses of
   55.5\% and 42.5\% for OA and OTC respectively) and 24 degrees C (32\%
   for OA and 47\% for OTC), However, a significant reduction in drug loss
   resulting from leaching was evident when the antibiotics were mixed with
   the diet at 16 degrees C (5\% for OA and 6.5\% for OTC) and 24 degrees C
   (10\% and 20\% for OA and OTC respectively). Increased water temperature
   induced a significant effect on the leaching of both drugs when mixed
   with the feed, but did not affect the loss of oil-coated drugs. There
   was a significant reduction in feed consumption of fish fed a diet with
   oil-coated OTC (90\% and 92\% at 16 degrees C and 24 degrees C
   respectively), whereas intake of feed containing oil-coated OA was only
   slightly affected (10\% at 16 degrees C, 12\% at 24 degrees C). The
   depressed palatability of feeds containing oil-coated OTC was overcome
   by mixing the drug with the diet. Both antibiotics were well digested by
   seabass (94\% and 85\% for OA and OTC respectively) at 24 degrees C;
   however, more than one-third of each drug was recovered in the faeces at
   16 degrees C (64\% and 59\% for OA and OTC respectively). The
   significance of these findings for the interaction between fish therapy
   and marine environment is stressed.},

Title = {CATALOGUE OF PESTS AND PATHOGENS OF TREES ON THE ISLAND OF IRELAND},

Abstract = {The health and sustainability of trees are increasingly under threat
   from biotic and abiotic sources, including rising incidences of
   non-native invasive plant pests and pathogens. The island of ireland
   (Ireland and Northern Ireland) is generally understood to have a high
   plant health status, due to its Island status and because of the
   national and international regulations aimed at protecting plant
   health.To establish a baseline of the current pest and pathogen threats
   to tree health for the Island of ireland, the literature and unpublished
   sources were reviewed to produce a dataset of pests and pathogens of
   trees on the island of Ireland. The dataset contains 396 records-the
   majority of pests and pathogens being arthropods and fungi-and indicates
   potentially more than 44 non-native pest and pathogen introductions.The
   reliability of many (378) of the records was judged to be high,
   therefore the dataset provides a robust assessment of the state of pests
   and pathogens of trees recorded on the island of Ireland.We analyse this
   dataset and review the history of plant pest and pathogen invasions; in
   doing so, we discuss (i) notable native and non-native pests and
   pathogens of trees, (ii) interceptions at borders and (iii) pests,
   pathogens and climate change.The dataset establishes an important
   baseline for the knowledge of plant pests and pathogens on the island of
   Ireland, and will be a valuable resource for future plant health
   research and policy making.},

Title = {Small Reserves Can Successfully Preserve Rare Plants Despite Management
   Challenges},
Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {403-411},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many small, once-rural parcels of land, which were protected to conserve
   rare plants, now exist as isolated patches of habitat within suburban
   and urban matrices. Small parcel protection and management are sometimes
   considered a non-ideal use of scarce conservation resources, but for
   plants with narrowly-restricted ranges, remnant parcels may still hold
   significant conservation value. Managing small reserves can be more
   complicated than tending to a single large reserve; destructive trespass
   and encroachment are common challenges on small reserves, where edge
   effects impact a significant portion of the total protected area. Small
   properties also provide limited space for species to migrate and adapt
   in the face of climate change. The conservation values and management
   challenges relevant to many small reserves are exemplified here in a
   case study from Bear Valley in southern California where The Nature
   Conservancy has collaborated with various partners to protect are plants
   on lands within the San Bernardino Mountains, which later became
   surrounded by residential development. The San Bernardino Mountains
   constitute a mere 1\% of the land area of California, yet contain about
   25\% of all of the state's plant species. The history of rare plant
   conservation in Bear Valley and the current status of The Nature
   Conservancy's efforts in this region are discussed. In addition,
   strategies and management recommendations for successful rare plant
   conservation in the face of global urbanization are presented.},

Abstract = {Mutant sugar transporter ScGAL2-N376F was overexpressed in Kluyveromyces
   marxianus for efficient utilization of xylose, which is one of the main
   components of cellulosic biomass. K. marxianus ScGal2\_N376F, the
   ScGAL2-N376F-overexpressing strain, exhibited 47.04 g/l of xylose
   consumption and 26.55 g/l of xylitol production, as compared to the
   parental strain (24.68 g/l and 7.03 g/l, respectively) when xylose was
   used as the sole carbon source. When a mixture of glucose and xylose was
   used as the carbon source, xylose consumption and xylitol production
   rates were improved by 195\% and 360\%, respectively, by K. marxianus
   ScGal2\_N376F. Moreover, the glucose consumption rate was improved by
   27\% as compared to that in the parental strain. Overexpression of both
   wild-type ScGAL2 and mutant ScGAL2-N376F showed 48\% and 52\% enhanced
   sugar consumption and ethanol production rates, respectively, when a
   mixture of glucose and galactose was used as the carbon source, which is
   the main component of marine biomass. As shown in this study,
   ScGAL2-N376F overexpression can be applied for the efficient production
   of biofuels or biochemicals from cellulosic or marine biomass.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was the preparation of supercritical (SCE),
   conventional hydrodistilled (HDE) and organic solvent (OSE) extracts
   from two Iberian Lavandula luisieri populations (A and B) to study their
   chemical composition and their insect antifeedant properties against
   Spodoptera littoralis and Myzus persicae. HOE and SCE extracts had
   different chemical compositions and insect antifeedant effects, extracts
   from population A being more effective. Compounds
   5-hydroxymethyl-2,3,4,4-tetramethylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (6) and
   (2,2,3,4-tetramethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-en-1-yl)-methyl acetate (7)were
   the major components of the SCE fractions of both populations. The
   supercritical technique (SFE) improved the extraction of 6, 7,
   oxo-cadinol (8), hexadecanoic acid and several not identified compounds
   with respect to HOE. SCE extracts also exhibited increased antifeedant
   effects against S. littoralis and the aphid M. persicae (A-SCE). The
   biological effects of the active extracts cannot be accounted for those
   of their individual major components, suggesting additive or synergistic
   effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {168},

Abstract = {Laser Raman spectroscopy has been successfully applied for the in situ
   detection of gases and liquids, but has not yet been extensively applied
   to rocks in the deep sea. Authigenic carbonate rocks are widely
   distributed at the Formosa Ridge (Site F) and the eastern region of the
   Pear River Mouth basin (Site P) in the South China Sea (SCS).
   Considerable Raman spectral information on authigenic carbonates was
   obtained from laboratory measurements of slices of authigenic carbonate,
   direct measurements in a simulation environment, and in situ
   measurements in the deep sea. The dominant band of authigenic carbonate
   from Site F ranges from 1084 to 1087 cm(-1) while the dominant band from
   Site P ranges from 1088 to 1091 cm(-1), suggesting that compositional
   differences exist between the samples from the two cold seep areas. The
   results of the point-counting method indicates that the aragonite
   content in Site F is higher than that at Site P. The wider peak width of
   the aragonites at Site P shows the aragonites at Site P have lower
   degree of crystallinity, which suggests that aragonite is likely to be
   destroyed when the cold seep weakens or dies. The above information
   obtained via the Raman spectroscopy can guide sample collection in the
   deep sea and can be used in conjunction with other analysis methods to
   better understand environmental changes or the geological processes.},

Title = {Increased extent of waterfowl grazing lengthens the recovery time of a
   colonizing seagrass (Halophila ovalis) with implications for seagrass
   resilience},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Herbivore distributions and abundance are shifting because of climate
   change, leading to intensified grazing pressure on foundation species
   such as seagrasses. This, combined with rapidly increasing magnitudes of
   change in estuarine ecosystems, may affect seagrass resilience. While
   the overall resilience of seagrasses is generally well-studied, the
   timeframes of recovery has received comparatively little attention,
   particularly in temperate estuaries. We investigated how the recovery
   time (RT) of seagrass is affected by simulated grazing in a southwestern
   Australian estuary. Whilst excluding swans, we simulated different
   grazing intensities (25, 50, 75, and 100\% removal from 1 m(2) plots) at
   four locations in the Swan-Canning Estuary, Western Australia during
   summer and tracked the recovery of seagrass over 3 months, using
   seagrass cover as the main measure of recovery. We found that seagrass
   recovered within 4-6 weeks from the lower grazing intensities (25 and
   50\%) and 7-19 weeks from the higher grazing intensities (75 and 100\%)
   across the estuary. Increased grazing intensity led to not only longer
   recovery times (RTs), but also greater variability in the RT among
   experimental locations. The RT from the higher grazing intensities at
   one location in particular was more than double other locations.
   Seagrass recovery was through vegetative mechanisms and not through
   sexual reproduction. There was a significant grazing treatment effect on
   seagrass meadow characteristics, particularly belowground biomass which
   had not recovered 3 months following grazing. As the pressure of climate
   change on estuarine environments increases, these quantified RTs for
   seagrass provide a baseline for understanding grazing pressure as a
   singular disturbance. Future work can now examine how grazing and other
   potentially interacting pressures in our changing climate could impact
   seagrass recovery even further.},

Abstract = {The basal Cambrian clastic sediments in northwest Scotland record a
   transgressive sequence of barrier island to tidal shelf quartz-arenites
   (Eriboll Sandstone Lower Member and Pipe Rock) overlain by a
   storm-dominated interval of mixed clastic-carbonate sediments (Fucoid
   Beds).  Two shallowing events interrupt this sequence:  the lower near
   the middle of the Pipe Rock, and the upper at the top of the Fucoid Beds
   which led to the deposition of the quartz-arenites of the Salterella
   Grit.  Variations in the proportion of storm deposited facies and in the
   thickness of tidally generated structures suggests that tidal currents
   progressively increased during deposition of the quartz-arenites and
   then decreased until deposition of the mixed clastic-carbonate deposits.
   These features suggest amplification of tides as the shelf approached a
   resonant width during transgression.  Further transgression produced a
   wide, non-resonant shelf where tides were frictionally damped, and storm
   processes were dominant.  Similar sequences of the same age in western
   Newfoundland, eastern Greenland and Spitzbergen may also have been
   produced by the shelf bordering the north American craton responding to
   tidal amplification followed by frictional damping.},

Abstract = {Coastal dynamics and erosion processes may cause serious damage,
   especially to people and assets in urban fronts, and they therefore
   merit special attention. To diminish the effects of these natural
   dynamics on coastal areas it is necessary to understand the various
   processes involved. The classification of a coast in terms of
   vulnerability and risk will only be possible when foresight capacity is
   improved, making the planning and decision processes easier. Coastal
   zone vulnerability to energetic environmental actions (waves, tides,
   winds and currents) may be considered to be biophysical systems
   sensitivity and morphological changes as the response. The present
   changes in the frequency of extreme events, the weakening of river
   sediments supply, the generalized sea level rise and other climatic
   changes, together with the advance of urban fronts towards the sea, may
   worsen the consequences of floods and land loss. The vulnerability
   analysis of coastal zones is crucial for appropriate land use, and is a
   complex process which involves many parameters. As a first approach an
   effective methodology is proposed and applied to the coastal region of
   the Aveiro district, south of Porto, Portugal, where the volume of
   available sediment is currently deficient in relation to the transport
   capacity, and it is predictable that the erosion situation will become
   further aggravated in some regions. This methodology consists of
   obtaining a global vulnerability index, which results from the weighting
   of each independently classified vulnerability parameter. This approach
   is complemented with a coastal line evolution estimation using numerical
   modelling.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates a successful application of fluorescence line
   height (FLH) images from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
   (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   satellite imagers and provides a strong argument for making more
   widespread use of FLH in monitoring surface phytoplankton in coastal
   waters. In the present example, MERIS and MODIS FLH images show the
   start of the spring bloom in coastal waters of the Strait of Georgia in
   British Columbia, Canada. The images clearly show a recurring pattern in
   five of the eight years from 2003 to 2010 covered by MERIS, which
   suggests seeding of the early spring bloom from narrow coastal inlets.
   Such seeding has been suggested before, but never observed. FLH images
   show the blooms more clearly than images of surface chlorophyll based on
   the ratios of water-leaving radiances in the blue and green spectral
   range (440-560 nm). FLH images used here have been derived with no
   atmospheric correction. Alternative products based on the blue/green
   ratio require atmospheric correction, which is difficult in coastal
   areas. Such products also tend to be more significantly confused with
   other constituents of coastal waters.},

Title = {Shark Spotters: Successfully reducing spatial overlap between white
   sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and recreational water users in False
   Bay, South Africa},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are apex predators that play an
   important role in the structure and stability of marine ecosystems.
   Despite their ecological importance and protected status, white sharks
   are still subject to lethal control to reduce the risk of shark bites
   for recreational water users. The Shark Spotters program, pioneered in
   Cape Town, South Africa, provides a non-lethal alternative for reducing
   the risk of human-shark conflict. In this study we assessed the efficacy
   of the Shark Spotters program in reducing overlap between water users
   and white sharks at two popular beaches in False Bay, South Africa. We
   investigated seasonal and diel patterns in water use and shark presence
   at each beach, and thereafter quantified the impact of different shark
   warnings from shark spotters on water user abundance. We also assessed
   the impact of a fatal shark incident on patterns of water use. Our
   results revealed striking diel and seasonal overlap between white sharks
   and water users at both beaches. Despite this, there was a low rate of
   shark-human incidents (0.5/annum) which we attribute partly to the
   success of the Shark Spotters program. Shark spotters use visual
   (coloured flags) and auditory (siren) cues to inform water users of risk
   associated with white shark presence in the surf zone. Our results
   showed that the highest risk category (denoted by a white flag and
   accompanying siren) caused a significant reduction in water user
   abundance; however the secondary risk category (denoted by a red flag
   with no siren) had no significant effect on water users. A fatal shark
   incident was shown to negatively impact the number of water users
   present for at least three months following the incident. Our results
   indicate that the Shark Spotters program effectively reduces spatial
   overlap between white sharks and water users when the risk of conflict
   is highest.},

Title = {Is inland aquaculture the panacea for Sierra Leone's decline in marine
   fish stocks?},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {132},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The literature on fisheries for developing countries often cites inland
   aquaculture as a promising source of wealth creation for a nation in
   terms of revenue generation from export products. However, in this paper
   we argue that inland aquaculture has a greater prospect of success if it
   focuses on social welfare - i.e. alleviating food insecurity and poverty
   in coastal fishing communities, particularly those that are experiencing
   increased and unsustainable fishing pressure on marine fish.
   Nevertheless, promoting inland aquaculture in coastal areas faces many
   challenges, including financial, legal, political, environmental,
   logistical, educational, and attitudinal obstacles. Our study
   investigates these challenges in two coastal communities in Sierra Leone
   - Tombo and Goderich - where declining levels of marine fish catches are
   intensifying efforts to provide alternative or supplementary forms of
   employment for artisanal fishers, but where knowledge and experience of,
   and enthusiasm and funding for, inland aquaculture are limited. The
   research is based on the perceptions of 51 key informant interviewees
   and 199 survey questionnaire respondents. The main findings of the
   fieldwork are as follows. (1) Few local fishers were familiar with
   inland aquaculture and its potential benefits. (2) There were land
   tenure problems (for example, women were excluded from ownership of
   land). (3) There was little funding to buy/rent land and equipment. (4)
   Despite declining fish stocks, respondents were reluctant to take up
   full-time fish farming because of the easier option of fishing. Our
   findings suggest that greater uptake of inland aquaculture is more
   likely if presented to local fishers as a supplementary livelihood
   activity rather than an alternative occupation to marine capture
   fishing. Our study reinforces the importance of understanding local
   fishers' cultures, values, and preferences before introducing a new
   livelihood activity.},

   nails demonstrate the first metallographically documented examples of
   Crusader steel recovered from archaeological contexts, as well as rare
   evidence of uncorroded Crusader alloys (non-numismatic). The analysis
   also provides likely evidence for the use of iron hardware from the

   marine ecosystem processes in the light of findings from terrestrial
   ecology. BTF employs recent developments in whole ecosystem simulation
   modelling that allow the analysis of uncertainty, tuning to past biomass
   estimates, and responses to climate changes. It includes new methods for
   describing past ecosystems, for designing fisheries that meet criteria
   for sustainability and responsibility, and for evaluating the costs and
   benefits of fisheries in restored ecosystems. Comparison of ecosystems
   before and after major perturbations, including investigation of
   uncertain ecological issues, may set constraints as to what may or may
   not be restored. Understanding how climate and ocean changes influence
   marine ecosystems may allow policies to be made robust against such
   factors. A new technique of intergenerational discounting is applied to
   economic analyses, allowing policies favouring conservation, as the same
   time as addressing economic standard discounting of future benefits.
   Automated searches maximise values of a range of alternative objective
   functions, and the methodology includes ways to account for uncertainty
   in model parameters. The evaluation of alternative policy choices,
   involving trade-offs between conservation and economic values, employs a
   range of economic, social and ecological measures. BTF policy also
   utilizes insight into the human dimension of fisheries management.
   Participatory workshops attempt to maximise compliance by fostering a
   sense of ownership among all stakeholders: ideally, collaboration by
   scientists, the maritime community, managers and policy-makers may build
   intellectual capital in the model, and social capital in terms of
   increased trust. BTF may help to reverse the shifting baseline syndrome
   by broadening the cognitive maps of resource users. Some challenges that
   have still be met include improving methods for quantitatively
   describing the past, reducing uncertainty in ecosystem simulation
   techniques and in making policy choices robust against climate change.
   Critical issues include whether past ecosystems make viable policy
   goals, and whether desirable goals may be reached from today's
   ecosystem. Examples are presented from case studies in British Columbia,
   Newfoundland and the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada; the Gulf of
   California, Mexico; the Bali Strait and Komodo National Park in
   Indonesia; and the South China Sea.},

Abstract = {To quantify the performance of several beach nourishment projects on
   three adjacent barrier islands located in west-central Florida, a total
   of 5200 beach and nearshore-profiles spaced at 300 m were surveyed
   monthly to bi-monthly from 2006 to 2010. Beach nourishment performance
   at annual temporal and kilometer spatial scales within the microtidal
   low-wave energy barrier island coast is most significantly influenced by
   the interruption of longshore sediment transport by complex tidal-inlet
   processes. The inlet processes directly influencing adjacent beach
   nourishment performance include longshore transport interruption
   resulting from divergence induced by wave refraction over an ebb-tidal
   shoal, flood-tidal currents along the beach, and total littoral blockage
   by structured inlets. Secondary factors controlling the nourishment
   performance include project length and width, shoreline orientation, and
   antecedent geology. A morphologic indicator of a large longshore
   transport gradient within the study area is the absence of a nearshore
   sandbar. These non-barred beaches are characterized by persistent
   shoreline erosion. The presence of a sandbar indicates the dominance of
   cross-shore processes, with bar migration in response to wave condition
   variations and a relatively stable shoreline. The entirety of a barrier
   island system should be considered when evaluating the performance of a
   nourishment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Shock dissipation in magnetically dominated impulsive flows},

Abstract = {The idea that cosmic relativistic jets are magnetically driven
   Poynting-dominated flows has many attractive features but also some
   problems. One of them is the low efficiency of shock dissipation in
   highly magnetized plasma. Indeed, the observations of gamma-ray bursts
   (GRBs) and their afterglow emission indicate very high radiative
   efficiency of relativistic jets associated with these phenomena. We have
   revisited the issue of shock dissipation and emission and its
   implications for the internal shock model of the prompt GRB emission and
   studied it in the context of impulsive Poynting-dominated flows. Our
   results show that unless the magnetization of GRB jets is extremely
   high, sigma > 100 in the prompt emission zone, the magnetic model may
   still be compatible with the observations. First, for sigma similar or
   equal to 1 the dissipation efficiency of fast magnetosonic shock is
   still quite high, similar to 30 per cent. Secondly, the main effect of
   reduced dissipation efficiency is merely an increase in the size of the
   dissipation zone, and even for highly magnetized GRB jets, this size may
   remain below the external shock radius, provided the central engine can
   emit magnetic shells on the time-scale well below the typical observed
   variability scale of 1 s. Our analytical and numerical results suggest
   that strong interaction between shells begins not during the coasting
   phase but well before it. As the result, the impulsive jet in the
   dissipation zone is best described not as a collection of shells but as
   a continuous highly magnetized flow with a high amplitude magnetosonic
   wave component. How exactly the dissipated wave energy is distributed
   between the radiation and the bulk kinetic energy of radial jets depends
   on the relative rates of radiative and adiabatic cooling. In the fast
   radiative cooling regime, the corresponding radiative efficiency can be
   as high as the wave contribution to their energy budget, independently
   of the magnetization. Moreover, after leaving the zone of prompt
   emission, the jet may still remain Poynting dominated, leading to weaker
   emission from the reverse shock compared to non-magnetic models.
   Energetically subdominant weakly magnetized `clouds' in otherwise
   strongly magnetized jets may significantly increase the overall
   efficiency of the shock dissipation.},

Title = {Geophysical Evidence for Carbonate Platform Periphery Gravity Flows in
   the Xisha Islands, South China Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {837-848},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {High-resolution bathymetric and partial seismic data were utilized to
   determine the characteristics and distribution of mass-transport
   deposits (MTDs) in the Xisha area, North of the South China Sea. Many
   isolated carbonate platforms are found in this area, providing
   mass-wasting materials as a sediment source for MTDs. The MTDs in the
   study area were divided into three types (slide, slump, and debris flow)
   based on their rheological properties. The MTDs were mostly distributed
   at the toe of the carbonate platform slope, where a large amount of
   carbonate debris accumulated. A total of 32 MTDs were identified on the
   carbonate platform slopes. A systematic assessment of the MTD
   morphometric parameters showed that their total area covered 2225.2
   km(2), with the largest MTD covering 354.1 km(2). These MTDs differ
   largely from the MTDs of other areas, especially in terms of sediment
   compositions and deposit processes. Gullies and channels on the slope
   and reefs on the top of the platform act as sediment conduits and
   carbonate-producing sources, respectively, playing vital roles in the
   distribution and generation of gravity flow deposits. The development
   model proposed in this work states that reefs disintegrate into
   carbonate debris and mix with seawater to form gravity flows, which
   scour the seafloor and accumulate at the downslope, eventually resulting
   in failure. Sediments from these failures turn into gravity flows,
   flowing into submarine canyons and channels. The results of this
   research further our understanding of the development pattern of MTDs in
   a carbonate setting.},

Title = {Long-term changes in precipitation phase in Europe in cold half year},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {227},
Pages = {79-88},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The change in precipitation phase is an important manifestation of
   climate change, especially in the moderate climate zone and mountain
   regions. We analyse changes in precipitation at 107 European stations in
   cold months (November-April). Stations in Czechia where both surface
   synoptic observations (SYNOP) reporting the precipitation phase, and
   temperature and precipitation data are available in sufficient quality,
   are used to determine the regional threshold temperature. The threshold
   temperature is then applied to separate solid and liquid precipitation
   phase in cold months at European stations in 1961-2010. If daily mean
   temperature is higher than the regional threshold temperature, daily
   precipitation amount is considered to be liquid and vice versa. The
   value of the regional threshold temperature is 1.1 degrees C. The ratio
   of solid to total precipitation (S/P) significantly declines over large
   parts of Europe. The strongest negative trend is detected in the belt
   stretching from the coast of northern Scandinavia through central and
   eastern Europe towards southern and southeastern Europe. The trend of
   S/P ranges from -0.2 to -0.9\%.year(-1) there. The average annual trend
   of the ratio of solid precipitation for all Europe is - 0.12\%.year(-1).
   The magnitude of the trend of the ratio of solid precipitation exhibits
   only a minor sensitivity to the choice of the threshold temperature. A
   comparison with real trends, calculated for stations in Czechia,
   indicates that trends determined from the threshold temperature tend to
   be overestimated, that is, the decline of solid precipitation in Europe
   is even faster that what results of this study indicate.},

Volume = {158},
Pages = {605-615},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {A wide variety of weather-data are readily available for simulating
   buildings energy performance by using dynamic software. However, climate
   change and its effects on buildings energy performance represent a
   critical issue, also considering the implications of climate change on
   human comfort. Starting from this, the present study aims at analyzing
   the climatic conditions in Rome and its surroundings, evaluating the
   occurrence of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. Therefore,
   meteorological data derived from two airports near the city and climatic
   data registered for two years in a central, densely-built zone of Rome
   were analyzed and compared. Furthermore, the differences among weather
   data were tested by means of a commonly used dynamic software in order
   to evaluate the effects of different climatic boundary conditions on
   building energy performance, in terms of heating and cooling energy
   demands. The results highlight significant differences with regard to
   temperature, wind velocity and relative humidity, as a result of a
   prevailing UHI phenomenon in central Rome throughout the year. The
   simulations show an average increase of cooling energy demand of about
   30\% and an average reduction of heating energy demand of about 11\%.
   Such differences give the rise for the investigation of the reliability
   of weather data files commonly used in building simulations, in order to
   properly estimate the buildings energy demand under a sustainable city
   perspective. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing the State of ICZM in an Island Tourist Destination-Applying
   SESs and Ostrom's Collective Action Principles: A View from Coastal
   Communities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the state of integrated coastal zone
   management (ICZM), which is justified as a strategy for managing coastal
   resources with respect to increasing pressures from tourism, farming,
   climate change, urbanization, population growth, etc. In the case of
   island states, the impact of tourism and second-home development is
   paramount. The use of coastal areas as commons and ICZM as a governance
   strategy have been established for a long time; however, the
   implementation of ICZM has remained a challenge due to the forces of
   global mass tourism and unsustainable resource use in island states.
   This study focused on views of the coastal communities in North Cyprus,
   who are in constant interaction with coastal ecosystems for their
   livelihood. For the analytical purpose of the study, 251 survey
   questionnaires were administered to eight communities along the coastal
   areas. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistical
   analysis with a post hoc test. Socio-ecological systems (SES) and
   Ostrom's collective action principles guided the study as the main
   theoretical frameworks. The study revealed that the ICZM strategy has
   been neglected and coastal communities are not invited to be involved in
   any form of ICZM. Furthermore, the study revealed the tourism
   development has been the major activity of the Anthropocene in coastal
   areas without a proactive coastal development strategy that is supposed
   to consider the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems. Practical and
   theoretical implications are also discussed.},

Title = {Energy retrofit to nearly zero and socio- oriented urban environments in

Abstract = {The paper aims at presenting alternative ways of investigating, planning
   and managing sustainable urban environments, by exploring the
   possibility to use energy retrofitting options as a socio-economical
   leverage towards nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs).
   The connecting theme of the proposed research path is that the crises of
   energy supply and global warming need to be tackled with an
   interdisciplinary, both socio-technical and engineering approach.
   In particular, the design study and the performed technical-economical
   evaluation demonstrate that energy efficiency in residential urban
   complex can be considered as an extraordinary opportunity to restore
   environmental, social and urban quality.
   The techno-economical feasibility assessment, the proper identification
   of the types of intervention and their combination in possible scenarios
   must be investigated and estimated on a case-by-case basis, with an
   effective and interdisciplinary design approach integrating in a whole
   system the socio-technical aspects into the feasibility study of
   economical and architectural issues.
   In this context, a renewed role of architects and planners is what is
   need for a real shift in the building practice. In fact, instead of
   trying to structure the informal through the architectural production
   based on authorship, architects should consider the users' perspective
   and their need as self-organised processes of negotiation. This strategy
   can help in engaging a real shift from the current practice towards a
   social sustainable process where inhabitants and designers work together
   to find effective and real solutions to social and technical questions.
   The urban and technological strategies here presented suggest a
   multi-fold approach that could stimulate the process of energy renewal
   according to a socio-oriented use of architectural tools in urban
   environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A two-dimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic finite-element
   model of the west coast of Britain is used to examine the response of
   the region to extreme meteorological forcing. The extent to which
   tide-surge interaction modifies the computed surge elevation and current
   distributions is examined in detail. The nature of the finite-element
   model with its ability to refine the mesh in nearshore regions is ideal
   for examining the influence of non-linear effects upon surges in these
   regions. Calculations using spatially uniform orthogonal wind stresses
   show that the surge elevation and current in shallow water are
   particularly sensitive to the method used to remove the tide as a result
   of the highly non-linear nature of the tide-surge interaction in these
   regions. The most accurate means of de-tiding the solution is by
   subtracting a tide derived by harmonic analysis of the tide and surge
   time series at the time of the surge. Subtracting a tide-only solution
   (the usual approach) leads to tidal energy leaking into the surge
   solution. Calculations show that this arises because the surge modifies
   the tidal amplitude and phase in shallow-water regions to such an extent
   that they are appreciably different to those found in the tide-only
   calculation. Results suggest that this problem becomes more important,
   as nearshore meshes are refined in an attempt to improve surge
   prediction. This suggests that in the future, highly accurate fine-mesh
   models will be required to compute total water levels without the
   present linear separation into tidal and surge signal used in
   operational surge prediction.},

Title = {Stakeholder discourses on urban mangrove conservation and management},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {178},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {In Southeast Asia, mangrove forest cover and biodiversity has shown a
   rapid decline in recent decades, despite extensive conservation efforts.
   Identifying and analysing discourses on biodiversity conservation
   improves our knowledge and understanding of stakeholder perspectives
   (including normative values and socially constructed viewpoints) on
   biodiversity conservation within a specific social-ecological context.
   Considering these perspectives in a decision-making context contributes
   to the long-term sustainability of resulting conservation approaches,
   thus contributing to continued biodiversity conservation efforts in the
   far future. We consider the urban City State of Singapore to identify
   and interpret stakeholder discourses-including values and socially
   constructed viewpoints-on (effective) mangrove biodiversity conservation
   and management in an urban context. Using the Q methodology, we: (i)
   delineate and describe mangrove conservation and management discourses
   in Singapore and (ii) extract consensual perspectives common to
   discourses as a basis for management recommendations. Areas of agreement
   and disagreement on motivation, prioritization and responsibilities
   related to mangrove conservation and management are described based on
   numerical (i.e. sorting of statements along an ordinal scale) and
   qualitative data (i.e. structured interviews). There was a large overlap
   between discourses, suggesting that disagreement between various
   stakeholders may not be a prominent inhibitor of future decision making
   regarding mangrove conservation and management. It seems stakeholders
   realise the urban context strongly limits the range of realistic
   conservation and management approaches of mangrove forests, resulting in
   the larger overlap between discourses. Generally, all participants agree
   no further loss of existing Singapore mangroves should be allowed. The
   most important recommendations to reach this ultimate objective include
   indefinite legal protection and increase of mangrove areas under
   national park and nature reserve status, as well as continued promotion
   of mangrove's cultural ecosystem services. The identified discourses can
   inform decision-making by deducing shared stakeholder objectives based
   on the consensus values and perspectives. These shared objectives can
   readily be incorporated in decision-making processes on mangrove
   conservation and management in an urban context.},

Abstract = {The coastal process in a surf zone is very complicated, especially when
   the wave breaks and it associates turbulence. In a coastal area with
   wave angle influence the cross-shore process, the energy dissipated per
   unit water volume by breaking waves generate seabed sediment suspension
   then drive the materials to offshore along with the undertow in the
   swash zone. This situation could lead beach profile evolution due to the
   sediment erosion and deposition across an area in the surf zone. As a
   result, a sand bar located around the breaking line and berm at the
   landward region caused by overwash are formed. Furthermore, the beach
   profile is presumed to be in an equilibrium condition when the total
   positive and negative littoral transport approaches zero. The
   equilibrium stage which commonly used is expressed with a power of 2/3
   which provide the best representative to the natural beach profile
   shapes. Under this concept, an analysis on the correlation between the
   beach profile response due to the incident wave energy and suspended
   sediment transport in a cross-shore view is carried out. Furthermore,
   this study develops a simple equilibrium beach profile prediction by
   analyzing the sediment characteristics and is supported by numerical
   modeling. Lastly, this study is expected to be practically used for
   coastal infrastructure design works, especially in the process of mean
   shoreline position prediction as the basis of the design judgements.},

Abstract = {Long-term forest dynamics plots in the tropics tend to be situated on
   stable terrain. This study investigated forest dynamics on the north
   coast of New Guinea where active subduction zones are uplifting lowland
   basins and exposing relatively young sediments to rapid weathering. We
   examined forest dynamics in relation to disturbance history, topography
   and soil nutrients based on partial re-census of the 50-ha Wanang Forest
   Dynamics Plot in Papua New Guinea. The plot is relatively high in
   cations and phosphorus but low in nitrogen. Soil nutrients and
   topography accounted for 29\% of variation in species composition but
   only 4\% of variation in basal area. There were few areas of high
   biomass and most of the forest was comprised of small-diameter stems.
   Approximately 18\% of the forest was less than 30 y old and the annual
   tree mortality rate of nearly 4\% was higher than in other tropical
   forests in South-East Asia and the neotropics. These results support the
   reputation of New Guinea's forests as highly dynamic, with frequent
   natural disturbance. Empirical documentation of this hypothesis expands
   our understanding of tropical forest dynamics and suggests that
   geomorphology might be incorporated in models of global carbon storage
   especially in regions of unstable terrain.},

Title = {New and rare coastal fishes in the Azores islands: occasional events or
   tropicalization process?},

Volume = {83},

Abstract = {Seven coastal fish species are newly reported for the remote north
   Atlantic archipelago of the Azores: Mediterranean sand eel Gymnammodytes
   cicerelus, bar jack Caranx ruber, two-banded seabream Diplodus vulgaris,
   bastard grunt Pomadasys incisus, unicorn leatherjacket filefish Aluterus
   scriptus and longspined porcupinefish Diodon holacanthus. The occurrence
   is also confirmed for 19 species that had been hitherto cited
   occasionally for the region, totalling a list of two elasmobranchs and
   23 teleosts. Diplodus vulgaris, which appears to have recently colonized
   the islands, as well as roughtail stingray Dasyatis centroura and golden
   grey mullet Liza aurata, re-cited based on new records, are frequent or
   common coastal species in the Azores. The remaining 22 species,
   exceptional or rare in the region, are of tropical or subtropical
   affinity and find their northernmost distribution limit within the
   central and north-east Atlantic Ocean precisely in the Azores. This
   biogeographical pattern contrasts with that of the Azorean coastal fish
   community and suggests a tropicalization process in the region in line
   with previous findings of similar patterns across the north-east
   Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. These novel data from the most
   isolated archipelago of the North Atlantic Ocean, located in a
   biogeographic boundary area where colonization opportunities are
   reduced, reinforce the need for long-term monitoring programmes of
   coastal fish communities and, in particular, of indicator species groups
   to improve understanding of the effects of climate change on marine
   communities. (C) 2013 The Authors Journal of Fish Biology (C) 2013 The

Title = {A multi-trait systems approach reveals a response cascade to bleaching
   in corals},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Background: Climate change causes the breakdown of the symbiotic
   relationships between reef-building corals and their photosynthetic
   symbionts (genus Symbiodinium), with thermal anomalies in 2015-2016
   triggering the most widespread mass coral bleaching on record and
   unprecedented mortality on the Great Barrier Reef. Targeted studies
   using specific coral stress indicators have highlighted the complexity
   of the physiological processes occurring during thermal stress, but have
   been unable to provide a clear mechanistic understanding of coral
   bleaching.
   Results: Here, we present an extensive multi-trait-based study in which
   we compare the thermal stress responses of two phylogenetically distinct
   and widely distributed coral species, Acropora millepora and Stylophora
   pistillata, integrating 14 individual stress indicators over time across
   a simulated thermal anomaly. We found that key stress responses were
   conserved across both taxa, with the loss of symbionts and the
   activation of antioxidant mechanisms occurring well before collapse of
   the physiological parameters, including gross oxygen production and
   chlorophyll a. Our study also revealed species-specific traits,
   including differences in the timing of antioxidant regulation, as well
   as drastic differences in the production of the sulfur compound
   dimethylsulfoniopropionate during bleaching. Indeed, the concentration
   of this antioxidant increased two-fold in A. millepora after the corals
   started to bleach, while it decreased 70\% in S. pistillata.
   Conclusions: We identify a well-defined cascading response to thermal
   stress, demarking clear pathophysiological reactions conserved across
   the two species, which might be central to fully understanding the
   mechanisms triggering thermally induced coral bleaching. These results
   highlight that bleaching is a conserved mechanism, but specific
   adaptations linked to the coral's antioxidant capacity drive differences
   in the sensitivity and thus tolerance of each coral species to thermal
   stress.},

Abstract = {Suites of criteria specifying ecological, biological, social, economic,
   and governance properties enable the systematic identification of sites
   and networks of high biodiversity value, and can support balancing
   ecological and socioeconomic objectives of biodiversity conservation in
   terrestrial and marine spatial planning. We describe designs of suites
   of ecological, governance and socioeconomic criteria to comprehensively
   cover manifestations of biodiversity, from genotypes to biomes;
   compensate for taxonomic and spatial gaps in available datasets; balance
   biases resulting from conventionally-employed narrow criteria suites
   focusing on rare, endemic and threatened species; plan for climate
   change effects on biodiversity; and optimize the ecological and
   administrative networking of sites. Representativeness, replication,
   ecological connectivity, size, and refugia are identified as minimum
   ecological properties of site networks. Through inclusion of a criterion
   for phylogenetic distinctiveness, criteria suites identify sites
   important for maintaining evolutionary processes. Criteria for focal
   species are needed to overcome data gaps and address limitations in
   knowledge of factors responsible for maintaining ecosystem integrity.},

Title = {Transform from gasoline stations to electric-hydrogen hybrid refueling

   storage system and its control strategy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) will proliferate in the near future
   as they are prerequisites for the fast developing hydrogen-powered
   vehicles. The electric-hydrogen hybrid refueling stations based on DC
   microgrid is a promising way. The HRSs can utilize renewable energy to
   generate and store hydrogen on site locally. DC bus voltage stability
   and reliable operation become significant control issues of HRSs based
   on DC microgrid. In order to solve the problem of power allocation and
   coordinated operation of lithium battery energy storage system (BESS)
   and hydrogen energy storage system (HESS), a fuzzy power allocation
   strategy and control method is proposed for islanding DC microgrid with
   electric-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system. The operation modes of
   DC microgrid are analyzed, the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is designed,
   and the control methods of different interface converters are given
   under different operating modes. Finally, simulation model and
   hardware-in-the loop experimental platform based on RT-LAB are built,
   the proposed algorithm and traditional method are carried out in
   simulation model and experimental platform. The simulation and
   experimental results show that the proposed method can use the fuzzy
   logic controller to dynamically adjust the allocation factors according
   to the state-of-charge (SOC) of battery and state-of-charge (SOCH) of
   hydrogen storage tank, so that the SOC and SOCH gradually tend to a
   reasonable working range, improve the service life of the battery and
   hydrogen safety, and reduce the number of control mode switching.},

   large sample of Ro-Ro cargo ships and Ro-Ro passenger ships, built
   between the years 1990 and 2012. The estimation of ships' resistance and
   powering was conducted by application of Holtrop's method. The obtained
   formulae's exponent values were compared with the corresponding ones
   from latest International Maritime Organization studies on Energy
   Efficiency Design Index and they appear to better represent the energy
   efficiency and environmental impact of the operating fleet of Ro-Ro
   cargo and Ro-Ro passenger ships. Derived formulae may also be used in
   the frame of parametric design optimization of Ro-Ro ships.},

Journal = {GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Chemical weathering of silicate rocks on continents is thought to have
   played an important role in the evolution of past atmospheric carbon
   dioxide over geologic timescales. However, the detailed links between
   continental weathering and climate change over shorter timescales, and
   their potential impact on sediment records deposited in the ocean,
   remain poorly understood. Here, we present clay mineralogy and
   strontium-neodymium isotopic data for marine sediment records from the
   Northern Indian Ocean, with the aim of investigating the weathering
   response of large Himalayan river basins to orbital and millennial
   climate forcing. We show that past glaciated episodes of the late
   Quaternary corresponded to periods of increased physical erosion,
   associated with the preferential export of illite and chlorite
   assemblages from the Himalayan highlands having relatively radiogenic Sr
   isotopic signatures. In contrast, the warm periods of enhanced monsoon
   rainfall coincided with the transport of intensively weathered
   smectite-dominated soils derived from the floodplains, characterized by
   lower(87)Sr/Sr-86 signatures. This finding suggests that the short-term
   climatic variability over late Quaternary timescales was accompanied by
   concomitant changes between high mountain- versus floodplain-dominated
   weathering regimes, with possible impact on the nature of weathered
   rocks and, as a consequence, on the carbon cycle.},

Abstract = {Intensive surveys with repeated CTD and microstructure turbulent
   observations, water and sediments sampling as well as onboard incubation
   and sediment trap experiments were conducted to reveal the nitrogen
   budget in the center of the East China Sea (ECS) during July 2010 and
   2011. Low salinity water (Changjiang Diluted Water, CDW) covered the
   study area in 2010, but not in 2011. Higher chlorophyll a (chl. a)
   concentration, primary productivity, and downward particle flux in the
   upper layer were observed in 2010 than those in 2011. Existence of the
   CDW resulted in a steep pycnocline and an associated subsurface chl. a
   maximum (SCM) layer directly beneath the CDW. From chemical analyses of
   particulate carbon and nitrogen contents and isotope ratios, it became
   apparent that the particles sunk out the euphotic zone in 2010 was
   primarily originated in the CDW layer and secondly in the SCM layer.
   Whereas, in 2011, sinking particles were originated in the surface layer
   but a part of them were decomposed in the bottom of pycnocline. Our
   findings indicate that the CDW would supply particles into the deep
   layer and contribute to the downward transport of materials and the
   efficiency of biological pump in the ECS.},

Abstract = {In 2007, China and Singapore decided to build an EcoCity in Tianjin,
   North China, as an example of sustainable development to be reproduced
   around China and the world. Tianjin is the third centre of development
   in China, after Hong Kong (1980' s) and Shanghai regions (1990' s), and
   an excellent test site for the struggle with tough environmental
   challenges in the 21st century.
   In 2009, the Finns were challenged to consider building their share of
   Tianjin EcoCity. The resulted Floating EcoCity-concept (FEC (C) ASOY
   2009) will be treated on this paper. It consists of hexagonal platforms
   and EcoFlo Vessels. six caissons offer maximal stability to the
   hexagonal platform. The lower deck has technical facilities in the
   middle, services on the edges, and traffic between, while the upper deck
   has prefabricated modular housing on the edges, Central Park in the
   middle, and the whole is covered by a megatent. The platforms are
   assembled into larger hexagons.
   EcoFlo Vessels are equipped similarly in new tankers and container ships
   that were left unused due to recession. They surround the platforms
   creating an even larger hexagonal quarter, to be replicated in fractals.
   Each unit is an energy positive and CO2 negative biosphere, where plants
   shade, purify air, water and soil, balance humidity and produce oxygen,
   food and recreation. Local services and working opportunities minimize
   traffic. FEC offers secure, practical, clean, healthy, and exciting sea
   life.},

Abstract = {In the study, a hybrid energy system for hydrogen and electric
   production is conceptually developed and applied to an island, Bozcaada.
   A thermodynamic analysis is performed using energy and exergy
   approaches. The conceptual system is examined from the viewpoints of
   economic and energy load distributions by the Hybrid Optimization Model
   for Electric Renewable (HOMER) tool. In the study, stand-alone island
   model is selected for analysis scenarios. The model consists of photo
   voltaic (PV) array, wind turbines, electrolyzer, polymer electrolyte
   membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), hydrogen tank and converter. Energy and
   exergy analyses are applied to determine of the locations and magnitudes
   of system inefficiencies. The analyses are essentially made for the main
   equipment under dynamically changing operating and environmental
   conditions. In addition, hourly distributions of changing energy and
   exergy rates are illustrated. As a result, the daily average energy and
   exergy efficiencies of the PV array are 13.31\% and 14.26\%. Also, the
   efficiency values are calculated for the wind turbine as 46\% for energy
   and 50.12\% for exergy and the electrolyzer equipment as 59.68\% for
   energy and 60.26\% for exergy, respectively. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy

Title = {On the displacement of marked pebbles on two coarse-clastic beaches
   during short fair-weather periods (Marina di Pisa and Portonovo, Italy)},
Journal = {GEO-MARINE LETTERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {463-476},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The aim of the investigation was to define the mechanisms of sediment
   transport in the swash zone of microtidal coarse-clastic beaches in the
   very short term by evaluating the displacement rates of marked pebbles
   under low-energy wave conditions. Tests were performed at two sites
   (Marina di Pisa, Ligurian Sea, and Portonovo, central Adriatic Sea) to
   check the consistency of the data over a range of different grain sizes.
   Two recovery campaigns were carried out at both sites, one 6 h and the
   other 24 h after the injection. During the experiments wave action was
   at a minimum (wave heights never exceeded 0.3 m). The results show that
   20\% of pebbles ranging in diameter from 30-90 mm moved significantly
   (more than 0.5 m) already 6 h after the injection, with some tracers
   being lost (3\%). After 24 h, 40\% of the pebbles were significantly
   displaced and 10\% were lost. The preferential downslope movement of
   tracers, which suggests that coarse sediment movement under low-energy
   conditions is mainly controlled by gravity processes enhanced by steep
   beachface slopes, represents the novelty of the results reported here.
   It would appear that swash processes on low-energy beaches cause a
   significant rate of pebble displacement through the destabilization
   induced by wave uprush and backwash. Despite the microtidal range, the
   position of the mean water level plays a major role in changing the
   beach level at which swash processes can actually trigger pebble
   movement. The results of this study show that considerable, and mostly
   seaward-directed, coarse sediment transport takes place even during
   short fair-weather periods.},

Abstract = {We identified 100 scientific questions that, if answered, would have the
   greatest impact on conservation practice and policy. Representatives
   from 21 international organizations, regional sections and working
   groups of the Society for Conservation Biology, and 12 academics, from
   all continents except Antarctica, compiled 2291 questions of relevance
   to conservation of biological diversity worldwide. The questions were
   gathered from 761 individuals through workshops, email requests, and
   discussions. Voting by email to short-list questions, followed by a
   2-day workshop, was used to derive the final list of 100 questions. Most
   of the final questions were derived through a process of modification
   and combination as the workshop progressed. The questions are divided
   into 12 sections: ecosystem functions and services, climate change,
   technological change, protected areas, ecosystem management and
   restoration, terrestrial ecosystems, marine ecosystems, freshwater
   ecosystems, species management, organizational systems and processes,
   societal context and change, and impacts of conservation interventions.
   We anticipate that these questions will help identify new directions for
   researchers and assist funders in directing funds.},

Title = {Intense but variable autotrophic activity in a rapidly flushed

Journal = {GEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Shallow-water hydrothermal plumes concomitantly host both photosynthetic
   and chemoautotrophic organisms in a single biotope. Yet, rate
   measurements to quantify the contributions of different autotrophic
   activity types are scarce. Herein, we measured the light and dark
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) uptake rates in the plume water of the
   Kueishantao hydrothermal field using the(13)C-labeling approach. Seventy
   percent of the plume-water samples had chemoautotrophy as the dominant
   mode of carbon fixation, with the dark DIC uptake rates (up to 18.6 mg
   C/m(3)/h) within the range of the primary production in productive
   inner-shelf waters. When considered alongside the geochemical and
   microbiological observations, the rate data reveal the distribution of
   different trophic activities in the hydrothermal plume. The autotrophic
   activity at the initial phase of plume dispersal is low. This is
   explained by the short response time the chemoautotrophs have to the
   stimulation from vent-fluid discharge, and the harmful effects of
   hydrothermal substances on phytoplankton. As plume dispersal and mixing
   continue, chemoautotrophic activities begin to rise and peak in waters
   that have low-to-moderate Si(OH)(4)content. Toward the plume margin,
   chemoautotrophy declines to background levels, whereas photosynthesis by
   phytoplankton regains importance. Our results also provide preliminary
   indication to the loci of enhanced heterotrophy in the plume. Results of
   artificial mixing experiments suggest that previously formed plume water
   is the primary source of microbial inoculum for new plume water. This
   self-inoculation mechanism, in combination with the intense DIC uptake,
   helps to sustain a distinct planktonic autotrophic community in this
   rapidly flushed hydrothermal plume.},

Abstract = {Soil samples from a Louisiana Barataria Basin brackish marshes were
   fractionated into acid-volatile sulfides (AVS), HCl-soluble sulfur,
   elemental sulfur, pyrite sulfur, ester-sulfate sulfur, and carbon-bonded
   sulfur. Inorganic sulfur composed 13\% of total sulfur in brackish marsh
   soil with HCl-soluble sulfur representing 63-92\% of the inorganic
   sulfur fraction. AVS represented less than 1\% of the total sulfur pool.
   Pyrite sulfur and elemental sulfur together accounted for 8 33\% of the
   inorganic sulfur pool. Organic sulfur, in the forms of ester-sulfate
   sulfur and carbon-bonded sulfur, was the most dominant pool representing
   the majority of total sulfur in brackish marsh. Results were compared to
   values reported for fresh and salt marshes. Reported inorganic sulfur
   fractions were greater in adjacent marshes, constituting 24\% of total
   sulfur in salt marsh, and 22\% in freshwater marshes. Along a salinity
   gradient, HCl-soluble sulfur represented 78-86\% of the inorganic sulfur
   fraction in fresh, brackish, and salt marsh. Organic sulfur in the forms
   of ester-sulfate sulfur and carbon-bonded sulfur was the major
   constituent (76-87\%) of total sulfur in all marshes. Reduced sulfur
   species, except elemental sulfur, increased seaward along the salinity
   gradient. Accumulation of reduced sulfur forms through sedimentation
   processes was significant in marsh energy flow in fresh, brackish and
   salt marshes.},

Title = {Parameterization of Urban Characteristics for Global Climate Modeling},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {100},
Number = {4},
Pages = {848-865},
Abstract = {To help understand potential effects of urbanization on climates of
   varying scales and effects of climate change on urban populations,
   urbanization must be included in global climate models (GCMs). To
   properly capture the spatial variability in urban areas, GCMs require
   global databases of urban extent and characteristics. This article
   describes methods and characteristics used to create a data set that can
   be utilized to simulate urban systems on a global scale within GCMs. The
   data set represents three main categories of urban properties: spatial
   extent, urban morphology, and thermal and radiative properties of
   building materials. Spatial extent of urban areas is derived from a
   population density data set and calibrated within thirty-three regions
   of similar physical and social characteristics. For each region, four
   classes of urbanization are identified and linked to a set of typical
   building morphology, thermal, and radiative characteristics. In
   addition, urban extent is simulated back in time to 1750 based on
   national historical population and urbanization trends. A sample set of
   simulations shows that the urban characteristics do change urban heat
   island outcomes. In general the simulations show greater urban heat
   islands with increasing latitude, in agreement with observations.

   addition, a methodology and a metric are presented for the assessment of
   the uncertainty across the full time series for the response of a

   that there is a significant cost incurred in terms of experimental
   uncertainty through the addition of rotor thrust in the laboratory

   experimental uncertainty is observed through the introduction of
   gyroscopic rotor loading for most platform responses.},

Abstract = {Disturbance observer based (DOB) control has been implemented in motion
   control to reject unknown or time varying disturbances. In this
   research, an internal model-based disturbance observer (DOB) design
   combined with a PID type feedback controller is formulated for wind
   turbine speed and power regulation. The DOB controller facilitates
   model-based estimation and cancellation of disturbance using an inner
   feedback control loop. The disturbance observer combined with a
   compensator is further designed to deal with the model mismatch. The
   proposed method is applied to National Renewable Energy laboratory
   (NREL) offshore 5-MW wind turbine. Our case studies show that the DOB
   controller can achieve improved speed and power regulation compared to
   the baseline PID controller, and exhibit excellent robustness under
   different turbulent wind fields.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies on poly gamma-d-glutamicacid (gamma-PGA) production
   have investigated terrestrial renewable sources for reducing production
   costs, but there are no studies using waste marine resources so far. We
   aimed to develop a cost-effective production method of gamma-d-PGA by
   Bacillus sp. SJ-10 using green macroalgae (Ulva sp.) as a major
   substrate without hydrolysis pretreatment. The SJ-10 was shown to not
   only cause immediate tissue degradation of the Ulva membrane but also
   grew well as a sole substrate. The gamma-d-PGA yield was 6.29 +/- 0.34
   g/L under optimized conditions via the response surface method, and the
   produced gamma-d-PGA had a thermal decomposition temperature of 310
   degrees C and molecular weight of 250-1780 kDa. The calculated cost
   efficiency for the final yield was 32\% when compared with complex
   media. Therefore, the present study provided a strategy for promoting an
   ecofriendly and cost-effective means to produce gamma-d-PGA via a marine
   renewable resource.},

Abstract = {There has been speculation that energy input (wind) can play an
   important role in the formation of rogue waves in the open ocean. Here
   we examine the role energy input can play by adding energy to the
   modified non-linear Schrodinger equation. We consider NewWave type
   wave-groups with spectra which are realistic for wind waves. We examine
   the case where energy input is added to the group as the wave-group
   focuses. We consider whether this energy input can cause significant
   non-linear effects to the subsequent spatial and spectral evolution. For
   the parameters considered here we find this to have only a small
   influence.},

Abstract = {Animals make behavioural and reproductive decisions that maximise their
   lifetime reproductive success, and thus their fitness, in light of
   periodic and stochastic variability of the environment. Modelling the
   variation of an individual's energy levels formalises this tradeoff and
   helps to quantify the population-level consequences of stressors (e.g.
   disturbance from human activities and environmental change) that can
   affect behaviour or physiology. In this study, we develop a dynamic
   state variable model for the spatially explicit behaviour, physiology
   and reproduction of a female, long-lived, migratory marine vertebrate.
   The model can be used to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of
   behaviour and reproduction that allow an individual to maximise its
   overall reproductive output. We parametrised the model for eastern North
   Pacific blue whales Balaenoptera musculus, and used it to predict the
   effects of changing environmental conditions and increasing human
   disturbance on the population's vital rates. In baseline conditions, the
   model output had high fidelity to observed energy dynamics, movement
   patterns and reproductive strategies. Simulated scenarios suggested that
   environmental changes could have severe consequences on the population's
   vital rates, but that individuals could tolerate high levels of
   anthropogenic disturbance. However, this ability depended on where, when
   and how often disturbance occurred. In scenarios with both environmental
   change and anthropogenic disturbance, synergistic interactions caused
   stronger effects than in isolation. In general, larger body size offered
   a buffer against stochasticity and disturbance, and, consequently, we
   predicted juveniles to be more susceptible to disturbance. We also
   predicted that females prioritise their own survival at the expense of
   the current reproductive attempt, presumably the result of their long
   lifespan. Our approach provides a general framework to make predictions
   of the cumulative and synergistic effects of human disturbance and
   climate change on migratory populations, which can inform effective
   management and conservation efforts.},

Title = {Controls on the solubility of rhenium in silicate melt: Implications for
   the osmium isotopic composition of Earth's mantle},
Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {361},
Pages = {320-332},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The solubility of Re and Au in haplobasaltic melt has been investigated
   at 1673-2573 K, 0.1 MPa-2 GPa and IW -1 to +2.5, in both
   carbon-saturated and carbon-free systems. Results extend the existing,
   low pressure and temperature, dataset to more accurately predict the
   results of metal-silicate equilibrium at the base of a terrestrial magma
   ocean. Solubilities in run-product glasses were measured by laser
   ablation ICP-MS, which allows for the explicit assessment of
   contamination by metal inclusions. The Re and Au content of demonstrably
   contaminant-free glasses increases with temperature, and shows variation
   with oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) similar to previous results, although lower
   valence states for Re (1+, 2+) are suggested by the data. At 2 GPa, and
   Delta IW of +1.75 to +2, the metal-silicate partition coefficient for Re
   (D-Met/Sil) is defined by the relation
   LogD(Met/Sil)(Re) = 0.50(+/- 0.022) x 10(4)/T(K)+3.73(+/- 0.095)
   For metal-silicate equilibrium to endow Earth's mantle with the observed
   time-integrated chondritic Re/Os, (and hence Os-187/Os-188), D-Met/Sil
   for both elements must converge to a common value. Combined with
   previously measured D-Met/Sil for Os, the estimated temperature at which
   this convergence occurs is 4500 (+/- 900) K. At this temperature,
   however, the Re and Os content of the equilibrated silicate is similar
   to 100-fold too low to explain mantle abundances. In the same
   experiments, much lower D-met/sil values have been determined for Au,
   and require the metal-silicate equilibration temperature to be <3200 K,
   as hotter conditions result in an excess of Au in the mantle. Thus, the
   large disparity in partitioning between Re or Os, and Au at core-forming
   temperatures argues against their mantle concentrations set solely by
   metal-silicate equilibrium at the base of a terrestrial magma ocean. (C)

Title = {Atractylis arbuscula Svent. \& Michaelis (Asteraceae): Two insular
   endemics from the Canary Islands with different conservation scenarios},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plants from arid environments can prevail with low fecundity, high
   survival and long lifespans. However, climate change may have an
   important impact on endangered species. In order to assess the effect of
   climatic fluctuations and change, we studied demographic processes in
   the narrow-range Canary Islands endemic Atractylis arbuscula Svent. \&
   Michaelis. It is considered a threatened taxon of arid ecosystems on the
   islands of Lanzarote (A. arbuscula ssp. arbuscula) and Gran Canaria (A.
   arbuscula ssp. schizogynophylla (Svent. and Kahne) Marrero Rodr. \&
   Caujape acute accent ). Monitoring was initiated in 2011 and conducted
   annually for six consecutive years to study population dynamics.
   Deterministic simulations showed that the population subjected to
   greater aridity (ssp. arbuscula) underwent an expansive trend. In
   contrast, the Gran Canaria population, presenting decline, seems not to
   benefit from higher annual precipitation. Spring precipitation is a good
   predictive variable that best explains the finite rate of population
   increase (lambda) variability, determining ``good years `` with wet
   springs and ``bad years `` with dry springs. With the climate
   projections for the 21st century of the spring precipitation for the
   stations closest to the studied populations, we obtained for each year
   of the period 2017-2100 a random vector that determines the probability
   with which each of the five matrices can be selected. The stochastic
   projections carried out reveal that ssp. arbuscula may experience a
   slight decline under two scenarios based on different Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP45 and RCP85, although the probability
   of extinction is zero in both. However, ssp. schizogynophylla could
   decline much faster, especially in scenario RCP85, reaching a 100\%
   probability of extinction by the end of the century. In conclusion, the
   population stability of ssp. arbuscula and its being included in a
   protected area of Lanzarote guarantees its conservation to a certain
   extent. However, the decline in ssp. schizogynophylla makes prompt
   conservation measures advisable on Gran Canaria.},

Abstract = {The influence of waves on the mean flow is derived on a rotating earth
   in the form of interaction stresses and a mass flux in the averaged
   momentum balance and mass conservation equations, respectively, using
   Hasselmann's formalism and keeping only the vertical component f of the
   Coriolis parameter. These stresses, easily computed from a spectral wave
   model, arise from both spatial gradients in the wave field and the
   bufferlike role of waves that store a small fraction of the air-sea
   momentum flux in the initial growth stages ( young seas) and restore
   this momentum to the mean currents, atmosphere, or solid earth when wave
   energy is dissipated. The practical importance of these wave-induced
   stresses on the depth-integrated mean circulation is evaluated from
   wind-wave growth curves and a third-generation spectral wave model. In
   steady conditions, waves are shown to induce stresses opposed to the
   wind stress for wave growth stages that may represent up to 10\% of the
   wind stress for short fetches. Assuming simple mean flow responses,
   wave-induced stresses shall translate into mean sea level variations,
   which are typically less than 1 mm in the middle of ocean basins but are
   much larger and significant in shallow areas like continental shelves.
   The present formulation is consistent with previous studies on
   wave-driven inertial oscillations and nearshore circulation, cases for
   which wave effects are known to be much stronger.},

Abstract = {Particle size characterizations of beach sediments along Tamil Nadu
   coast was carried out in the present study. The main objective of this
   work is to identify the textural behaviour of beach sediments and how
   wave energy correlates with grain size distribution. To achieve this
   goal tri-plot analysis was performed. Grain size characteristics such as
   central tendency, kurtosis and skewness were estimated using an updated
   version of the GRADISTAT programme and discussed in this paper. The
   highest sediment samples having medium sand with unimodal and bimodal
   characters at all along the coast. The entire coastal area was
   characterized as well sorted, moderately well sorted and moderately
   sorted sediment environments. Sediments were identified as fine skewed
   to coarse skewed with platykurtic, mesokurtic and leptokurtic
   characters. Grain characteristics varied spatially and temporally along
   with beach orientation, foreshore slope withwave action and skewness

Title = {Sustainable use of mangroves as sources of valuable medicinal compounds:
   Species identification, propagation and secondary metabolite composition},

Volume = {121},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mangroves are able to withstand a number of stress factors, such as high
   salt concentrations, tidal flooding, strong wind, solar radiation and
   heat. Their ability to grow under these circumstances is based on
   morphological and physiological adaptations, among them the high
   abundance of plant secondary metabolites. We are interested to
   investigate and exploit their medicinal and biotechnological potential
   for new bioactive compounds, without collecting material in the
   countries of origin and in a sustainable way. Therefore, a simple
   identification system based on molecular marker analysis, and a
   sustainable greenhouse propagation protocol for the continuous supply of
   fresh plant material, were established. DNA barcoding of the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) including ITS1, the 5.8S rRNA region and ITS2
   as a molecular marker was applied for several mangrove species. The
   obtained data and GenBank sequences were used for species
   identification. Three mangrove species are cultivated in our greenhouse
   and propagated in different ways: Avicennia species produced many
   propagules in the greenhouse, however, further propagation by cuttings
   was not successful. Laguncularia racemosa was propagated by cuttings in
   a fog house whereas Bruguiera cylindrica was difficult to cultivate and
   propagation was not successful. Finally, the concentration of secondary
   phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, and the content of major
   elements were compared among naturally and greenhouse-grown mangroves
   indicating comparable amounts and composition. (C) 2018 SAAB. Published

Abstract = {Log-log plots of measured organic carbon-normalized sediment pore-water
   distribution coefficients (K'(OC)s) for several polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) versus their octanol-water partition coefficients
   (K'(OW)s) at two sites in the Elizabeth River, Virginia, show large
   deviations from linearity. Organic-carbon normalized distribution
   coefficients for these PAHs between sediments and pore waters decreased
   by more than two orders of magnitude with depth as well. To determine to
   what extent pore water dissolved and colloidal organic carbon (DOC) was
   responsible for the observed nonlinearity and decrease in K'(OC), a
   three-phase model was used to estimate pore-water PAH-DOC binding
   coefficients (K-DOC). Partitioning of PAHs to pore-water DOC (i.e.,
   K-DOC) enhances the observed ``dissolved{''} phase PAH concentration,
   especially for high-K-OW compounds, contributing to the nonlinearity in
   K'(OC)-K-OW plots. However, our application of the three-phase
   partitioning model to these data indicate that, at most, pore-water
   PAH-DOC binding accounts for one order of magnitude of the observed
   decrease in K'(OC) with depth in the sediment bed. The results of this
   study are consistent with three-phase partitioning theory for
   hydrophobic organic compounds between sediment organic matter,
   pore-water DOC, and freely dissolved aqueous phases in natural systems.},

Title = {A method for detecting and monitoring changes to the Okotoks Erratic -
   ``Big Rock{''} provincial historic site},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose Designing and implementing effective strategies for managing
   heritage resources throughout the world has become critically important
   as the impacts of climate change and human-caused destruction are
   increasingly felt. Of particular importance is the ability to identify
   and track fast- and slow-moving processes associated with weathering,
   erosion and the movement or removal of heritage objects by natural and
   human agents. In this paper, the authors demonstrate how 3D laser
   scanning can be used to detect and monitor changes to the Okotoks
   Erratic ``Big Rock{''} Provincial Historic Resource in Alberta, Canada,
   over a period of 7 years. Design/methodology/approach Terrestrial laser
   scanning surveys of the Okotoks Erratic ``Big Rock{''} Provincial
   Historic Resource were undertaken in 2013, 2016 and 2020. Registration
   was used to place the three epochs of point clouds into a unique datum
   for comparison using the cloud-to-cloud distance function in Cloud
   Compare. Findings The movement/repositioning of rocks around the base of
   the erratic, the emergence of ``unofficial{''} paths and changes to
   interpretive trails and fencing were all identified at the site over the
   time period of the study. Practical implications Current conservation at
   the Okotoks Big Rock focus primarily on the rock art panels that are
   scattered over the erratic. The results of this study indicate they
   should be broadened so that the geological integrity of the site, which
   is intrinsically linked to its cultural value, can also be maintained.
   Originality/value This is the first study the authors are aware of that
   utilizes terrestrial laser scanning + change detection analysis to
   identify and track changes to a heritage site over a period as long as 7
   years.},

Title = {Travel Time Evaluation of a U-Turn Facility Comparison with a
   Conventional Signalized Intersection},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2011},
Number = {2223},
Pages = {26-33},
Abstract = {Drivers on high-volume arterials with signalized intersections often
   face congestion during peak hours. This congestion, primarily through
   movement, decreases the traffic performance of the intersection. The
   primary delay at conventional intersections is caused by interactions
   between high left-turn movements and the opposing through maneuvers.
   Unconventional intersection designs have been proposed to decrease
   intersection delay and travel time, for example, by redirecting left
   turns from the minor approach away from the main intersection and
   replacing them with a right turn followed by U-turn. The U-turn
   intersection investigated in this study is geometrically designed with a
   raised island, which provides a protected U-turn movement. Several
   scenarios with different distances between the U-turn facility and the
   intersection, traffic volume on major and minor approaches, and
   percentage of left-turn volumes were simulated by using AIMSUN (Advanced
   Interactive Microscopic Simulator for Urban and Non-Urban Networks)
   software. Models were created to predict travel time for each movement
   at the intersection and were validated against data collected from a
   number of U-turn facilities. With these models, it was possible to
   calculate travel time of each movement within boundaries of geometric
   features and traffic conditions indicated in this study. Finally, by
   comparison of the travel time of a conventional signalized intersection
   with that of a U-turn facility, an objective criterion was obtained for
   use in deciding on the possible conversion of a signalized intersection
   into this new kind of U-turn facility. According to the results of this
   comparison, this type of U-turn facility generally produces lower travel
   time. Thus, evaluation of using this type of unconventional intersection
   should be seriously considered.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Vargas and collaborators (Vargas et al., 2018), therein V2018, reported
   measurements of pH, total alkalinity (A(T)), dissolved inorganic carbon
   (C-T), dissolved oxygen (DO) and other hydrographic variables along a
   portion of the Strait of Magellan and associated fjords during the
   spring of 2010. Using the measured values of A(T) and pH to calculate
   the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), they showed that DO supersaturated
   waters in the upper 50 m depth were often associated with pCO(2) higher
   than atmospheric CO2 levels. Here we show that this anomalous pattern
   arises because V2018's carbonate system parameters were apparently
   incorrectly calculated, resulting in positively biased pCO(2) values.
   A(T) measurements in this layer were often higher than the marine
   end-member, which could indicate an additional source of bias. Biased
   carbonate system parameters used by V2018 imply a sub-estimation of the
   capacity of CO2 uptake, with important consequences for local capacity
   to modulate the potential deleterious effects of freshening and ocean
   acidification on fjord biota. The critical analysis of the global
   sources of uncertainty in carbonate-system parameters, and evaluation of
   internal and external consistency (i.e., with complementary hydrographic
   information or with previous reports), are necessary to detect bias, and
   generate data with sufficient quality to study the effect of ocean
   acidification on marine ecosystems (GOA-ON, 2019).},

Title = {A review of the potential of surface flow constructed wetlands to

Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {692},

Abstract = {Integrated Constructed Wetlands (ICWs) constitute an alternative way of
   cleansing water in agricultural areas to conventional water treatment
   plants. These pond systems integrate their water treatment capabilities
   with other functions such as biodiversity enhancement, carbon
   sequestration and landscape fit, by virtue of mimicking natural
   wetlands. ICWs have shown to have potential to enhance macroinvertebrate
   diversity in agricultural areas due to their unique design flexibility.
   We suggest that ICWs characterised by adequate shore sloping and
   presence of complex habitat mosaics, as well as other design
   considerations, would maximise the potential of these systems to enhance
   macroinvertebrate diversity. In addition, it would be highly beneficial
   to increase the total ICW area and to increase the total number of ponds
   in a system accordingly from a minimum of four to at least five. This
   article also highlights the need not only to develop policies that focus
   on the creation of ICWs but also to foster a number of management
   practices that rely on the active involvement of farmers. The inclusion
   of additional ponds in selected ICW systems could be the means to inform
   local communities as to the importance, attractiveness and conservation
   value of ponds.},

Title = {A Scenario Analysis of Solar Photovoltaic Grid Parity in the Maldives:
   The Case of Malahini Resort},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Maldives, one of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) with
   great solar potential, is keen to promote renewable energy systems to
   reduce its heavy reliance on imported diesel for power generation.
   However, adopting renewable energy systems is still burdensome for the
   Maldives not only because of its high initial costs and insufficient
   financial resources but also because of a lack of understanding about
   whether the deployment of a renewable system is economically feasible.
   Therefore, the concept of grid parity is explored as an important
   concept in this paper to examine the possible timeframe for reaching it.
   A distinctive feature of the paper is that the paper used actual cost
   and technical information to analyze the levelized cost of energy
   (LCOEs) of the independent renewable system in a remote island and
   examined its timeframe for reaching the grid parity condition. Based on
   economic and technical information from a project for replacing existing
   diesel generator to photovoltaic (PV) with energy storage system (ESS)
   in Kuda Bandos Island in the Maldives, the paper considers three
   different system configurations and evaluates which configuration could
   result in the most optimal off-grid energy systems in this remote
   island. With sensitivity analysis on various uncertainties, the paper
   shows the range of the levelized costs of energy and the periods
   required for reaching grid parity for deploying solar photovoltaics and
   ESSs in Kuda Bandos Island, Maldives. The result indicates that the
   photovoltaic system is an economically feasible option for the resort,
   and that grid parity can be reached within the project lifetime.
   However, the result shows that the use of advanced ESSs is still an
   expensive option and would not be economically reasonable.},

Title = {Quantification of sedimentary black carbon using the chemothermal
   oxidation method: an evaluation of ex situ pretreatments and standard
   additions approaches},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {2},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The highly condensed products and residues of incomplete combustion of
   biomass and fossil fuel termed black carbon ( BC) partake in a multitude
   of important geochemical processes. However, ambiguity persists because
   different quantification methods give highly variable results, leaving
   it unclear whether this reflects method difficulties or that different
   methods simply mirror different parts of the BC spectrum. Introducing
   additional wet chemical ex situ pretreatment steps (Gelinas et al.
   2001b), to a commonly applied chemothermal oxidation (CTO) method led to
   large handling and transfer losses of hydrophobic diesel-soot BC (NIST
   SRM-2975). The resulting yield of soot BC spiked to a coastal marine and
   a freshwater sediment was only 6 +/- 1\% and 70 +/- 4\%, respectively,
   for the entire ex situ procedure. Instead, a standard addition approach
   yielded statistically significant linear returns of incremental soot BC
   additions. The slopes suggested that 51 +/- 6\% and 78 +/- 6\% of the
   added soot BC was accounted for in the marine and freshwater sediment,
   respectively. The lower recovery of soot BC in the marine sediment is
   likely caused by chloride enhancing the contact between BC surfaces and
   mineral oxides, catalyzing the BC oxidation. A consequential lowering of
   the oxidation energy from 375 degreesC to 360 degreesC resulted in
   increased soot BC yields of 75 +/- 7\% and 97 +/- 3\% in the marine and
   freshwater sediments, respectively. The standard addition approach
   suggests a native ``soot BC-like{''} concentration of 0.48 mg BC/g dry
   weight ( soot BC/total organic carbon = 0.03) in the bioturbated marine
   sediment from Kosterfjord, Skagerrak and 6.2 mg BC/g dry weight ( soot
   BC/TOC = 0.10) in the heavily polluted Rhine River sediment.},

Title = {Sea spray influences water chemical composition of Mediterranean semi
   natural springs},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {414-423},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sea spray aerosol (SSA) is responsible for the large-scale transfer of
   particles from the sea to the land, leading to significant deposition of
   a range of ions, predominantly Na+ K+, Ca2+, and Cl-. Up to now, there
   has been little research into the effects of SSA on spring water
   chemistry. Therefore, we sampled 303 semi-natural springs across
   Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula) and analysed the concentrations of 20
   different ions and elements, and determined the impact of SSA (using
   distance to the coast as a proxy) as well as climate, lithology and
   human disturbances. We found that distance to the coast had a clear
   effect on the water chemical composition of springs, while accounting
   for potentially confounding factors such as anthropogenic water
   pollution (nitrate, NO3-), differences in lithology and annual rainfall.
   Our results showed that springs located closer to the coast had higher
   Cl-, SO42-, Na+ Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ concentrations than those of springs
   located further away. Precipitation was generally negatively correlated
   with the concentration of almost all elements analysed. The
   concentration of NO3- increased with distance to the coast, concurrently
   with farming activities, located mainly inland in the study area. These
   results demonstrate that SSA has an important effect on the groundwater
   of coastal zones, up to a distance of around 70 km from the coastline.
   This analysis reveals the main natural and human processes that
   influence spring water chemistry in this Mediterranean region,
   information that could be helpful in similar regions for ecological
   studies, water quality policies, and for the improvement of predictions
   in the current context of global change.},

Abstract = {Deltaic landscapes, such as the Mississippi River Delta, are sites of
   extensive conversion of wetlands to open water, where increased fetch
   may contribute to erosion of marsh edges, increasing wetland loss. A
   field experiment conducted during a storm passage tested this process
   through the observations of wave orbital and current velocities in the
   fringe zone of a deteriorating saltmarsh in Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana.
   Incident waves seaward of the marsh edge and wave orbital and current
   velocities immediate landward of the marsh edge were measured. Through a
   dimensional analysis, it shows that the current and orbital velocities
   in the marsh fringe were controlled by the incident waves, inundation
   depth, submergence ratio, and vegetation density. Similarly, it is shown
   that the longshore currents in the inundated saltmarsh fringe depended
   on the local wave-induced momentum flux, vegetation submergence, and
   vegetation density in the fringe zone. The cross-shore current showed
   the presence of a return flow in the lower region of the velocity
   profile. A high correlation between the current direction and the local
   flow-wave energy ratio as well as the vegetation submergence and density
   is found, indicating the important role of surface waves in the fringe
   flow landward of an inundated wetland under storm conditions. The field
   observations shed light on the potential ecological consequences of
   increased wave activities in coastal saltmarsh wetlands owing to
   subsidence, sea level rise, limited sediment supply, increases in wind
   fetch, and storm intensity.},

Abstract = {This study explores the management of a system of multiple
   interconnected microgrids in a loop configuration. To facilitate
   renewable integration and reduce the cost of operation, an economic
   dispatch model of the distributed energy resources (DER) with dynamic
   update of the states of the energy storage systems (ESS) to handle the
   forecasting error in the photovoltaic (PV) power output is developed. By
   simulating the economic dispatch of DER for various PV output profiles,
   the minimum size of ESS required in a microgrid can be determined. The
   sizing and placement of ESS in a loop configuration, be it one ESS for
   each individual microgrid or one ESS for the whole interconnected
   system, are also explored. The case study conducted found that the total
   capacity of the ESS for the interconnected microgrids in a loop
   configuration with a single shared ESS is smaller than that for the loop
   configuration with individual ESS, which is in turn smaller than that
   for the islanded mode.},

Title = {Flexible reproductive timing can buffer reproductive success of
   Pygoscelis spp. penguins in the Antarctic Peninsula region},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {454},
Pages = {91-104},
Abstract = {Varying the timing of reproduction in response to local environmental
   conditions is a key factor influencing reproductive success. We used 19
   yr (1991 to 2009) of data on breeding chronology and reproductive
   success of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae and gentoo penguins P.
   papua at King George Island, Antarctica to compare clutch initiation
   dates (CIDs), hatch rates, and creche rates at population and individual
   levels. The CIDs of both species occurred earlier with warmer October
   temperatures, but gentoo penguins adjusted CIDs twice as much per C of
   temperature as Adelie penguins. Gentoo penguins also exhibited lower
   variances in hatch and creche rates than Adelie penguins, suggesting
   that greater ability to respond to ambient conditions can buffer
   reproductive success. Mixed-effects models revealed that individual-and
   year-specific random effects on the overall population mean best
   accounted for observed variation in CIDs, with some individuals
   routinely breeding earlier than others. However, individual differences
   in the relative timing of breeding provided no advantage for long-term
   reproductive success. The results suggest that, among gentoo and Adelie
   penguins, plasticity in CIDs with respect to environmental conditions is
   primarily a population-level rather than an individual-level response.
   Energetic constraints of contrasting migratory and fasting behaviors
   likely contribute to the different abilities to respond to warming
   spring temperatures. Overall, larger responses of gentoo penguin CIDs to
   October temperature and lower variability in reproductive success,
   despite reduced reproductive success with delayed breeding, suggests
   that gentoo penguins are better equipped than Adelie penguins to adjust
   to rapid warming in the Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem.},

Abstract = {From 1928 to 1991 the following oligochaete energy budget quantitative
   values: biomass (B), production (P), respiration (R), assimilation (A),
   ration (C) changed 8 to 12 times. With increasing depth the ratios of
   energy budget decreased: P/B ratio from 3.4 to 0.1, R/B ratio from 4.5
   to 0.5, net production efficiency from 43 to 18\%. A relationship was
   revealed between oligochaete biomass and the primary production (PP) of
   the lake. There is a delay in the response in oligochaete biomass to
   primary production. In Lake Sevan the `delay' is 2 years in the
   littoral, 4 years in the sublittoral and 11 years in the profundal zone.
   The closest correlation was revealed between oligochaete energy budget
   quantitative values and the values of primary production of the
   preceding 10 years, which enables a prediction of the quantitative
   indices of the community of Oligochaeta. The values of energy budget
   ratios depend on temperature and oxygen regimes but not on the trophic
   status of the reservoir and were comparatively stable during the
   observed period.},

Abstract = {PetroChina, Sinopec, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC)
   have been prominent instruments used by the Chinese government in its
   policies to ensure greater security of oil and gas supply in the face of
   growing domestic shortages. Chinese overseas acquisitions and activities
   have diversified, with a greater emphasis on offshore, gas and the
   Americas. Both parent and listed daughter companies are run by
   CCP-appointed managers who have to balance political and commercial
   goals. Their lacklustre financial performance can be attributed to
   domestic and institutional constraints, such as state-set social goals,
   low pricing, and government controls over their monopolies. Not only
   have state companies sustained losses from refining activities, but
   financing their rapid expansion has also increased their debts and
   dependency on the government. Cases of corruption have further weakened
   their political influence. Longterm supply contracts have made a greater
   contribution to the security of energy supply as compared with equity
   oil and gas. Nationalistic preferences for investment over trade
   increase company risks but are somewhat mitigated by an integral
   economic package approach and political backing in weak countries.
   Recent policies to reduce monopoly power are unlikely to produce viable
   commercial alternatives, but may increase the focus on listed daughter
   companies, overseas assets and international trading. Because of these
   developments and the recent fall in oil prices, a better evaluation of
   political and economic risks is required.},

Title = {Urban dew and rain in Paris, France: Occurrence and physico-chemical
   characteristics},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {189},
Pages = {152-161},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {This paper summarizes one year (April 2011 to March 2012) measurements
   on planar condensing surfaces of dew and rain events and related
   physico-chemical characteristics in the urban environment of Paris (city
   center). Yearly collected water was 3.48 mm for dew (63 events) and 593
   mm for rain (146 events). The latter value compares well with rain data
   (547 mm and 107 events) collected within 12 km at Paris-Orly airport. An
   estimation of dew yield based on meteo data gives 235 mm and 74 events,
   to be compared with 17.11 mm and 196 events at Paris-Orly. These
   differences highlight the large reduction in dew events and dew yields
   in an urban area as compared to a close rural-like area. This reduction
   is not due to a sky view reduction but to heat island that increases air
   temperature and decreases relative humidity.
   Analysis of dew (34) and rain (77) samples were done concerning pH,
   electrical conductivity (EC), major anions and cations as well as
   selected trace metals and other minor ions. Mean pH values are found
   similar for both, dew (6.5) and rain (6.1), rain being slightly more
   acidic than dew. The mean dew total ionic content (TIC 1.8 meq/I) and EC
   value (124 mu S/cm) are about four times that of rain (0.45 meq/I; 35 mu
   S/cm), meaning that total dissolved solids in dew is nearly four times
   that in rain. Sulfate and nitrate are the most acidifying components,
   calcium the most neutralizing constituent with ratio of mean total
   acidity/total alkalinity comparable for dew and rain (similar to 0.9).
   Sulfate and nitrate have mainly anthropogenic sources, whereas chloride
   and magnesium are mostly connected with marine air masses. Dew is a
   considerable factor of wet deposition of pollutants; dew and rain ion
   concentrations, however, meet the WHO requirements for drinking water.

Title = {Carbon emission from Western Siberian inland waters},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {High-latitude regions play a key role in the carbon (C) cycle and
   climate system. An important question is the degree of mobilization and
   atmospheric release of vast soil C stocks, partly stored in permafrost,
   with amplified warming of these regions. A fraction of this C is
   exported to inland waters and emitted to the atmosphere, yet these
   losses are poorly constrained and seldom accounted for in assessments of
   high-latitude C balances. This is particularly relevant for Western
   Siberia, with its extensive peatland C stocks, which can be strongly
   sensitive to the ongoing changes in climate. Here we quantify C emission
   from inland waters, including the Ob' River (Arctic's largest
   watershed), across all permafrost zones of Western Siberia. We show that
   the inland water C emission is high (0.08-0.10 Pg C yr(-1)) and of major
   significance in the regional C cycle, largely exceeding (7-9 times) C
   export to the Arctic Ocean and reaching nearly half (35-50\%) of the
   region's land C uptake. This important role of C emission from inland
   waters highlights the need for coupled land-water studies to understand
   the contemporary C cycle and its response to warming. Rivers and lakes
   are thought to be a major conduit of loss for the massive amounts of
   carbon locked away in high-latitude systems, but such losses are poorly
   constrained. Here the authors quantify carbon emissions from rivers and
   lakes across Western Siberia, finding that emissions are high and exceed
   carbon export to the Arctic Ocean.},

Title = {An evaluation of acid-base changes following aortic cross-clamping using

Journal = {PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {To investigate the cause of acidosis following release of an aortic
   cross-clamp, we measured tissue PCO2 using a transcutaneous (TC) CO2
   monitor placed below the level of the cross-clamp in 10 patients
   undergoing aortic arch surgery. Following placement of the aortic
   cross-clamp, the TC CO2 value from the lower extremity increased from 41
   +/- 4 to 92 +/- 41, whereas there was no change in the TC CO2 value from
   the upper extremity. With release of the cross-clamp, end-tidal CO2
   increased by 6.2 +/- 1.9 mmHg, the upper TC CO2 increased by 8.4 +/- 4.8
   mmHg, and the lower extremity TC CO2 value returned to baseline. During
   cross-clamping, there was an increase in the base deficit of 4.3 +/- 2.9
   when comparing the baseline arterial blood gas value with the one
   obtained after cross-clamp release (p = 0.0004). These data demonstrate
   that the acidosis occurring during aortic cross-clamping is a mixed
   metabolic and hypercarbic acidosis. Appropriate treatment includes the
   provision of adequate minute ventilation to ensure CO2 removal and the
   use of sodium bicarbonate based on the degree of metabolic acidosis
   demonstrated by arterial blood gas analysis.},

Title = {Effects of shoreline permafrost thaw on nutrient dynamics and diatom

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {In permafrost landscapes, ponds and lakes are ubiquitous and important
   features that support long-term carbon storage and diverse diatom
   communities. With climate warming, thermokarst lake expansion may modify
   the ability of these aquatic systems to maintain these functions, as a
   consequence of changes to nutrient inputs and cycling. A recent
   (2006-2008) thermokarst shoreline expansion event adjacent to small
   Frisbee Pond, in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada, presented an
   opportunity to evaluate the effects of thaw-driven disturbance on pond
   nutrient dynamics. A sediment core was collected in 2015 and analysed
   for diatom assemblage composition, total nutrient (carbon, nitrogen and
   phosphorus) accumulation rates, and stable isotopes of organic carbon
   (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15). Results indicate that recent
   shoreline expansion in this subarctic peatland pond caused an increase
   in total diatom accumulation, although shifts in diatom community
   composition were initiated prior to the shoreline slump, particularly an
   increase in the relative abundance of Denticula kuetzingii. Nutrient
   accumulation rates in the sediment increased dramatically both prior to
   and following shoreline slumping, with isotope values indicating an
   increased supply of allochthonous carbon and atmospheric nitrogen.
   Investigations of hydroclimate conditions prior to the shoreline slump
   indicate warming of summer air temperatures and an increase in
   precipitation over the long-term mean, consistent with changing climate
   conditions that caused thermokarst disturbance in other permafrost
   environments. This study has important implications for understanding
   hydro-ecological responses of small surface water bodies to general
   climate forcing, in combination with rapid thermokarst shoreline
   expansion, under a changing climate.},

Abstract = {A free-surface semicircular breakwater (SCB) has been developed for
   protecting coastal and marine infrastructures against ocean waves. The
   hydrodynamic characteristics of the breakwater are investigated in
   irregular seas through an experimental program. A test model of the
   semicircular breakwater has been constructed with front wall porosity
   varied at 0 (i.e., no perforations), 9, 18, and 27\%. The wave surface
   elevations are measured at different locations upstream and downstream
   of the models, and the coefficients of wave transmission, reflection,
   and energy dissipation are evaluated. Wave climate in the vicinity of
   the breakwater models and horizontal wave force on them are also
   measured. On the basis of the measured data, empirical models are
   proposed to provide design formulas for wave transmission, wave
   reflection, and horizontal wave force. The proposed empirical models
   show good agreement with the measured data; however, sensible
   engineering judgment must be taken while using these because the
   equations proposed are based on small-scale laboratory tests. The
   overall results indicate that the impermeable SCB model is an effective
   wave reflector, and the permeable SCB models are good energy
   dissipaters. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)WW.1943-5460.0000116. (C) 2012 American

Title = {Impact of Three Bleaching Events on the Reef Resiliency of Kane'ohe Bay,
   Hawai'i},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching events have been increasing in frequency and severity
   worldwide. The most prolonged global bleaching event began in 2014 and
   continued into 2017 impacting more reefs than any previous occurrence.
   Here we present the results of coral bleaching and mortality surveys
   conducted in Kane'ohe Bay Oahu, Hawai'i and compare them to the only
   other widespread bleaching events to impact the main Hawaiian Islands in
   1996 and 2014. Results from these surveys along with associated
   environmental factors were used to compare these events to gain a
   baseline understanding of the physical processes that influence
   localized bleaching dynamics under these extreme environmental
   conditions. Survey results show extensive variation in bleaching
   (1996-62\%, 2014-45\%, 2015-30\%) and cumulative mortality (1996 <1\%,
   2014-13\%, 2015-22\%) between years. Bleaching prevalence was observed
   to decrease in certain reef areas across events, suggesting some
   acclimation and/or resilience, but possible increase susceptibility to
   mortality. Long-term monitoring sites show a similar temporal pattern of
   coral mortality and decline in coral cover, but revealed some reefs
   remained relatively un-impacted by consecutive high temperature events.
   Across the three bleaching events, we found that although circulation
   patterns can facilitate heating, the duration and magnitude of the high
   temperature event were the primary forcing functions for coral bleaching
   and mortality. Other localized primary drivers influencing water
   temperature such as irradiance, turbidity, and precipitation contributed
   to spatial variations. Recovery and resilience of this coral reef
   ecosystem is dependent on many factors including duration and magnitude
   of heating, resulting mortality levels, localized environmental factors
   in the bay, and coral species affected and their bleaching tolerances.},

Abstract = {Isla del Coco is the only oceanic island in the Eastern Pacific with
   humid tropical climate. Its forests have a particular structure with a
   unique array of plant species and high endemism. There are few studies
   on the flora or forest monitoring on the island. The population
   structure of Sacoglottis holdridgei was analyzed using data from six
   years with data points taken in 2006 and 2012, including sampling of
   regeneration in 2012. Sacoglottis holdridgei was the most important tree
   species, presenting in 2012 the highest Importance Value Index (190.7
   +/- 21.8), abundance (158.5 +/- 40.3 Nha(-1) or 39.5 \% of the forest)
   and basal area (15.6 m(2)ha(-1) or 72.9 \% of the forest). It was
   present in all three height strata with dominance in the highest. Annual
   mortality was reported at 3.3 \% and recruitment at 1.2 \%. The diameter
   distribution of forest fits the inverted J model, but not for the
   reported species of which only S. holdridgei tends to adjust for DBH>40
   cm. Regeneration fitted the inverted J model with values below those
   reported for continental forests. Even though it was the dominant
   species, S. holdridgei showed low regeneration values. This particular
   condition, give way hypotheses related to the introduction of species,
   species biology and climate change which could influence the future
   development of S. holdridgei and forests of Isla del Coco.},

Title = {Infragravity waves in the deep ocean: An upward revision},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {40},
Number = {13},
Pages = {3435-3439},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Ocean infragravity waves are surface gravity waves with periods of
   several minutes and corresponding wavelengths of up to tens of
   kilometers. When propagating freely in the deep ocean, these waves are
   typically small, several centimeters at most, so they have been seldom
   studied. In the context of future wide-swath altimetry missions, these
   waves need to be better quantified as they have wavelengths that will be
   resolved by such instruments. Here, we analyze the global climatology
   and variability of infragravity waves in the deep ocean using data from
   over 40 open ocean locations, with depths larger than 2000 m. We show
   that typical infragravity wave heights are higher than previously
   estimated, with winter-averaged values up to 11 mm off the U. S. West
   Coast, and typically less than 6 mm in the tropics. The mid to high
   latitudes exhibit a strong seasonal cycle consistent with the local
   variability of the wind-waves, while the tropical Pacific has a higher
   energy level during the Austral winter that does not correlate well with
   the local wind-waves, suggesting a remote source for the recorded
   infragravity waves. These infragravity wave energies are expected to be
   a significant contribution to the error budget for possible measurements
   of sea level associated to sub-mesoscale currents at horizontal scales
   around 10 km. Hence, a global numerical model of infragravity waves will
   likely be necessary for the analysis of the planned Surface Water Ocean
   Topography mission.},

Title = {Engaging with Users of Climate Information and the Coproduction of

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Within the realm of climate and environmental sciences, stakeholder
   engagement has traditionally been given a relative low priority in favor
   of generating tools, products, and services following the longstanding
   practice of pushing out information in the hopes users will pull it into
   their decision toolkits. However, the landscape is gradually shifting
   away from that paradigm and toward one in which the stakeholder
   community is more directly involved in the production of products and
   services with the scientific organization. This mutual learning
   arrangement, referred to as the coproduction of knowledge, has been
   applied to two user engagement activities within the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental
   Information (NCEI) and the NOAA Office of Coastal Management (OCM) Coral
   Reef Conservation Program (CRCP). The iterative nature of such dialogues
   helped scientists within NCEI and OCM to better understand user
   requirements and as a result generate climate information that was
   locally relevant and regionally applicable. The recent engagement
   activities exemplified the benefits of a robust and sustained
   relationship between climate scientists and the user community. They
   demonstrate that the interactions between the two led to the empowerment
   of the local community to shape and mold climate information products as
   well as further enhancing user buy in of these products and services
   with which local agriculture and food security, disaster risk reduction,
   energy, health, and water decisions are being made. This coproduction of
   knowledge model for user engagement activities also serves to build
   trust between the scientific and user communities.},

Abstract = {A 14weeks growth trial was performed to estimate the protein requirement
   for growth and maintenance of zebra sea bream (Diplodus cervinus)
   juveniles. For that purpose, nine isolipidic diets were formulated to
   contain increasing protein levels (from 50 to 550gkg(-1)) at the expense
   of carbohydrate. Each diet was assigned to duplicate groups of 20 fish,
   with an average body weight of 7.7g. Feed efficiency improved with
   dietary protein up to 400gkg(-1), no further differences being noticed
   at higher protein levels. Fish fed the 50gkg(-1) protein diet lost
   weight during the trial. In the other groups, weight gain improved as
   dietary protein increased up to 350-400gkg(-1). Fish fed diets with
   250gkg(-1) protein or lower had lower whole-body protein content than
   the other groups. A curvilinear-plateau model was used to adjust weight
   gain and protein gain (gkgABW(-1)day(-1)) to dietary protein levels.
   Based on that model, the optimum dietary protein requirement for maximum
   weight gain was estimated to be 437.6gkg(-1) and for maximum protein
   gain 461.9gkg(-1), corresponding to a protein intake of
   7.63gkgABW(-1)day(-1). Protein requirement for maintenance was estimated
   to be 1.01gkgABW(-1)day(-1).},

Title = {Ecosystem perspectives on management of disease in shrimp pond farming},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {191},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {145-161},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {This paper reviews and discusses, from an ecological perspective, the
   causes behind the development and spreading of pathogens in shrimp
   aquaculture. The risk of disease in shrimp fanning often increases with
   culture intensity and high stocking densities, and when polyculture is
   replaced by monoculture. High pond densities will facilitate the spread
   of pathogens between ponds. Shortage of clean water supply and
   insufficient waste removal lead to overloading of metabolites,
   environmental degradation, and to the shrimp becoming stressed by bad
   water quality, and thus more prone to becoming affected by disease.
   Excessive fluctuations in abiotic factors like oxygen, salinity, and
   temperature may also increase stress and susceptibility to disease. The
   location of farms in mangrove environments can lead to acidification
   that may directly, or indirectly, through release of heavy metals from
   the sediments, lower disease resistance. The use of hatchery-reared
   larvae will increase genetic uniformity and thus disease risk in
   comparison to the collection of wild larvae where selection has already
   favored the most viable individuals. Global and regional transportation
   of seed larvae and broodstock will facilitate the spread of pathogens.
   Apart from the above factors, which are all dependant on the farming
   itself, contamination by pesticides and pollutants from agriculture and
   industrial activities may lower disease resistance of the shrimp,
   especially if combined with other environmental factors.
   We show that shrimp farming is, to a large extent, dependent on
   ecological services supplied by nature, and discuss the carrying
   capacity of shrimp pond farming from an ecosystem perspective, including
   aspects like culture intensity, pond density and sustainability. Since
   aquaculture is basically a natural ecological process, although in
   intensive shrimp farming it reaches industrial proportions, it is
   essential that we do not forget the underlying ecological principles, as
   this may help us to understand and contribute to the solution of some of
   the disease problems faced by shrimp farming. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {The established human health benefits of carotenoids along with the
   contemporary consumption of natural carotenoids bring the necessity to
   sustainable production of carotenoids. Among, marine diatoms have
   emerged as the potential biological resources for carotenoid production;
   however, their relatively lower yield in native strains provides the
   impetus to genetically improve the diatoms to cope with the burgeoning
   demand. In this study, we genetically improved the diatom Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum by overexpressing key carotenogenic genes involved in
   methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. The genes with lower relative
   transcript level under optimum conditions such as CMK and CMS were
   selected and overexpressed in P. tricornutum individually. Both CMK and
   CMS overexpressing lines exhibited elevated growth and photosynthesis.
   The expression of key carotenogenic genes such as PSY, PDS, ZDS, CRT,
   and LCYB was significantly upregulated. Furthermore, total carotenoid
   content was significantly increased; particularly, fucoxanthin content
   was increased by 1.83- and 1.82-fold in engineered lines CMK and CMS,
   respectively. Together, the results identify the potential metabolic
   targets and also uncover the crucial role of MEP pathway in redirecting
   metabolic precursors towards carotenogenesis.},

   Superalloy at High Temperatures},
Journal = {METALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Inconel 625 alloys are widely applied for high-corrosion resistance and
   as high-efficiency materials in aeronautical, aerospace, chemical,
   nuclear, petrochemical, and marine industries. Although Inconel 625
   alloys are excellent materials, they cannot be formed at room
   temperature owing to difficulties in processing. To improve the
   formability of Inconel 625, it is necessary to investigate its
   formability at a high-temperature range and its strain rate variation.
   In this study, high-temperature deformation behavior after forming was
   investigated. A high-temperature compression test was performed with a
   Gleeble 3500 testing machine at various temperatures (approximately
   900-1200 degrees C) and strain rates (10 and 30 s(-1)) to obtain the
   high-temperature deformation characteristics of Inconel 625.
   Furthermore, high-temperature tensile tests were performed to measure
   elongations and reductions in the area of the Inconel 625 alloy. The
   tests focused on obtaining the flow stress data and optimal hot forging
   conditions under various strain rates and temperatures. The results of
   this research are expected to contribute to hot forming processes and to
   formability in hot extrusion and pilger processes.},

Title = {Depositional environments and facies of the Late Triassic Abu Ruweis
   Formation, Jordan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4-6},
Pages = {372-384},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The Abu Ruweis Formation is composed of carbonates, evaporites, and
   mudstones, with some locally developed pelletic, oolitic and
   stromatolitic limestones. The lateral persistence of bedding, the purity
   of the evaporite rocks, the alternating arrangement of marine carbonates
   and evaporites indicates periodic deposition in subaqueous conditions
   (salina). Petrographic investigations, X-ray diffraction analysis as
   well as chemical analysis have shown that the outcropping evaporite beds
   are mainly composed of secondary gypsum, with rare anhydrite relics.
   Five microfacies of gypsum were recognized according to their fabrics:
   porphyroblastic and granoblastic gypsum showing polarization texture,
   gypsum pseudomorph after anhydrite laths, and satin spar gypsum. The
   textures they display indicate a hydration origin of precursor
   anhydrite, which is in turn rehydrated from primary gypsum. Some of
   these anhydrites were formed as a result of replacement processes of the
   carbonate sediments associated with the evaporites, as evidenced from
   the textural relationships of the carbonate and sulfate minerals. The
   O-18 content ranges from 1.45 to 8.38\% PDB and the C-13 content ranges
   from -1.52 to 4.73\% PDB. Trace elements analysis has shown that the Abu
   Ruweis dolomites are rich in strontium (up to 600 ppm), and sodium (up
   to 835 ppm). The isotope composition and trace elements content, as well
   as the petrographic characteristics point to a penecontemporaneous
   hypersaline dolomitization origin for the Abu Ruweis dolomites. The
   evaporites were deposited during a regressive lowstand systems tract,
   whereas the carbonates were deposited under shallow water marine
   conditions during a highstand systems tract. The Abu Ruweis succession
   represents a relatively stable and climate within a rapidly subsiding
   basin. Restricted conditions were provided by the development of beach
   barriers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {417-426},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. Carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C(D)) Of a herbivorous zooplankter,
   Daphnia middendorfiana and several environmental variables were
   investigated during four annual production cycles (1988-92) in Smith
   Lake, Alaska to determine factors that affect the seasonal and
   interannual variability of delta(13)C(D).
   2. delta(13)C(D) varied from -44.7 to -31.5 ppt and was significantly
   correlated with Chi a (r = 0.66, P = 0.0001), weakly correlated with
   CO2(aq) (r = 0.31, P = 0.07) and uncorrelated with delta(13)C(DIC) (r =
   0.10, P = 0.70). Carbon isotope fractionation was minimal when Chi a
   appeared to be optimal. The largest C-13 fractionation was associated
   with the lowest Chi a during early and mid winter periods.
   3. delta(13)CD was also significantly correlated with water temperature
   (r = 0.480, P = 0.0001) and photoperiod (r = 0.62, P = 0.0001), probably
   suggesting a critical role of physical forcing, particularly solar
   energy input, in affecting algal photosynthesis and delta(13)C(D) in
   this subarctic lake.
   4. There was a large interannual variability of delta(13)C(D) among
   ice-cover periods which was partly explained by interwinter differences
   in the amount of snowfall that affected the flux of solar irradiance to
   the ice-covered lake.
   5. Other explanations for delta(13)CD variability such as species
   succession, changes in algal cell size and differential use of CO2(aq)
   and HCO3- were also considered, but cannot account for the observations
   reported here.},

Abstract = {Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are a cosmopolitan species but are
   only found in ice-free regions of the ocean. It is unknown how their
   distribution might change in regions undergoing rapid loss of sea ice
   and ocean warming like Baffin Bay in the eastern Canadian Arctic. In
   2014 and 2018, sperm whales were sighted near Eclipse Sound, Baffin Bay:
   the first recorded uses of this region by sperm whales. In this study,
   we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of sperm whales near
   Eclipse Sound using visual and acoustic data. We combine several
   published open-source, data sets to create a map of historical sperm
   whale presence in the region. We use passive acoustic data from two
   recording sites between 2015 and 2019 to investigate more recent
   presence in the region. We also analyze regional trends in sea ice
   concentration (SIC) dating back to 1901 and relate acoustic presence of
   sperm whales to the mean SIC near the recording sites. We found no
   records of sperm whale sightings near Eclipse Sound outside of the
   2014/2018 observations. Our acoustic data told a different story, with
   sperm whales recorded yearly from 2015 to 2019 with presence in the late
   summer and fall months. Sperm whale acoustic presence increased over the
   5-year study duration and was closely related to the minimum SIC each
   year. Sperm whales, like other cetaceans, are ecosystem sentinels, or
   indicators of ecosystem change. Increasing number of days with sperm
   whale presence in the Eclipse Sound region could indicate range
   expansion of sperm whales as a result of changes in sea ice. Monitoring
   climate change-induced range expansion in this region is important to
   understand how increasing presence of a top-predator might impact the
   Arctic food web.},

Abstract = {Quantifying freeze/thaw status of the landscape (soils and vegetation)
   is important for identifying the availability of liquid water in the
   high latitudes to support ecosystem processes controlling carbon
   sequestration and release. A better understanding of the seasonal
   transition of high latitude landscapes between frozen and thawed states
   is therefore critical for predicting carbon cycle feedbacks in a warming
   climate. However, observations of freeze/ thaw state are not at
   sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to observe fast (similar to
   days-weeks) transitions in highly heterogeneous regions. Here, we
   present new evidence that reflected Global Navigation Satellite System
   (GNSS) signals captured by the SMAP radar receiver have the potential to
   quantify changes in high-latitude soil freeze/thaw state at
   kilometer-scale resolution. Boreal wetland observations indicate a
   similar to 10 dB seasonal difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
   in agreement with simulations from a simple reflectivity model. Our
   analysis indicates that ground-reflected GNSS signals as a form of
   L-band bistatic radar could be a robust observable to quantify soil
   freeze/thaw state at process-relevant scales. We describe the caveats
   and potential limitations of this approach, and highlight areas for
   continuing research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {An automatic guided wave pulse position modulation system, using steel
   tubes as the communication channel, for detecting flooding in the hollow
   sub-sea structures of newly built offshore oilrigs is presented.
   Underwater close visual inspections (CVI) are normally conducted during
   swim-round surveys in pre-selected areas or areas suspected of damage.
   An acceptable alternative to CVI is a non-destructive testing (NDT)
   technique called flood member detection (FMD). Usually, this NDT
   technique employs ultrasound or x-rays to detect the presence of
   seawater in the tubular structures, requiring divers or remote operating
   vehicles (ROVs). The field-proven FMD technique, integrated within the
   concept of structural health monitoring, offers an alternative to these
   traditional inspection methods. The system employs two smart sensors and
   modulators, which transmit 40 kHz guided wave pulses, and a digital
   signal processing demodulator, which performs automatic detection of
   guided wave energy packets. Experiments were performed in dry
   conditions, inside and outside the laboratory; in the former using a
   steel tube 1.5 m x 0: 27 m x 2 mm, and in the latter using a tubular
   steel heliport structure approximately 15 m x 15 m in area and the base
   deck of an oilrig under construction. Results confirm that, although
   there was significant dispersion of the transmitted pulses, the system
   successfully distinguished automatically guided wave encoded information
   that could potentially be used in sub-sea oilrigs.},

Title = {Toward Eco-Friendly and Highly Efficient Solar Water Splitting Using

Abstract = {The TiO2-based heterojunction nanodendrite (ND) array composed of
   anatase nanoparticles (ANPs) on the surface of the rutile ND (RND) array
   is selected as the model photoanode to demonstrate the strategies toward
   eco-friendly and efficient solar water splitting using neutral
   electrolyte and seawater. Compared with the performances in alkaline
   electrolyte, a non-negligible potential drop across the electrolyte as
   well as impeded charge injection and charge separation is monitored in
   the ANP/RND array photoanode with neutral electrolyte, which are,
   respectively, ascribed to the series resistance of neutral electrolyte,
   the fundamentally pH-dependent water oxidation mechanism on TiO2
   surface, as well as the less band bending at the interface of TiO2 and
   neutral electrolyte. Accordingly, a TiO2-based dual-staggered
   heterojunction ND array photoanode is further designed in this work to
   overcome the issue of less band bending with the neutral electrolyte.
   The improvement of charge separation efficiency is realized by the
   deposition of a transparent In2S3 layer on the ANP/RND array photoanode
   for constructing additional staggered heterojunction. Under illumination
   of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm(-2)), the improved photocurrent densities acquired
   both in neutral electrolyte and seawater at 1.23 V vs reversible
   hydrogen electrode (RHE), which approach the theoretical value for
   rutile TiO2, are demonstrated in the dual-staggered-heterojunction ND
   array photoanode. Faradaic efficiencies of similar to 95 and similar to
   32\% for solar water oxidation in neutral electrolyte and solar seawater
   oxidation for 2 h are acquired at 1.23 V vs RHE, respectively.},

Title = {Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias) recovery potential under different
   environment and fishery scenarios},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {266},

Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the most significant fishery
   targets in northern seas. The cod occurs also in the brackish Baltic
   Sea, where besides fishing, several abiotic and biotic factors have a
   strong effect on their population dynamics. All cod stocks have
   diminished simultaneously due to heavy exploitation. Maintaining a
   sustainable fishery requires sufficient understanding of the recovery
   process and adequately tailored management plans. In marine habitats,
   temporal environmental fluctuations are often positively autocorrelated.
   Yet the temporal autocorrelation is often disregarded in models
   estimating fishery stock dynamics. For the Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus
   morhua callarias), the main environmental factors are water salinity and
   oxygen concentrations, which determine species distribution and
   reproductive success. The Baltic Sea's oceanographic characteristics
   make the ecosystem sensitive and climate change is expected to convert
   the type and magnitude of environmental fluctuations. This could
   potentially lead to inaccurate stock estimation and requires
   reassessment for any management strategy. We analyzed the recovery
   potential of the Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias) under
   different fishery and environmental scenarios. Our results illustrate
   how the unpredictability of stock size, catch, and recovery increase
   with increasing environmental autocorrelation. Under current
   environmental conditions and threshold methods fishing is at sustainable
   level. However, under more radical environmental fluctuations, like
   global warming, the estimation of cod population recovery becomes more
   difficult. Moreover, the precautionary fishing methods are important for
   population recovery by ensuring more sustainable fishing and preventing
   stock collapses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The composition, biomass, feeding and predation impact of carnivorous
   macrozooplankton (>2cm) on mesozooplankton (0.2-2cm) in the
   sub-Antarctic waters of the southwest Indian Ocean were investigated at
   19 stations in austral autumn (April/May) 1998. Zooplankton abundances
   and biomass ranged from 6.9 to 95.2 ind m(-3) and between 1.8 and 18.1mg
   Dwt m(-3), respectively. Throughout the investigation, mesozooplankton
   comprising mainly copepods numerically and by biomass dominated net
   samples. Among the copepods, Calanus simillimus, Clausocalanus brevipes,
   Ctenocalanus vanus, and Oithona spp. dominated. The carnivore component
   of the macrozooplankton consisted mainly of five groups: decapods,
   amphipods, chaetognaths, euphausiids and gelatinous zooplankton. Among
   these, chaetognaths (Eukrohnia hamata and Sagitta gazellae) and
   euphausiids (Nematoscelis megalops and Euphausia longirostris) were the
   most prominent. Collectively, the carnivorous macrozooplankton comprised
   between 11\% and 72\% of total zooplankton biomass. Total predation
   impact of the carnivorous macrozooplankton varied considerably but
   generally accounted for <5\% (range 0.7-44\%) of the total
   mesozooplankton standing stock. Tentative calculations suggest that
   carnivorous macrozooplankton may contribute, via vertical migrations and
   production of fast sinking faecal pellets, to a downward flux of carbon
   equivalent to up to 9\% of the total mesozooplankton stock per day
   within the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. As a consequence, carnivorous
   macrozooplankton may increase the localised efficiency of the biological
   pump. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Tropical Atlantic Cooling and Freshening in the Middle of the Last
   Interglacial From Coral Proxy Records},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Pages = {8289-8299},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {The last interglacial (LIG; Marine Isotope Substage 5e, similar to
   127-117 ka) experienced globally warmer than modern temperatures;
   however, profound differences in regional climate occurred that are
   relevant to the assessment of future climate change scenarios. Tropical
   Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) and hydrology are intrinsic to
   the spatiotemporal evolution of past and future climate. We present
   eight monthly resolved coral Sr/Ca and delta O-18 records (130-118 ka)
   to reconstruct mean western tropical Atlantic SST and seawater delta
   O-18 changes during the LIG. Cooler and fresher than modern surface
   waters are indicated for the middle of the LIG at similar to 126 ka.
   This was followed by a rapid transition to modern-like SSTs and
   salinities that characterized the remaining part of the LIG. Our
   results, which account for differences found among corals, proxies, and
   SST calibration uncertainties, agree with western tropical Atlantic
   sediment records. Together, they suggest that an oceanic regime existed
   that differed from today.
   Plain Language Summary The last interglacial is a period of time that
   occurred approximately similar to 127 to 117 thousand years ago and
   experienced globally warmer than modern temperatures, similar to those
   predicted by computer simulations of future climate change. However,
   little is known about the temperature and hydrology of the tropical
   oceans at this time. We analyzed fossil Caribbean corals that lived
   between 130 and 118 thousand years ago and record within their
   structures the properties of the seawater they inhabited. From these we
   reconstructed snapshots of past mean sea surface temperatures and the
   changing influences of regional ocean currents. Surprisingly, we found
   cooler and fresher than modern surface waters occurred within the
   tropical Atlantic at similar to 126 thousand years ago, a time usually
   associated with peak global warming. These anomalous conditions were
   followed by a rapid transition to modern-like sea surface temperatures
   and salinities that went on to define the remaining part of the LIG
   until similar to 118 ka. Our results agree with other reconstructions of
   last interglacial climate derived from tropical Atlantic sediment
   records. Together, they suggest changes in ocean currents that transport
   waters into the Caribbean and we highlight the complementary use of
   widely different marine archives to assess past climate change.},

Volume = {71},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2618-2633},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be an important mechanism for
   adapting to environmental heterogeneity. Nonetheless, the genetic basis
   of plasticity is still not well understood. In Drosophila melanogaster
   and D. simulans, body size and thermal stress resistance show clinal
   patterns along the east coast of Australia, and exhibit plastic
   responses to different developmental temperatures. The genetic basis of
   thermal plasticity, and whether the genetic effects underlying clinal
   variation in traits and their plasticity are similar, remains unknown.
   Here, we use line-cross analyses between a tropical and temperate
   population of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans developed at three
   constant temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 29 degrees C) to
   investigate the quantitative genetic basis of clinal divergence in mean
   thermal response (elevation) and plasticity (slope and curvature) for
   thermal stress and body size traits. Generally, the genetic effects
   underlying divergence in mean response and plasticity differed,
   suggesting that different genetic models may be required to understand
   the evolution of trait means and plasticity. Furthermore, our results
   suggest that nonadditive genetic effects, in particular epistasis, may
   commonly underlie plastic responses, indicating that current models that
   ignore epistasis may be insufficient to understand and predict
   evolutionary responses to environmental change.},

Abstract = {Continuous cultures in which a high-pressure chemostat was used were
   employed to study the growth responses of (i) deep-sea microbial
   populations with the naturally occurring carbon available in seawater
   and with limiting concentrations of supplemental organic substrates and
   (ii) pure cultures of copiotrophic barophilic and barotolerant deep-sea
   isolates in the presence of limiting carbon concentrations at various
   pressures, dilution rates, and temperatures. We found that the growth
   rates of natural populations could not be measured or were extremely low
   (e.g,, a doubling time of 629 h), as determined from the difference
   between the dilution rate and the washout rate. A low concentration of
   supplemental carbon (0.33 mg/liter) resulted in positive growth
   responses in the natural population, which resulted in an increase in
   the number of cells and eventually a steady population of cells. We
   found that the growth responses to imposed growth pressure by barophilic
   and barotolerant pure-culture isolates that were previously isolated and
   characterized under high-nutrient-concentration conditions were
   maintained under the low-nutrient-concentration limiting conditions
   (0.33 to 3.33 mg of C per liter) characteristic of the deep-sea
   environment. Our results indicate that deep-sea microbes can respond to
   small changes in substrate availability. Also, barophilic microbes that
   are copiotrophic as determined by their isolation in the presence of
   high carbon concentrations and their preference for high carbon
   concentrations are versatile and are able to compete and grow as
   barophiles in the low-carbon-concentration oligotrophic deep-sea
   environment in which they normally exist.},

Title = {Sustainable management of two-directional lateral and upconing saltwater
   intrusion in coastline aquifers to alleviate water scarcity},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Lateral saltwater intrusion (LSWI) and vertical saltwater intrusion
   (VSWI) are the major problems in coastal aquifers. Coastal aquifers are
   subjected to natural and artificial changes, including sea-level rise,
   decreasing inland recharge, and overexploitation of production wells'
   water resources. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of
   changing the coastal aquifers boundary conditions considering climate
   changes' effect. Parameters describing the upward saline well parameters
   based on the abstraction conditions, also, the top layer properties were
   studied based on the erosion and sediments, irrigation, and drainage
   conditions. For this purpose, the SEAWAT model was employed to simulate
   lateral SWI based on Henry's problem principle. The sensitivity analysis
   of the mentioned parameters was accomplished considering as a case study
   the Biscayne aquifer in the Cutler Ridge area near Deering Estate,
   Florida, USA, where the LSWI and VSWI were also investigated. The
   results indicate that the boundary conditions, abstraction well
   parameters, and top layer cost significantly impact aquifer LSWI and
   water upconing. The simulation results of the Biscayne aquifer for a
   saline water head of 84.86 cm for 2060 indicate a decrease in freshwater
   recharge by 30\% and increasing the saltwater concentration by 14.30\%.
   At the same time, the LSWI increased by 3.30\%, 22.80\%, and 8.70\%,
   while the relative upconing heights reached 0.63, 0.60, and 0.47
   compared with 0.42 for the current situation. Increasing the upward
   saline abstraction well discharge rates by 50\% increases the LSWI by
   9.40\%. In contrast, increasing the depth by 10\%; decreases the
   distance by 30\%, the screen length by 30\%, the LSWI decreased by
   1.80\%, 25.10\%, and 1.30\%, respectively. At the same time, the
   relative VSWI height reached 0.60, 0.39, 0.48, and 0.40, respectively.
   Moreover, decreasing the top layer hydraulic conductivity by 25\% and
   increasing the aquitards layer depths by 200\% decreased the LSWI by
   4.90\% and 7.80\%, respectively. At the same time, the relative VSWI
   height reached 0.34 and 0.30, respectively. In addition, the saline
   water heads, a freshwater recharge should be controlled to manage SWI;
   the upward well should be utilized at a low abstraction rate, far from
   the seaside, and with minimum screen length. The agriculture activity
   for decreasing the soil permeability for the top layer must be extended
   for better management of the SWI. The solution-oriented findings
   resulting from this study might be useful for decision-makers and
   engineers to develop effective management measures to tackle the SWI
   issue in coastal aquifers.},

Title = {Ocean acidification state variability of the Atlantic Arctic Ocean
   around northern Svalbard},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {199},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Svalbard shelf and Atlantic Arctic Ocean are a transition zone
   between northward flowing Atlantic Water and ice-covered waters of the
   Arctic. Effects of regional ocean warming, sea ice loss and greater
   influence of Atlantic Water or ``Atlantification{''} on the state of
   ocean acidification, i.e. calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation (O) are
   yet to be fully understood. Anomalies in surface layer Omega for the
   climatically-vulnerable CaCO3 mineral aragonite (Delta Omega) were
   determined by considering the variability in Omega(aragonite) during
   late summer each year from 2014 to 2017 relative to the four-year
   average. Greatest sea ice extent and more Arctic-like conditions in 2014
   resulted in Delta Omega anomalies of -0.05 to-0.01 (up to 45\% of total
   Delta Omega) as a result of lower primary production. Conversely,
   greater Atlantic Water influence in 2015 supplied the ice-free surface
   layer with nitrate, which prolonged primary production to drive Delta
   Omega anomalies of 0.01 to 0.06 (up to 45\% of total Delta Omega) in
   more Atlantic like conditions. Additionally, dissolution of CaCO3
   increased carbonate ion concentrations giving Delta Omega anomalies up
   to 0.06 (up to 52\% of total Delta Omega). These processes enhanced
   surface water Omega, which ranged between 2.01 and 2.65 across the
   region. Recent sea ice retreat in 2016 and 2017 (rate of decrease in ice
   cover of similar to 4\% in 30 days) created transitional Atlantic-Arctic
   conditions, where surface water Omega varied between 1.87 and 2.29
   driven by AO anomalies of-0.10 to 0.01 due to meltwater inputs and
   influence of Arctic waters. Anomalies as low as-0.12 from reduced CaCO3
   dissolution in 2016 further supressed Omega. Wind-driven mixing in 2017
   entrained Atlantic Water with low Omega into the surface layer to drive
   large Delta Omega anomalies of-0.15 (up to 58\% of Delta Omega). Sea-ice
   meltwater provided a minor source of carbonate ions, slightly
   counteracting dilution effects. Ice-free surface waters were substantial
   sinks for atmospheric CO2, where uptake of 20.5 mmol m(-2) day(-1)
   lowered surface water Omega. ``Atlantification{''} could exacerbate or
   alleviate acidification of the Arctic Ocean, being highly dependent on
   the numerous factors examined here that are intricately linked to the
   sea ice-ocean system variability.},

Title = {Phytoplankton succession and nitrogen utilization during the development
   of an upwelling bloom},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {428},
Pages = {13-31},
Abstract = {Diatoms typically constitute the majority of large phytoplankton in
   coastal systems, where they dominate upwelling conditions. The exact
   mechanism for diatom success has never been explicitly demonstrated, and
   we hypothesize that it is attributable to their early, rapid response to
   newly upwelled nitrate. This strategy allows diatoms to grow quickly and
   consume a disproportionate fraction of the available nutrients. To test
   this hypothesis and investigate differential growth of phytoplankton
   during the early stages of upwelling, an upwelling event-and the
   subsequent phytoplankton bloom-was simulated in a mesocosm experiment in
   Monterey Bay. Nitrate, ammonium and inorganic carbon uptake by 3 size
   fractions (0.7-5 mu m, 5-20 mu m, >20 mu m) was measured daily through
   stable isotope tracer incubations. The particulate nitrogen and carbon
   biomass was initially dominated by the smallest phytoplankton, but the
   largest fraction increased most rapidly to dominate the biomass and
   nitrogen and carbon assimilation after a few days. All size fractions
   achieved similar maximum specific nitrate uptake rates (V-NO3), but this
   occurred most rapidly and was maintained longest by the largest
   fraction. This initial acceleration of V-NO3 appears to be the mechanism
   by which diatoms exploit upwelling conditions. All size fractions
   assimilated carbon and nitrogen in a nearly constant ratio of similar to
   6.3 as the assemblage returned to balanced growth. Pigment measurements
   and light microscopy independently documented changing phytoplankton
   abundance, with diatoms demonstrating a characteristic pattern of
   succession. Changes in diatom diversity and assemblage composition
   occurred early, providing evidence of a faster response than observable
   changes in nitrate or biomass implied.},

Abstract = {Enclosed seas are suitable for bivalve farming due to high primary

   the biological productivity of lower trophic levels was evaluated in
   Hiroshima Bay. The area-weighted mean primary production in the estuary

   offshore area (southwestern bay; SB) in all four seasons. In contrast,
   the area-weighted mean secondary production by net zooplankton in the NB
   was lower than that of the SB, except in August. The areaweighted mean
   secondary production by oysters in the NB was 2.2 to 2.8 times higher
   than that of the SB in all four seasons, and exhibited a similar spatial
   pattern to that of the primary production. The primary production was
   more efficiently utilized and transferred to secondary producers in the
   SB (16.7\% on average) than in the NB (9.4\% on average). This study

Abstract = {The ability to survive severe summer water stress determines the
   persistence, and therefore autumn yield, of temperate grasses in the
   Mediterranean environment. In the island of Corsica, sward survival and
   changes in carbohydrate content were investigated over 2 years, in two
   contrasting populations of cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.): KM2, an
   early-flowering population of Mediterranean origin and Lutetia, a
   late-flowering cultivar bred in North West France.
   In Expt 1 (1987/88) three spring defoliation intensities were imposed.
   In Expt 2 (1989/90) three levels of water deficit were imposed under a
   rain shelter.
   In spring, dry matter (DM) yields and water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC)
   concentrations in leaf bases were similar (20-35 \% of DM) for both
   populations. From June to September, WSC reserves tended to decline in
   Lutetia, whereas accumulation of WSC was maintained until August (45 \%
   of DM) in KM2. Fructans formed the major component, and therefore
   followed the same seasonal pattern, as total WSC. Contents of
   trisaccharide and sucrose increased in late summer as drought
   progressed. Contents of glucose and fructose were lower but increased in
   August or in September according to treatment.
   In both field experiments during summer, KM2 had 50 \% more live
   tillers/ml than Lutetia, possibly because it remained in positive carbon
   balance for a longer period.
   WSC levels in summer and regrowth in autumn were reduced both by intense
   defoliation in spring and by severe water stress in summer. On average,
   autumn yields of KM2 were five times greater than those of Lutetia and
   the recovery yields were closely correlated with fructan contents of
   leaf bases in summer (r = 0.80; P < 0.001).
   The role of fructans and low DP-sugars as solutes in osmotic adjustment
   and as substrates for regrowth are discussed, and the differences
   between populations are analysed.},

   plant) or offshore. The most common offshore intake type uses a velocity
   cap at the top of the invert pipe. Inshore or offshore passive screen
   intakes are used to reduce the impacts of impingement and entrainment.
   Subsurface intake systems, either wells or galleries, are being used in
   hundreds of small to medium capacity SWRO facilities. Because of the
   greater attention being given to the environmental impacts of
   impingement and entrainment of marine organisms, subsurface intake
   systems are being specified for a greater number of facilities with
   higher capacity.},

Title = {Water resources and the potential of brackish groundwater extraction in
   Egypt: a review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA},
Year = {2014},

Pages = {399-428},
Abstract = {A review of water resources in Egypt indicates that Nile water is fully
   utilized and the available quantity could potentially decrease by
   approximately 19\% due to proposed water usage by neighboring countries.
   Seawater desalination and groundwater extraction are the only options to
   increase Egypt's water supply. The extraction and desalination of
   brackish groundwater is suggested to develop sustainable decentralized
   communities. A review of seven main hydro-geological systems across six
   regions in Egypt is conducted to identify areas with access to brackish
   groundwater and aquifers are ranked on the potential for sustainable
   development using multi-criteria analysis based on literature data for
   productivity, renewability, groundwater depth and development potential.
   Approximately 55\% of Egypt's area has access to brackish groundwater,
   47\% of which has access to aquifers with moderate to high potential for
   development. Five high priority areas have been identified for
   establishing decentralized communities based on brackish groundwater
   extraction: Areas with access to the Nubian aquifer, the Quaternary
   aquifer in the central parts of the Sinai Peninsula, in the vicinity of
   the Nile River in the Eastern Desert and the Western Desert south of
   Cairo, and the coastal aquifers along the north west Mediterranean coast
   and the Suez Gulf.},

Abstract = {Surface sediments were collected from the coastal water near Luan River
   Estuary-Dapu River Estuary in spring and summer, 2015. The aim was to
   examine the spatial and seasonal distributions of total organic carbon
   (TOC) and acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) in surface sediments. The paired
   samples t-test results revealed that the seasonal variation had
   significant effects on the spatial distribution of TOC and AVS in
   surface sediments (p < 0.05). TOC content was well correlated with
   sediment grain sizes and comparatively higher TOC content was present in
   the fine-grained sediments in two seasons.},

Title = {Geomicrobiological linkages between short-chain alkane consumption and
   sulfate reduction rates in seep sediments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Marine hydrocarbon seeps are ecosystems that are rich in methane, and,
   in some cases, short-chain (C-2-C-5) and longer alkanes. C-2-C-4 alkanes
   such as ethane, propane, and butane can be significant components of
   seeping fluids. Some sulfate-reducing microbes oxidize short-chain
   alkanes anaerobically, and may play an important role in both the
   competition for sulfate and the local carbon budget. To better
   understand the anaerobic oxidation of short-chain n-alkanes coupled with
   sulfate-reduction, hydrocarbon-rich sediments from the Gulf of Mexico
   (GoM) were amended with artificial, sulfate-replete seawater and one of
   four n-alkanes (C-1-C-4) then incubated under strict anaerobic
   conditions. Measured rates of alkane oxidation and sulfate reduction
   closely follow stoichiometric predictions that assume the complete
   oxidation of alkanes to CO2 (though other sinks for alkane carbon likely
   exist). Changes in the delta C-13 of all the alkanes in the reactors
   show enrichment over the course of the incubation, with the C-3 and C-4
   incubations showing the greatest enrichment (4.4 and 4.5 parts per
   thousand, respectively). The concurrent depletion in the delta C-13 of
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) implies a transfer of carbon from the
   alkane to the DIC pool (-3.5 and -6.7 parts per thousand for C-3 and C-4
   incubations, respectively). Microbial community analyses reveal that
   certain members of the class Deltaproteobacteria are selectively
   enriched as the incubations degrade C-1-C-4 alkanes. Phylogenetic
   analyses indicate that distinct phylotypes are enriched in the ethane
   reactors, while phylotypes in the propane and butane reactors align with
   previously identified C-3-C-4 alkane-oxidizing sulfate-reducers. These
   data further constrain the potential influence of alkane oxidation on
   sulfate reduction rates (SRRs) in cold hydrocarbon-rich sediments,
   provide insight into their contribution to local carbon cycling, and
   illustrate the extent to which short-chain alkanes can serve as electron
   donors and govern microbial community composition and density.},

Title = {East Australian Current volume transports at 30 degrees S: Estimates
   from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment hydrographic sections

Abstract = {Between September 1991 and March 1994 the oceanic region off the east
   coast of Australia at 30 degreesS was the subject of an intense
   observational program Part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment,
   the objective was to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the
   East Australian Current (EAC) and to measure its volume and energy flux.
   The two main components were the Pacific Current Meter Array 3 (PCM3)
   with six moorings spanning a total distance of 120 km, and repeat,
   high-resolution hydrographic surveys. The long-term average from PCM3
   shows the EAC as a narrow, swift, and highly variable current centered
   at 40 km from the coast with strong shear in the upper 1000 m and mean
   southward velocities of 0.6 m s(-1) in the core. The measurements also
   revealed a thick countercurrent underneath the poleward flow. The mean
   volume transport for the entire section covered by the array (between
   the coast and 154.4 degreesE) was 22.1+/-4.6 Sv toward the south with an
   rms variability of 30 Sv. Combining the data from the PCM3 array with
   the hydrographic sections generated nine detailed snapshots of the
   absolute geostrophic current field. The snapshots were used to evaluate
   the reliability of the PCM3 data for determining volume transports. The
   rms difference between transports derived from direct current
   observations and from hydrographic data was 3.8 Sv, indicating that the
   PCM3 array can be used to describe the current variability despite the
   sparse spatial distribution of velocity measurements. Transport
   variability was dominated by periods between 90 and 140 days, which are
   attributed to eddy shedding in the region. Occasional intense northward
   flow events were observed where total transports reached up to 50 Sv
   northward. On those occasions the southward boundary current changed
   from being surface intensified and mainly baroclinic to northward and
   more barotropic, related to the northward migration past the array of
   the EAC coastal separation point.},

Abstract = {The mechanism whereby inorganic carbon (C(i)) is acquired by the
   symbiotic association between the giant clam (Tridacna derasa) and
   zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium sp.) has been investigated. C(i) in the
   haemolymph of the clam is in equilibrium with the surrounding sea water.
   The photosynthesis rate exhibited by the intact clam varies as a
   function of the C(i) concentration in the clam haemolymph. The gill
   tissue contains high carbonic anhydrase activity which may be important
   in adjusting the C(i) equilibrium between haemolymph and sea water.
   Zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium sp.) isolated from the clam mantle prefer
   CO2 to HCO3- as a source of inorganic carbon. The zooxanthellae have low
   levels of carbonic anhydrase on the external surface of the cell;
   however, mantle extracts display high carbonic anhydrase activity.
   Carbonic anhydrase is absent from the mantle of aposymbiotic clams (T.
   gigas), indicating that this enzyme may be essential to the symbiosis.
   The enzyme is probably associated with the zooxanthellae tubes in the
   mantle. The results indicate that carbonic anhydrase plays an important
   role in the supply of carbon dioxide within the clam symbiosis.},

Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {260},
Number = {3-4},

Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {Although the Re/Os isotopic system has proved to be a valuable aid in
   understanding the evolution of the Earth's mantle, interpretation of the
   data is currently hindered by limited knowledge of the high-temperature
   geochemical behaviour of Re. In particular, the extent to which Re in
   the mantle is hosted by sulphide or silicate phases is poorly known. We
   report the results of an experimental study of the solubility of Re in
   sulphide melts (called here ``mattes{''}) coexisting with a Re-rich
   Re-Fe alloy in the system Fe-Re-S-O over a range of fO(2,)fS(2) and
   temperatures, which allow extrapolation to conditions pertinent to the
   Earth's mantle. The solubility of Re in mattes increases with increasing
   fS(2), with Re dissolving as Re4+ at high fS2 and Reo at low fS(2). The
   effect of fO(2) is negligible except at high fO(2) where 0 in the matte
   becomes important. At constant fS2, an increase in temperature leads to
   an increase in the solubility of Reo in the matte, but a decrease in the
   solubility of Re4+. These results, coupled with data for the Re
   solubility in silicate melts taken from the literature, allow the
   calculation of Re matte/silicate-melt partition coefficients
   (D-Re(matte/sil)) for a range of conditions. The calculated
   (D-Re(matte/sil)) show a large dependence on fO(2), and a lesser
   dependency on fS(2), with Re behaving as a chalcophile element for
   relatively reduced MORB-type mantle and as a lithophile element for the
   oxidised sources of island-arc basalts. The sensitivity of Re to fS(2)
   and fO(2) reconciles the apparent discrepancies between previous
   estimates of this parameter, which can vary by more than five orders of
   magnitude within the range of fS(2) and fO(2) covered by terrestrial
   basaltic magmas. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   where chlorophyll-a (chl-a) was > 1.5 mu g l(-1) and diatoms comprised >
   80\% of biomass. Pigment signatures representative of haptophytes-8,
   indicative of Phaeocystis antarctica, were dominant near the ice shelf.
   Chl-a concentrations were 0.2-0.6 mu g l(-1) between the APF and the
   Subtropical Front (STF) and outputs suggested that chlorophytes,
   haptophytes-8 and haptophyte-6, in the form of coccolithophores, were
   the major constituents. Very low chl-a levels ( < 0.2 mu g l(-1) were
   observed north of the STF and the prokaryotes Synechococcus spp. and
   Prochlorococcus spp. were the dominant groups in these oligotrophic
   waters. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a new and efficient passive islanding detection technique
   for a grid-connected hybrid distributed generating system has been
   proposed using Second Generation Wavelet Transform (SGWT) and Maximum
   Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT). In this technique, the
   ripple content of the voltage signal is measured at the Point of Common
   Coupling (PCC) and it is monitored through the decomposition of the
   signal by applying SGWT and MODWT technique up to suitable finer levels.
   This algorithm able to detects all kinds of islanding at nearly 0.3 sec,
   even with zero power mismatch. It is verified on a wide range of
   operational conditions and is also validated in various non-islanding
   conditions. Furthermore, the proposed technique is simple, there is no
   need for a classifier requirement, not depends on system parameters,
   zero non-detection zone (NDZ), and its operation is independent of the
   capacity and nature of distributed generation (DG) connected to the
   utility grid.},

Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {Various methods have been used to quantify the kinematic variability or
   stability of the human spine. However, each of these methods evaluates
   dynamic behavior within the stable region of state space. In contrast,
   our goal was to determine the extent of the stable region. A 2D
   mathematical model was developed for a human sitting on an unstable seat
   apparatus (i.e., the ``wobble chair{''}). Forward dynamic simulations
   were used to compute trajectories based on the initial state. From these
   trajectories, a scalar field of trajectory divergence was calculated,
   specifically a finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field.
   Theoretically, ridges of local maxima within this field are expected to
   partition the state space into regions of qualitatively different
   behavior. We found that ridges formed at the boundary between regions of
   stability and failure (i.e., falling). The location of the basin of
   stability found using the FILE field matched well with the basin of
   stability determined by an alternative method. In addition, an
   equilibrium manifold was found, which describes a set of equilibrium
   configurations that act as a low dimensional attractor in the controlled
   system. These simulations are a first step in developing a method to
   locate state space boundaries for torso stability. Identifying these
   boundaries may provide a framework for assessing factors that contribute
   to health risks associated with spinal injury and poor balance recovery
   (e.g., age, fatigue, load/weight, and distribution). Furthermore, an
   approach is presented that can be adapted to find state space boundaries
   in other biomechanical applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Variability of multivariate wave climate in Latin America and the
   Caribbean},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {70-84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wave climate is highly variable on the world's coast and its temporal
   changes and extremes usually imply consequences like erosion or impacts
   to infrastructures. Alterations in wave climate were little addressed in
   the four IPCC reports although variations in wave climate may cause
   extensive coastal impacts. Changes are also often related to climate
   pattern variability. This variability as well as long-term trends has
   been an issue of research in recent years. In the region of Latin
   America and the Caribbean (LAC) an understanding of wave climate and its
   variability is scant. In this paper we use an extensively calibrated and
   validated wave reanalysis to describe the wave climatology in the region
   at different time scales and for scalar and directional wave parameters.
   Long-term changes are identified in the wave heights and mean direction
   of the energy flux shows high spatial variability. Correlation patterns
   of the mean significant wave height and direction of mean energy flux
   lead to the detection of prominent modes of influence of several climate
   indices. A wave climate type approach is also used to identify wave
   variability along the region that allows an identification of different
   wave climate types in terms of wave parameters and occurrence frequency.
   In line with the results, the influence of El Nino events shows a higher
   frequency of occurrence of certain sea-states with respect to non ENSO
   years. We also explore how climate change affecting storm patterns may
   be translated into a modification of sea-state occurrence and therefore
   implying different consequences for coastal zones depending on local
   wave propagation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Microgrids provide an effective way to increase renewable energy (RE)
   penetration level in the power network. The cooperation of renewable
   microsources, energy storage systems (ESSs) and conventional
   dispatchable microsources is an important issue in the operation of an
   islanded microgrid. In this paper, the designed power sharing scheme
   aims to maximize renewable penetration level by giving RE the priority
   of power supply. This requires RE to be able to regulate grid voltage
   rather than only operating under power control mode (PCM) in the
   conventional way. Droop control strategy is modified to support a
   microsource operating under both voltage control mode (VCM) and PCM, and
   switching between both modes automatically. It also enables ``peer to
   peer{''} and ``plug and play{''} operation of a microgrid. Meanwhile,
   the characteristics of power sources (photovoltaic and batteries) are
   considered. DC/DC converter controller is proposed correspondingly with
   the aim of keeping the system stable. Simulations have been conducted to
   verify its effectiveness.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the control performance of a physical
   configuration of a microgrid (MG), integrated with photovoltaic (PV)
   arrays, battery energy storage systems (BESSs), and variable loads. The
   main purpose is to achieve cooperative optimal control under both
   grid-connected and islanded modes for the MG. For the grid-connected
   mode, a voltage source inverter (VSI) based on swoop control is used to
   control the MG connection to the grid even if PV arrays are under
   partially shading conditions (PSC). Then, for the islanded mode, the
   paper analyzes the model of the PV unit and BESS unit detailed from the
   small signal point of view and designs the suitable control strategy for
   them. Finally, the whole MG system combines the droop control and the
   main/slave control to stabilize the DC bus line voltage and frequency.
   Both simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed
   method can achieve cooperative control of the MG system in both
   grid-connected and islanded mode.},

Abstract = {Aimed to acquire optimum comprehensive properties for the oil and gas
   pipeline steels, thermal treatment should be controlled to achieve ideal
   microstructures. Effects of cooling rates on transformation kinetics and
   microstructures of the low-carbon high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel
   were investigated to obtain an optimized thermal treatment technology.
   Dilatometric measurements, light microscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were employed in
   present work. The transformed microstructures contained polygonal
   ferrite + pearlite, acicular ferrite (AF), and bainitic ferrite (BF) due
   to the cooling rates increasing from 5 to 3000 degrees C min(-1), in
   present investigated HSLA steel. The result shows that, the increase of
   cooling rate accelerates AF transformation and refines the steel's
   matrix. The morphology of martensite/austenite structures transformed
   from islands in AF to films in BF with the increase of cooling rate.},

Abstract = {Recently, the penetration of Distributed Generation (DG) at medium and
   low voltages in utility networks is increasing in developed countries
   and takes special place for them worldwide. Due to the DGs advantages,
   increasing of DGs add some problems in the system. One problem that
   encountered with it when using with DGs, is an unwanted Islanding
   phenomenon. Islanding phenomenon of a grid-connected independent
   generator like a photovoltaic (PV) system occurs when a section of a
   utility system is disconnected from the main utility voltage source, but
   the independent generator continues to energize the utility lines in the
   isolated section.
   In this paper, a new technique in order to detecting islanding
   conditions has been present, and the proposed method based on rate of
   change of reactive power and total harmonic distortion, its performance
   is much more appropriate than that of previous techniques. The
   simulation results performed in MATLAB, clearly show improved operation
   of this method.},

Abstract = {In this study, we have evaluated two different ionic liquids (IL) as
   extractants based on the same cation (trioctylmethylammonium) but
   bearing the anion thiosalicylate (TOMATS) or salicylate (TOMAS). Both IL
   have been incorporated as carriers in polymer inclusion membranes
   (PIMs), and mercury (Hg) has been pre-concentrated using a special
   device. Results show that among the tested IL, TOMATS has given better
   results. A PIM made of 50\% cellulose triacetate, 30\% TOMATS and 20\%
   nitrophenyl octyl ether as a plasticizer enabled the effective transport
   of Hg to a 10(-3)M cysteine solution used as a stripping phase. This
   novel and simple PIM-device system allows the transport of Hg at low
   concentration levels in different types of natural waters such as
   rivers, groundwater and seawater without any previous treatment. Since
   no matrix effect was observed on Hg transport efficiency with different
   waters, this newly developed PIM-system could be used as a global
   detection system for this metal. The effect of biofilm growth on the
   surface of PIMs has been investigated for the first time, and no
   significant differences on Hg transport have been found when using a
   fresh PIM and a PIM deployed for 7 days in a pond.},

Abstract = {Numerical models are capable of simulating various groundwater scenarios
   and relate it towards groundwater management. A mesh based density
   dependent flow model, FEFLOW is used to simulate groundwater flow and
   transport for a coastal island aquifer in Kg. Salang, Tioman Island,
   Malaysia. FEFLOW is designed to simulate 2D and 3D, variable density
   groundwater flow and multi-species transport. The impacts of pumping and
   recharge rates represented by three different groundwater scenarios,
   which were investigated by means of hydraulic heads, TDS concentrations
   and water balance components. Scenario A showed the standard saturated
   groundwater flow and the steady state fluid flow. Over pumping and
   inconsistency in recharge rate are the stresses shown in Scenarios B and
   C. Scenario B involved in the maximum pumping rate of 96m(3) per day and
   recharge rate of 300mm per year has shown a drawdown of 1.5 m. Scenario
   C showed the extreme pumping rate of 1000m(3) per day and without
   recharge has shown a decrease in groundwater levels of 6.3 m. and
   groundwater storage (50\%). Scenario B presented the most promising
   finding compared with Scenario C. Highest hydraulic heads, lowest mass
   concentration and positive groundwater storage (2578.6m(3)/day) were
   obtained in Scenario B. Additionally, and further progress is needed in
   obtaining the water usage data from each part to determine the best
   pumping rate. A sustainable groundwater management plan is crucial to
   maintain the natural resources and social benefits as well as to protect
   the ecological balance.},

Abstract = {For some utilities, new US drinking water regulations may require the
   removal of disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursor material as a means of
   minimizing DBP formation. The Environmental Protection Agency's Stage It
   DBP Rule relies on total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations as a
   measure of the effectiveness of treatment techniques for removing
   organic material that could act as DBP precursors. Accordingly, precise
   and accurate methods are needed for the determination of TOC and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in raw and finished
   potable water supplies. This review describes the current analytical
   technologies and summarizes the key factors affecting measurement
   quality. It provides a look into the fundamental principles and workings
   of TOC analyzers. Current peroxydisulfuric acid wet ashing methods and
   combustion methods are discussed. Issues affecting quality control, such
   as non-zero blanks and preservation, are covered. Some of the
   difficulties in analyzing water for TOC and DOC that were identified up
   to 20 years ago still remain problematic today. Limitations in
   technology, reagent purity, operator skill and knowledge of natural
   organic matter (NOM) can preclude the level of precision and accuracy
   desirable for compliance monitoring.},

Title = {Temperate predators and seasonal water temperatures impact feeding of a
   range expanding tropical fish},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {163},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Range expansions of species due to climate change threaten the function
   and composition of marine ecosystems globally, yet factors constraining
   or facilitating this redistribution are poorly understood. Native
   predators may constrain prey shifting poleward through consumption, or
   by restricting their feeding activity. However, the extent that native
   predators impact range-expanders will likely be structured by
   physiological mismatches between these groups, associated with water
   temperatures. We examined how temperate predators and seasonal water
   temperature affected foraging of the planktivorous tropical reef fish,
   Abudefduf vaigiensis, within temperate southeastern Australian waters,
   an emerging new range. Foraging excursions of A. vaigiensis were
   compared between predator-rich marine reserves and predator-depauperate
   fished reefs during summer and winter (similar to 18 and 22 degrees C
   water, respectively). A. vaigiensis foraged with shorter excursions in
   marine reserves than fished reefs and higher excursions during summer
   than winter. Effects of predation risk and water temperature on A.
   vaigiensis foraging were isolated in an aquarium experiment. Groups were
   held at 18 or 22 degrees C and visually exposed to a temperate predator,
   a predator control (temperate herbivore) and an empty tank. Foraging
   excursions and feeding rates were reduced when exposed to predators at
   22 degrees C, but did not differ between predator and the predator
   control or empty tank at 18 degrees C. Results suggest temperate
   predators may restrict range expansions of A. vaigiensis by reducing
   its' food intake during summer months. But winter water temperatures may
   limit feeding, independent of predation risk. Protection of predators
   from fishing should improve resistance of some marine ecosystems to
   impacts of range expanding prey.},

Abstract = {Sedimentation rates were determined daily over a 2 wk period (late April
   - early May 1992) under post spring bloom conditions at a permanent
   station in the Bjornafjorden, Norway. Samples collected using floating
   sediment traps deployed at 50 and 100 m depth showed that sedimented
   seston, particulate organic matter, carbonate and lithogenic + opal
   fractions were, on average, twice as high at 100 m (221, 99, 51 and 76
   mg m-2 d-1, respectively) as at 50 m (119, 62, 27 and 34 Mg M-2 d-1,
   respectively). Faecal pellets made up the bulk of sedimenting matter,
   accounting for 87 and 92 \% of the average total organic carbon recorded
   at 50 and 100 m, respectively. The remaining sedimented matter consisted
   mainly of tintinnids. Diatoms cells and resting spores,
   coccolithophorids and flagellates contributed a minor fraction. It is
   postulated that the vertical flux of faecal pellets was determined by a
   combination of 3 factors: (1) relatively high standing stock of actively
   grazing mesozooplankton dominated by calanoid copepods and

Abstract = {This study examined the diversity of Bacteria, Archaea and in particular
   aerobic methanotrophs associated with a shallow (84 m) methane seep in
   the tropical Timor Sea, Australia. Seepage of thermogenic methane was
   associated with a large carbonate hardground covered in coarse
   carbonate-rich sediments and various benthic organisms such as solitary
   corals. The diversity of Bacteria and Archaea was studied by analysis of
   cloned 16S rRNA genes, while aerobic methanotrophic bacteria were
   quantified using real-time PCR targeting the alpha-subunit of
   particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) genes and diversity was studied
   by analysis of cloned pmoA genes. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and
   archaeal 16S rRNA genes revealed diverse and mostly novel phylotypes
   related to sequences previously recovered from marine sediments. A small
   number of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were related to aerobic
   methanotrophs distantly related to the genera Methylococcus and
   Methylocaldum. Real-time PCR targeting pmoA genes showed that the
   highest numbers of methanotrophs were present in surface sediments
   associated with the seep area. Phylogenetic analysis of pmoA sequences
   revealed that all phylotypes were novel and fell into two large clusters
   comprised of only marine sequences distantly related to the genera
   Methylococcus and Methylocaldum that were clearly divergent from
   terrestrial phylotypes. This study provides evidence for the existence
   of a novel microbial diversity and diverse aerobic methanotrophs that
   appear to constitute marine specialized lineages.},

Title = {Glacial-interglacial variation in denudation rates from interior Texas,
   USA, established with cosmogenic nuclides},
Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {390},
Pages = {209-221},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The Brazos, Colorado, and Trinity rivers of Texas drain a tectonically
   quiescent, non-glaciated, and low-relief landscape inland from the Gulf
   of Mexico, where long-term {[}10(3)-10(5) a] changes in denudation rates
   are probably driven largely by climate change. Here, we use cosmogenic
   Be-10 to obtain spatially averaged denudation rates for these river
   catchments, primarily from terrace deposits associated with glacial or
   interglacial intervals over the past half million years. The denudation
   rates are similar to 30-35\% higher during interglacial periods than
   during glacial periods, and correlate broadly with temperature. The
   results are consistent with predictions from the BQART sediment flux
   model, and support the hypothesis that increased weathering rates
   associated with warmer climates will accelerate landscape erosion.
   Furthermore, by analyzing Al-26/(10) Be in these deposits, we can
   estimate the bed load sourced from up-catchment surfaces. The stored
   coastal plain fraction varies from similar to 10\% to 30\%, and is
   greater during times of relatively lower sea level. The results indicate
   that although sediment flux is moderated by coastal-plain storage,
   increased up-catchment flux during warmer interglacial periods outpaces
   evacuation of stored sediment during glacial periods, resulting in a net
   increase in sediment flux to the ocean during warm intervals. If this
   temperature-sediment flux relationship is valid beyond the
   Plio-Pleistocene transition, then global sediment flux to the ocean from
   passive, non-glaciated, and low-relief landscapes would have been
   greater during the Pliocene than in the cooler Quaternary. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) has been identified or inferred to
   exist in many groups of marine organisms that produce biominerals widely
   used as geochemical archives (e.g. foraminifera, molluscs, echinoderms).
   However, little is known about trace element incorporation into ACC, and
   thus it is not understood how precipitation through an ACC precursor
   might impact the fidelity of climate proxies and biomineralisation
   models built on the skeletal geochemistry of these marine calcifiers. To
   address this, we investigated the incorporation of Li, B, Na, Mg, Mn,
   Sr, Ba, and U into inorganic amorphous calcium magnesium carbonates
   precipitated from seawater under a variety of different carbonate
   chemistries, Mg/Ca ratios, and in the presence of aspartic and glutamic
   acid, two of the most common intracrystalline amino acids found in
   foraminifera and corals. ACC is highly enriched in most of these trace
   elements relative to the crystalline carbonates yet similar in some
   respects in terms of the factors influencing trace element partitioning.
   For example, ACC B/Ca is sensitive to the carbonate system, whilst Mg/Ca
   and Sr/Ca are largely a function of their respective ratio in seawater.
   In general, we find that most of the variance in the distribution
   coefficients of the other trace elements can be explained by some
   combination of the seawater carbonate chemistry and the seawater or ACC
   Mg/Ca ratio. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In India, presently 85 existing thermal power plants (TPPs),
   contributing to about 70\% of the total energy requirement, produce 118
   million tons of fly ash per year. This huge quantity of fly ash not only
   poses serious problems of environmental concerns but occupies large
   areas of land for its dumping and needs urgent and appropriate measures
   for its safe disposal and gainful utilization on sustainable basis.
   Besides, reclamation of a vast area of uncultivated wasteland for
   agriculture and forestry is another challenge for the fast-growing
   population of the country. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate
   the effect of pond ash application on the yield and nutrient composition
   of wheat, maize and eggplant crops grown in sequence on an uncultivated
   fallow land. Pond ash collected from the Anpara TPP India was mixed with
   soil at 100 t ha(-1). Ash application had a beneficial effect on the
   wheat yield. Addition of pond ash resulted in a significant increase in
   the contents of N, R K, S, Ca, Mg, and micro-nutrients. The uptake of
   toxic trace elements (Pb, Se, Cr, and Cu) was below the threshold
   levels. The residual effect of ash on crop yield and nutrient
   composition of the subsequent maize and eggplant crops were also
   significant. The overall beneficial effect of pond ash on crops could be
   attributed to the improvement in the soil physical quality due to ash
   amendment. The results indicated that pond ash could be applied safely
   for reclamation of uncultivated fallow soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Experimental solubility data of CO2 in (5 and 10) mass\% TRIS aqueous
   solutions were measured at (318.15 and 333.15) K and up to 10 MPa. The
   solubility data were well correlated with the modified Kent-Eisenberg
   model. The reaction mechanism, reaction energies, and equilibrium
   constants for the formation of bicarbonate and carbamate from CO2, H2O,
   and TRIS were studied using the quantum-chemical approach COSMO-RS
   (conductor-like screening model for real solvents) at the BP/TZVP level.
   The bicarbonate and carbamate formations were confirmed by using Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the
   formation of the bicarbonate anion is the main product formed by the
   direct reaction of CO2 with water and TRIS, and reveal that the
   carbamate anion was formed by a proton transfer from TRIS-CO2 zwitterion
   to TRIS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with
   transition-state optimization and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) in
   water using IEF-PCM solvation model at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) levels of
   theory were employed to support the reaction pathway for the bicarbonate
   and carbamate formations. The conversion of the absorption product to
   stable carbonate (CaCO3) was also investigated experimentally by adding
   various Ca2+ sources, CaCl2\textbackslash{}center dot 2H(2)O aqueous
   solution, and artificial seawater.},

Abstract = {Both C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and High
   Performance Anion Exchange (HPAE) chromatography were used to examine
   the alditols mannitol and volemitol found in the brown alga Pelvetia
   canaliculata (Linnaeus) Decaisne et Thuret (Phaeophycota, Fucales,
   Fucaceae). Carbohydrates were extracted using either ethanol or
   distilled water and our investigations have shown that both methods give
   qualitatively and quantitatively similar results. The ratios of alditols
   extracted from the seaweed under different growth conditions
   (temperature and emersion time) were compared. In the laboratory, growth
   rates of P. canaliculata increased with temperature up to 20 degrees C
   and decreased thereafter, but results indicated that the degree to which
   plants responded to temperature is seasonally dependent. Greater
   increases occurred during winter and spring, possibly due to
   low-temperature acclimation of field-collected plants in winter.
   Mannitol and volemitol concentrations in P. canaliculata increased in
   culture with temperatures up to 27 degrees C. Both mannitol and
   volemitol concentrations remained similar during continuous emersion for
   7 d at 10 degrees C. By contrast, in plants emersed continuously for 8
   or 12 d at 25 degrees C, volemitol concentrations decreased
   significantly, whilst mannitol concentrations remained similar. But when
   plants were emersed continuously for varying periods and subsequently
   re-immersed in seawater, recovery of photosynthesis was complete in
   plants which had been emersed at 10 degrees C for up to 7 d. When
   cultured at 25 degrees C, photosynthesis recovered only when plants had
   been emersed for no longer than 4 d. As optimum growth occured at higher
   temperatures than in other intertidal fucoids and P. canaliculata
   appeared well adapted to prolonged periods of emersion, even at high
   temperatures. The accumulation of mannitol and volemitol during growth
   at higher temperatures when submerged and a decrease during emersion at
   high temperatures may suggest a possible role for these carbohydrates as
   stress metabolites. However, further research is required to explain how
   the unique presence of volemitol in P. canaliculata may contribute to
   its ability to withstand unfavourable conditions in the intertidal zone
   during periods of extreme and prolonged dehydration.},

Abstract = {Australia's CO2CRC Otway Site hosts a carbon capture and storage (CCS)
   demonstration facility that has, to date, injected over 80,000 tonnes of
   CO2 into two separate geological reservoirs. The reservoir geology is
   well understood and the site has been the subject of several seismic
   investigations, though relatively little is known about the near-surface
   geology and how potential leaks from the injection wells would migrate,
   particularly within the Port Campbell Limestone. No shallow core has
   been taken from relevant petroleum wells or water bores, and although
   there is extensive exposure in the prominent sea cliffs, these are
   mostly inaccessible. In order to further define the structure and
   geology of the Port Campbell Limestone at the Otway site, a
   high-resolution, shallow focused, 3D seismic survey has recently been
   conducted. The assessment of the near-surface geology described in this
   paper was used to assist with planning the survey. Using available data,
   the Port Campbell Limestone is assessed as a series of laterally
   continuous intercalated limestone, marl, and marly limestones.
   Interpretation of three previously acquired 3D seismic surveys using a
   minimum similarity attribute demonstrates evidence for a shallow,
   steeply east-dipping fault striking approximately NNW-SSE directly below
   the Otway site. This is observed from approximately 100 m to 380 m depth
   below surface, where it appears to die out. In the shallow section, the
   fault is undetectable primarily due to low seismic resolution, and so it
   is unknown how shallow it propagates. Extrapolation of the fault to the
   surface projects to between the wells Naylor-1 and CRC-1. A recently
   acquired high-resolution 3D seismic survey over the study area will
   allow for this fault to be further delineated. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Title = {New estimates of the large-scale Arctic atmospheric energy budget},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {New estimates of the current energy budget of the north polar cap ( the
   region north of 70 degrees N) are synthesized by combining data from new
   atmospheric reanalyses and satellite retrievals. For the period
   2000-2005, monthly means from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy
   System (CERES) satellite data set are considered to provide the most
   reliable top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation budget. The remaining
   components of the energy budget, comprising of the energy storage,
   horizontal convergence of energy, and the net surface flux between the
   atmospheric and subsurface columns, are compiled using data from the
   Japanese 25 Year Reanalysis Project (JRA) and the National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research
   (NCAR) Reanalysis (NRA). The annual cycles of energy budget components
   for the polar cap are fairly consistent between the JRA and NRA, but
   with some systematic differences. JRA depicts an annual mean surface
   flux of 14 W m(-2) ( upward), compared to only 5 W m(-2) in NRA. Most of
   this disparity appears to be due to differences in sea ice and albedo.
   Horizontal atmospheric energy flux divergence calculated using
   mass-corrected flux values contains artifacts leading to unphysical
   results. We argue that backing out the energy flux convergence as a
   residual from the net surface heat flux and time change in energy
   storage from each reanalysis, and the TOA radiation budget from CERES,
   provides for more physically realistic results in the Arctic. Monthly
   mean anomalies of budget terms, used to examine conditions leading to
   the extreme seasonal sea ice extent minimum of September 2005, point to
   the importance of albedo feedback.},

Title = {PRETREATMENT FOR REMOVAL OF ORGANIC MATERIAL IS NOT NECESSARY FOR

Abstract = {Quantifying the effects of ocean acidification requires understanding
   the skeletal carbonate mineralogy in living marine organisms. X-ray
   diffractometry (XRD) is the simplest and most commonly used technique
   for determining this. Samples being analyzed by XRD are typically
   pretreated to remove organic material prior to grinding to a crystallite
   powder. This pretreatment was traditionally performed as organic
   material may obscure the mineral peaks on XRD traces. This study
   compared controls with no pretreatment with the most common pretreatment
   methods: roasting, immersion in chlorine bleach, and immersion in
   hydrogen peroxide. The latter two methods were performed at two
   strengths and two durations. We test the hypothesis that bleaching
   and/or roasting of skeletal carbonate to remove organic material does
   not affect the mineralogy of temperate skeletal carbonate at a scale
   detectable by XRD. This was done with biogenic skeletal carbonate from
   temperate marine environments around southern New Zealand. Specimens
   included 5 species of bivalve mollusks, 4 species of bryozoans, 2
   species of barnacles, as well as 1 species each of serpulid worm,
   echinoid, gastropod mollusk, brachiopod, and coralline algae. Comparison
   to the untreated control showed that all pretreatments removed some
   organic matter and that the presence of organic matter in temperate
   skeletal carbonate does not affect the ability to qualitatively
   interpret mineralogy or semiquantitatively measure mineralogy using XRD.
   Given that pretreatment does not appear to be necessary and that some
   methods at least can cause unacceptable changes in mineralogy, we
   recommend that pretreatment for the removal of organic material be
   abandoned.},

Abstract = {Clean water is a natural resource that is crucial for life but has very
   little protection. This was exemplified by the Gold King Mine spill on
   August 7, 2015, in which three million gallons of acidic mine drainage
   was released into the head waters of the Animas River. The Animas River
   is the source for five water supply systems, providing drinking water
   for tens of thousands of people and irrigation water for a myriad of
   agricultural operations. Incidents such as this happen regularly and
   create the need for persistent monitoring of the water in rivers, lakes
   and reservoirs world wide. To this end, this paper presents the
   development of a network of three autonomous surface vehicles equipped
   with water monitoring sensors for water quality monitoring and an
   algorithm validation testbed. These vehicles are sustained by solar
   power and equipped with 3G wireless communication for real-time data
   transmission. Here, we detail the vehicles and the networked system, and
   provide results from field deployments.
   An additional outcome of this project is the engagement and
   collaboration with the local community and the robotic community at
   large. By making the database view-able to the public the local
   community can be involved in evaluating the quality of their water. By
   allowing the public to plan paths for the vehicles, multi-robot sampling
   algorithms and crowd-sourced control techniques can be methodically
   developed and systematically analyzed.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened worldwide by global climate change,

   importance of coral sexual reproduction for the continuity of coral
   reefs, our understanding of the extent of the impact of climate change
   on coral sexual reproduction, particularly on coral reproductive
   phenology and early life stages, is limited. Here, we experimentally
   examined the effects of predicted end-of-the-century seawater conditions
   on the sexual reproduction and photosynthetic capacity of a Red Sea
   zooxanthellate octocoral, Rhytisma fulvum. Sexually mature colonies were
   exposed to ambient temperature and pH conditions and to Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) conditions (4.5 and 8.5), five weeks prior
   to their expected surface-brooding event. The reproductive phenology of
   the colonies under the simulated seawater conditions was compared to
   that on the natural reef. In addition, subsequent planulae development
   and their metamorphosis into primary polyps under the same RCP
   conditions as their parent colonies were monitored in a running seawater
   system. The results reveal that both RCP conditions led to a change in
   the timing of onset of the surface-brooding event and its synchronicity.
   In contrast, the surface-brooding event under ambient conditions
   co-occurred with that of the in-situ reef colonies and maintained its
   synchrony. Similarly, planula survival and polyp metamorphosis rate were
   significantly reduced under both RCP conditions compared to propagules
   reared under ambient conditions. In addition, the photosynthetic
   capacity of the parent colonies under both RCPs showed a reduction
   relative to that under the ambient conditions in the experiment,
   suggesting a reduction in carbon fixation during the late stages of
   gametogenesis. While our findings indicate that octocoral reproductive
   phenology is affected by environmental changes, further work is required
   in order to elucidate the long-term implications for the R. fulvum
   population in the northern Red Sea.},

Abstract = {In this paper design and analysis of energy, exergy, economic and the
   environmental impacts (4E) of direct two-stage reverse osmosis (RO)
   system have been optimized for supplying Miarkelar water, north of Iran
   using multiobjective optimization. In this city, water has been provided
   for a period of 20 years and at the end of this period water is supplied
   for a population of 12,125 people. The calculation was based on the
   Caspian Sea water maximum TDS up to 13,000 ppm and permeate production
   of 4000 m(3)/day. The results present that optimal recovery and final
   price per cubic meter are respectively 76\% and 0.37\$. Feed water
   should be 10 degrees C preheated in power generation cycle condenser.
   Power needed for pumping is 362 kW. Based on these data, the organic
   fluids R290 and R717 have been selected for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC),
   which have negligible environmental impacts than other fluids. Energy
   and exergy analysis was done according to this selection. Finally,
   considering the optimal design of a solar farm being matched with the
   HRSG with known Pinch and Approach temperatures, the results indicated
   that, R290 has the lowest desalinated water production cost compared
   with water and R717 and its cost is 0.568\$ per cubic meter. (C) 2015

Title = {PETROLOGICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL FEATURES OF THE AZOV SEA AREA CARBONATITES
   (UKRAINE)},
Journal = {MINERALOGICAL JOURNAL-UKRAINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-78},
Abstract = {The geochemical features carbonatites in the spatial association with
   gabbro-sienitic and alkaline-ultrabasic magmatic complexes or forming
   separate small vein or dike-like body of the Azov Sea area are
   considered. Most varieties are presented by calcite carbonatites, but
   both calcite-dolomite and calcite carbonatites are known in Chernigivka
   complex. Carbonatites are characterized by high Sr concentration, by
   decreasing Ba, and REE, low Ti, Zr, `If, that is consistent with the
   average values for the Ca-carbonatites. Compared to carbonatites from
   other complexes of the Azov Sea area in the Chernigivka complex
   carbonatites are more enriched with phosphorus, Nb and Ti REE at high
   U/Th. Chondrite-normalized patterns are characterized by significant
   enrichment of EREE, without negative or with slightly negative
   Eu-anomaly (Eu 31 0.74-1.04). Data on geochemistry of stable and Sr
   isotopes evidence for the abyssal nature of carbonaite melts. The fairly
   narrow range of delta C-13 variation is typical of the Azov Sea area
   carbonatites that corresponds to the depth values, while 6180 can vary
   significantly, going beyond the scopes of typical carbonatitic values.
   Sometimes, this is connected with the presence, alongside with typical
   carbonatites, of carbonate veins of hydrothermal-metasomatic genesis,
   and sometimes with carbonatites interaction with meteoric and
   metamorphogenic waters. In the Chernigivka carbonatite complex the
   significant variations of delta O-18 may be determined by different
   depth their erosion cross-cut and/or by thermal dissociation of rock
   forming carbonates. The presented data indicate that carbonatites of
   different complexes can be formed as a result of different
   petrogenetical processes generation and further differentiation of
   initial magmatic melt. The calcite carbonatites of the Chernigivka
   complex and Khlibodarivka quarry may appear as a result of a primary
   dolomite carbonatitic melt crystallization or liquation carbonatitic and
   silicate melt from primary CO2-enriched silicate melt. The dolomitic and
   kimberlitic carbonatites are very similar to primitive carbonatitic
   melts formed by negligible partial melting of CO2-enriched mantle
   peridotite. Geochemical features of carbonatites from the
   gabbro-syenitic complexes of the Azov Sea area are more consistened with
   their liquation genesis.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the feasibility of implementing an integrated system
   for electricity and freshwater production, focusing on solar chimney
   technology as its main pillar. A preliminary study based on literature
   is carried out to analyze electrical generation and the heat transfer to
   the storage system of the solar chimney. In addition, a seawater thermal
   desalination is incorporated with the idea to increase the overall
   efficiency of the solar chimney. Furthermore, in order to address
   electricity and freshwater demand without interruption, a hydro-storage
   system with a water turbine is integrated. As a result, implementing an
   integrated system with a solar chimney as its main source of energy, the
   overall energy efficiency is obtained to be 8.4\%, which is
   sub-stantially higher than a single solar chimney.},

Title = {RAINS FROM SUCCESSIVE HURRICANES REDUCE NESTING SUCCESS OF THE MARBLED

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Current models predict that the intensity of extreme weather will
   increase as climate change progresses. Indeed, 2020 brought a record
   number of tropical storms to the Southeastern U.S. The effect of these
   storms is a conservation concern for amphibians because they depend on
   aquatic habitats for reproduction. I studied the effect of three
   subsequent hurricanes on the nesting success of Marbled Salamanders
   (Ambystoma opacum) in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, USA. In autumn,
   females migrate to nesting grounds, lay eggs terrestrially and guard
   them until seasonal rains flood the nest causing eggs to hatch. Rains
   from Hurricane Sally brought the salamanders into the breeding grounds,
   but rains from Hurricane Delta drove them back out, leaving the nesting
   area flooded before eggs could be laid. Most nests were constructed on
   the periphery of the semi-flooded nesting grounds, and subsequent
   seasonal rains flooded nests before the eggs were ready to hatch. Rains
   from Hurricane Zeta maintained high water levels. Of 28 nests, three
   were successful. Two nests were never covered in water (i.e., 100\% egg
   mortality), and the rest were flooded prematurely. Concomitant lab
   studies demonstrated that premature flooding of nests reduces hatching
   success, indicating that increased hurricane frequency can harm
   salamander populations even if they are relatively far from the coast.
   Few studies have focused on the effects of hurricanes on salamanders;
   thus, additional research is warranted because the Southeastern U.S. is
   a hotspot for both salamander diversity and hurricane activity.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {15, SI},
Pages = {8522-8528},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {Increases in atmospheric CO2 cause the oceanic surface water to
   continuously acidify, which has multiple and profound impacts on coastal
   and continental shelf environments. Here we present the carbonate
   mineral composition in surface sediments from a range of continental
   shelf seabed environments and their current and predicted stability
   under ocean acidifying conditions. Samples come from the following four
   tropical Australian regions: (1) Capricorn Reef (southern end of the
   Great Barrier Reef), (2) the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon, (3) Tones
   Strait, and (4) the eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf. Beyond the near-shore
   zone, these regions typically have a carbonate content in surface
   sediments of 80 wt \% or more. The abundance of high-magnesium calcites
   (HMC) dominates over aragonite (Arag) and low-magnesium calcite (LMC)
   and constitutes between 36\% and 50\% of all carbonate. HMC, with a
   magnesium content larger than 8-12 mol \%, is more soluble than both
   Arag and LMC, and the solubility of HMC positively correlates with its
   magnesium concentration. From the solubility data of Plummer and
   Mackenzie (Am. J. Sci. 1974, 274, 61-83), 95\% of HMC in the four
   regions is presently in metastable equilibrium relative to global mean
   tropical sea surface water. HMC is predicted to become destabilized in
   the four regions between 2040 and 2080 AD, with typical HMC decline
   rates between 2\% and 5\% per year. The range of respective estimated
   carbonate dissolution rates is expected to exceed current continental
   shelf carbonate accumulation rates, leading to net dissolution of
   carbonate during the period of HMC decline. In a geological context, the
   decline in HMC in tropical continental shelf environments is a global
   event triggered by reaching below-equilibrium conditions. The
   characteristic change in carbonate mineral composition in continental
   shelf sediments will serve as a geological marker for the proposed
   Anthropocene Epoch.},

Abstract = {Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is attracting great interest as a clean
   energy alternative to other fossil fuels, mainly due to its ease of
   transport and low carbon dioxide emissions, a primary factor in air
   pollution and global warming. It is expected that this trend in the use
   of LNG will lead to steady increases in demand over the next few
   decades. To meet the growing demand for LNG, natural gas liquefaction
   plants have been constructed across the globe. Furthermore, single train
   capacity has been increased to strengthen price competitiveness. To
   achieve greater capacity, more complex refrigeration cycle designs that
   combine two or more different conventional single refrigeration cycles
   are being developed to obtain synergistic effects in the liquefaction
   process. At the same time, a variety of recent studies have focused on
   designing suitable processes for offshore and small-scale plants to
   improve the profitability of stranded gas fields. LNG plants are known
   to be energy/cost-intensive, as they require a large amount of power for
   the processes of compression and refrigeration, and need special
   equipment such as cryogenic heat exchangers, compressors, and drivers.
   Therefore, one of the primary challenges in the LNG industry is to
   improve the efficiency of the current natural gas liquefaction processes
   in combination with cost savings. In this paper, we review recent
   developments in LNG processes, with an emphasis on commercially
   available refrigeration cycles. We also discuss recent research and
   suggest future directions for natural gas liquefaction processes. Up to
   this point, most studies have focused on operating cost. To achieve
   better results, future studies that investigate optimal design and
   operation of LNG technologies should consider both capital cost and
   operating cost.},

Abstract = {To enhance our understanding of the forcing factors of marine biological
   community structure in the Bay of Bengal, we studied proxies for
   biogenic carbonate and silicate production in the western Bay of Bengal
   and compared them with proxies for upper-ocean stratification and
   strength of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). Specifically, we
   investigated the record in a sediment core from the western Bay of
   Bengal that extended to approximately 80 ky before the present (BP). The
   records of Globigerinoides ruber sensu stricto delta O-18 minus
   Neogloboquadrina dutertrei delta O-18 (Delta delta O-18(r-d)) were used
   to investigate changes in upper-ocean stratification. We reconstructed
   variations in mass accumulation rates (MARs) of CaCO3 and biogenic
   silica (BSi) to discuss plankton community structure. Greater difference
   between Globigerinoides ruber sensu stricto delta O-18 and
   Neogloboquadrina dutertrei delta O-18 during the marine isotope stage
   (MIS) 1 and 5a indicate intervals with less saline and more stratified
   conditions. In contrast, the relatively small difference between both
   planktic foraminiferal delta O-18 during MIS 2 and 4 indicates
   diminished stratification during these periods. Elevated carbonate
   production during MIS 2 and 4, demonstrated by the increase in CaCO3
   MAR, could have been driven by lower freshwater influx to the western
   Bay of Bengal resulting from lower ISM precipitation, and thus the
   increased mixing and upwelling of deep nitrate into the photic zone. The
   relative increase in BSi MAR during periods of high ISM precipitation
   and decreased salinity of surface waters suggests a limited recovery in
   biological siliceous production under interglacial conditions, possibly
   due to enhanced fluvial SiO4 delivery to the ocean. Fluctuations of
   Delta delta O-18(r-d) during MIS 3 indicate that freshwater
   stratification was moderate and insufficient to restrict up welling.
   This might have induced moderate biogenic silica and carbonate
   productions during this period.},

Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},

Abstract = {Island nations and islands in Oceania and the Asia Pacific rely heavily
   on coastal and marine ecosystem services. Systems such as coral reefs,
   seagrass and mangroves are intrinsically important, vital to many
   people's livelihoods, and in many cases intertwined with cultural
   systems. Some, such as the reefs of the Coral Triangle, are seriously
   threatened by fishing pressures, including destructive fishing
   practices, pollution and environmental change. Governments, and
   concerned coastal communities, each try to work to protect or manage the
   exploitation of important ecosystems, yet apart from the limited cases
   with endorsed systems of co-management or community based management,
   communities and governments can find themselves working separately and
   not necessarily in harmony. A participatory diagnosis on the island of
   Selayar, Eastern Indonesia, highlights opportunities for communities and
   government to improvement alignment of their efforts towards sustainable
   management of marine ecosystems. The findings from this study can inform
   strategies in Oceania and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific towards improved
   management of marine and coastal ecosystems, from the standpoints of
   communities, government and civil-society actors. We highlight issues of
   policy alignment between communities and government; aligning customary
   and science-based knowledge; and navigating inter-community conflict.},

Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {In literature, different fixatives have been used to stop
   microphytobenthic photosynthetic activity estimated using the C-14
   technique, and different concentrations of HCl have been used to remove
   the excess labeled bicarbonate. To standardize these two steps of the
   C-14 method, we designed a series of experiments using sub-littoral
   muddy sediments colonized by microphytobenthos. The first aim was to
   identify which fixative among formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and HCl was
   most effective in arresting photosynthetic activity. Formaldehyde
   increases cell membrane permeability leading to a loss of assimilated
   carbon because an underestimate of dis-integrations per minute (DPM) of
   up to 64\% was obtained when compared with HCl values. Glutaraldehyde
   led to an overestimate of DPM due to its autofluorescence. We propose
   that the best way to stop photosynthetic activity is by using HCl. The
   second aim of the article was to define which HCl concentration from
   0.1N to 5N was sufficient to remove the excess labeled bicarbonate. The
   residual inorganic C-14 led to an overestimate of DPM values when mild
   acids were added. None of the acid treatments completely removed the
   inorganic labeled carbon because of the sediment matrix effect. However,
   a further pH decrease, caused by too strong acid normalities, could
   digest the organic carbon pool. Besides dark estimates, blank production
   estimates should be assessed before each primary production experiment
   to consider the sediment matrix effect.},

Abstract = {Surgical cotton production has drastically been increased in the past
   few years due to excessive use by medical health professionals
   especially in countries like India, which is among the top three
   exporters of cotton worldwide. The effluent generated from surgical
   cotton industries differ from textile effluents by the conspicuous
   absence of dyeing chemicals. This wastewater has a high concentration of
   suspended particles, COD, dissolved ions, organic carbon, and alkaline
   pH. Several studies have been published on the treatment of textile
   effluents and the degradation of dyeing chemicals, while the treatment
   studies on surgical cotton wastewater have been rarely reported in spite
   of their potential to cause pollution in receiving land/water bodies.
   Activated sludge microbes have been extensively studied and well
   documented in the treatment of several industrial effluent but does not
   match to the production of valuable biomass from algae. The global
   energy demand has prompted the scientific community to investigate and
   explore the possibility of using algae for energy production with
   simultaneous wastewater treatment. To the best of the authors'
   knowledge, no research articles have been published which compare the
   effectiveness of activated sludge microorganisms, microalgae, and
   macroalgae in removing contaminants from real wastewater. To date, there
   is a knowledge gap in understanding and selecting the right choice of
   biological system for effective and economical effluent treatment. In an
   attempt to minimize this gap, carbon removal by microalgae, macroalgae,
   and activated sludge microbes were investigated on real effluent from
   surgical cotton industries. It was observed that the strain of Chlorella
   vulgaris could dissipate 83\% of COD from real wastewater, while
   consortia of macroalgae (consisting predominantly of Ulvaceae and
   Chaetomorpha) and activated sludge microbes could remove 81\% and 69\%
   of the carbon, respectively. The microalgal growth (in terms of wet
   weight) increased from 0.15 to 0.3 g, whereas the macroalgal wet weight
   increased from 1.5 to 3 g in over 7 days of batch experiments conducted
   in triplicates. This indicated the superlative performance of microalgae
   over activated sludge microbes in carbon dissipation.},

Abstract = {Interfacial solar-thermal water evaporation (STWE) shows considerable
   potential in terms of harvesting freshwater from the ocean; thereinto,
   the design of an efficient floatable material with low-cost and salt

   this work, we prepared an economical Janus complex for STWE by
   assembling commercial carbon nanotubes and porous cotton fiber paper,
   functionalized by silanization and combination of polyelectrolyte.
   Because of the synergy of efficient photothermal conversion, localized
   hot layer and fast transmission of water and vapor, the Janus complex
   displayed a superior evaporation rate of 3.443 kg m(-2) h(-1)under 5
   suns (5 kW m(-2)) in saltwater. Moreover, almost no salt was detected in
   the used Janus complex, and the salt deposition was rejected at the
   source due to the strong ionic strength of polyelectrolyte. These
   results indicated that the Janus complex has potential applications for
   water purification.},

Title = {Iron-bound carbon increases along a freshwater-oligohaline gradient in a
   subtropical tidal wetland},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Globally, a vast extent of tidal wetlands will be threatened by
   sea-level-rise-induced salinization. Because ferric (hydro)oxides
   {[}Fe(III)] play a crucial role in soil organic carbon (SOC)
   preservation, understanding the responses of the Fe-bound C pool to
   increasing salinity could assist in accurate prediction of the changes
   in C stocks in the tidal wetland soils facing imminent sea-level rise.
   In this study, we investigated pools of Fe-bound C and SOC, C-degrading
   enzyme activity, Fe species contents and Fe-cycling bacteria, and plant
   properties along a salinity gradient from freshwater (0.0 +/- 0.1 ppt;
   part per thousand) to oligohaline (2.6 +/- 0.6 ppt) in a subtropical
   tidal wetland. Overall, the belowground biomass and the content of root
   Fe(III) plaque (a proxy of root oxygen loss potential) rose with the
   increasing salinity. Along the salinity gradient, the abundance of
   Gallionella (Fe-oxidizing bacteria) increased, but the abundance of
   Geobacter (Fe-reducing bacteria) decreased. The Fe(II):Fe(III) ratios
   decreased as salinity increased, implying that more Fe(II) was oxidized
   and immobilized into Fe(III) closer to the sea. Fe sulfides contents
   also elevated close to sea. The co-existence of Fe(III) and Fe sulfides
   at the oligohaline sites implied a high spatial heterogeneity of Fe
   distribution. During the growing season, the SOC pool generally
   decreased with increasing salinity, probably due to a reduction in
   aboveground-C input and enhanced activity of the C-degrading enzyme. The
   Fe-bound C pool was positively affected by the amorphous Fe(III) content
   and negatively related to the activity of phenol oxidase. The Fe-bound C
   pool generally rose along the salinity gradient, with the importance of
   Fe-bound C to SOC increasing from 18\% to 29\%. Altogether, our findings
   implied that when the imminent sea-level-rise-induced salinization

Abstract = {The impact of the diverse processes responsible for the distribution of
   suspended sediments in the wide, shallow, and microtidal Rio de la Plata
   estuary and the adjacent shelf is studied by means of a set of
   process-oriented numerical simulations. Model results show that the
   large width and the geometry of the estuary play a major role in the
   sedimentation processes. The widening and deepening of the estuary
   drives a significant reduction in current speeds at (i) the confluence
   of the tributaries and (ii) downstream Barra del Indio Shoal. Thus,
   sediment deposition enhances downstream those areas. Even though tides
   are of small amplitude in the study area, they have a significant impact
   on lateral mixing and resuspension of the bottom sediments. Resuspension
   augments the concentration of fine sediments in the layers close to the
   bottom, but tidal energy is not enough to lift them to the surface.
   Winds (which can be quite strong over this area) enhance horizontal
   mixing, smoothing the pattern produced by tides. Wind waves increase the
   concentration of sediment by vertical mixing, and their effect is most
   evident along the southern coast where wind waves lift the sediments
   resuspended by tides to the surface. The estuarine circulations
   associated to the bottom salinity front acts retaining sediments
   upstream the Barra del Indio Shoal, where estuarine currents and
   flocculation play an important role in sediment deposition.},

   Beach nourishment has been used for several years as a means to solve
   the problem of coastal erosion, and it is considered to be one of the
   main tools for coastal management. It is however known that relict sand
   dredging can have a number of physical and biological effects on the
   marine environment. The main physical effects are related to
   morphological and sedimentological changes on the sea bottom and to the
   alteration of the chemical-physical characteristics of the water column
   due to sediment input. This paper aims to examine the physical effects
   of the dredging activities carried out in three sites of the Anzio
   (Rome, Italy) relict sand deposit in the central Tyrrhenian sea. A
   multi-year environmental survey was carried out to analyze different
   environmental parameters in order to assess the effects of relict sand
   mining on the marine environment. In particular, this paper reports the
   results of the grain size analysis and of the morphological and
   bathymetric surveys (high-resolution side scan sonar imagery and
   bathymetric maps) carried out before and after the dredgings, in order
   to identify the features and the extensions of the actuallty-impacted
   areas.},

Abstract = {Understanding the responses of mean and extreme precipitation to climate
   change is of great importance. Previous studies have mainly focused on
   the responses to prescribed sea surface warming or warming due to
   increases of CO2. This study uses a cloud-resolving model under the
   idealization of radiative-convective equilibrium to examine the
   responses of mean and extreme precipitation to a variety of climate
   forcings, including changes in prescribed sea surface temperature, CO2,
   solar insolation, surface albedo, stratospheric volcanic aerosols, and
   several tropospheric aerosols. The different responses of mean
   precipitation are understood by examining the changes in the surface
   energy budget. It is found that the cancellation between shortwave
   scattering and longwave radiation leads to a small dependence of the
   mean precipitation response on forcings. The responses of extreme
   precipitation are decomposed into three components (thermodynamic,
   dynamic, and precipitation efficiency). The thermodynamic components for
   all climate forcings are similar. The dynamic components and the
   precipitation-efficiency components, which have large spreads among the
   cases, are negatively correlated, leading to a small dependence of the
   extreme precipitation response on the forcings.},

Abstract = {In the present payer some preliminary results of an experiment performed
   in the Velebit Channel between 4 September and 11 October 1998 are
   discussed. Throughout the experiment currents were measured at three
   stations and two levels, using Aanderaa RCM-4S and RCM-7 current meters.
   At the beginning and end of the experiment the CTD profiling was done
   using a Sea Bird 17 probe, at the network of 27 stations positioned c.2
   NM apart. On the final day of the experiment the CTD profiles were also
   taken in the Zrmanja Estuary. All the experimental data could be
   compared with the tide-gauge records routinely collected at the nearby
   stations (Bakar, Zadar) and with the time series originating from the
   meteorological stations in the area (Senj, Obrovac, Sibenik).
   Meteorological data showed that during the summer 1998 rainfall was
   below the long-term average and that in September 1998 it suddenly
   surpassed not only the corresponding average but the upper
   standard-deviation limit as well. As a consequence of this anomaly, in
   the course of our experiment the salinity was considerably reduced in
   the Velebit Channel, mostly in the surface layer, thus enabling various
   freshwater discharges in the area to be quantitatively documented. As
   the interval between the two CTD surveys was also characterised by
   numerous sirocco and bora wind pulses, current meters simultaneously
   operating in the channel captured its response to the wind forcing. Both
   the density and current data indicated that the northern part of the
   Velebit Channel is predominantly influenced by the wind, whereas its
   southern part is mostly buoyancy driven. implications of these findings
   for the proposed construction of thermal power plant in the area are
   briefly commented upon.},

Abstract = {The demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the global markets has
   changed significantly. As a result, industries have been forced to
   consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an
   efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint
   reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation
   to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon
   footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and
   practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime
   transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon
   footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation
   model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main
   input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a
   multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver
   software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon
   footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam
   process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most
   sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and
   Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces
   more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are
   traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type
   of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the
   relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two
   conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found
   to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode. (C)

Abstract = {Aim The conservation of biodiversity is hampered by data deficiencies,
   with many new species and subspecies awaiting description or
   reclassification. Population genomics and ecological niche modelling
   offer complementary new tools for uncovering functional units of
   phylogenetic diversity. We hypothesize that phylogenetically delineated
   lineages of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) distributed across
   Antarctica and sub-Antarctic Islands are subject to spatially explicit
   ecological conditions that have limited gene flow, facilitating genetic
   differentiation, and thereby speciation processes.
   Location Antarctica and sub-Antarctic area.
   Methods We identify divergent lineages for gentoo penguins using
   ddRAD-seq and mtDNA, and generated species distribution models (SDMs)
   based on terrestrial and marine parameters.
   Results Analyses of our genomic data supports the existence of four
   major lineages of gentoo penguin: (i) spanning the sub-Antarctic
   archipelagos north of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF); (ii) Kerguelen
   Island; (iii) South America; and (iv) across maritime Antarctic and the
   Scotia Arc archipelagos. The APF, a major current system around
   Antarctica, acts as the most important barrier separating regional
   sister lineages. Our ecological analyses spanning both the terrestrial
   (breeding sites) and marine (feeding sites) realms recover limited niche
   overlap among the major lineages of gentoo penguin. We observe this
   pattern to correspond more closely with regional differentiation of
   marine conditions than to terrestrial macroenvironmental features.
   Main conclusions Recognition of regional genetic lineages as discrete
   evolutionary entities that occupy distinct ecological niches and also
   differ morphologically should be considered a priority for conservation.
   Gentoo penguins provide a good example of how conservation policy can be
   directly impacted by new insights obtained through the integration of
   larger genomic datasets with novel approaches to ecological modelling.
   This is particularly pertinent to polar environments that are among the
   most rapidly changing environments on earth.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},

Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {We investigate decadal variations in the three-dimensional structure of
   the California Current System (CCS) upwelling cells as a potential
   mechanism for explaining observed ecosystem changes after the mid-1970s.
   To this end, we track the origin of upwelled water masses using adjoint
   passive tracers during time periods corresponding to the positive and
   negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in a 55 year
   regional ocean model simulation of the CCS. Results show that in the PDO
   ``cool'' phase (pre mid-1970s), the upwelling cell is deeper while
   during the ``warm'' phase (post mid-1970s), the upwelling cell is
   shallower with more horizontal entrainment of surface waters from the
   north. These changes in the coastal upwelling cell exhibit a latitudinal
   non-uniformity and may result in significant changes of the nutrient
   flux, which would have important impacts on the biological productivity
   of the coastal ocean.},

Title = {A hydrophobic-hydrophilic MXene/PVDF composite hollow fiber membrane
   with enhanced antifouling properties for seawater desalination},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {644},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Hollow fiber membrane-based humidification-dehumidification desalination
   of seawater is a low-carbon freshwater-harvesting technology that can be
   powered by low-grade solar energy. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) can be
   easily fabricated into membranes and is considered the most promising
   material for industrial seawater desalination. However, membrane fouling
   and wetting have always been major obstacles with this technology. In
   this study, a hydrophobic-hydrophilic MXene/PVDF composite hollow fiber
   membrane (PVDF-MP) with remarkable antiwetting and antifouling
   properties was successfully prepared using a chemical grafting method.
   The interfacial dehydration reaction between the hydrophilic substrate
   layer (PVDF-OH) and the hydrophobic skin layer (MXene-P {[}MP]) was
   verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, and a detailed reaction mechanism was
   provided. The hydrophilic substrate layer decreased moisture transfer
   resistance, while the hydrophobic skin layer reduced the membrane
   surface energy and increased the surface roughness. This resulted in a
   contact angle of 156.2 degrees, which was measured using a new method
   that accounted for the curvature of the membrane. The superhydmphobic
   surface possessed a strong repulsive force toward water, and the air gap
   between the water and membrane impeded pollutant deposition on the inner
   surface of the membrane. Moreover, the rough surface created high entry
   pressure and prevented water from entering the membrane pores. Thus, the
   permeate flux of the PVDF-MP membrane persisted over 120 h during
   desalination tests, surpassing the performance of traditional materials.},

Abstract = {The cold energy in many liquefied natural gas (LNG) satellite stations
   is directly carried away by air or seawater. This causes cold energy
   waste and environmental cold pollution. To solve this problem, a
   combined power, heating and cooling system (CCHP) driven by LNG is
   established based on solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and humid air turbine
   (HAT), namely SOFC-HAT-CCHP system, in which, not only can the waste
   cold energy cool compressor inlet air to decrease power consumption, but
   supply cold energy for the cold storage and CO2 recovery. Based on
   FORTRAN and Aspen Plus, the thermodynamic performance calculation models
   and the simulation work of the new system are carried out, such as the
   exergy and energy analysis, as well as the effects of the selected
   important variables. The results indicate that total exergy efficiency
   and total power efficiency are 64.7\% and 54.4\%, and the total thermal
   efficiency is 79.1\%. Besides, the capture rate and purity of the CO2
   are 98.7\% and 98.9\% respectively. The novel system is environmental
   protective, energy-saving and efficient, which may provide a new
   direction to reasonably analysis utilize the waste cold energy in LNG
   satellite stations. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published

Abstract = {The export of Dendrobium cut-flowers from Thailand to overseas markets
   has been done by air shipment. Air shipment is the quickest possible
   delivery but it includes a high air freight cost and limited cargo
   space. Possible alternative shipment methods to deliver Dendrobium
   cut-flowers to Asian markets are under-considered. Shipment by sea is a
   novel practice that should be considered for long-term transportation.
   We investigated the effect of storage temperature during the 3-day
   shipment of Dendrobium cut-flowers. Cut inflorescences of four
   Dendrobium cultivars, namely, `Sonia 17', `Anna', `Sanan White' and
   `Fatima' were packed wet under simulated shipment for export and stored
   at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C for 3 days. The storage temperature at 10
   degrees C induced chilling injuries of bud abscissions in all four
   Dendrobium cultivars but it had no effect on open flowers. The optimal
   storage temperature of each cultivar was different. A temperature of 15
   degrees C was optimum for `Anna', while a temperature of 15 and 20
   degrees C was optimum for `Sonia 17', `Khoa Sanan' and `Fatima'.
   Three-day sea shipment of cut Dendrobium flowers for Asian markets may
   be possible with the ideal storage temperature during transportation at
   15 degrees C. The customers will then have the option to use cut flowers
   for about 15 days.},

Abstract = {Despite significant cost reductions and reliability improvements in
   recent decades, combined heat and power (CHP) stationary fuel cells are
   expected to remain relatively limited in their commercial acceptance
   until additional advancements are realized.
   In the present study, three stationary CHP fuel cell technologies -
   phosphoric acid (PAFC), molten carbonate (MCFC), and solid oxide (SOFC)
   - operating in the 100-400 kWe range were examined with process based
   cost models to estimate manufacturing costs and to highlight high cost
   steps where alternative production methods may have the greatest
   potential for high impact cost reduction. PAFC manufacturing costs,
   estimated to be \$3049/kWe for a baseline manufacturing volume of 20
   MWe/yr, may benefit most from reduced catalyst loading, lower cost
   substrates, reduced fuel processing balance of plant (BOP) costs, and
   near net shape bipolar plate manufacturing. MCFC manufacturing costs,
   while not reported in detail due to the proprietary nature of inputs
   employed in the model, may be reduced through advances in fuel
   desulfurization and stainless steel stack component manufacturing. SOFC
   manufacturing costs, estimated to be \$1242/kWe, approach a commercially
   acceptable level, but significant advancements in seal and bipolar plate
   reliability are likely required before a commercially acceptable stack
   life of 40,000 hours is realized.},

Abstract = {The published schemes of the net alongshore sediment transport near the
   eastern coast of Gdansk Bay have been systematized. Considerable
   discrepancies have been identified in the structure and localization of
   the convergence zones of opposite currents. The results of station-based
   measurements of bottom currents near the Strait of Baltiysk at depths of
   6-16 m were used to show that, at winds >6 m/s, the alongshore currents
   run along the alongshore wind component. The morphodynamic accumulation
   (filling of the entry corner and abrasion in the shadow zone of the
   obstacle) and abrasion (orientation of the abrasion depression at the
   extreme end of the harbor moles) criteria are discussed. The abrasion
   criterion is shown to work better than the accumulation criterion in
   determining the net sediment transport in the coastal reaches with a
   normal or near-normal approach angle of the wave energy flow toward the
   shore. The specific features of the mechanism of sediment transport from
   south to north, by-passing Baltiisk harbor moles, from the abrasion to
   accumulation shore segments are given. Two schemes of the opposite
   Vistula and Sambian alongshore sediment flows are proposed: before the
   construction of the entry harbor moles in the Baltic Strait with a vast
   migration zone near the northern end of the Vistula Spit and after the
   construction of these moles, which has narrowed this zone and shifted
   its southern boundary northward toward the moles.},

Abstract = {Coastal cities play an important role in regional economic development
   and sustainable development strategies of water resources and their
   ecological environment. As a typical coastal city in Hebei Province,
   Qinhuangdao city is facing severe problems, such as water shortages and
   water environment deterioration, while social and economic development
   continues. Based on input-output analysis, we established a dynamic
   optimization model among Qinhuangdao city's socioeconomic development,
   water resources and water environment. The 2013-2030 simulation after
   introducing comprehensive water resources policies of regional
   development, examines the regional socioeconomic development, optimizes
   the water resources supply structure and improves the water environment
   under the optimal scenario, and evaluates policy feasibility through
   cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The simulation results suggest that under
   the optimal scenario, the water-use efficiency (WE) of Qinhuangdao is
   improved by 59.14\% and the proportion of reclaimed water and
   desalinated seawater in the water supply structure is increased by
   13.70\%. In addition, it has achieved an average annual gross regional
   production (GRP) growth rate of 6.36\% and an average annual chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) emission rate of 17.95\%. Moreover, the net present
   value (NPV) of the projects under the optimal scenario is 1.534 billion
   Chinese yuan (CNY), which means that the policy is economically
   feasible. Our research is helpful to improve the WE, optimize the water
   supply structure and protect the hydrogeological environment in coastal
   cities with water shortages and can provide a reference for Qinhuangdao
   city and other similar coastal cities to realize the rational
   utilization of water resources and regional sustainable development.},

Abstract = {The ocean section along the 24.5degreesN has been one of the most
   frequently sampled of the world's oceans. It has been sampled in 1957,
   1981, 1992 and 1998. Previous works showed a progressive warming and

   m to 3000 m. The maximum warming rate was 0.009degreesC/yr at 1100 m.
   The eastern part of this section was sampled in 2002. The warming of the
   main thermocline has continued at a higher rate (0.042degrees/yr at 400
   m) in the last 10 years. Salinity has also increased along the
   thermocline conserving the 1992 thetaS relationship. From 100 to 1000
   db, the warming is mainly due to downward displacement of the
   isopycnals, though some cooling along isopycnals is also observed in the
   upper 350 db.},

Title = {Fine-Scale Urban Heat Patterns in New York City Measured by ASTER
   Satellite-The Role of Complex Spatial Structures},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban areas have very complex spatial structures. These spatial
   structures are primarily composed of a complex network of built
   environments, which evolve rapidly as the cities expand to meet the
   growing population's demand and economic development. Therefore,
   studying the impact of spatial structures on urban heat patterns is
   extremely important for sustainable urban planning and growth. We
   investigated the relationship between surface temperature obtained by
   the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer
   (ASTER, at 90 m spatial resolution) and different urban components based
   on high-resolution QuickBird satellite imagery classification. We
   further investigated the relationships between ASTER-derived surface
   temperature and building footprint and land use information acquired by
   the New York City (NYC) Department of City Planning. The ASTER image
   reveals fine-scale urban heat patterns in the NYC metropolitan region.
   The impervious-medium and dark surfaces, along with bright covers,
   generate higher surface temperatures. Even with highly reflective urban
   surfaces, the presence of impervious materials leads to an increased
   surface temperature. At the same time, trees and shadows cast by
   buildings effectively reduce urban heat; on the contrary, grassland does
   not reduce or amplify urban heat. The data aggregated to the census
   tract reveals high-temperature hotspots in Queens, Brooklyn, and the
   Bronx region of NYC. These clusters are associated with industrial and
   manufacturing areas and multi-family walk-up buildings as dominant land
   use. The census tracts with more trees and higher building height
   variability showed cooling effects, consistent with shadows cast by
   high-rise buildings and trees. The results of this study can be valuable
   for urban heat island modeling on the impact of shadow generated by
   building heights variability and trees on small-scale surface
   temperature patterns since recent image reveals similar hotspot
   locations. This study further helps identify the risk areas to protect
   public health.},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Seawater acidification can be induced both by absorption of atmospheric
   carbon dioxide (CO2) and by atmospheric deposition of sulfur and
   nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Their relative significance, interplay, and
   dependency on water column biogeochemistry are not well understood.
   Using a simple biogeochemical model we show that the initial conditions
   of coastal systems are not only relevant for CO2-induced acidification
   but also for additional acidification due to atmospheric acid
   deposition. Coastal areas undersaturated with respect to CO2 are most
   vulnerable to CO2-induced acidification but are relatively least
   affected by additional atmospheric deposition-induced acidification. In
   contrast, the pH of CO2-supersaturated systems is most sensitive to
   atmospheric deposition. The projected increment in atmospheric CO2 by
   2100 will increase the sensitivity of coastal systems to atmospheric
   deposition-induced acidification by up to a factor 4, but the additional
   annual change in proton concentration is at most 28\%.
   Key Points
   Seawater acidification by absorption of CO2 and atmospheric deposition
   co-occur CO2-supersaturated seawater is especially susceptible to
   atmospheric deposition By 2100 coastal seas become more sensitive to any
   proton transferring process},

Abstract = {The development of abrasion-landslide processes on the north-west coast
   of the Black Sea depends on several factors: geological structure, slope
   exposure, neotectonic, climatic and hydrodynamic conditions. However,
   the nature of this relation is not always obvious and insufficiently
   studied. The goal is to identify patterns of spatial and temporal
   development of landslide processes in the north-west coast of the Black
   Sea. Methods of correlation-regression, and spectral analysis were used.
   Periods of activation of landslide processes depending on changing
   climatic and hydrodynamic conditions were determined. On the south-west
   from the Odessa bay, abrasion process is described by dependence model
   abrasion indicators from wind wave energy, width of a beach and a
   precipitation. On the east from the Odessa bay the most proved model is
   dependence between abrasion indicators, sea level and a precipitation.
   Beaches have a significant role in the rate of abrasion and landslide
   processes. Gentle slopes at some sections of the beaches are the result
   of the predominance of silt and clay components in abraded loess strata
   of coastal slopes. All identified patterns have significant correlation
   coefficients (r > 0.5). It was found that the landslide processes in
   relation to climate and hydrodynamic impacts have a delay of 1-2 years,
   due to the inertia of the coastal geological system.},

Abstract = {An evacuated thermal insulation panel has been developed consisting of
   glass panes as covers and a powder filling. Several powder materials and
   mixtures of powders have been tested regarding their thermal
   conductivity and the critical gas pressure for the onset of gas
   conductivity. With an opacified precipitated silica powder a thermal
   conductivity of less than 0.003 W/mK could be reached if evacuated below
   0.1 mbar. A value of 0.004 W/mK has been measured at an internal gas
   pressure of I mbar. A crucial point of panel design is the rim seal
   which should provide a negligible gas permeation and a small thermal
   heat transfer coefficient. With very thin stainless steel foils these
   requirements could be met.},

Abstract = {Carbonaceous components {[}organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC),
   water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), primary organic carbon (POC),
   secondary organic carbon (SOC) and carbonaceous aerosols (CAs)] and
   major and trace elements (Na, Mg, Ca, Al, Fe, Ti, Cl, P, S, K, Cr, Ni,
   Cu, Zn, Mo and B) of PM10 were studied over the eastern Himalayan high
   altitude station {[}Darjeeling: 27.01 degrees N and 88.15 degrees E,
   2200 m average mean sea level (amsl)] during winter 2018-19 (December
   2018-February 2019). The carbonaceous aerosols/species (CAs) contributed
   to similar to 23\% of PM10 mass concentration, whereas major and trace
   elements accounted for 10\% of PM10. During the entire study period, the
   average concentrations of PM10, OC, EC, WSOC, POC, SOC and CAs were
   recorded as 48 +/- 16 mu g m(-3), 5.39 +/- 1.84 mu g m(-3), 2.60 +/-
   0.94 mu g m(-3), 3.87 +/- 1.18 mu g m(-3), 3.40 +/- 1.23 mu g m(-3),
   1.99 +/- 1.03 mu g m(-3) and 11.21 +/- 3.78 mu g m(-3), respectively.
   Significant positive correlation between OC \& EC and OC \& WSOC have
   been observed which are indicating their common sources. WSOC/OC ratio
   was estimated to be 0.71 suggesting that the biomass burning is one of
   the major sources of carbonaceous aerosols at Darjeeling during winter.
   The significant positive correlation of PM10 with crustal elements (Al,
   Fe, Ca, Mg and Ti) as well as the correlation of Al with other crustal
   elements (Fe, Ca, Mg and Ti) indicates the abundance of mineral dust at
   the sampling site. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified the
   contribution of crustal/soil dust, biomass + coal burning, vehicular
   emissions and solid waste to the PM10 over the eastern Himalayan region
   of India.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that surface wave breaking can impact
   upper-ocean turbulence through wave-breaking-induced turbulence kinetic
   energy (TKE) flux and momentum flux. Wave-breaking-induced momentum flux
   decays approximately exponentially with depth, and the decay exponent
   depends on both the wind speed and wave age. With increasing wave age,
   the decay speed of wave-breaking-induced momentum flux first decreases,
   reaching a minimum around a wave age of 16, and then increases. In this
   study, a wave-breaking-induced momentum flux parameterization was
   proposed based on wave age and wind-speed dependence. The new proposed
   parameterization was introduced into a one-dimensional (1-D) ocean model
   along with a wave-age-dependent wave-breaking-induced TKE flux
   parameterization. The simulation results showed that the wave-breaking
   impact on the ocean mainly affected the upper-ocean layer. Adding the
   wave-age impact to the wave-breaking-induced TKE flux and momentum flux
   improved the 1-D model performance concerning the sea temperature.
   Moreover, the wave-breaking-induced momentum flux had a larger impact on
   the simulation results than the wave-breaking-induced TKE flux.},

Abstract = {The increasing use of fossil fuels has a significant impact on the
   environment and ecosystem, which increases the rate of pollution. Given
   the high potential of renewable energy sources in Yemen and the absence
   of similar studies in the region, this study aims to examine the
   potential of wind energy in Socotra Island. This was done by analyzing
   and evaluating wind properties, determining available energy density,
   calculating wind energy extracted at different altitudes, and then
   computing the capacity factor for a number of wind turbines and
   determining the best. The average wind speed in Socotra Island was
   obtained from the Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority data, only
   for the five-year data currently available. The results showed high wind
   speeds from June to September (9.85-14.88 m/s) while the wind speed
   decreased for the rest of the year. The average wind speed in the five
   years was 7.95 m/s. The average annual wind speed, wind energy density,
   and annual energy density were calculated at different altitudes (10,
   30, and 50 m). According to the International Wind Energy Rating
   criteria, the region of Socotra Island falls under Category 7 and is
   classified as `Superb' for most of the year. This study provides useful
   information for developing wind energy and an efficient wind approach.},

Abstract = {To model climate in the distant geological past, we assume that the
   physical processes involved are the same as those built into models of
   present-day climate, but that certain of the boundary conditions were
   different. As regards the Mesozoic, the major changes in boundary
   condition would be to continental positions, mountain elevations, and
   sea level; these change only on timescales of the order 10(6)  years.
   However, during the past million years, with today's boundary
   conditions, climate has undergone enormous and rapid fluctuations. The
   examination of these more recent changes gives us very considerable
   insight into the myriad interactions whereby oceanic and atmospheric
   chemical composition, the marine and continental biosphere, the surface
   albedo as well as temperate-latitude ice volume and low-latitude aridity
   have all fluctuated in response to rather subtle changes in the
   latitudinal and seasonal redistribution of solar energy. At present we
   can only construct a general circulation model of the climate of today,
   or of the last ice age, by specifying many of the components of the
   global climate system that ought to be treated as unknown variables. The
   models constructed by Gallee et al. (1991, 1992, 1993) point to the
   characteristics required to simulate a glacial-interglacial cycle.
   Despite this, we are a long way from actually understanding how climate
   actually changes on this timescale. In particular, it is difficult to
   understand how the climate system was able to build ice sheets as
   quickly as they appear to have formed (Rind et al. 1989).},

Abstract = {We apply several skill tests to assess tidal currents within a
   three-dimensional, eddy resolving, global ocean circulation model
   compared to over 5000 observational velocity records spanning 40 years.
   We examine the skill of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) on a
   regional, basin, and global scale and in deep versus shallow water. On a
   global scale, we examine the model tidal kinetic energy (KE) compared to
   the tidal KE estimated from the observational velocity records. We
   examine the vertical structure of the model tidal KE by averaging over
   predetermined depth bins. We also investigate the ability of the model
   to satisfy the 95\% confidence intervals of the individual tidal ellipse
   parameters. On a basin scale, we determine if any bias exists in model
   performance with regards to a particular part of the global ocean and
   further investigate if any variability of model skill exists within the
   ocean basins by testing the model against smaller subsets of the
   observations. Our results show that the skill of the nondata
   assimilative HYCOM is comparable to the skill of the
   altimetric-constrained model TPXO7.2. HYCOM is shown to have up to 20\%
   higher skill in resolving the Greenwich phase of the tides on a global
   basis and demonstrates moderate skill in replicating the vertical
   structure of the tidal currents as represented by the current meters.
   HYCOM demonstrates up to 20\% higher skill than TPXO7.2 for some ocean
   basins and some ocean regions but exhibits up to 20\% weaker skill in
   the Southern Ocean.},

Abstract = {Results of a field experiment carried out in 1991 to gather upper-air
   data on the morning-glory environment are presented. The data include
   daily early morning radiosonde soundings from Burketown in north
   Queensland, Australia, for a 28-day period during the late dry season,
   together with pressure, Hind, temperature, and humidity data from a
   number of surface stations in the region. During the experiment, 16
   morning glories were recorded. On all but one day, radiosonde soundings
   were carried out in the pre-morning-glory environment. On 7 days,
   additional soundings were carried out within an hour or two of the
   passage of a morning glory.
   Soundings made on days on which morning glories were generated over Cape
   York Peninsula but failed to reach Burketown are compared with those on
   days when morning glories were recorded at Burketown. The comparison
   shows that the depth and strength of the surface-based inversion did not
   differ significantly and that the stratification of the almost neutral
   layer above the stable laver was similar on days with and without
   morning glories. An examination of the wind profiles is unrevealing and
   leads the authors to reject the hypothesis that the trapping of wave
   energy is the key factor that determines the longevity of the
   disturbances. That the leakiness of the wave-guide is not the only
   factor in the ability of disturbances to cover large distances from
   their place of origin is consistent with a numerical study by Noonan and
   Smith, which suggests that the morning-glory bore-wave system is formed
   and maintained by mesoscale circulations associated with the sea breezes
   over Cape York Peninsula.},

Title = {Divergent trends of urban thermal environmental characteristics in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {287},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Due to the rapid urbanization in China, urban expansion has gradually
   shifted from large cities to small cities, causing spatiotemporal
   changes in the urban thermal environment. The differential thermal
   environmental characteristics of 334 cities at different hierarchy
   caused by urbanization are investigated in this study. Then, the
   spatiotemporal changes of land surface temperature (LST), albedo, and
   emissivity among urban areas and their surrounding buffer areas are
   analyzed during 2000-2015. We found that the urban warming effect is
   usually prominent in the daytime, with an obvious seasonal
   differentiation between 0.32 degrees C{[}0.27, 0.38] in summer and -0.14
   degrees C{[}-0.20, -0.07] in winter. The nighttime warming effect during
   summer resembles that in winter, in the range 0.23-0.25 degrees C. In
   addition, the number of cities with intensifying trends of the warming
   effect in summer daytime account for 50\% of the total cities, but only
   9\% in winter nighttime, 23\% in summer nighttime, and 25\% in winter
   daytime. Large cities usually have obvious warming effects compared with
   small cities. But the highest warming effect is found in megacities
   during the daytime and in medium cities during the nighttime. In
   southern subtropical cities, the warming of urban zones is high in the
   daytime and low in the nighttime, while it is opposite in arid and
   semiarid regions, especially in winter. The negative correlations
   between the difference of surface albedo (emissivity) and LST in
   megacities and metropolitan areas emphasize that nighttime warming
   primarily results from radiation absorption and release affected by
   urbanization. This study may advance the understanding of the
   heterogeneity in the warming effects of different cities in China and
   support policy formulation and regulation to adapt to urban warming. (C)

Title = {European Windstorm Risk of Post-Tropical Cyclones and the Impact of
   Climate Change},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Sainsbury et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL089853)
   highlighted the fact that although post-tropical cyclones only consist
   of a small part of the cyclones impacting Northern Europe (similar to
   1\%) during the hurricane season, their contribution to storms with at
   least storm force (>25 m/s) is about 10 times larger and therefore pose
   a substantial windstorm risk for Northern Europe. Overall postTCs
   impacting Northern Europe are significantly more intense than
   midlatitude cyclones. This is related to their combined tropical (warm
   seawater) and midlatitude (baroclinic instability) energy source. A few
   studies have suggested that in a warmer climate the amount and intensity
   of post-tropical cyclones might increase due to stronger tropical
   cyclones (TCs), warmer oceans, and pole and eastward extension of TC
   genesis regions. This would further enhance the windstorm risk of
   post-TCs. Further high-resolution modeling research is required to
   delineate this risk.
   Plain Language Summary In the analyses of European windstorm risk,
   generally only winter storms that develop over the North Atlantic are
   considered. However, Sainsbury et al. (2020, https://doi.
   org/10.1029/2020GL089853) made clear that remnants of tropical cyclones
   (TCs) (hurricanes over the Atlantic), although being only a small
   fraction (similar to 1\%) of the total storms reaching Europe during the
   hurricane season, need also to be taken into consideration. In terms of
   severe wind storms their fraction is about 10-fold (similar to 10\%).
   Their average strength is also larger than that of other storms. A few
   studies have suggested that the amount and intensity of those remnants
   of TCs that reach Europe might increase due to climate change, thereby
   further increasing their windstorm risk. Further research with climate
   models is required to further investigate the potentially high windstorm
   risk for Europe in the future of those remnants of TCs.},

Title = {Drying effects on sorption capacity of coastal sediment: The importance

Year = {2006},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Investigations on how desiccation changes sorption of organic compounds
   by salt marsh sediments provide insight into the physical and chemical
   properties of these wide-spread coastal sediments. We measured sorption
   of compounds with different polarities (lysine, tyrosine, naphthalene
   and aniline) onto natural sediments and sediments that were dried and
   rewetted. Sorption of lysine by marsh sediment decreased significantly
   when the sediment was dried using a freeze-drier, oven, or desiccator.
   and sorption capacity was not restored when sediments were rewetted. In
   contrast to lysine, the sorption capacity of more hydrophobic compounds
   (tyrosine, aniline and naphthalene) increased significantly after salt
   marsh sediment was dried. These results suggest that drying greatly
   increased sediment hydrophobicity. Consistently, water drop penetration
   time, an index of hydrophobicity, was significantly lower for combusted
   sediments than for those that were simply dried. Sediments treated with
   EDTA, or boiled in seawater, exhibited a similar or even greater
   reduction in lysine sorption capacity compared with sediments that were
   dried. Water retention capacity of salt marsh sediment decreased 50\%
   after sediment was dried. The effects of pH and salinity on lysine
   sorption in wet and dry sediments suggest that carboxyl groups play a
   major role in lysine sorption through cation ion exchange, and drying
   may reduce access to carboxyl groups. We hypothesize that the
   three-dimensional (3D) structure of organic matter, originating mainly
   from Spartina alterniflora, is an important factor controlling sorption
   capacity in salt marsh sediment. The drying process makes sedimentary
   organic matter change conformation, shrink in volume, and expose
   hydrophobic groups, thus becoming more hydrophobic. In environments with
   wet and dry cycles. the distribution of hydrophobic or hydrophilic
   compounds between solution and particulate phases could thus be
   influenced by the 3D structure and polarity of organic matter. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Historic shipwrecks function as habitats for benthic organisms by
   providing food, refuge, and structure. They also form islands of
   biodiversity on the seabed, shaping microbial ecology and ecosystem
   processes. This study examined two wooden deep-sea shipwrecks at 525 and
   1800 m water depth and probed their influence on sediment microbiomes
   and geochemistry. Microbiomes were investigated with 16S rRNA gene
   amplicon sequencing along 60 m transects extending in four directions
   from the hulls of the shipwrecks. Distance from shipwrecks and sediment
   depth both shaped microbiome structure. Archaeal alpha diversity was
   significantly and positively correlated with proximity to the deeper
   shipwreck while bacterial diversity was not to either. Archaeal
   community structure differed at both sites; the deeper site had a higher
   proportion of Bathyarchaeia and Lokiarchaeia proximate to shipwreck
   compared to the shallow location. Major bacterial communities were
   consistent at both sites, however, at the deeper site had higher
   abundance of Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Desulfofarculales, and
   Desulfobacteriales. Core microbiome and differential abundance analyses
   revealed unique taxa nearest the shipwrecks compared to the surrounding
   seabed including organoheterotrophs, and cellulolytic and sulfur cycling
   taxa. Sediment carbon content influenced microbiome structure near the
   shipwrecks (5-10 m). We show that shipwrecks have a distinct sediment
   microbiome and form unique habitat patches on seabed, resembling those
   surrounding organic falls. The shipwreck influence was more pronounced
   at the deeper site, further from terrestrial influences signaling
   shipwrecks may be a significant source of organic matter in far-shore
   oligotrophic settings.},

Journal = {GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {473-479},
Abstract = {The origin of organic matter in recent anoxic sediments of the alpine
   Lake Bled (NW Slovenia) was determined by analyzing the carbon isotope
   composition of lipid biomarkers, i.e. alkanes, alcohols, sterols and
   fatty acids, busing compound specific, carbon isotope analysis. The
   results indicate that, although biomarker analysis indicated mostly
   plankton and terrestrial sources for lipids, an important part of
   sedimentary lipids, especially sterols, are autochthonous, of anaerobic
   microbial (methanotrophic) origin. Marked differences were observed in
   delta C-13 values of lipid biomarkers in settling particles collected 2
   m above the bottom, and in delta C-13 values determined in surface
   sediment. These results indicate that even some compounds found in both
   particulate organic matter and sediments are the same in terms of
   chemical structures, their sources can be different and thus, isotopic
   composition should be used as a complementary tool for source
   identification.},

   abalone fed CS100 had a lower weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate
   than abalone fed the other diets; however, there was no significant
   difference among abalone fed Con, CS20, CS40, CS60, and CS80. Abalone
   fed Con, CS20, and CS40 had a higher feed efficiency and protein
   efficiency ratio than abalone fed CS100 diet, although there were no
   significant differences among abalone fed Con, CS20, CS40, CS60, and
   CS80. Abalone fed CS100 had a lower whole-body crude lipid content than
   did abalone fed Con. Broken-line analysis for WG indicated that dietary
   SWP was successfully replaced by CS up to 74.8\%. Based on growth
   performance, CS could replace more than 74.8\% but less than 80\% of SWP
   in juvenile abalone diets.},

Abstract = {During the Permian, a large carbonate platform developed on Gondwana
   continental crust adjacent to the Indian Shield. The various carbonates
   and mixed carbonate/siliciclastic rocks record major depositional
   sequences, and are a sedimentary expression of variations in the
   depositional environment. As a result of the facies analysis in the Salt
   Range and Trans Indus Ranges several sequences, bounded by sequence
   boundaries, are distinguished within the Zaluch Group and the basal
   Kathwai Member (Mianwali Formation). The Amb Formation (Wordian)
   represents a complete sequence bounded by sequence boundaries associated
   with hiatuses. The maximum flooding occurred within marly, fossiliferous
   carbonates of the Jan Sukh Member. The second sequence comprises the
   lower Wargal Formation (Capitanian). A climatic change towards higher
   water temperatures took place, accompanied by decreased terrigenous
   input from the hinterland. A carbonate platform developed with scattered
   coral patches. Them, third sequence (Wuchiapingian) is represented by
   the upper part of the Wargal Formation, again a carbonate platform with
   coral patch reefs and abundant bars composed of echinodermal debris.
   Within the Chhidru Formation each member. represents its own sequence
   with basal terrigenous sandstones and overlying mixed
   carbonate/sandstone associations. The `White Sandstone Unit' is
   interpreted as a further lowstand system tract of Changhsingian age. The
   lowest part of the Kathwai Member of the Mianwali Formation is still
   Changlisingian in age, and indicates final Permian transgression.
   Transgression continued during the basal Triassic. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {A number of numerical methods have been developed to predict the
   performance and aerodynamic loads of the Darrieus turbine. Prior work by
   Reference {[}1] using blade element methods (BEM) and free vortex
   methods (FVM) {[}2] has produced reasonable models that predict the
   hydrodynamic performance of the Darrieus turbine. The validated models
   reasonably estimate the performance at low solidities (Nc/R<<1), but
   lose accuracy at higher solidity ratios. Dynamic stall and flow
   curvature has been recognized by {[}2] {[}3] and {[}4] to be significant
   modeling parameters which have limited the accuracy of prior models. The
   current numerical model extends the predictions of the FVM model to a
   higher solidity ratio range. An improved model is presented for the
   condition of high angles of attack and for dynamic stall,. Experimental
   data on a series of two (Nc/R approximate to.9) and four (Nc/ R
   approximate to 1.8) blade configurations are presented as validation of
   the modified analytical vortex model.
   Tidal Energy has the potential to be an important source to diversify
   and provide affordable renewable power to people near coastal areas.
   However, some of the best tidal currents available are near sensitive
   areas for fish spawning and feeding. For this reason, any device that is
   to be designed for installation in this environment has to minimize
   impact on these fragile ecosystems. The Darrieus turbine offers an
   attractive alternative design because of these environmental
   considerations. High solidity turbines are of interest since they
   operate at lower tip speed ratios and allow for lower pressure gradients
   along the blade. These characteristics have the potential to reduce
   environmental impact on marine fauna, as the conditions of excessive
   mechanical strike, cavitations, shear and large pressure gradients are
   minimized while maintaining reasonable power coefficient values.
   In order to analyze the performance of the high solidity Darrieus
   turbine, the FVM model was chosen to model the turbine and wake with
   discrete vortex segments, which were then used to determine the induced
   velocities at the blade. Although the computational expense is greater
   than with other methods, like BEM models, FVM models can better predict
   the turbine performance at higher tip to flow speed ratios and higher
   rotor solidities. These methods also have the advantage of providing
   information of the wake profile and can be extended to provide
   information on the interaction of different devices.
   The lifting line FVM model requires the lift and drag curves to be
   prescribed for a given hydrofoil profile. Experimental data have shown
   that the dynamic stall contribution is higher than expected at low tip
   speed ratios for high solidity Darrieus turbines. Because of the complex
   nature of the problem, an empirical lift model based on theoretical
   foundation is used. An approximation of the known asymptotic limit
   values was used to account for the dynamic stall behavior.
   In order to validate the empirical lift model for the FVM, a set of
   experiments was conducted using NACA 63018 blades at different toe
   angles, tip speed ratios, and free stream velocities. Results will be
   shown for a numerical model of high solidity Darrieus type cross flow
   turbines which have been experimentally validated. High solidity rotors
   (1 < Nc/R < 2) were tested and modeled for conditions of blade dynamic
   stall and other effects.},

Abstract = {The Petit-Saut ecosystem is a hydroelectric reservoir covering 365 km(2)
   of flooded tropical forest. This reservoir and the Sinnamary Estuary
   downstream of the dam are subject to significant mercury methylation.
   The mercury methylation potential of plankton and biofilm
   microorganisms/components from different depths in the anoxic reservoir
   water column and from two different sites along the estuary was
   assessed. For this, reservoir water and samples of epiphytic biofilms
   from the trunk of a submerged tree in the anoxic water column and from
   submerged branches in the estuary were batch-incubated from 1 h to 3
   months with a nominal 1000 ng/L spike of Hg(II) chloride enriched in
   Hg-199. Methylation rates were determined for different reservoir and
   estuarine communities under natural nutrient (reservoir water, estuary
   freshwater) and artificial nutrient (culture medium) conditions.
   Methylation rates in reservoir water incubations were the highest with
   plankton microorganisms sampled at -9.5 m depth (0.5\%/d) without
   addition of biofilm components. Mercury methylation rates of incubated
   biofilm components were strongly enhanced by nutrient addition. The
   results suggested that plankton microorganisms strongly contribute to
   the total Hg methylation in the Petit-Saut reservoir and in the
   Sinnamary Estuary. Moreover, specific methylation efficiencies
   (\%(MeHgnet)-Hg-199/cell) suggested that plankton microorganisms could
   be more efficient methylating actors than biofilm consortia and that
   their methylation efficiency may be reduced in the presence of biofilm
   components. Extrapolation to the reservoir scale of the experimentally
   determined preliminary methylation efficiencies suggested that plankton
   microorganisms in the anoxic water column could produce up to 27 mol
   MeHg/year. Taking into account that (i) demethylation probably occurs in
   the reservoir and (ii) that the presence of biofilm components may limit
   the methylation efficiency of plankton microorganisms, this result is
   highly consistent with the annual net MeHg production estimated from
   mass balances (8.1 mol MeHg/year, Muresan et al., 2008a). (C) 2009

Abstract = {Global warming is increasing the frequency and duration of heat waves,
   which is defined as when air temperature exceeds a threshold for more
   than specific consecutive days. Ecosystem around the globe will be
   impaired by heat waves just like the exposures to dangerously high
   temperatures as a public health threat to human. However, the knowledge
   of the response of lake and reservoir ecosystem to heat waves is largely
   unknown although it has been argued that climate warming may increase
   the incidence of harmful algal blooms. We examined the long-term trend
   of heat waves and how the variability of phytoplankton biomass responds
   to lake heat waves on a deep reservoir (Lake Qiandaohu). Long-term
   (1980-2020) meteorological observation in the lake watershed showed a
   significant warming trend of 0.36 degrees C per decade for the yearly
   average of daily average air temperature and the yearly average of daily
   maximum air temperature of 18.32 degrees C was observed in 2016.
   Meanwhile, a significant increasing number of heat wave events lasting
   longer was observed, and Lake Qiandaohu suffered an unusually severe
   lake heat wave in summer 2016. Significant correlations were found
   between the yearly average of daily maximum air temperature and heat
   days, heat wave events, and heat wave days. Nuisance phytoplankton bloom
   was found in Lake Qiandaohu by high frequency observation and remote
   sensing monitoring in summer 2016. Remote sensing estimation from two
   Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images showed that the average
   chlorophyll a (Chla) was 7.45 +/- 4.89 mu g/L on July 18 before heat
   wave and 18.96 +/- 0.98 mu g/L on August 19 during the heat wave. Two
   heat wave events lasting from July 20 to August 2 and August 11 to 26
   with average surface water temperature of 29.93 and 31.99 degrees C
   promoted two marked phytoplankton blooms with average Chla
   concentrations of 11.75 +/- 4.08 and 10.53 +/- 1.65 mu g/L in the
   central lake region, respectively, as evidenced by high-frequency buoy
   data. These findings suggest that heat waves are likely to yield an
   increased threat of harmful algal bloom in freshwater ecosystems. With
   lake heat waves projected to increase in frequency, duration, and
   spatial extent with global climate change, more studies are needed to
   improve our understanding of lake heat waves and their potential effects
   on the species, communities, frequency of phytoplankton bloom, and also
   help providing advanced schemes of water quality management.},

Title = {A novel tri-semicircle shaped submerged breakwater for mitigating wave
   loads on coastal bridges part I: Efficacy},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {245},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Extreme waves generated by hurricanes, together with storm surges, have
   led to severe damage and even failures in many offshore structures. This
   paper presents a novel submerged breakwater design suitable for
   protecting coastal bridges and other infrastructure. The proposed
   breakwater design is composed of three identical semicircular shells and
   a rectangular base using the same total volume of construction material
   as traditional trapezoidal breakwaters. This configuration permits
   modular construction and quick installation. A high-fidelity numerical
   wave tank is established to investigate the performance of the new
   breakwater device under different conditions with varying wave height,
   water depth, bridge submersion depth, and spacing between the device and
   the bridge. The extreme wave is simulated using a second-order solitary
   wave. According to the observation of a typical scenario, based on the
   numerical simulations, where waves pass over the novel breakwater and
   then impact the bridge, it is argued that the new design demonstrates an
   increased effectiveness to dissipate wave energy. Through analysis of
   the horizontal and vertical wave forces impacting the T-girder bridge
   deck, the wave loads are shown to be consistently reduced under all
   parametric studies. Moreover, it is found that the new breakwater offers
   improved protection when contrasted with the traditional trapezoidal
   geometry. The work conducted in this study sheds light on the design of
   high performing submerged breakwater for mitigating wave loads on
   coastal bridges.},

Title = {The incubation environment of nests deposited by a genetically distinct
   group of loggerhead sea turtles in Northwest Florida},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The warming climate presents a challenge to conservation of all
   threatened and endangered species but particularly to those that exhibit
   temperature-dependent sex determination such as sea turtles. Changes in
   temperature may result in changes in the sex ratio of the population
   which can directly affect reproductive rate, abundance and population
   dynamics. The NW Atlantic loggerhead turtle population is listed as
   threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and one of the
   smallest subpopulations in this assemblage nests in the northern Gulf of
   Mexico. Here, we describe the incubation environment of northern Gulf of
   Mexico loggerheads nesting at several different beaches in Northwest
   Florida. Temperature dataloggers were placed inside and adjacent to
   nests on different nesting beaches across Northwest Florida. In
   addition, incubation durations were recorded from nests deposited on
   those same beaches. Internal nest temperatures were higher than those in
   the sand, however sand temperatures were correlated with incubation
   durations. Sand temperatures differed along the vertical beach profile
   and according to depth. Temperatures also differed along a geographic
   gradient across Northwest Florida and in relation to distance from the
   Apalachicola River. Incubation durations followed a similar pattern.
   Mean monthly temperatures at all sites were at or lower than 29 degrees
   C (range 23.1 degrees C-29.6 degrees C at the dunes; 23.8 degrees C-29.4
   degrees C at mid-beach) which suggests nests in Northwest Florida may be
   producing a significant number of males, in contrast to the large number
   of females being produced on Florida's Atlantic coast. The temperatures
   and incubation durations on these nesting beaches may be regulated by
   differing sources of sand and beach orientations across Northwest
   Florida. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Aerosol deposition plays an important role in climate and biogeochemical
   cycles by supplying nutrients to the open ocean, in turn stimulating
   ocean productivity and carbon sequestration. Aerosol particles also
   contain elements such as copper (Cu) that are essential in trace amounts
   for phytoplankton physiology but that can be toxic at high
   concentrations. Although the toxicity of Cu associated with aerosols has
   been demonstrated in bioassay experiments, extrapolation of these
   laboratory results to natural conditions is not straightforward. This
   study provides observational evidence of the negative effect of aerosols
   containing high Cu concentrations on marine phytoplankton over a vast
   region of the western Mediterranean Sea. Direct aerosol measurements
   were combined with satellite observations, resulting in the detection of
   significant declines in phytoplankton biomass after atmospheric aerosol
   events characterized by high Cu concentrations. The declines were more
   evident during summer, when nanoflagellates predominate in the
   phytoplankton population and stratification and oligotrophic conditions
   prevail in the study region. Together with previous findings concerning
   atmospheric Cu deposition, these results demonstrate that the toxicity
   of Cu-rich aerosols can involve large areas of the world's oceans.
   Moreover, they highlight the present vulnerability of oceanic ecosystems
   to Cu-rich aerosols of anthropogenic origins. Because anthropogenic
   emissions are increasing, large-scale negative effects on marine
   ecosystems can be anticipated.},

Abstract = {Microbialites found in the low-light-intensity, hypersaline waters of
   Storr's Lake (SL), San Salvador Island, the Bahamas, were investigated
   with respect to their morphology, mineralogy, and microbial diversity.
   Previously described microbialite morphologies, as well as a newly
   identified multi-cuspate morphology, were observed at various depths.
   Electron microscopy analysis revealed the presence of angular, blocky,
   and needle-shaped crystals with mineralized cyanobacterial filaments and
   remains of exopolymeric substances. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed
   the presence of both Mg-calcite and aragonite in the plateau-mushroom
   and pinnacle mound microbialites, whereas only Mg-calcite was identified
   in the other microbialite morphotypes. A comprehensive molecular
   analysis using barcoded pyrosequencing of five different microbial mat
   communities identified at least 12 dominant bacterial phyla.
   Cyanobacteria were generally low in abundance and ranged from
   approximate to 0.01\% in the deeper pinnacle mounds to approximate to
   3.2\% in the shallow calcareous knobs. Other photosynthetic members
   included green nonsulfur bacteria of the phylum Chloroflexi and purple
   sulfur bacteria of the class Gammaproteobacteria. All mat types
   contained significant amounts of sulfate-reducing and dehalogenating
   bacteria. The low light intensity reaching the deeper microbialites, the
   lack of dominant cyanobacteria, and the abundance of sulfate reducers
   and Chloroflexi collectively suggest that sulfate reduction and
   anoxygenic photosynthetic processes influence the carbonate
   biomineralization process in these systems. Astrobiology 16, 282-300.},

Abstract = {Energy system analyses on the basis of fast and simple tools have proven
   particularly useful for interdisciplinary planning projects with
   frequent iterations and re-evaluation of alternative scenarios. As such,
   the tool ``EnergyPLAN{''} is used for hourly balanced and spatially
   aggregate annual analyses of energy scenarios. For the relatively fast
   dynamics of electrical energy systems, additional requirements need to
   be formulated to justify the technical feasibility of the respective
   scenario. In this article, the comparison is made of energy scenarios
   for the Danish island of Bornholm. First, the model is verified on the
   basis of the existing energy mix on Bornholm as an islanded energy
   system. Future energy scenarios for the year 2030 are analysed to study
   a feasible technology mix for a higher share of wind power. Finally, the
   results of the hourly simulations are compared to dynamic frequency
   simulations incorporating the Vehicle-to-grid technology. The results
   indicate how the EnergyPLAN model may be improved in terms of intra-hour
   variability, stability and ancillary services to achieve a better
   reflection of energy and power capacity requirements. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   and the drag force of vegetation was modeled as the sink terms in the
   momentum equations. The CMS-wave model was used to investigate the
   non-breaking and the breaking random waves propagation in vegetation
   fields. Afterwards, an empirical wave energy dissipation term with plant
   effect was derived to represent the resistance induced by aquatic
   vegetation in the wave-action balance equation. The established model
   was calibrated and validated with both the experimental and field data.
   The results showed that the wave height decreased significantly along
   the wave propagation direction in the presence of vegetations. The
   sensitivity analysis for the plant density, the wave height, and the
   water depth were performed by comparing the numerical results for the
   wave height attenuation. In addition, wave and wave-induced current
   through a finite patch of vegetation in the surf zone were investigated
   as well. The strong radiation stress gradient could be produced due to
   the variation of the energy dissipation by vegetation effect in the
   nearshore zone, which impacted the direction and amplitude of the
   longshore current. The calculated results showed that the coupling model
   had good performance in predicting wave propagation and the current over
   vegetated water regions.},

Title = {Climate change in mechanical systems: the snapshot view of parallel
   dynamical evolutions},
Journal = {NONLINEAR DYNAMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {106},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2781-2805},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We argue that typical mechanical systems subjected to a monotonous
   parameter drift whose timescale is comparable to that of the internal
   dynamics can be considered to undergo their own climate change. Because
   of their chaotic dynamics, there are many permitted states at any
   instant, and their time dependence can be followed-in analogy with the
   real climate-by monitoring parallel dynamical evolutions originating
   from different initial conditions. To this end an ensemble view is
   needed, enabling one to compute ensemble averages characterizing the
   instantaneous state of the system. We illustrate this on the examples of
   (i) driven dissipative and (ii) Hamiltonian systems and of (iii)
   non-driven dissipative ones. We show that in order to find the most
   transparent view, attention should be paid to the choice of the initial
   ensemble. While the choice of this ensemble is arbitrary in the case of
   driven dissipative systems (i), in the Hamiltonian case (ii) either KAM
   tori or chaotic seas should be taken, and in the third class (iii) the
   best choice is the KAM tori of the dissipation-free limit. In all cases,
   the time evolution of the chosen ensemble on snapshots illustrates
   nicely the geometrical changes occurring in the phase space, including
   the strengthening, weakening or disappearance of chaos. Furthermore, we
   show that a Smale horseshoe (a chaotic saddle) that is changing in time
   is present in all cases. Its disappearance is a geometrical sign of the
   vanishing of chaos. The so-called ensemble-averaged pairwise distance is
   found to provide an easily accessible quantitative measure for the
   strength of chaos in the ensemble. Its slope can be considered as an
   instantaneous Lyapunov exponent whose zero value signals the vanishing
   of chaos. Paradigmatic low-dimensional bistable systems are used as
   illustrative examples whose driving in (i, ii) is chosen to decay in
   time in order to maintain an analogy with case (iii) where the total
   energy decreases all the time.},

Title = {The 2014-2017 global-scale coral bleaching event: insights and impacts},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {539-545},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {2014-2017 was an unprecedented period of successive record-breaking hot
   years, which coincided with the most severe, widespread, and
   longest-lasting global-scale coral bleaching event ever recorded. The
   2014-2017 global-scale coral bleaching event (GCBE) resulted in very
   high coral mortality on many reefs, rapid deterioration of reef
   structures, and far-reaching environmental impacts. Through the papers
   in this special issue of Coral Reefs entitled The 2014-2017 Global Coral
   Bleaching Event: Drivers, Impacts, and Lessons Learned, as well as
   papers published elsewhere, we have a good analysis of the 2014-2017
   GCBE and its impacts. These studies have provided key insights into how
   climate change-driven marine heatwaves are destroying coral reef
   ecosystems: (a) The 2014-2017 GCBE is unique in the satellite record in
   its spatial scale, duration, intensity, and repetition of bleaching. (b)
   The impacts have been the most severe ever seen at many reefs. (c)
   Timing of observations matters and needs to be considered during the
   analysis of impacts. (d) On both global and local scales, the intensity
   of heat stress and impacts varied. (e) We continue to see important
   differences among and within coral taxa, with key roles played by algal
   symbionts and the microbiome. (f) Heat stress and bleaching both play a
   role in subsequent disease, which plays a key role in mortality. (g)
   Impacts ripple far beyond corals, with significant changes to the fish
   and invertebrate community that may last decades. (h) The structure of
   both individual coral's skeletons and entire reefs has been eroded much
   more quickly than previously realized. (i) The 2014-2017 GCBE provided
   little support for the proposed ``lifeboat{''} hypothesis, whereby deep
   or mesophotic reefs serve as a means of coral reef salvation. (j) While
   marine protected areas (MPAs) provide protection from local stressors,
   they not only do not protect reefs from global-scale stressors, but also
   here is also little evidence they provide significant resilience.},

Title = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Powered by Direct Methanol Fuel Cell-Based
   Power Plants: A Quick Preliminary Design Model},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Investigation, conservation, and exploitation of seas require platforms
   capable of accomplishing a wide variety of missions in harsh
   environments with restricted human intervention for long periods of
   time. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are excellent tools for
   carrying out these missions due to their versatility and ability to
   access remote sites. However, despite the improvement of their
   capabilities, their development is not devoid of challenges. Endurance,
   among others, such as underwater communications or autonomy, is still a
   pending subject. Current battery-based solutions do not offer sufficient
   endurance and innovative power plants with higher energy content are
   needed. This work studies the advantages, in terms of endurance, of
   using a power plant based on Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) to power
   AUVs. In order to accomplish this, a multi-objective optimization tool
   that makes use of a genetic algorithm was developed. This tool allows
   quick preliminary design of AUVs with a DMFC-based power plant,
   complying with a user-defined payload, operation profile, and
   restrictions. Six designs based on a real AUV model were studied, and
   endurance values up to 2 times longer than the corresponding reference
   AUV were obtained. These results support the benefits of using DMFCs to
   power AUVs to increase their endurance.},
