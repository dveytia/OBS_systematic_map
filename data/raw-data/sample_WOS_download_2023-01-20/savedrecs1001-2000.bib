Abstract = {Renewable energy is the most sustainable form of energy being able to
   act as a substitute for conventional sources of energy such as
   petroleum, coal, nuclear and thermal power and so on. In order to reduce
   the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, world
   organizations have proposed some measures to promote the efficient
   utilization of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as solar, wind,
   bioenergy, hydropower and ocean technology etc. As a major step towards
   a greener future, most of the countries have agreed to meet a target
   utilization of renewable energy sources by the year 2020. This paper
   depicts the technical feasibility of renewable energy sources in
   reaching those targets, especially for the European Union (EU). The
   paper sheds light on to various types of RES in the EU, recent
   developments in renew able energy technology and the proposed methods
   adopted with the aim of achieving a target of 20 percentage by 2020.},

   What we have learnt from China's practice},

Abstract = {Municipal water and wastewater services have complicated sources of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and quantifying their roles is critical
   for tackling global environmental challenges. In this study we provide a
   systematic review of the state-of-the-art on GHG emission
   characterizations of China's urban water infrastructure with the aim of
   shedding light on global implications for sustainable development. We
   started by synthesizing a framework on GHG emissions associated with
   water and wastewater infrastructure. Then we analyzed the different
   sources of GHG emissions in drinking water and wastewater treatment
   systems. In drinking water services, electricity consumption is the
   largest source of GHG emissions. A particular concern in China is the
   common use of secondary pumping for high-rise buildings. Optimized
   pressure management with an efficient pumping system should be
   prioritized. In wastewater services, non-CO2 emissions such as methane
   (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are substantial, but vary
   greatly depending on regional and technological differences. Further
   research directions may include GHG inventory development for urban
   water systems at the plant level, quantifications of GHG emissions from
   sewer systems, emission reduction measures via water reclamation,
   renewable energy recovery, energy efficiency improvement, cost-benefit
   analyses, and characterizations of Scope 3 emissions.

Abstract = {Increases in sea surface temperature have led to distributional changes
   in many commercially exploited fish species. These changes have already
   led to conflict over mackerel fisheries, arising from demand for fair
   resource apportionment and desire to manage the fishery sustainably. In
   order to develop adaptable management strategies for complex ocean
   fishery systems, policymakers and researchers must move beyond a
   reactive producer-consumer relationship to develop proactive, supportive
   collaborations. The history of U.S. national fisheries management is
   presented as an example of this transition. Building cooperative
   capacity over the last two centuries has lead to a more systematic
   understanding of the oceans, and has led to success in reducing the
   number of overfished stocks. Similar development of cooperation between
   policymakers and researchers on an international scale may be the surest
   way to develop management strategies adaptable enough to withstand
   challenges posed by future climate change.},

Title = {The Most Important Topic Political Scientists Are Not Studying: Adapting
   to Climate Change},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {420-434},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Few, if any, political scientists currently study climate change
   adaptation or are even aware that there is a large and growing
   interdisciplinary field of study devoted not just to mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions but to reducing our vulnerability to the
   now-inevitable impacts of climate change. The lack of political science
   expertise and research represents an obstacle for adapting to climate
   change, because adaptation is fundamentally political. Technical
   advances in adaptations for infrastructure, agriculture, public health,
   coastal protection, conservation, and other fields all depend on
   political variables for their implementation and effectiveness. For
   example, adaptation raises questions about political economy (adaptation
   costs money), political theory (adaptation involves questions of social
   justice), comparative politics (some countries more aggressively pursue
   adaptation), urban politics (some cities more aggressively pursue
   adaptation), regime type (democracies and authoritarian regimes may
   differently pursue adaptation), federalism (different levels of
   government may be involved), and several other fields of study including
   political conflict, international development, bureaucracy, migration,
   media, political parties, elections, civil society, and public opinion.
   I review the field of climate change adaptation and then explore the
   tremendous contributions that political scientists could make to
   adaptation research.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that combines wavelet transform
   and artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast the time series of
   hourly average methane (CH4) concentration. In this work, we want to
   improve the accuracy of predicting the dynamics of changes in the
   surface concentration of CH4. The model is based on data from
   environmental monitoring of greenhouse gases on the Belyy Island of the
   Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia. The initial data for building the
   proposed model were obtained in the period July-August 2017. The time
   series of the CH4 concentration was decomposed using a discrete wavelet
   transform into five components-one approximating and four detailing
   components. These five components, together with synchronized series of
   meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, and pressure), were
   used to train ten ANNs-five autoregressive networks with exogenous input
   (NARX) and five recurrent neural networks (Elman). The forecast was
   calculated as the sum of the forecasts for each of the five components.
   The forecast accuracy was assessed using several indices and a Taylor
   chart. The hybrid approach improved the accuracy of the forecasts by
   more than 20\%. The hybrid model based on the NARX shown the best
   accuracy.},

Abstract = {In order to limit climate change to a temperature rise of 2 degrees C,
   developed countries must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 30\%
   by 2020 compared to 1990. Germany in support a 30\% reduction in the EU
   with its own comittment of 40\% by 2020. With the measures presented
   this paper, Germany can reduce 224 Million tonnes (Mt) energy related
   CO2 emissions.
   The largest CO2 reductions are possible in electricity generation with
   savings of 40 Mt, by switching fuel and increased energy conversion
   efficiency (30 Mt) and an augmented 26\% share of renewable energies (44
   Mt). An increase in renewable energy from 70 to 140 TWh/year can be
   borne primarily by Multi-Mega-Watt wind turbines, both inshore and
   offshore, and electricity generation from biomass. Further reductions
   are possible by increased energy efficiency buildings, expansion of
   combined heat and power production and reductions in transport and heat
   supply.},

Abstract = {Nontidal wetlands are estimated to contribute significantly to the soil
   carbon pool across the globe. However, our understanding of the
   occurrence and variability of carbon storage between wetland types and
   across regions represents a major impediment to the ability of nations
   to include wetlands in greenhouse gas inventories and carbon offset
   initiatives. We performed a large-scale survey of nontidal wetland soil
   carbon stocks and accretion rates from the state of Victoria in
   south-eastern Australiaa region spanning 237,000km(2) and containing
   >35,000 temperate, alpine, and semi-arid wetlands. From an analysis of
   >1,600 samples across 103 wetlands, we found that alpine wetlands had
   the highest carbon stocks (290 +/- 180 Mg C-org ha(-1)), while permanent
   open freshwater wetlands and saline wetlands had the lowest carbon
   stocks (110 +/- 120 and 60 +/- 50 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively).
   Permanent open freshwater sites sequestered on average three times more
   carbon per year over the last century than shallow freshwater marshes
   (2.50 +/- 0.44 and 0.79 +/- 0.45 Mg C-org ha(-1)year(-1), respectively).
   Using this data, we estimate that wetlands in Victoria have a soil
   carbon stock in the upper 1m of 68 million tons of C-org, with an annual
   soil carbon sequestration rate of 3 million tons of CO2 eq.
   year(-1)equivalent to the annual emissions of about 3\% of the state's
   population. Since European settlement (similar to 1834), drainage and
   loss of 260,530ha of wetlands may have released between 20 and 75
   million tons CO2 equivalents (based on 27\%-90\% of soil carbon
   converted to CO2). Overall, we show that despite substantial spatial
   variability within wetland types, some wetland types differ in their
   carbon stocks and sequestration rates. The duration of water inundation,
   plant community composition, and allochthonous carbon inputs likely play
   an important role in influencing variation in carbon storage.},

Title = {Estimation of the Non-Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory from Ships in
   the Port of Incheon},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Nowadays, maritime air pollution is regarded as a severe threat to
   coastal communities' health. Therefore, many policies to reduce air
   pollution have been established worldwide. Moreover, there has been a
   shift in policy and research attention from greenhouse gases, especially
   CO2, to other air pollutants. To address the current local environmental
   challenges, this research analyzes the non-greenhouse gas emissions
   inventory (CO, NOx, SOx, PM, VOC, and NH3) from ships in the second
   biggest port in Korea, the Port of Incheon (POI). A bottom-up
   activity-based methodology with real-time vessel activity data produced
   by the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is applied to obtain reliable
   estimations. NOx and SOx dominated the amount of emission emitted from
   ships. Tankers, general cargo ships, cruise ships, and container ships
   were identified as the highest sources of pollution. Based on the above
   results, this study discusses the need for long-term policies, such as
   the designation of a local emission control area (ECA) and the
   establishment of an emission management platform to reduce ship-source
   emissions. Furthermore, this study elucidates that significant emissions
   come from the docking process, ranging from 33.9\% to 42.0\% depending
   on the type of pollutant when only the auxiliary engines were being
   operated. Therefore, short-term solutions like applying exhausted gas
   cleaning systems, using on-shore power supplies, reducing docking time,
   or using greener alternative fuels (e.g., liquefied natural gas or
   biofuels) should be applied and motivated at the POI. These timely
   results could be useful for air quality management decision-making
   processes for local port operators and public agencies.},

Title = {Determinants of climate change adaptation strategies in the coastal zone
   of Bangladesh: implications for adaptation to climate change in
   developing countries},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Considering the growing threats of climate change, in addition to
   mitigation strategies, it is highly and equally critical to understand
   the socio-economic determinants of climate adaptation in order to
   develop climate adaptation policies. This study makes a first attempt to
   explore the determinants of adaptation to climate change and choices of
   adaptation strategies at a larger spatial scale of the south-west
   coastal areas in Bangladesh, which is one of the most climate-vulnerable
   regions in the world. We employ both qualitative and quantitative
   approaches in order to examine farmers' perception of climate risks,
   determinants and choices of adaptation strategies to climate change in
   six coastal districts of Bangladesh. Farmers are adapting to these
   situations using their knowledge and experience. The study reveals that
   a number of adaptation strategies have been taken to reduce the negative
   impacts of climate change. These adaptation strategies are categorized
   into four groups: crop management, water management, land management,
   and income diversification. Availability of inputs, high production
   cost, agricultural extension service, and proper adaptation knowledge
   and experiences were noted as the main non-climatic challenges, as well
   as different climatic factors in agricultural adaptation strategies.
   Statistical analysis indicates that the different socio-economic
   determinants of farmers significantly influence their choices of
   adaptation to climate change. Farmers adopt these adaptations mostly
   autonomously rather than on the advice of government. This study could
   be useful for developing national adaptation policies in Bangladesh and
   other similar developing countries.},

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {205-225},

Abstract = {Human activity has perturbed the Earth's energy balance by altering the
   properties of the atmosphere and the surface. This perturbation is of a
   size that would be expected to lead to significant changes in climate.
   in recent years, an increasing number of possible human-related climate
   change mechanisms have begun to be quantified. This paper reviews
   developments in radiative forcing that have occurred since the second
   assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC), and proposes modifications to the values of global-mean
   radiative forcings since pre-industrial times given by IPCC. The forcing
   mechanisms which are considered here include those due to changes in
   concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases, tropospheric and
   stratospheric ozone, aerosols composed of sulphate, soot, organics and
   mineral dust (including their direct and indirect effects), and surface
   albedo. For many of these mechanisms, the size, spatial pattern and, for
   some, even the sign of their effect remain uncertain. Studies which have
   attributed observed climate change to human activity have considered
   only a subset of these mechanisms; their conclusions may not prove to be
   robust when a broader set is included. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {Electric energy security is essential, yet the high cost and limited
   sources of fossil fuels, in addition to the need to reduce greenhouse
   gasses emission, have made renewable resources attractive in world
   energy-based economies. The potential for renewable energy resources is
   enormous because they can, in principle, exponentially exceed the
   world's energy demand; therefore, these types of resources will have a
   significant share in the future global energy portfolio, much of which
   is now concentrating on advancing their pool of renewable energy
   resources. Accordingly, this paper presents how renewable energy
   resources are currently being used, scientific developments to improve
   their use, their future prospects, and their deployment. Additionally,
   the paper represents the impact of power electronics and smart grid
   technologies that can enable the proportionate share of renewable energy

Title = {Allowable carbon emissions for medium-to-high mitigation scenarios},
Journal = {TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {65},
Abstract = {Using an ensemble of simulations with an intermediate complexity climate
   model and in a probabilistic framework, we estimate future ranges of
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in order to follow three medium-high
   mitigation concentration pathways: RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and SCP4.5 to 2.6.
   Uncertainty is first estimated by allowing modelled equilibrium climate
   sensitivity, aerosol forcing and intrinsic physical and biogeochemical
   processes to vary within widely accepted ranges. Results are then
   constrained by comparison against contemporary measurements. For both
   constrained and unconstrained projections, our calculated allowable
   emissions are close to the standard (harmonised) emission scenarios
   associated with these pathways. For RCP4.5, which is the most moderate
   scenario considered in terms of required emission abatement, then after
   year 2100 very low net emissions are needed to maintain prescribed year
   2100 CO2 concentrations. As expected, RCP2.6 and SCP4.5 to 2.6 require
   more strict emission reductions. The implication of this is that direct
   sequestration of carbon dioxide is likely to be required for RCP4.5 or
   higher mitigation scenarios, to offset any minimum emissions for society
   to function (the `emissions floor'). Despite large uncertainties in the
   physical and biogeochemical processes, constraints from
   model-observational comparisons support a high degree of confidence in
   predicting the allowable emissions consistent with a particular
   concentration pathway. In contrast the uncertainty in the resulting
   temperature range remains large. For many parameter sets, and especially
   for RCP2.6, the land will turn into a carbon source within the 21st
   century, but the ocean will remain as a carbon sink. For land carbon
   storage and our modelling framework, major reductions are seen in
   northern high latitudes and the Amazon basin even after atmospheric CO2
   is stabilised, while for ocean carbon uptake, the tropical ocean regions
   will be a source to the atmosphere, although uncertainties on this are
   large. The parameters which most significantly affect the allowable
   emissions are aerosols and climate sensitivity, but some carbon-cycle
   related parameters (e.g. maximum photosynthetic rate and respiration's
   temperature dependency of vegetation) also have significant effects.
   Parameter values are constrained by observation, and we found that the
   CO2 emission data had a significant effect in constraining climate
   sensitivity and the magnitude of aerosol radiative forcing.},

Title = {Development and appraisal of long-term adaptation pathways for managing

Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {73-92},
Abstract = {The risk of residential overheating and mortality is increasing due to
   the effects of global warming and the urban heat island effect and needs
   to be addressed through climate change adaptation. `Adaptation pathways'
   have become widely recognised as an adaptation planning approach, but
   they have not been utilised for long-term planning for city-scale urban
   heat risk management. This paper applies adaptation pathway methodology
   to urban heat risk management. We use spatially coherent downscaled
   probabilistic climate change projections that account for changes in
   urban-land cover and the urban heat island to appraise adaptation
   pathways and inform long-term adaptation planning. We demonstrate that
   adaptation strategies focusing solely on urban greening or building
   level adaptation based on current best practice are unlikely to cope
   with the increasing levels of risk. Air-conditioning may play a growing
   role in managing heat-risk; however, increasing air-conditioning will
   exacerbate the urban heat island and further increase the risks of
   overheating. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {270},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the suitability of pollutant
   emission data published in the national pollutant inventories for impact
   assessment of thermal power generation using Australian technologies as
   case studies. ReCiPe midpoint and endpoint hierarchist methods were used
   to investigate the environmental impacts of power stations fuelled with
   hard coal, brown coal, diesel, coal seam methane, natural gas, landfill
   gas, sewage gas and bagasse. Brown coal was found to be the most
   impactful fuel source, followed by hard coal and diesel fuel, all
   averaging above the Australian national power generation environmental
   impacts. The renewable energy fuels, bagasse, landfill gas and sewage
   gas, exhibited the lowest environmental impacts. Global warming and fine
   particulate matter formation were the two most impactful contributors
   ranging between 97 and 99.8\% of the human health endpoint impacts,
   while global warming and terrestrial acidification were the most
   impactful categories to ecosystems contributing between 98.3 and 100\%
   of the ecosystem endpoint impacts. Global warming impacts on human
   health and ecosystems were the major impactful categories for all fossil
   fuels, while fine particulate matter formation and terrestrial
   acidification contributed with the largest respective impacts on human
   health and ecosystems by the considered renewable energy technologies.
   The major identified pollutants of concern for the thermal power
   generation technologies are emissions of greenhouse gases, acidic gases,
   such as SO2 and NOx, and PM2.5. As an interim solution, reduction of the
   impacts from the fossil fuel technologies can be achieved by targeting
   the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, better control of acidic
   gases SO2 and NOx, and blending of the renewable energy sources,
   bagasse, landfill gas and sewage gas, with coal and natural gas, however
   long term solutions would require further reduction in fossil fuel
   reliance for Australia. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emission from a eutrophic coastal lagoon in Rio de

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {638-653},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gases increased in concentrations over pre-industrial values
   by 257\% for methane and 145\% for carbon dioxide in 2016. Such
   increased levels are the main climate change drivers and may affect
   aquatic systems that accumulate and carry carbon to the ocean and the
   atmosphere. Additionally, these systems are sensitive to environmental
   changes since their physical, chemical and biological properties respond
   rapidly to changes. Therefore, this study focus on the greenhouse gases
   dynamic over an urban eutrophic tropical lagoon. Samplings were
   performed in the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon by covering four periods in
   2016 (April, June, October and December). Mean diffusive flux was
   -1,466.8 mg m(-2) d(-1) of carbon dioxide and 113.7 mg m(-2) d(-1) of
   methane. Regarding the bubbling, fluxes were 58.28 mg m(-2) d(-1) for
   methane and negligible for carbon dioxide (mean value of 5.01 mg m(-2)
   d(-1)). Environmental parameters such as depth, water temperature and
   sediment particle size were strongly related to the fluxes. In
   conclusion, the region is a sink of carbon dioxide and a source of
   methane to the atmosphere. Additionally, the rivers discharge impacts
   the lagoon by generating a methane hotspot emission region.},

Title = {Symbiont diversity may help coral reefs survive moderate climate change},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Given climate change, thermal stress-related mass coral-bleaching events
   present one of the greatest anthropogenic threats to coral reefs. While
   corals and their symbiotic algae may respond to future temperatures
   through genetic adaptation and shifts in community compositions, the
   climate may change too rapidly for coral response. To test this
   potential for response, here we develop a model of coral and symbiont
   ecological dynamics and symbiont evolutionary dynamics. Model results
   without variation in symbiont thermal tolerance predict coral reef
   collapse within decades under multiple future climate scenarios,
   consistent with previous threshold-based predictions. However, model
   results with genetic or community-level variation in symbiont thermal
   tolerance can predict coral reef persistence into the next century,
   provided low enough greenhouse gas emissions occur. Therefore, the level
   of greenhouse gas emissions will have a significant effect on the future
   of coral reefs, and accounting for biodiversity and biological dynamics
   is vital to estimating the size of this effect.},

Title = {Climate Change Perceptions, Impacts and Adaptation Strategies: Insights
   of Fishers in Zambezi River Basin, Zimbabwe},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Zambezi River Basin is considered to be highly vulnerable to the
   impacts of climate change and adverse weather events, which might cause
   serious environmental, economic, and social consequences for millions of
   people. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how natural
   resource-dependent people perceive climate change, and how they adapt to
   the changes, as it is very important for climate change adaptation
   policy formulation and its implementation. Therefore, this study seeks
   to assess fishers perceptions of climate change, its impacts on fishery
   resources and livelihoods, and their adaptation strategies. Data were
   collected from 120 fishers in two basins (Binga and Kariba) along the
   shores of Lake Kariba using a mixed-method research approach.
   Meteorological data were obtained from the Meteorological Department
   Services of Zimbabwe (MSDZ). The findings show that fishers of Lake
   Kariba have observed changes in temperature and rainfall trends. Fishers
   believe that the perceived changes of the climatic variables have led to
   a decline in fish productivity and fish catches. To cope with declining
   fish stocks and catches, fishers have adopted several adaptation
   strategies, including changing fishing gear, targeting new fish species,
   and increasing fishing efforts. These study findings help to set a path
   towards local specific climate change adaptation strategies for
   small-scale fishers. This study provided relevant information for policy
   makers and fisheries stewards to formulate appropriate policies and
   programmes aimed at enhancing fishers adaptation to climate change and
   promote sustainable fisheries.},

Abstract = {The global carbon cycle is sensitive to changes in global temperature
   and atmospheric CO2 concentration, with increased temperature tending to
   reduce the efficiency of carbon sinks and increased CO2 enhancing the
   efficiency of carbon sinks. The emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases
   warms the Earth but does not induce the CO2 fertilization effect or
   increase the partial-pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the
   surface ocean. Here we present idealized climate model experiments that
   explore the indirect interaction between non-CO2 forcing and the carbon
   cycle. The experiments suggest that this interaction enhances the
   warming effect of the non-CO2 forcing by up to 25\% after 150 years and
   that much of the warming caused by these agents lingers for over 100
   years after the dissipation of the non-CO2 forcing. Overall, our results
   suggest that the longer emissions of non-CO2 forcing agents persists the
   greater effect these agents will have on global climate.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {212},
Number = {D},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Bioenergy is a promising solution for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   mitigation. However, the emissions resulting from the different
   production stages must be quantified and evaluated. The life cycle
   assessment (LCA) method was used to compare and quantify the
   environmental burdens of three rice straw (RS) utilization scenarios for
   producing biogas, briquette fuel, and syngas. To our knowledge, this is
   the first study that applies the LCA approach to assess these three
   bioenergy scenarios in a single study where the main goal was to
   determine the most sustainable option. A total of 10 mid-point impact
   categories were investigated. The results indicated that the three
   scenarios achieved net positive energy and net negative GHG balances.
   The briquette fuel scenarios had the highest net energy balance (11,115
   MJ/tonne dry RS), while the syngas scenario had the highest net GHG
   (-2,315 kg CO2-eq./tonne dry RS). Moreover, the syngas scenario was the
   most beneficial to the environment, achieving negative results in 9 out
   of the 10 impact categories; the largest was marine ecotoxicity
   (-853,897 kg 1,4-DB-eq./tonne dry RS). The biogas scenario achieved
   emission savings in 3 out of the 10 categories. Although the briquette
   fuel scenario had no negative values in the 10 categories, its overall
   contribution to environmental burdens was relatively low. Overall, the
   order of the three scenarios in terms of the most sustainable option is
   syngas > briquette fuel > biogas.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests are important carbon sinks in the tropics, yet tropical
   mangrove deforestation and land use conversion still persists. Reporting
   of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources
   in wetlands are important in regional and national emissions
   inventories. However, very few studies have been conducted to measure on
   the GHG fluxes in coastal wetlands, particularly in mangrove forest and
   non-forest land uses in deforested mangroves. We investigated the soil
   fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O in mangrove forest and non-forest land uses
   on deforested mangrove areas (i.e. abandoned aquaculture ponds, coconut
   plantations, abandoned salt ponds, and cleared mangroves) in the coasts
   of Honda Bay, Philippines. Results showed that the emissions of CO2 and
   CH4 were higher by 2.6 and 6.6 times in mangrove forests (110 and 0.6 kg
   CO(2)e ha(-1) day(-1), respectively) while N2O emissions were lower by
   34 times compared to the average of non-forest land uses (1.3 kg CO(2)e
   ha(-1) day(-1)). CH4 and N2O emissions accounted for 0.59\% and 0.04\%
   of the total emissions in mangrove forest as compared to 0.23\% and
   3.07\% for non-forest land uses, respectively. Site-scale soil GHG flux
   distribution could be mapped with 75\% to 83\% accuracy using Ordinary
   Kriging. Unlike mangroves that can offset all GHG emissions through CO2
   uptake from photosynthesis, the non-forest land uses cannot offset their
   emissions on-site as they are usually devoid of vegetation. Our results
   could be utilised in higher tier national GHG inventories, to refine
   regional and global estimates of GHG emissions in mangrove wetlands, and
   improve policy on coastal wetlands conservation.},

   APPLICATION ON TAIWANESE SET-ASIDE LAND},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Taiwan imports more than 99\% of her energy and suffers from climate
   change effects such as rising ocean level. Therefore, energy insecurity
   and GHG emissions offset are two serious problems facing Taiwan. This
   paper examines the possibilities for domestic bioenergy production in
   Taiwan utilizing set-aside land. Three bioenergy alternatives are
   examined: pyrolysis-based bioelectricity, conventional bioelectricity
   and ethanol. We examine the comparative economics and choices among
   these alternatives under current Taiwanese agricultural system policies
   and also under altered energy and greenhouse gas/carbon prices. Biochar,
   produced from pyrolysis, is also investigated for different uses:
   whether it is best used as an energy source and/or a soil amendment. The
   study employs modified Taiwanese Agricultural Sector Model (TASM) to
   simulate the effects of the alternatives in the face of energy and
   greenhouse gases prices. Results show that ethanol production is chosen
   under current conditions but that this is replaced by pyrolysis-based
   bioelectricity when the GHG price is high. The results also indicate
   that Taiwan's energy security can be enhanced by domestic bioenergy
   production and up to 1.59\% of total GHG emissions can be offset.},

Title = {A New Background Method for Greenhouse Gases Flux Calculation Based in
   Back-Trajectories Over the Amazon},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The large amount of carbon stored in trees and soils of the Amazon rain
   forest is under pressure from land use as well as climate change.
   Therefore, various efforts to monitor greenhouse gas exchange between
   the Amazon forest and the atmosphere are now ongoing, including regular
   vertical profile (surface to 4.5 km) greenhouse gas measurements across
   the Amazon. These profile measurements can be used to calculate fluxes
   to and from the rain forest to the atmosphere at large spatial scales by
   considering the enhancement or depletion relative to the mole fraction
   of air entering the Amazon basin from the Atlantic, providing an
   important diagnostic of the state, changes and sensitivities of the
   forests. Previous studies have estimated greenhouse gas mole fractions
   of incoming air ('background') as a weighted mean of mole fractions
   measured at two background sites, Barbados (Northern Hemisphere) and
   Ascension (Southern hemisphere) in the Tropical Atlantic, where the
   weights were based on sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) measured locally (in
   the Amazon vertical profiles) and at the two background sites. However,
   this method requires the accuracy and precision of SF(6)measurements to
   be significantly better than 0.1 parts per trillion (picomole mole(-1)),
   which is near the limit for the best SF(6)measurements and assumes that
   there are no SF(6)sources in the Amazon basin. We therefore present here
   an alternative method. Instead of using SF6, we use the geographical
   position of each air-mass back-trajectory when it intersects the limit
   connecting these two sites to estimate contributions from Barbados
   versus Ascension. We furthermore extend the approach to include an
   observation site further south, Cape Point, South Africa. We evaluate
   our method using CO(2)vertical profile measurements at a coastal site in
   Brazil comparing with values obtained using this method where we find a
   high correlation (r(2)= 0.77). Similarly, we obtain good agreement for
   CO(2)background when comparing our results with those based on SF6, for
   the period 2010-2011 when the SF(6)measurements had excellent precision
   and accuracy. We also found high correspondence between the methods for
   background values of CO, N2O and CH4. Finally, flux estimates based on
   our new method agree well with the CO(2)flux estimates for 2010 and 2011
   estimated using the SF6-based method. Together, our findings suggest
   that our trajectory-based method is a robust new way to derive
   background air concentrations for the purpose of greenhouse gas flux
   estimation using vertical profile data.},

Abstract = {The cultivation of seaweed as a feedstock for third generation biofuels
   is gathering interest in Europe, however, many questions remain
   unanswered in practise, notably regarding scales of operation, energy
   returns on investment (EROI) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, all of
   which are crucial to determine commercial viability. This study
   performed an energy and GHG emissions analysis, using EROI and GHG
   savings potential respectively, as indicators of commercial viability
   for two systems: the Swedish Seafarm project's seaweed cultivation (0.5
   ha), biogas and fertilizer biorefinery, and an estimation of the same
   system scaled up and adjusted to a cultivation of 10 ha. Based on a
   conservative estimate of biogas yield, neither the 0.5 ha case nor the
   up-scaled 10 ha estimates met the (commercial viability) target EROI of
   3, nor the European Union Renewable Energy Directive GHG savings target
   of 60\% for biofuels, however the potential for commercial viability was
   substantially improved by scaling up operations: GHG emissions and
   energy demand, per unit of biogas, was almost halved by scaling
   operations up by a factor of twenty, thereby approaching the EROI and
   GHG savings targets set, under beneficial biogas production conditions.
   Further analysis identified processes whose optimisations would have a
   large impact on energy use and emissions (such as anaerobic digestion)
   as well as others embodying potential for further economies of scale
   (such as harvesting), both of which would be of interest for future
   developments of kelp to biogas and fertilizer biorefineries. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Small, low-lying islands are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate
   change and development of effective adaptation strategies is regarded as
   an urgent need. Through an analysis of existing and emerging climate
   adaptation policies, this paper assesses the climate adaptation response
   in the Cayman Islands. Despite its strong economic status and several
   developments in the areas of Planning, Environment and Tourism,
   alongside a draft Climate Change Policy, the study reveals a focus on
   symbolic policies and a lack of adopted ``concrete{''} climate change
   adaptation policies. Although the draft National Climate Change Policy
   (2011) contains a comprehensive range of substantial policies, none has
   been formally adopted by the Cayman Islands Government. The practical
   implications of this situation in the face of climate change-related
   hazards are assessed in the context of Seven Mile Beach, the most
   heavily developed stretch of the Cayman Islands coast. Here, the
   prevailing response to shoreline change is stabilisation and, despite
   several opportunities to change the situation, recent policy
   developments have not stimulated changes in practice.},

Abstract = {This work presents a design for Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy (HRE), for
   off grid power generation for remote riverine regions in developing
   nations. The uniqueness of this technique for power generation using
   streams and other marine currents to generate electric energy is
   detailed. The problem of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the
   environment, rapid increase in human population, industries,
   modernization and our lifestyle put immense pressure on most power
   generation plants and infrastructures. Thus, global warming and carbon
   footprints of using fossil fuels to generate energy has driven the
   interest for energy generation from renewable sources. The Upper River
   Benue and Lower River Niger coastal basins, as well as the River Niger
   Basin on the Lower Niger sub-basin area of southeastern Nigeria was
   selected as a case study for the design of the hydrokinetic power
   generation technology. The results show that for a hydrokinetic turbine
   the level of power output is directly proportional to the flow velocity.
   Therefore the cost of its installation is reduced drastically from about
   \$7,900 per installed kW to about \$2,500 per kW, is easily assessable,
   less technical and a familiar motor technology for most of these
   communities. It is also a predictable form of energy in comparison to
   other emerging renewable energy fields like wind, solar and wave. Also
   this form of renewable energy is less harmful to the environment, has a
   lower noise emission and produces no greenhouse gases or any solid
   waste. HRE will bring energy security that is essential for the riverine
   dweller and curb rural urban migration and both improves the rural
   communities' standard of living and enhances their productivity.},

Abstract = {This research develops and applies a system dynamics (SD) model for the
   strategic evaluation of environmental adaptation options for coastal
   communities. The article defines and estimates asset-based measures for
   community vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity with respect
   to the environmental, economic, social, and cultural pillars of the
   coastal community under threat. The SD model simulates the annual
   multidimensional dynamic impacts of severe coastal storms and storm
   surges on the community pillars under alternative adaptation strategies.
   The calculation of the quantitative measures provides valuable
   information for decision makers for evaluating the alternative
   strategies. The adaptation strategies are designed model results
   illustrated for the specific context of the coastal community of
   Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. The dynamic trend of the
   measures and model sensitivity analyses for Charlottetown-facing
   increased frequency of severe storms, storm surges, and sea-level
   rise-provide impetus for enhanced community strategic planning for the
   changing coastal environment. This research is presented as part of the

Title = {Fluxes of greenhouse gases at two different aquaculture ponds in the
   coastal zone of southeastern China},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {269-277},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Shallow water ponds are important contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG)
   fluxes into the atmosphere. Aquaculture ponds cover an extremely large
   area in China's entire coastal zone. Knowledge of greenhouse gas fluxes
   from aquaculture ponds is very limited, but measuring GHG fluxes from
   aquaculture ponds is fundamental for estimating their impact on global
   warming. This study investigated the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO2),
   methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from two coastal
   aquaculture ponds during 2011 and 2012 in the Shanyutan wetland of the
   Min River estuary, southeastern China, and determined the factors that
   may regulate GHG fluxes from the two ponds. The average fluxes of CO2,
   CH4 and N2O were 20.78 mgCO(2) m(-2) h(-1), 19.95 mgCH(4) m(-2)h(-1) and
   10.74 mu gN(2)O m(-2) respectively, in the shrimp pond. The average
   fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were 60.46 mgCO(2) m(-2)h(-1), 1.65
   mgCH(4)m(-2) h(-1) and 11.8 mu gN(2)O m(-2) h(-1), respectively, in the
   mixed shrimp and fish aquaculture pond during the study period. The
   fluxes of all three gases showed distinct temporal variations. The
   variations in the GHG fluxes were influenced by interactions with the
   thermal regime, pH, trophic status and chlorophyll-a content.
   Significant differences in the CO2 and N2O fluxes between the shrimp
   pond and the mixed aquaculture pond were observed from September to
   November, whereas the CH4 fluxes from the two ponds were not
   significantly different. The difference in the CO2 flux likely was
   related to the effects of photosynthesis, biological respiration and the
   mineralization of organic matter, whereas the N2O fluxes were controlled
   by the interactions between nitrogen substrate availability and pH.
   Water salinity, trophic status and dissolved oxygen concentration likely
   affected CH4 emission. Our results suggest that subtropical coastal
   aquaculture ponds are important contributors to regional CH4 and N2O
   emissions into the atmosphere, and their contribution to global warming
   must be considered. Furthermore, we also suggest that aquaculture pond
   type should be considered when evaluating regional GHG budgets in
   coastal aquaculture ponds. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change is altering ecosystems and fisheries throughout the
   world's oceans, demanding climate-adaptive governance for conserving and
   managing living marine resources. While in some regions fisheries
   management systems address wider ecosystem dynamics within management
   frameworks and decision-making, which may facilitate resilience to
   climate change, there remains a shortfall in terms of directly
   incorporating climate change adaptation into fisheries management
   legislation and implementation. This review assesses the current state
   of implementation of climate change adaptation into fisheries management
   policies and legislation across 11 national case studies, based on
   government documents and the primary literature. The overarching goal is
   to understand the key elements and gaps in existing fisheries management
   policies and legislation in the context of climate change. Given recent
   reforms of fisheries management policies and/or legislation across the
   nations examined, political recognition of the need to address climate
   change adaptation in fisheries management appears to be increasing;
   albeit formal mandates of climate-adaptation objectives in fisheries
   management are largely missing. Based on our review, recommendations for
   achieving climate-adaptive fisheries management regimes are developed.
   Overall, this study will help to inform and broaden the scope of
   management approaches and tools to accelerate the move towards adaptive
   fisheries management that accounts for climate change impacts on fish
   stocks, fisheries and the societies that depend upon them.},

Title = {Assessing the merits of bioenergy by estimating marginal climate-change
   impacts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {841-852},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose Climate-change impacts can be mitigated through greater use of
   bioenergy, but the extent to which specific options actually reduce
   overall impacts needs to be assessed. Most bioenergy assessments have
   used proxy measures for assessing its merits. Here, a new approach is
   presented, whereby the contribution of bioenergy use is assessed through
   quantifying marginal changes in climate-change impacts that result from
   the implementation of a bioenergy option.
   Methods Marginal climate-change impacts were calculated for one specific
   example of a bioenergy option, conversion of an unutilised mature forest
   into a production forest harvested repeatedly for bioenergy over
   successive 25-year rotations. The overall benefit of the option was
   assessed by including stand-level carbon dynamics, global carbon-cycle
   feedback, progressively changing radiative efficiency and marginal
   impact sensitivity of warming. It also includes a differentiated
   assessment of three kinds of climatic impacts: direct-warming,
   rate-of-warming and cumulative-warming impacts. Marginal impacts were
   calculated and summed over 100 years to assess the overall marginal
   impact of this bioenergy option.
   Results and discussion Bioenergy use in this specific example led to a
   large initial loss of biomass carbon followed by an ongoing and
   accumulating benefit through fossil-fuel substitution. This caused
   adverse climatic impacts over the first two rotations as the effects of
   the on-site carbon loss dominated the overall impact, but the option
   became increasingly beneficial over longer time frames as the benefit of
   fossil-fuel substitution accrued and eventually dominated. Summed over
   100 years, the bioenergy option reduced direct-temperature and
   rate-of-warming impacts whilst increasing cumulative-warming impacts.
   The average of the three kinds of impacts showed a slight mitigation
   benefit by reducing overall impacts. In the particular example,
   bioenergy use was assessed to have a more beneficial effect if the
   analysis was carried out under the assumption of higher-emission
   concentrations pathways, or if it assumed a steeper relationship between
   climate perturbations and impacts.
   Conclusions The usefulness of any climate-change mitigation option
   ultimately relates to the marginal climate-change impacts it can avert.
   It is shown here that marginal impacts can be calculated in routine
   operation and that they can provide an objective and methodologically
   consistent assessment of the mitigation potential of bioenergy use.},

Title = {Caught by the fuzz: Using FCM to prevent coastal adaptation stakeholders
   from fleeing the scene},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {109},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is an increasingly urgent priority for
   coastal managers. At the highest levels of governance, European Union
   and Member State adaptation policies and strategies are now well
   established, but meaningful adaptation interventions illustrating
   tangible gains in resilience remain scarce. A clear framework for
   generic adaptation processes, along with barriers to their smooth
   progress, have now been identified in the literature, and equally
   generic scenario analysis tools have been put forward to strengthen
   adaptation delivery by assisting coastal managers to overcome them.
   Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) is a relatively novel option in this
   respect, having yet to achieve the kind of widespread uptake and trial
   that more orthodox futures approaches such as intuitive logic scenarios
   have. FCM is however growing rapidly in its range of uses and breadth of
   uptake, and its utility in overcoming the barriers to adaptation among
   coastal managers is therefore worthy of analysis. This case study, in
   which FCM was employed in place of intuitive logic scenario analysis
   within an adaptation strategy development process, found FCM to carry a
   number of key strengths that intuitive logic scenario analysis has been
   found to lack. Through enabling a more detailed and granular level of
   participatory development of the `engine' of the futures process than
   possible under an intuitive logic approach, the level of buy-in and
   commitment to the adaptation strategy development process achieved among
   coastal managers and stakeholders was significantly greater.},

Title = {Combining offshore wind and solar photovoltaic energy to stabilize
   energy supply under climate change scenarios: A case study on the
   western Iberian Peninsula},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {157},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The expansion of marine renewable power is a major alternative for the
   reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. In Europe, however, the high
   penetration of offshore wind brings intermittency and power variability
   into the existing power grid. Offshore solar photovoltaic power is
   another technological alternative under consideration in the plans for
   decarbonization. However, future variations in wind, air temperature or
   solar radiation due to climate change will have a great impact on both
   renewable energy resources. In this context, this study focusses on the
   offshore energy assessment off the coast of Western Iberia, a European
   region encompassing Portugal and the Northwestern part of Spain. Making
   use of a vast source of data from 35 simulations of a research project
   called CORDEX, this study investigates the complementarity of offshore
   wind and solar energy sources with the aim of improving the energy
   supply stability of this region up to 2040. Although the offshore wind
   energy resource has proven to be higher than solar photovoltaic resource
   at annual scale, both renewable resources showed significant
   spatiotemporal energy variability throughout the western Iberian
   Peninsula. When both renewable resources are combined, the stability of
   the energy resource increased considerably throughout the year. The
   proposed wind and solar combination scheme is assessed by a performance
   classification method called Delphi, considering stability, resource,
   risk, and economic factors. The total index classification increases
   when resource stability is improved by considering hybrid offshore
   wind-photovoltaic solar energy production, especially along the
   nearshore waters.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas fluxes from coastal wetlands at the intersection of urban
   pollution and saltwater intrusion: A soil core experiment},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {44-53},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Wetlands serve an important role in regulating greenhouse gases
   globally. Anthropogenic stressors including elevated nutrients and
   contaminants from urban pollution and elevated salinity from saltwater
   intrusion have the potential to alter greenhouse gas emissions,
   particularly in tidal wetlands that experience these stressors
   simultaneously. We designed a laboratory soil core experiment to
   disentangle the separate and combined effects of saltwater intrusion
   (elevated salinity versus elevated sulfate) and urban pollution
   (elevated nitrogen versus elevated copper) on carbon and nitrogen
   cycling in wetland soils. We collected 45 intact soil cores from a
   brackish tidal wetland and applied chemical treatments for seven weeks
   in the laboratory. We measured greenhouse gas soil-to-atmosphere fluxes
   (CO2, CH4, N2O) and porewater chemistry weekly. Soils were harvested at
   the end of the experiment to analyze soil chemistry and microbial carbon
   and nitrogen processing rates. Compared to the freshwater control, we
   found that elevated copper and sulfate (without elevated salinity)
   decreased CH4 fluxes. Treatments with elevated salinity, sulfate, or
   both also reduced CO2 fluxes. Likewise, carbon mineralization at the end
   of the experiment was lower for all treatments with elevated copper,
   sulfate, or salinity. In contrast, elevated salinity enhanced N2O fluxes
   but did not affect potential denitrification rates at the end of the
   experiment. Combined urban pollution and sea salt enrichment suppressed
   carbon gas fluxes but enhanced N2O emissions. Decreased carbon gas
   fluxes offset increased N2O fluxes such that the saltwater, urban, and
   combined treatments reduced the total global warming potential by 6.9 x,
   2.6 x, and 3.6 x, respectively, relative to the freshwater control. Thus
   our laboratory experiment suggests in the short-term, saltwater
   intrusion could reduce global warming potential of coastal wetland soils
   in Southern New England with typical levels of urban pollution. Future
   research that addresses the response of coastal wetland ecosystems to
   combined effects of urban pollution and saltwater intrusion will be
   critical for predicting long-term coastal wetland function under future
   land use and climatic conditions.},

   strategies to protect human lives.
   Successfully applied to seven municipalities impacted by Storm Xynthia
   (2010, in France), some limitations were identified as the index was
   only designed for centennial floods or the cost-efficiency was conducted
   comparing strategies one after the other.
   This paper shows that (i) preventionwarning and evacuation appears to be
   the only strategy for which efficiency increases with the flood
   intensity and that (ii) mixing adaptation strategies allows to enhance
   efficiency and decrease costs.},

Abstract = {Various climate adaptation strategies are being studied for the
   agricultural sector to address the effects of climate change. Global
   warming is predicted to have a significant influence on cool-season
   grass production in Japan in terms of decreasing grass dry matter yield.
   The authors have studied adaptation strategies to maintain grass dry
   matter yield using orchardgrass, a cool-season grass. However, it may be
   difficult to adapt to future climate conditions using management methods
   such as fertilizer application or changing grassland renovation cycles
   using only one grass species. In this study, a model was constructed
   formulating the relationship between temperature and yields of the main
   cool-season grasses in Japan, and the effects of global warming on grass
   productivity were predicted. Two models were constructed, and the
   optimal one was selected using Akaike's information criterion. The
   selected model was then validated using correlations with observation
   data. We also compared areas suitable for cultivation at current and
   higher temperatures, which were produced as maps using the selected
   model. Bahiagrass, which is a warm-season grass, was suitable for
   cultivation in coastal areas in southern Kanto under increased
   temperature condition. It may be useful, therefore, to convert to
   heat-resistant grasses, such as orchardgrass or tall fescue, as
   temperatures rise.},

Title = {Evaluating negative emissions technologies using neutrosophic data
   envelopment analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {286},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Growing energy demand due to population growth and economic progress has
   led to the need for intensive climate change mitigation. Negative
   emissions technologies (NETs) will play an important role in limiting
   global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentration in the
   atmosphere. Available options for NETs can be integrated into energy and
   climate change policies. However, this strategy requires an assessment
   tool to select a suitable set of NETs to be integrated. A mathematical
   framework considering multiple environmental and economic factors under
   uncertainty is needed for the assessment tool. This paper has two main
   contributions: (1) development of a novel multi-criteria decision
   analysis tool based on data envelopment analysis method under
   neutrosophic environment, and (2) application of this tool in the
   evaluation of NETs considering the risks associated with the
   uncertainties in these technologies. The model incorporates
   uncertainties that result in risks when higher performance levels are
   assumed. A novel neutrosophic data envelopment analysis (NDEA) model is
   developed for evaluating NETs; this approach uses neutrosophic set
   theory to account for membership, nonmembership and indeterminacy in
   uncertain parameter values. A case study is presented to illustrated
   this technique. Then, a representative case study considering four
   alternative options for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
   (BECCS) is used to demonstrate the tool. The performance assessment of
   candidate NETs based on literature data is made. Results show different
   characteristics of NETs in terms of their sensitivity to expert's risk
   attitude and perception towards the different dimensions of neutrosophic
   decision-making environment. For instance, the preference of underground
   storage over ocean storage for BECCS is evident when improving the
   technology is assumed to be challenging. Various NETs are evaluated;
   technologies such as BECCS, and afforestation and reforestation show
   consistent ranking in different decision environments. The capability of
   the model to account for uncertainties can allow useful insights to be
   drawn by policy-makers, and thus, accelerate the deployment of NETs. (C)

Abstract = {There are innumerable astronomical bodies in the universe, but only two
   are essential for life as we know it: our planet, the Earth, and the
   star about which it orbits, the Sun. Middle aged, at nearly five billion
   years, the Sun is a reliable, steady source of energy for the Earth. Its
   radiation heats the Earth's surface to -18 degreesC. Thus warmed, the
   Earth radiates its own energy which is trapped by atmospheric greenhouse
   gases and provides additional warming to 15 degreesC. Together with the
   Earth's greenhouse gases, the Sun sustains the mean global terrestrial
   temperature at a level supportive of life. It enables photosynthesis,
   and powers the atmospheric and oceanic circulations that profoundly
   influence living organisms.},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Health is inextricably linked to climate change. It is
   important for clinicians to understand this relationship in order to
   discuss associated health risks with their patients and to inform public
   policy.
   OBJECTIVES To provide new US-based temperature projections from
   downscaled climate modeling and to review recent studies on health risks
   related to climate change and the cobenefits of efforts to mitigate
   greenhouse gas emissions.
   DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, AND DATA SYNTHESIS We searched PubMed and
   Google Scholar from 2009 to 2014 for articles related to climate change
   and health, focused on governmental reports, predictive models, and
   empirical epidemiological studies. Of the more than 250 abstracts
   reviewed, 56 articles were selected. In addition, we analyzed climate
   data averaged over 13 climate models and based future projections on
   downscaled probability distributions of the daily maximum temperature
   for 2046-2065. We also compared maximum daily 8-hour average ozone with
   air temperature data taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration, National Climate Data Center.
   RESULTS By 2050, many US cities may experience more frequent extreme
   heat days. For example, New York and Milwaukee may have 3 times their
   current average number of days hotter than 32 degrees C (90 degrees F).
   High temperatures are also strongly associated with ozone exceedance
   days, for example, in Chicago, Illinois. The adverse health aspects
   related to climate change may include heat-related disorders, such as
   heat stress and economic consequences of reduced work capacity;
   respiratory disorders, including those exacerbated by air pollution and
   aeroallergens, such as asthma; infectious diseases, including
   vectorborne diseases and waterborne diseases, such as childhood
   gastrointestinal diseases; food insecurity, including reduced crop
   yields and an increase in plant diseases; and mental health disorders,
   such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, that are
   associated with natural disasters. Substantial health and economic
   cobenefits could be associated with reductions in fossil fuel
   combustion. For example, greenhouse gas emission policies may yield net
   economic benefit, with health benefits from air quality improvements
   potentially offsetting the cost of US and international carbon policies.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Evidence over the past 20 years indicates that
   climate change can be associated with adverse health outcomes. Health
   care professionals have an important role in understanding and
   communicating the related potential health concerns and the cobenefits
   from policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Copyright 2014

Abstract = {China is faced with significant challenges in the energy sector such as
   energy shortage, environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and
   energy supply in rural areas, which severely restrict its sustainable
   development. The promotion of a sustainable energy system is the key
   solution to tackling those issues. In this paper, the current status and
   trends of sustainable energy development in China are elaborated, taking
   account of renewable energy, nuclear energy, and energy efficiency. The
   strategies of sustainable energy in China are brought forward
   accordingly, and the corresponding implementations of sustainable energy
   development in China are expounded as well. Note that the development of
   clean coal and nuclear power with innovative technologies can vigorously
   promote China's sustainable development since renewable energy as a
   whole, with the exception of hydro power, is still very small compared
   with conventional generation. In the end, this paper concludes that
   China must set a step-by-step unified national energy plan to promote
   the construction of a sustainable energy system, which will be
   economically, environmentally, and socially viable, and, thus, China
   would play an important role to promote global sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Previous climate modeling studies suggest that temperature increases
   beyond 2100 AD due to greenhouse gas changes could be comparable to the
   Cretaceous. However, these projections have not been tested against a
   range of emission scenarios, nor have estimates of past temperature
   change been well restrained quantitatively. Herein we use a 1D energy
   balance model (EBM) with an upwelling-diffusion ocean model to explore
   the temperature response to extreme cases of unrestricted and severely
   restricted greenhouse gas increases. Results are compared against
   revised estimates of global temperature change over the last 100 million
   years. For four of the six scenarios, global temperature projections by
   the years 2400-2700 equal or exceed levels of the Eocene or Cretaceous
   warm periods. The two exceptions involve scenarios with relatively low
   climate sensitivity and stringent conservation measures, but even in
   these projections temperatures are as warm as any time in the last 30
   million years. These calculations suggest that regardless of emission
   scenario or system sensitivity, future greenhouse warming will be large
   even on a geological scale.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many ecosystems around the world are rapidly deteriorating due to both
   local and global pressures, and perhaps none so precipitously as coral
   reefs. Management of coral reefs through maintenance (e.g.,
   marine-protected areas, catchment management to improve water quality),
   restoration, as well as global and national governmental agreements to
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., the 2015 Paris Agreement) is
   critical for the persistence of coral reefs. Despite these initiatives,
   the health and abundance of corals reefs are rapidly declining and other
   solutions will soon be required. We have recently discussed options for
   using assisted evolution (i.e., selective breeding, assisted gene flow,
   conditioning or epigenetic programming, and the manipulation of the
   coral microbiome) as a means to enhance environmental stress tolerance
   of corals and the success of coral reef restoration efforts. The
   2014-2016 global coral bleaching event has sharpened the focus on such
   interventionist approaches. We highlight the necessity for consideration
   of alternative (e.g., hybrid) ecosystem states, discuss traits of
   resilient corals and coral reef ecosystems, and propose a decision tree
   for incorporating assisted evolution into restoration initiatives to
   enhance climate resilience of coral reefs.},

Title = {Using quantitative dynamic adaptive policy pathways to manage climate
   change-induced coastal erosion},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {Adaptation requires planning strategies that consider the combined
   effect of climatic and nonclimatic drivers, which are deeply uncertain.
   This uncertainty arises from many sources, cascades and accumulates in
   risk estimates. A prominent trend to incorporate this uncertainty in
   adaptation planning is through adaptive approaches such as the dynamic
   adaptive policy pathways (DAPP). We present a quantitative DAPP
   application for coastal erosion management to increase its utilisation
   in this field. We adopt an approach in which adaptation objectives and
   actions have continuous quantitative metrics that evolve over time as
   conditions change. The approach hinges on an adaptation information
   system that comprises hazard and impact modelling and systematic
   monitoring to assess changing risks and adaptation signals in the light
   of adaptation pathway choices. Using an elaborated case study, we force
   a shoreline evolution model with waves and storm surges generated by
   means of stochastic modelling from 2010 to 2100, considering uncertainty
   in extreme weather events, climate variability and mean sea-level rise.
   We produce a new type of adaptation pathways map showing a set of
   90-year probabilistic trajectories that link changing objectives (e.g.,
   no adaptation, limit risk increase, avoid risk increase) and nourishment
   placement over time. This DAPP approach could be applied to other
   domains of climate change adaptation bringing a new perspective in
   adaptive planning under deep uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Biochar-based subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (CWs) with
   intermittent aeration (IA) or tidal flow (TF) oxygen supply strategies
   were established to treat domestic wastewater. The results showed that
   biochar achieved higher nutrient removal and lower greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions than ceramsite while supporting more diverse bacterial
   communities and higher abundances of functional taxa. Both IA and TF
   effectively enhanced nutrient removal, though the latter was more
   efficient and practical, and aeration conditions greatly influenced
   nutrient removal efficiency. GHG emissions were decreased by IA but were
   slightly increased by TF. Both oxygen supply methods significantly
   shaped the biofilm microbial communities and influenced biodiversity and
   richness, with observably higher proportions of potential nitrifiers and
   denitrifiers present in aerated CWs. Overall, biochar-based CWs operated
   with oxygen supply strategies provide superior treatment of
   decentralized wastewater.},

Abstract = {This article presents a proposal for the implementation of photovoltaic
   systems in homes located in Mexicali, Mexico. With exhibition of new
   insulation and different consumption characteristics. The photovoltaic
   low power system is proposed as a type of electrical supply that helps
   in reducing the environmental impact of generating energy by burning
   fossil fuels. A photovoltaic system installed in the city of Yuma,
   Arizona in the United States, which supplies the electrical needs to a
   building is selected as a reference for solar resource use. Energy use
   improvement and consumption costs are calculated, and the equivalent
   amounts of greenhouse gases, not generated since solar technologies were
   implemented are determined. Furthermore, comparisons of the solar
   potential between Yuma and Mexicali show that the Mexican city has a
   higher annual solar potential, so the applicability of this solar
   technology is too feasible in Mexicali. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Modelling of a Wave Energy Converter Impact on Coastal Erosion, a Case
   Study for Palm Beach-Azur, Algeria},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Facing the exhaustion of fossil energy and in the context of sustainable
   development, strong incentives are pushing for the development of
   renewable energies. Nuclear energy and fossil fuels like petroleum,
   coal, and natural gas provide most of the energy produced today. As a
   result, greenhouse gases are released and climate change becomes
   irreversible. Furthermore, radioactive waste disposal causes severe
   radiation pollution in nuclear power. Alternatives such as marine energy
   are more sustainable and predictable. It has none of the detrimental
   effects of fossil and nuclear energies and is significant in terms of
   environmental sustainability by defending the coastline from erosion.
   Here, we study the Palm Beach-Azur region near Algiers on the
   Mediterranean Sea. The study aims to use wave energy converters (WEC) to
   generate clean energy and reduce coastline erosion. The results of this
   study show that in the presence of wave energy converters, the wave
   height decreased by 0.3 m, and sediment deposition increased by 0.8 m.
   Thus, sand deposit prediction demonstrates that the presence of WEC
   decreases marine erosion and contributes to an accumulation of sediments
   on the coast. Moreover, this confirms that WECs can serve a dual role of
   extracting marine energy by converting it into electrical energy and as
   a defence against marine erosion. Therefore, WECs justify their
   efficiency both in energy production and economic and environmental
   profitability due to coastal protection.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas flux with reflooding of a drained salt marsh soil},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and bury more C per
   square meter annually than any other ecosystem. Reclamation and
   anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of
   salt marshes. Carbon credits can be generated and sold by restoring
   marshes, but only if C sequestration and net reductions in greenhouse
   gases (GHG) are reliably quantified. Restored marshes, however, may
   exhibit different patterns of GHG emissions than natural marshes and it
   is possible that they could temporarily become sources of N2O even in
   the usually N-limited estuarine environment. Research on short-term GHG
   flux following salt marsh restoration is limited to studies of two
   restored marshes which examined GHG flux more than six months after the
   return of tidal flooding. Here we report on a laboratory experiment in
   which soil cores collected from a drained agricultural marsh on the St.
   Lawrence Estuary were flooded with estuary water. Gas flux measurements
   immediately after flooding revealed small increases in N2O and CH4, but
   a large decline in CO(2 )yielding, from a climatic perspective, a net
   cooling effect over the observation period. In addition to restoring the
   land's capacity to sequester C once a marsh develops, returning tidal
   flooding thus appears to have the added benefit of stemming large
   ongoing C losses. With more than 400 km(2) of undeveloped dykeland,
   Eastern Canada is well positioned to restore large sections of marsh and
   contribute to reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.},

Journal = {WETLANDS},

Pages = {831-842},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The relationship between methane emissions and salinity is not well
   understood in tidal marshes, leading to uncertainty about the net effect
   of marsh conservation and restoration on greenhouse gas balance. We used
   published and unpublished field data to investigate the relationships
   between tidal marsh methane emissions, salinity, and porewater
   concentrations of methane and sulfate, then used these relationships to
   consider the balance between methane emissions and soil carbon
   sequestration. Polyhaline tidal marshes (salinity > 18) had
   significantly lower methane emissions (mean +/- sd = 1 +/- 2 gm(-2)
   yr(-1)) than other marshes, and can be expected to decrease radiative
   forcing when created or restored. There was no significant difference in
   methane emissions from fresh (salinity=0-0.5) and mesohaline (5-18)
   marshes (42 +/- 76 and 16 +/- 11 gm(-2) yr(-1), respectively), while
   oligohaline (0.5-5) marshes had the highest and most variable methane
   emissions (150 +/- 221 gm(-2) yr(-1)). Annual methane emissions were
   modeled using a linear fit of salinity against log-transformed methane
   flux (log(CH4) - -0.056 x salinity + 1: 38; r(2) = 0.52; p < 0.0001).
   Managers interested in using marshes as greenhouse gas sinks can assume
   negligible methane emissions in polyhaline systems, but need to estimate
   or monitor methane emissions in lower-salinity marshes.},

Title = {What Are the Impacts of a Coastal Zone Protection Policy on Farmers'
   Livelihood Capital? Empirical Analysis From the Perspective of Farmer
   Participation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {To restore and protect the ecosystem service function of coastal zones,
   some farmers have changed their certain original production methods and
   lifestyles and some have even relinquished a portion of the economic
   benefits that could be obtained directly. What impacts do the coastal
   zone ecological protection policies bring to the livelihoods of coastal
   farmers? The strict coastline protection of Beibu Gulf, Hepu County,
   Beihai City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, is taken as an
   example. Combined with the sustainable livelihood framework (SLF), this
   paper set up an evaluation index system for the livelihood capital of
   farmers in the Beibu Gulf coastal zone, obtaining 568 valid
   questionnaires through a field survey, and use the propensity score
   matching and difference-in-difference (PSM-DID) method to study the
   impacts of a coastal ecological protection policy on the livelihood
   capital of coastal farmers from the perspective of farmer participation.
   The results show that (1) the coastal ecological protection policy had a
   significant impact on the natural capital and social capital of coastal
   farmers that actively participated in coastal ecological protection,
   which increased by 0.181 and 0.052, respectively. (2) However, it did
   not have a significant impact on the total livelihood capital, human
   capital, physical capital or financial capital. Therefore, this paper
   presents policy suggestions for constructing coastal ecological
   compensation mechanisms and for promoting active participation by
   coastal farmers in coastal ecological protection efforts.},

Abstract = {Limited water resources and greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels
   used in electricity production are problems experienced in Chile. To
   address water shortages, many copper mining companies have started to
   use seawater or desalinated water in their operations. However, seawater
   exerts a negative impact on the mineral processing operation. It reduces
   the recovery of copper and molybdenum minerals in the flotation of
   copper molybdenum sulfide ores due to the presence of calcium and
   magnesium ions. This study aims to propose a partial desalination
   treatment for calcium and magnesium species removal to improve the
   recovery of valuable minerals in the flotation of copper molybdenum
   sulfide ores. The proposed method uses carbon dioxide gas and sodium
   greenhouse gas emissions. hydroxide to promote the removal of calcium
   and magnesium ions from seawater. As a result, the partial desalination
   treatment can remove 60.5\% of calcium and 98.3\% of magnesium species.
   In addition, it helped in reaching a high recovery of molybdenum
   (81.1\%) and copper (93.4\%) as well as depressed pyrite (0.95\% of
   iron) in the flotation of copper-molybdenum sulfide ores. Therefore,
   partial desalination treatment could provide the appropriate water
   quality required in the froth flotation process and it could reduce
   carbon dioxide from greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {An integrated approach for physical, economic, and demographic
   evaluation of coastal flood hazard adaptation in Santa Monica Bay,
   California},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {The increased risk of coastal flooding associated with climate-change
   driven sea level rise threatens to displace communities and cause
   substantial damage to infrastructure. Site-specific adaptation planning
   is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of flooding on coastal
   residents and the built environment. Cost-benefit analyses used to
   evaluate coastal adaption strategies have traditionally focused on
   economic considerations, often overlooking potential demographic impacts
   that can directly influence vulnerability in coastal communities. Here,
   we present a transferable framework that couples hydrodynamic modeling
   of flooding driven by sea level rise and storm scenarios with
   site-specific building stock and census block-level demographic data. We
   assess the efficacy of multiple coastal adaptation strategies at
   reducing flooding, economic damages, and impacts to the local
   population. We apply this framework to evaluate a range of engineered,
   nature-based, and hybrid adaptation strategies for a portion of Santa
   Monica Bay, California. Overall, we find that dual approaches that
   provide protection along beaches using dunes or seawalls and along
   inlets using sluice gates perform best at reducing or eliminating
   flooding, damages, and population impacts. Adaptation strategies that
   include a sluice gate and partial or no protection along the beach are
   effective at reducing flooding around inlets but can exacerbate flooding
   elsewhere, leading to unintended impacts on residents. Our results also
   indicate trade-offs between economic and social risk-reduction
   priorities. The proposed framework allows for a comprehensive evaluation
   of coastal protection strategies across multiple objectives.
   Understanding how coastal adaptation strategies affect hydrodynamic,
   economic, and social factors at a local scale can enable more effective
   and equitable planning approaches.},

Title = {History and potential of renewable energy development in New Zealand},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2501-2509},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many years before greenhouse gas emission reduction became a major
   driver for renewable energy development, New Zealand was an early
   adopter of several alternative energy technologies, particularly
   hydroelectricity and geothermal energy. It has achieved a level of 60\%
   of total electricity generation from such sources, and is now pursuing a
   target of 95\% of electricity generation from renewable energy, to be
   achieved in fifteen years. In recent years, however, the development of
   renewables has lagged that of other countries, particularly in fields
   such as wind power. The paper reviews the history, current status and
   potential of the major renewable energy technologies in New Zealand, and
   suggests what may be current barriers to development. It is seen that
   the likely major contributors to replacing fossil fuel based energy are
   likely to be wind power and expanded geothermal energy use, with
   biomass, marine and solar energy sources likely to play a lesser role.
   The barriers to development include environmental issues, the
   opportunity cost of biomass feedstocks, and a policy environment
   offering less incentive to RE development than is the case in many other
   countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Role of Living Shorelines as Estuarine Habitat Conservation
   Strategies},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {161-174},
Abstract = {Globally, shoreline protection approaches are evolving towards the
   incorporation of natural and nature-based features (living shorelines
   henceforth) as a preferred alternative to shoreline armoring. Emerging
   research suggests that living shorelines may be a viable approach to
   conserving coastal habitats (marshes, beaches, shallows, seagrasses)
   along eroding shorelines. Living shorelines typically involve the use of
   coastal habitats, such as wetlands, that have a natural capacity to
   stabilize the shore, restore or conserve habitat, and maintain coastal
   processes. They provide stability while still being dynamic components
   of the ecosystem, but due to their dynamic nature, careful designs and
   some maintenance will be required if habitat conservation is a goal.
   Living shorelines may represent a singular opportunity for habitat
   conservation in urban and developing estuaries because of their value to
   society as a shoreline protection approach and resilience to sea level
   rise. However, enhanced public acceptance and coordination among
   regulatory and advisory authorities will be essential to expand their
   use. To fully understand their significance as habitat conservation
   strategies, systematic and standardized monitoring at both regional and
   national scales is vital to evaluate the evolution, persistence, and
   maximum achievable functionality (e.g., ecosystem service provision) of
   living shoreline habitats.},

Title = {A Perspective on Biofuels Use and CCS for GHG Mitigation in the Marine
   Sector},
Journal = {ISCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the marine sector were around
   2.6\% of world GHG emissions in 2015 and are expected to increase
   50\%-250\% to 2050 under a ``business as usual'' scenario, making the
   decarbonization of this fossil fuel-intensive sector an urgent priority.
   Biofuels, which come in various forms, are one of the most promising
   options to replace existing marine fuels for accomplishing this in the
   short to medium term. Some unique challenges, however, impede biofuels
   penetration in the shipping sector, including the low cost of the
   existing fuels, the extensive present-day refueling infrastructure, and
   the exclusion of the sector from the Paris climate agreement. To address
   this, it is necessary to first identify those biofuels best suited for
   deployment as marine fuel. In this work, the long list of possible
   biofuel candidates has been narrowed down to four high-potential
   options-bio-methanol, bio-dimethyl ether, bio-liquefied natural gas, and
   bio-oil. These options are further evaluated based on six criteria-cost,
   potential availability, present technology status, GHG mitigation
   potential, infrastructure compatibility, and carbon capture and storage
   (CCS) compatibility-via both an extensive literature review and
   stakeholder discussions. These four candidates turn out to be relatively
   evenly matched overall, but each possesses certain strengths and
   shortcomings that could favor that fuel under specific circumstances,
   such as if compatibility with existing shipping infrastructure or with
   CCS deployment become pivotal requirements. Furthermore, we pay
   particular attention to the possibility of integrating deployment of
   these biofuels with CCS to further reduce marine sector emissions. It is
   shown that this aspect is presently not on the radar of the industry
   stakeholders but is likely to grow in importance as CCS acceptability
   increases in the broader green energy sector.},

Abstract = {To meet the ambitious EC target of an 80\% reduction in greenhouse gas
   emissions by 2050, CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) needs to move rapidly
   towards full scale implementation with geological storage solutions both
   on and offshore. Onshore storage offers increased flexibility and
   reduced infrastructure and monitoring costs. Enabling onshore storage
   will support management of decarbonisation strategies at territory level
   while enhancing security of energy supply and local economic activities,
   and securing jobs across Europe. However, successful onshore storage
   also requires overcoming some unique technical and societal challenges.
   ENOS will provide crucial advances to help foster onshore CO2 storage
   across Europe through:
   1. Developing, testing and demonstrating in the field, under ``real-life
   conditions{''}, key technologies specifically adapted to onshore
   storage.
   2. Contributing to the creation of a favourable environment for onshore
   storage across Europe.
   The ENOS site portfolio will provide a great opportunity for
   demonstration of technologies for safe and environmentally sound storage
   at relevant scale. Best practices will be developed using experience
   gained from the field experiments with the participation of local
   stakeholders and the lay public. This will produce improved integrated
   research outcomes and increase stakeholder understanding and confidence
   in CO2 storage. In this improved framework, ENOS will catalyse new
   onshore pilot and demonstration projects in new locations and geological
   settings across Europe, taking into account the site-specific and local
   socio-economic context. By developing technologies from TRL4/5 to TRL6
   across the storage lifecycle, feeding the resultant knowledge and
   experience into training and education and cooperating at the
   pan-European and global level, ENOS will have a decisive impact on
   innovation and build the confidence needed for enabling onshore CO2
   storage in Europe.
   ENOS is initiating strong international collaboration between European
   researchers and their counterparts from the USA, Canada, South Korea,
   Australia and South Africa for sharing experience worldwide based on
   real-life onshore pilots and field experiments. Fostering
   experience-sharing and research alignment between existing sites is key
   to maximise the investment made at individual sites and to support the
   efficient large scale deployment of CCS. ENOS is striving to promote
   collaboration between sites in the world through a programme of site
   twinning, focus groups centered around operative issues and the creation
   of a leakage simulation alliance. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {The 2013 Pacific Coast Action Plan on Climate and Energy signed by the
   Governors of California, Oregon, and Washington and the Premier of
   British Columbia launched a broadly announced public commitment to
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions through multiple strategies. Those
   strategies include the development and increased use of renewable energy
   sources. The initiative recognized that citizens are both a central
   component in abating greenhouse gas emissions with regard to their
   energy use behaviors, and are important participants in the public
   policymaking process at both state and local levels of government. The
   study reported here examines whether either support or opposition to
   state government leadership in the development of alternative energy
   technologies can be explained by environmental values as measured by the
   New Ecological Paradigm (NEP). The research results are based on mail
   surveys of randomly selected households conducted throughout Oregon and
   Washington in late 2009 and early 2010. Findings suggest that younger
   and more highly educated respondents are significantly more likely than
   older and less educated respondents to either support or strongly
   support government policies to promote bioenergy, wind, geothermal, and
   solar energy. Those respondents with higher NEP scores are also more
   supportive of government promotion of wind, geothermal, and solar
   technologies than are those with lower NEP scores. Support for wave
   energy does not show a statistical correlation with environmental
   values, maybe a reflection of this technology's nascent level of
   development. The paper concludes with a consideration of the
   implications of these findings for environmental management.},

Abstract = {Fourteen countries have signed an agreement to take part in an initial
   three-year programme of research and development aimed at potential
   mitigation techniques in response to the issue of global warming. Formed
   under the aegis of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the programme
   brings together those countries interested in establishing the
   techniques, costs, and environmental consequences of removing CO2 and
   other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-based power station flue gases
   and storing or otherwise disposing of them. The programme has evaluated
   many fossil fuel power generation options, with the technologies
   required for CO2 removal. Using the technical and economic results from
   these studies the programme has recently commenced a detailed
   specification for a series of full scale `full fuel cycle' studies. The
   programme will culminate in proposals aimed at demonstration facilities
   should any of the full fuel cycle technologies show sufficient promise.
   In addition, the programme could be expanded to look in more detail at
   CO2 disposal options and the question of methane and its contribution to
   global warming. The project structure and work programme to date are
   described in outline and a summary of the results to date is given, with
   an overview of all of the technologies involved.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1827-1842},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasing the threat of erosion and flooding along
   coastlines globally. Engineering solutions (e.g. seawalls and
   breakwaters) in response to protecting coastal communities and
   associated infrastructure are increasingly becoming economically and
   ecologically unsustainable. This has led to recommendations to create or
   restore natural habitats, such as sand dunes, saltmarsh, mangroves,
   seagrass and kelp beds, and coral and shellfish reefs, to provide
   coastal protection in place of (or to complement) artificial structures.
   Coastal managers are frequently faced with the problem of an eroding
   coastline, which requires a decision on what mitigation options are most
   appropriate to implement. A barrier to uptake of nature-based coastal
   defence is stringent evaluation of the effectiveness in comparison to
   artificial protection structures. Here, we assess the current evidence
   for the efficacy of nature-based vs. artificial coastal protection and
   discuss future research needs. Future projects should evaluate habitats
   created or restored for coastal defence for cost-effectiveness in
   comparison to an artificial structure under the same environmental
   conditions. Cost-benefit analyses should take into consideration all
   ecosystem services provided by nature-based or artificial structures in
   addition to coastal protection. Interdisciplinary research among
   scientists, coastal managers and engineers is required to facilitate the
   experimental trials needed to test the value of these shoreline
   protection schemes, in order to support their use as alternatives to
   artificial structures. This research needs to happen now as our rapidly
   changing climate requires new and innovative solutions to reduce the
   vulnerability of coastal communities to an increasingly uncertain
   future.},

Title = {Nature-based solutions for coastal adaptation management, concepts and
   scope, an overview},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Abstract = {The paper introduces nature-based solutions (NBS) and their application
   in coastal adaptation management. NBS seek to make use of local natural
   elements and processes in coastal ecosystems, as much as possible, to
   harness forces of nature for the benefit of society. We focus on soft
   sedimentary coasts, like beaches and dunes, salt marshes, seagrass beds
   and mangroves. By shifting coastal management from conventional
   `Building in Nature' to `Building with Nature', NBS can be seen as a
   valuable alternative to the traditional approach, which is based on
   hydraulic, civil engineered designs. NBS can be applied in diverse
   situations and at various scales, from small-scale (ecosystem elements,
   a small pond) to large-scale (entire coastal stretches). The practice of
   NBS is also valuable for climate change adaptation, when forces of
   nature will increase. NBS requires a governance setting that makes use
   of an integrated approach with disciplines of ecology, economy and
   society working together. But integration is not yet common practise in
   many countries. We conclude that NBS are a promising alternative to the
   traditional approach. Because the practise still is relatively young,
   more field and laboratory projects should be executed, in particular
   under extreme weather conditions. The future challenge is to build up
   more stakeholder acceptance and (local) trust in the concept.},

Abstract = {Climate change is probably the greatest threat to global ecosystems that
   humanity has ever faced. Greenhouse gases, primarily from the production
   and combustion of fossil fuels for human energy needs, are heating up
   our atmosphere, changing our climate, and threatening the health and
   well-being of people the world over. Pre dieted consequences of climate
   change include more frequent extreme weather events such as intensive
   precipitation, drought and floods, rising sea levels, increased smog in
   cities, and the possible spread of tropical diseases to more temperate
   dimes. These grim effects can be limited if societies throughout the
   world act quickly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Substantially
   reducing emissions, however, means a fundamental shift in the way we
   produce and consume energy. To help bring about change, scientists,
   health professionals and nongovernment organizations such as the David
   Suzuki Foundation must work together to educate and motivate the public,
   industries, business organizations, and governments to take actions that
   will reduce the threat of global warming.},

Abstract = {This paper describes coastal resilience as a measure of the extent to
   which a coast is able to respond to external pressures without losing
   actual or potential functions. Such usage of the term gives coastal
   scientists, planners and managers a new opportunity to express complex
   coastal dynamics in a simple aggregated form. Coastal resilience has
   morphological, ecological and socio-economic components, each of which
   represents another aspect of the coastal system's adaptive capacity to
   perturbations. Enhancing coastal resilience is increasingly viewed as a
   cost-effective way to prepare for uncertain future changes while
   maintaining opportunities for coastal development. The Netherlands has
   known a long tradition of controlling natural coastal processes by
   stringent dune management and building hard sea-defence structures.
   However, both socio-economic and natural adaptive processes have become
   constrained owing to the limited availability of land and the diminished
   coastal resilience that has resulted from technological solutions and
   legal provisions. The recent study Growing with the Sea proposes to
   restore natural coastal processes along the Dutch coast and let natural
   and socio-economic systems interact more dynamically. It explores
   possibilities of enhancing coastal resilience in The Netherlands by
   allowing managed retreat in areas where it is environmentally acceptable
   and reclaiming land in other areas.},

Abstract = {Since environmental impacts of desalination processes are intrinsically
   related to system efficiency, per water-unit produced loads have
   constantly decreased over the past decades. However, some significant
   fouls remain. The example of Spain is punctually used throughout this
   paper, to illustrate the main environmental impacts of the desalination
   technology. One major concern is the potential environmental impacts
   caused by extensive brine discharge; unavoidable desalination
   sub-product that may heavily affect marine biota. Recommendations are
   outlined to reduce environmental degradation related to hypersalinity. A
   further drawback is the production of greenhouse gases associated with
   the required power generation. Environmental loads of any process can be
   considerably reduced when integrated with renewable energy production
   systems. After these two `direct' environmental impacts are addressed,
   some socially-induced factors leading to unsustainable water management

Abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is one of the
   mainstays of today's society that provides major impacts on our
   professional, private lives but also most important drivers of economic
   growth. It is very true that fossil fuel combustion produces carbon
   dioxide, which is the cause of the greenhouse effect. This Greenhouse
   effect is the major reason for climate change. Therefore, this climate
   change problem is related to an energy challenge. The effective measure
   that reduces carbon emission is the replacement of conventional
   combustion fossil fuel into renewable energies like solar, wind, water,
   tides and geothermal heat. In order to recover the climate change, we
   require greenhouse gas reduction using renewable sources with effective
   ICTs. ICT embedded renewable energy storage system can enable wider
   geographic scopes of grid integration, optimized energy demand
   management and dynamic pricing. The paper discussed about the

Abstract = {Climate change impacts on marine life in the world ocean are expected to
   accelerate over the 21st century, affecting the structure and
   functioning of food webs. We analyzed a key aspect of this issue,
   focusing on the impact of changes in biomass flow within marine food
   webs and the resulting effects on ecosystem biomass and production. We
   used a modeling framework based on a parsimonious quasi-physical
   representation of biomass flow through the food web, to explore the
   future of marine consumer biomass and production at the global scale
   over the 21st century. Biomass flow is determined by three
   climate-related factors: primary production entering the food web,
   trophic transfer efficiency describing losses in biomass transfers from
   one trophic level (TL) to the next, and flow kinetic measuring the speed
   of biomass transfers within the food web. Using climate projections of
   three earth system models, we calculated biomass and production at each
   TL on a 1 degrees latitude x1 degrees longitude grid of the global ocean
   under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We show that the
   alterations of the trophic functioning of marine ecosystems, mainly
   driven by faster and less efficient biomass transfers and decreasing
   primary production, would lead to a projected decline in total consumer
   biomass by 18.5\% by 2090-2099 relative to 1986-2005 under the ``no
   mitigation policy{''} scenario. The projected decrease in transfer
   efficiency is expected to amplify impacts at higher TLs, leading to a
   21.3\% decrease in abundance of predators and thus to a change in the
   overall trophic structure of marine ecosystems. Marine animal production
   is also projected to decline but to a lesser extent than biomass. Our
   study highlights that the temporal and spatial projected changes in
   biomass and production would imply direct repercussions on the future of
   world fisheries and beyond all services provided by Ocean.},

Abstract = {Low elevation coastal zones (LECZ) are extensive throughout the
   southeastern United States. LECZ communities are threatened by
   inundation from sea level rise, storm surge, wetland degradation, land
   subsidence, and hydrological flooding. Communication among scientists,
   stakeholders, policy makers and minority and poor residents must
   improve. We must predict processes spanning the ecological, physical,
   social, and health sciences. Communities need to address linkages of (1)
   human and socioeconomic vulnerabilities; (2) public health and safety;
   (3) economic concerns; (4) land loss; (5) wetland threats; and (6)
   coastal inundation. Essential capabilities must include a network to
   assemble and distribute data and model code to assess risk and its
   causes, support adaptive management, and improve the resiliency of
   communities. Better communication of information and understanding among
   residents and officials is essential. Here we review recent background
   literature on these matters and offer recommendations for integrating
   natural and social sciences. We advocate for a cyber-network of
   scientists, modelers, engineers, educators, and stakeholders from
   academia, federal state and local agencies, non-governmental
   organizations, residents, and the private sector. Our vision is to
   enhance future resilience of LECZ communities by offering approaches to
   mitigate hazards to human health, safety and welfare and reduce impacts
   to coastal residents and industries.},

Abstract = {Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat
   to Europe and the world. Each year that passes the atmosphere warms up
   and the climate changes with possible catastrophic consequences for all
   living species. It is therefore necessary to implement a decisive change
   of course in terms of energy and environmental strategies at a global
   level, gradually abandoning the use of fossil sources in favor of
   renewable ones. A lot of country participates to European or global
   energy treaties or pacts to reduce step by step their fossil energy
   consumption and greenhouse gas. Among all renewable energies, the
   engineering department of the University of Palermo focuses the
   exploitation of sea energy. The study reported in this abstract involved
   the optimization of a WEC (wave energy converter) in term of geometry.
   The device focused is a point absorber with a PTO (power take off)
   composed by a linear generator. The software used to model the WEC is
   ``Ansys Aqwa{''}.},

Abstract = {The European goals to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 40\% by 2030 and
   reach carbon neutrality by 2050 cannot ignore the building sector, that
   accounts for 27\% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In the context of
   the sustainable development goals, it is a key point to consider the
   reduction of the heat island effect in the urban environment.
   Considering this background and the proven absence of the clear
   promotion of urban mitigation measures, the research aims at
   investigating the influence on several micro-climate parameters of
   different retrofitting strategies at the building level (green facades)
   and the cooling strategies at the urban scale (e.g., cool pavements,
   trees). As a case study, the application of these measures in an
   industrial district located in Italy is evaluated. ENVI-met software was
   adopted to perform the outdoor environmental simulations, in order to
   assess the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies proposed,
   considering both the whole district and a portion, focusing on urban
   canyons. Cool pavements proved to be the most promising strategy to both
   reduce the air temperature and increase the relative humidity. Slighter
   effects on environmental conditions can be achieved by planting trees
   and installing green walls that, by contrast, significantly affect the
   mean radiant temperature and buildings' surface temperatures,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {For remote agriculture-based rural areas, utilizing the local renewable
   resources such as biomass, wind, and solar energy could be potentially
   more efficient than long-distance transmission of electricity. In this
   paper, a multi-objective optimization model for the design of standalone
   hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) in remote rural areas is
   proposed. The objective is to maximize the profits and the carbon
   abatement capability of the system by optimal process selection and
   sizing of HRES components including solar, wind, and biomass generation
   systems. A case study for the design of an HRES on the Carabao Island in
   the Philippines is conducted. The result shows a 122 kW solar power
   plant, a 67 kW onshore wind farm and a 223 kW biomass pyrolysis system
   constitute the optimal configuration of the hybrid energy system,
   generating a daily profit of US\$ 940. The greenhouse gas emission of
   the optimal system is -3,339 kg CO2 eq/day, indicating good carbon
   sequestration performance. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Decision making under catastrophic risk and learning: the case of the
   possible collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {193-209},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A collapse of the West-Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) would cause a sea
   level rise of 5-6 m, perhaps even within 100 years, with catastrophic
   consequences. The probability of such a collapse is small but increasing
   with the rise of the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas and
   the resulting climate change. This paper investigates how the potential
   collapse of the WAIS affects the optimal rate of greenhouse gas emission
   control. We design a decision and learning tree in which decision are
   made about emission reduction at regular intervals: the decision makers
   (who act as social planners) have to decide whether to implement the
   environmental or not (keeping then the flexibility to act later). By
   investing in the environmental policy, they determine optimally the date
   of the optimal emission reduction. At the same time, they receive new
   information on the probability of a WAIS collapse and the severity of
   its impacts. The probability of a WAIS collapse is endogenous and
   contingent on greenhouse gas concentrations. We solve this optimisation
   problem by backward induction. We find that a potential WAIS collapse
   substantially bring the date of the optimal emission reduction forward
   and increases its amount if the probability is high enough (a
   probability of 1\% per year for the worst case), if the impacts are high
   enough (a worst case damage of 10\% of GDP for a 3 degrees C warming) or
   if the decision maker is risk averse enough (for example a social damage
   due to pollution equal to 1\% GDP for an atmospheric temperature of 3
   degrees C). We also find that, as soon as a WAIS collapse is a foregone
   fact, emission reduction falls to free up resource to prepare for
   adapting to the inevitable. By contrast, adaptation (such as building
   dikes along the coast) postpones policy intervention because that
   strategy reduces the risk of catastrophic damages.},

Title = {Farming the Ocean - Seaweeds as a Quick Fix for the Climate?},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE \& AQUACULTURE},
Abstract = {Finding ways to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius is urgent
   and will need a portfolio of solutions. Seaweeds are marine
   photosynthetic organisms that humans harvest either from the wild or
   farm, to be used in many applications and providing various ecosystem
   services. Large scale farming of seaweeds for absorbing carbon has
   lately been promoted as a climate ``fix{''}. The major shortcomings of
   this argument relate to the idea that a carbon sink function should
   exist through carbon accumulation in seaweed biomass simultaneously as
   seaweeds are consumed as food by humans, fed to animals, or used in many
   alternative applications. This carbon instead enters the fast carbon
   cycle and does not provide any ``carbon sink{''} function. Radical
   suggestions of intentionally transfer of farmed seaweeds to the deep-sea
   to accomplish a longer removal are highly questionable from feasibility,
   economic, ecosystem effects and ethical resource use perspectives.
   Development of ``ocean forests{''} for carbon capturing through farming
   should not be compared to forests on land as these provide carbon
   removal from the atmosphere at sufficiently long time scales to be
   qualified as carbon sequestration - thus making a difference related to
   reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Seaweeds can,
   however, play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the
   overall food system through carbon offset - i.e. if replacing food,
   feed, and/or materials that have larger carbon footprints. The
   fate/cycling of carbon as particulate and dissolved matter from both
   farmed and wild seaweeds, are however not fully understood, especially
   with respect to pathways and time scales relevant for carbon
   removal/storage. Another potential pathway for their role in
   decarbonization may be through reducing enteric methane emissions from
   ruminants and also through bioenergy production. More research is,
   however, needed for understanding the contributions from such
   interventions. Presenting seaweed farming as a quick fix for the climate
   risks facilitating misdirected investments (for carbon abatement
   solutions) and reducing demand for specific research and technological
   development that will be needed for increasing our understanding about
   seaweeds' contribution to food/feed systems and additional
   sustainability services and benefits.},

Abstract = {Wetland systems play important roles in the issues of global warming.
   That is because wetlands can not only intake carbon and nitrogen in the
   plants and sediments, but could also release carbon dioxide (CO2),
   methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere during the
   microbial decomposition processes in the water. In the past, greenhouse
   gases (GHGs) were measured mostly by using the manual sampling
   technique; however, it is difficult to measure the diurnal variation of
   greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, a floating chamber used to
   collect GHGs, which were then in-site monitored with a continuous GHG
   analyzer, through a Teflon tube connected to the top of the chamber was
   designed. The data for seasonal and diurnal variations of GHGs, emission
   fluxes of GHGs, and equivalent carbon dioxide emissions (CO2-e) were
   measured to explore the extent of a saline mangrove constructed wetland
   contributing to global warming. In addition, the correlation and
   regression analysis among greenhouse gas emissions, water quality, and
   other environmental factors were analyzed statistically. The results of
   continuous monitoring of GHGs showed that the concentrations of CO2
   emitted from a saline mangrove constructed wetland ranged from 383.5 +/-
   25.9 to 476.8 +/- 24.2 ppm. The diurnal variation of GHG concentrations
   was significant, which showed that the GHG concentrations in the daytime
   were generally lower than those at nighttime. The emissions of methane
   (CH4) from the wetland were monitored in a range between 3.7 +/- 1.4 and
   28.6 +/- 7.6 ppm, while the concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emitted from the wetlands ranged from 3.1 +/- 2.6 to 0.9 +/- 0.6 ppm.
   Hence, the diurnal variations of CH4 and N2O concentrations showed
   higher values in the daytime than those at nighttime. The correlation
   analytical results among GHG emissions, water quality, and other
   environmental factors presented that the emission fluxes of CO2 and BOD5
   were positively correlated, but a negative correlation was shown for
   global solar radiation (GSR). Moreover, the concentrations of CH4 and
   N2O had moderately positive correlation with both air temperature and
   water temperature.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems are under the direct threat of increasing
   atmospheric greenhouse gases, which increase seawater temperatures in
   the oceans and lead to bleaching events. Global bleaching events are
   becoming more frequent and stronger, and understanding how corals can
   tolerate and survive high-temperature stress should be accorded
   paramount priority. Here, we review evidence of the different mechanisms
   that corals employ to mitigate thermal stress, which include association
   with thermally tolerant endosymbionts, acclimatisation, and adaptation
   processes. These differences highlight the physiological diversity and
   complexity of symbiotic organisms, such as scleractinian corals, where
   each species (coral host and microbial endosymbionts) responds
   differently to thermal stress. We conclude by offering some insights
   into the future of coral reefs and examining the strategies scientists
   are leveraging to ensure the survival of this valuable ecosystem.
   Without a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a divergence from
   our societal dependence on fossil fuels, natural mechanisms possessed by
   corals might be insufficient towards ensuring the ecological functioning
   of coral reef ecosystems.},

Title = {Climate change, seaports, and coastal management in Brazil: An overview
   of the policy framework},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Seaports are exposed to a variety of coastal risks, particularly when
   considering the effects of climate change, due to their location in the
   land-sea interface. The vulnerability of seaports, besides the
   robustness and design of their infrastructures, is also directly related
   to their adaptive capacity. A policy framework plays an important role
   in facing the effects of climate change by virtue of planning and
   supporting the implementation of adaptive measures. This research aims
   to identify and evaluate the extent to which the climate change topic is
   addressed by the port planning, coastal management, and climate
   adaptation policies of Brazil. A policy review was carried out and the
   documents were evaluated based on the achievement of the Sustainable
   Development Goal 13 (climate action) targets. A multiscale analysis was
   performed to identify how different management levels address the topic
   in their planning. The results suggest that although Brazil has
   effectively addressed the climate issue with its Adaptation National
   Plan, the coastal management framework and primarily port planning both
   remain uncertain. The existing coastal policies for climate adaptation
   purposes remain virtually not implemented, and accomplishments related
   to port adaptations are based only on a recent national sustainability
   guideline agenda. Although climate change impacts are perceived on a
   local scale, the Brazilian coastal ports and cities have not
   institutionalized efforts to taking climate-adaptive actions. This
   observed gap points out the necessity of policymakers to enhance the
   planning and application of adaptation measures at the local level, as
   well as promote the cooperation between multiscale sectoral agencies.
   This overview illustrates several opportunities to update, redesign, and
   innovate coastal and port management instruments to address
   climate-related issues. Nature-based Solutions would appear as a
   fundamental approach to be incorporated in multi-scale policy
   frameworks, which would support coastal ports and cities in their
   becoming climate-resilient, thus containing socio-economic losses and
   environmental deterioration.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study conducts the first systematic literature review of climate
   change adaptation in aquaculture. We address three specific questions:
   (i) What is aquaculture adapting to? (ii) How is aquaculture adapting?
   and (iii) What research gaps need to be addressed? We identify,
   characterise and examine case studies published between 1990 and 2018
   that lie at the intersection of the domains of climate change,
   adaptation and aquaculture. The main areas of documented climate change
   impacts relate to extreme events and the general impacts of climate
   change on the aquaculture sector. Three categories of adaptation to
   climate change are identified: coping mechanisms at the local level
   (e.g. water quality management techniques), multilevel adaptive
   strategies (e.g. changing culture practices) and management approaches
   (e.g. adaptation planning, community-based adaptation). We identify four
   potential areas for future research: research on inland aquaculture
   adaptation; studies at the household level; whether different groups of
   aquaculture farmers (e.g. indigenous people) face and adapt differently
   to climate change; and the use of GIS and remote sensing as
   cost-effective tools for developing adaptation strategies and responses.
   The study brings essential practical and theoretical insights to the
   aquaculture industry as well as to climate change adaptation research
   across the globe.},

Abstract = {Human society needs to achieve a low-carbon energy mix this century. To
   achieve this, we need: (a) an appreciation of the value of Earth's
   atmosphere; and (b) a sustainable approach for low-carbon energy. For
   sustainable developments, three pillars need to work together: the
   environment, social equity and economics. To address the societal
   aspects of the low-carbon energy transition, we need to appreciate that
   our future depends on protecting the Earth's atmosphere. By reviewing
   the discovery of the greenhouse gas effect over the last 200 years, we
   establish the essential motivation for changing human behaviour with
   regard to energy use. From this basis, we consider the challenge of how
   to achieve this energy transition or, more specifically, how to overcome
   the dissonances related to societal acceptance, economic hurdles and
   lack of progress with deployment of low-carbon energy options. The last
   decade has seen a significant growth in the renewable energy and natural
   gas sectors: however, CCS has made limited progress. This has to change
   if the human population is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions. In order to accelerate reductions in global CO2 emissions,
   all low-carbon energy options must be deployed at an increasing rate in
   the coming decades.},

Title = {Financial and Economic Assessment of Tidal Stream Energy-A Case Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This case study is based on actual project and consultancy work,
   balancing real life experience with a review and analysis of empirical
   and theoretical literature. Tidal stream energy (TSE) is still a nascent
   technology, but with much better predictability than the classical
   alternatives of sun and wind. Being still more expensive than other
   renewable technologies, it is important to find locations in order to
   initiate a learning process to bring down cost to a competitive level as
   it was the case for solar and wind technologies. Locations for an
   initial phase of operation of TSE small islands in the Philippines (and
   other Asian countries) were found to be most suitable, because expensive
   and polluting diesel generators can be replaced and a reliable 24 h
   electricity supply can be established. Different appraisal methods in
   different scenarios show that under normal circumstances a hybrid
   combination of TSE, solar energy and battery storage is financially and
   economically superior to existing fossil energy based power stations as
   well as to solar energy alone. However, the traditional financial
   approaches are not always reliable, in spite of superficial mathematical
   exactness, and the parameters used must be analysed carefully,
   especially if we deal with innovative technologies with fast changes. In
   times of global warming we must also include the controversial issue of
   evaluating damages from greenhouse gases if choosing fossil
   alternatives. When evaluating and planning renewable technologies,
   engineering know-how is important, but insufficient. Since financing is
   a crucial issue for most renewable technologies with high front loaded
   cost and long amortisation periods, a thorough and trustworthy financial
   and economic analysis is necessary not only to avoid financial failure
   later on, but also to attract stakeholders like private investors, banks
   and government institutions to support a still unknown technology.},

   deforestation and climate change in coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {68-75},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Bangladesh, export-oriented shrimp farming is one of the most
   important sectors of the national economy. However, shrimp farming in
   coastal Bangladesh has devastating effects on mangrove forests.
   Mangroves are the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics, and blue
   carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions from
   mangrove deforestation due to shrimp cultivation are accumulating. These
   anthropogenic carbon emissions are the dominant cause of climate change,
   which in turn affect shrimp cultivation. Some adaptation strategies
   including Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA), mangrove
   restoration, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest
   Degradation (REDD +) could help to reduce blue carbon emissions.
   Translocation of shrimp culture from mangroves to open-water IMTA and
   restoration of habitats could reduce blue carbon emissions, which in
   turn would increase blue carbon sequestration. Mangrove restoration by
   the REDD + program also has the potential to conserve mangroves for
   resilience to climate change. However, institutional support is needed
   to implement the proposed adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Most sewers in developing countries are combined sewers which receive
   stormwater and effluent from septic tanks or cesspools of households and
   buildings. Although the wastewater strength in these sewers is usually
   lower than those in developed countries, due to improper construction
   and maintenance, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) could be relatively
   long and resulting considerable greenhouse gas (GHG) production. This
   study proposed an empirical model to predict the quantity of methane
   production in gravity-flow sewers based on relevant parameters such as
   surface area to volume ratio (A/V) of sewer, hydraulic retention time
   (HRT) and wastewater temperature. The model was developed from field
   survey data of gravity-flow sewers located in a peri-urban area, central
   Thailand and validated with field data of a sewer system of the Gold
   Coast area, Queensland, Australia. Application of this model to improve
   construction and maintenance of gravity-flow sewers to minimize GHG
   production and reduce global warming is presented.},

Title = {Estimating the full greenhouse gas emissions offset potential and
   profile between rehabilitating and established mangroves},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {665},
Pages = {419-431},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests are extremely productive, with rates of growth rivaling
   some terrestrial tropical rainforests. However, our understanding of the
   full suite of processes underpinning carbon exchange with the atmosphere
   and near shore-waters, the allocation of carbon in mangroves, and fluxes
   of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) are limited to a handful of studies.
   This constrains the scientific basis from which to advocate for greater
   support for and investment in mangrove restoration and conservation.
   Improving understanding is urgently needed given the on-going landuse
   pressures mangrove forests face, particularly throughout much of
   Southeast Asia. The current study reduces uncertainties by providing a
   holistic synthesis of the net potential GHG mitigation benefits
   resulting from rehabilitating mangroves and established forests.
   Rehabilitating sites from two contrasting locations representative of
   high (Tiwoho) and low (Tanakeke) productivity systems on the island of
   Sulawesi (Indonesia) were used as case studies to compare against
   established mangroves. A carbon budget, allocation and pathways model
   was developed to account for inputs (carbon sequestration) and outputs
   (GHG emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4) to estimate Net Ecosystem Production
   (NEP) and Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance (NECB). Our results indicate that
   while Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites and established mangroves represent
   a significant carbon sink (-10.6 +/- 0.9 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1) and 16.1
   Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1) respectively), the low productivity of Tanakeke
   has resulted in minimal reductions to date (0.7 +/- 0.3 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1)
   y(-1)). Including NEP from mangrove-allied primary producer communities
   (e.g. benthic algae) and the portion of dissolved inorganic carbon
   exported from mangroves (EXDIC) that remainswithin the water column may
   drive overall removals considerably upwards in established forests to
   37.2 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1). These values are higher than terrestrial
   forests and strengthen the evidence base needed to underpin the use of
   forest carbon financing mechanisms for mangrove restoration. (c) 2019

Abstract = {Soil redox potential (Eh), concentrations of oxygen (O-2) and three
   greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O) were measured in the soil profile
   of a coastal forest at ridge, transition, and swamp across a
   hydrological gradient. The results delineated a distinct boundary in
   soil Eh and O-2 concentration between the ridge and swamp with
   essentially no overlap between the two locations. Critical soil Eh to
   initiate significant CH4 production under this field conditions was
   about +300 mV, much higher than in the homogenous soils (about -150 mV).
   The strength of CH4 source to the atmosphere was strong for the swamp,
   minor for the transition, and negligible or even negative (consumption)
   for the ridge. Maximum N2O concentration in the soils was found at about
   Eh +250 mV, and the soil N2O emission was estimated to account for less
   than 4\% for the ridge and transition, and almost negligible for the
   swamp in the cumulative global warming potential (GWP) of these three
   gases. The dynamic nature of this study site in response to water table
   fluctuations across a hydrological gradient makes it an ideal model of
   impact of future sea level rise to coastal ecosystems. Soil carbon (C)
   sequestration potential due to increasing soil water content upon sea
   level rise and subsidence in this coastal forest was likely limited and
   temporal, and at the expense of increasing soil CH4 production and
   emission. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Consequences resulting from future Climate Change may be one of the most
   severe threats for people and economies in many countries of the world.
   With respect to Coastal Protection, the resulting changed hydrodynamic
   impacts are discussed globally. At present, a world-wide average sea
   level rise of less than 1.0 m within the 21st century can be assumed to
   be reasonable order of magnitude. Nevertheless, other sources, which are
   taking into account possible melting of the two main continental ice
   covers, estimate significantly higher values, especially over long
   periods. Besides the problem of sea level rise, also possible general
   changes in the frequency and intensity of storms as well as general
   changes in the average wind field are discussed worldwide. With respect

Abstract = {Making decisions and efficiently allocating resources to reduce the
   vulnerability of coastal communities requires, among other things, an
   understanding of the factors that make a society vulnerable to climate
   and coastal hazards. One way of doing this is through the analysis of
   spatial data. We demonstrate how to apply GIS methods to spatially
   represent socioeconomic vulnerability in Grenada, a tropical small
   island developing state (SIDS) in the Eastern Caribbean. Our model
   combines spatial features representing variables of social sensitivity,
   community adaptive capacity, and community exposure to flooding in an
   integrated vulnerability index. We draw from the fields of climate
   change adaptation, disaster management, and poverty and development to
   select our variables enabling unique, cross sector, applications of our
   assessment. Mapping our results illustrates that vulnerability to
   flooding is not evenly distributed across the country and is not driven
   by the same factors in all areas of Grenada. This indicates a need for
   the implementation of different strategies in communities across Grenada
   to help effectively reduce vulnerability to climate and coastal hazards.
   The approach presented in this paper can be used to address national
   issues on climate change adaptation, disaster management, and poverty
   and development and more effectively utilize funds in order to reduce
   community vulnerability to natural hazards today and in the future.},

Abstract = {The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is very important challenge on
   offshore engineering. It is expected that the wind energy platform plays
   important roles on the clean energy development. In the present study,
   it is carried out the dynamic response analysis of the offshore wind
   energy platform due to wave force and seismic force with uncertainty.
   There are some uncertainties not only for dynamic forces such as wave
   and seismic forces but also the structure with aging effects. Applying
   the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method to the dynamic response of the
   offshore platform, it is efficiently carried out the dynamic response
   estimations for the uncertainty including aging effects. It is shown
   that the reliability evaluation plays important roles on the dynamic
   response evaluation of the offshore wind energy platform subjected to
   uncertainty effects.},

   Aerosol Than Greenhouse Gases},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Because increased greenhouse gas emissions considerably warm and moisten
   the Earth's atmosphere, one may expect an increase in monsoon
   precipitation during the historical period. However, we find the
   observed Northern Hemisphere land summer monsoon (NHLM) precipitation
   has significantly decreased since 1901. Simulations from Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) well reproduce global warming
   and the drying of NHLM since the industrial revolution when forced by
   observed external forcings. Result from single forcing experiment shows
   that the anthropogenic aerosol (AA) dominates the Northern Hemisphere
   (NH) monsoon precipitation drying, while the greenhouse gases (GHG)
   largely control surface warming. Thus, the NH monsoon precipitation
   responds to AA more sensitively than the GHG. The AA can more
   effectively modulate downward solar radiation reaching the surface,
   decreasing evaporation and weakening monsoon circulations by reducing
   the interhemispheric temperature difference and land-ocean thermal
   contrast, albeit with the same efficiency of the thermodynamic effect in
   the two forcings. Our result indicates the future intensive reduction of
   aerosol emission may rapidly recover the NH monsoon precipitation.},

Title = {Long Term Sugarcane Crop Residue Retention Offers Limited Potential to
   Reduce Nitrogen Fertilizer Rates in Australian Wet Tropical Environments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {The warming of world climate systems is driving interest in the
   mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the agricultural
   sector, practices that mitigate GHG emissions include those that (1)
   reduce emissions {[}e.g., those that reduce nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emissions by avoiding excess nitrogen (N) fertilizer application], and
   (2) increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (e.g., by retaining
   instead of burning crop residues). Sugarcane is a globally important
   crop that can have substantial inputs of N fertilizer and which produces
   large amounts of crop residues ('trash'). Management of N fertilizer and
   trash affects soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and hence GHG emissions.
   Trash has historically been burned at harvest, but increasingly is being
   retained on the soil surface as a `trash blanket' in many countries. The
   potential for trash retention to alter N fertilizer requirements and
   sequester SOC was investigated in this study. The APSIM model was
   calibrated with data from field and laboratory studies of trash
   decomposition in the wet tropics of northern Australia. APSIM was then
   validated against four independent data sets, before simulating location
   x soil x fertilizer x trash management scenarios. Soil carbon increased
   in trash blanketed soils relative to SOC in soils with burnt trash.
   However, further increases in SOC for the study region may be limited
   because the SOC in trash blanketed soils could be approaching
   equilibrium; future GHG mitigation efforts in this region should
   therefore focus on N fertilizer management. Simulated N fertilizer rates
   were able to be reduced from conventional rates regardless of trash
   management, because of low yield potential in the wet tropics. For crops
   subjected to continuous trash blanketing, there was substantial
   immobilization of N in decomposing trash so conventional N fertilizer
   rates were required for up to 24 years after trash blanketing commenced.
   After this period, there was potential to reduce N fertilizer rates for
   crops when trash was retained (<= 20 kg N ha(-1)per plant or ratoon
   crop) while maintaining >= 95\% of maximum yields. While these savings
   in N fertilizer use were modest at the field scale, they were
   potentially important when aggregated at the regional level.},

Title = {Blue Carbon: an Additional Driver for Restoring and Preserving
   Ecological Services of Coastal Wetlands in Tampa Bay (Florida, USA)},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal habitats, including mangroves, salt marsh, and seagrass meadows,
   provide numerous ecosystem services, including improved water quality,
   shoreline stabilization, and essential fish habitat. Over the past few
   decades, the quantification of greenhouse gas fluxes in wetlands has
   improved, leading to the recognition of these habitats as long-term
   carbon sinks. Quantifying this ``blue carbon{''} as an ecosystem service
   provides added value for wetland protection and restoration and serves
   as a useful management tool when implementing plans for sustained
   ecosystem health and productivity. Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), a highly
   urbanized estuary, provides an interesting case study to assess the role
   of blue carbon in supporting management and informing restoration
   decisions. This review provides results from the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon
   Assessment, which quantified existing carbon stocks and identified the
   future carbon sequestration trajectories of coastal habitats with
   respect to climate change and sea-level rise. Examples are provided of
   how these data can be used to prioritize restoration efforts, support
   and enhance management decisions, and potentially attract new partners
   to support wetland restoration projects that offer additional climate
   change mitigation and adaptation benefits. This added valuation can help
   drive investment towards additional wetland restoration activities to
   help meet management targets in estuaries worldwide.},

Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Although studies of biogeochemical processes in polar sea ice have been
   increasing, similar research on relatively warm low-salinity sea ice
   remains sparse. In this study, we investigated biogeochemical properties
   of the landfast sea ice cover in the brackish Bothnian Bay (Northern
   Baltic Sea) and the possible role of this sea ice in mediating the
   exchange of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
   (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) across the water column-sea
   ice-atmosphere interface. Observations of total alkalinity and dissolved
   inorganic carbon in both landfast sea ice and the water column suggest
   that the carbonate system is mainly driven by salinity. While high CH4
   and N2O concentrations were observed in both the water column (up to
   14.3 and 17.5 nmol L-1, respectively) and the sea ice (up to 143.6 and
   22.4 nmol L-1, respectively), these gases appear to be enriched in sea
   ice compared to the water column. This enrichment may be attributable to
   the sea ice formation process, which concentrates impurities within
   brine. As sea ice temperature and brine volume decrease, gas solubility
   decreases as well, promoting the formation of bubbles. Gas bubbles
   originating from underlying sediments may also be incorporated within
   the ice cover and contribute to the enrichment in sea ice. The fate of
   these greenhouse gases within the ice merits further research, as
   storage in this low-salinity seasonal sea ice is temporary.},

   in climate, due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, are
   described. Results from a 75-year experiment with carbon dioxide
   increasing at 1\%/annum using a coupled model of the atmosphere, land
   and deep ocean, are presented and compared with those from equilibrium
   experiments. Rainfall over the UK increases over the year as a whole,
   with the largest changes in winter; however, in summer it decreases
   except in the north. Soil moisture decreases except in winter. Results
   from an equilibrium experiment show that rainfall tends to be more
   intense but less frequent with a doubled atomospheric concentration of
   CO2. A scenario of climate change over western Europe is included, based
   on these and other experiments.},

Abstract = {Environmental parameters controlling fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHG)
   differ spatially within landscapes. This study aimed to improve the
   understanding of landscape processes controlling GHG-fluxes of different
   landscape units of marshes (in terms of vegetation, land use and
   seawater inflow) at the Southern North Sea coast. For this emissions of
   methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were quantified and related to
   reported carbon sequestration rates. Ancillary environmental parameters
   were determined to identify controlling factors and thresholds enabling
   GHG emissions. For inland marshes (enclosed by embankments) the water
   level was the predominant factor controlling CH4 emissions ranging
   between 1.58 and 1544.70 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1). The duration of threshold
   (10 cm below surface) exceedance was found as a predictor for annual CH4
   emissions. Emissions of outland marshes (influenced by tides) varying
   from -1.34 to 55.14 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1) were predominantly controlled by
   sulphate (SO42-) concentrations, because soil CH4-contents were
   negligible when soil SO42--contents exceeded 0.5 mg g(-1). The
   variability of the N2O-fluxes (-0.81 to 17.78 kgN(2)O ha(-1) a(-1))
   could not be explained by the collected environmental parameters. GHG
   balances indicated that inland extensive grasslands and particularly
   reed stands are net sources of CO2-equivalents (100 year time horizon),
   while outlands are natural sinks.},

Title = {Can novel ingredients replace soybeans and reduce the environmental
   burdens of European livestock systems in the future?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {338-347},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Much of the protein in the diets of European livestock is sourced from
   imported soybeans produced in the Americas. This protein deficit in
   livestock production presents a risk to social, economic and
   environmental progress in Europe. In this study the impact of
   incorporating novel ingredients into future chicken diet formulations to
   serve as European sourced alternatives to imported soybeans was
   investigated. The novel ingredients considered were: microalgae,
   macroalgae, duckweed, yeast protein concentrate, bacterial protein meal,
   leaf protein concentrate and insects. Using horizon scanning and a
   modelling approach, the nutritional requirements of two potential
   meat-producing chicken lines were simulated. The two chicken lines were
   a fast-growing line based on the apparent maximum feed efficiency that
   could be achieved through further artificial selection, and a reduced
   growth rate for high welfare line. Diets were formulated to include the
   novel ingredients, whilst meeting the nutritional requirements of the
   birds. The effects of diet composition on indicators of environmental
   burdens, associated with feed production for the poultry industry, were
   then assessed. We found that soybean products can be completely replaced
   by novel feed ingredients, whilst reducing the greenhouse gas emissions
   and arable land requirements for feed provision relative to conventional
   diets formulated for both chicken lines. Switching from conventional
   diets to diets which incorporate novel ingredients was also shown to
   mitigate the increased environmental burdens associated with moving
   towards higher welfare livestock systems. Incorporation of novel
   ingredients in diet formulations offers a viable option for providing
   sustainable and nutritionally balanced livestock feed in the future and
   thus provides huge potential for facilitating bespoke feeding strategies
   and specific management choices for mitigating environmental impacts of
   chicken systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Systematic Review on the Existing Research, Practices, and Prospects
   Regarding Urban Green Infrastructure for Thermal Comfort in a
   High-Density Urban Context},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban green infrastructures (UGI) have been suggested as a natural
   solution to tackle the problem of human thermal comfort as well as to
   reduce energy consumption in buildings under the pressures of rapid
   urbanization and global warming. However, the acceptance of UGI to
   mitigate the urban heat effect is not yet universal. The development of
   such an infrastructure is also not consistent across the regions,
   emphasizing the different objective parameters and methodologies. A
   systematic review has been conducted to analyze the published research
   work on UGI, targeting thermal comfort, in the past decade to identify
   the trends of UGI development around the world. The result shows that
   most of the studied locations were situated around the Mediterranean Sea
   region in a temperate climate, and most of the studied cities are within
   countries with a high gross domestic product, large urban area and urban
   population, primary energy consumption, and high greenhouse gas and
   carbon dioxide emissions. Extensive green roofs are the most popular
   type of UGI and mostly use Sedum plants. In the published studies,
   experimental setups are the most common methods by which to collect
   data. EnergyPlus is the most popular software used to conduct energy
   analysis for buildings, whereas ENVI-met is more commonly used for
   microclimate analysis. These results indicated that the direction of UGI
   studies is driven by climate characteristics and the socioeconomic
   factors of geographical location, which favor low construction cost and
   maintenance needs, with a minimal irrigation requirement for small-scale
   UGI projects. Understanding the trend of UGI approaches for thermal
   comfort allows researchers to standardize practices that help the
   decision-making process for future researchers while recognizing the
   limitations and potential of current UGI practices. It is recommended
   that future studies should include arid and equatorial climate regions,
   with more focus on large-scale projects including high-rise building
   environments to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of UGIs.},

Title = {Quantification and analysis of CO2 footprint from industrial facilities
   in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT-X},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is among the countries that committed
   to taking measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with
   the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. KSA has rolled out the 2030 Vision
   aiming at creating a more diverse and sustainable economy that cascaded
   into a series of initiatives, including the circular carbon economy,
   Saudi green initiative, and the national renewable energy program.
   Furthermore, KSA has recently announced an ambitious goal to reach
   net-zero goal by 2060. In its updated nationally determined contribution
   (NDC), the Kingdom committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 278
   million tons of CO2eq (equivalent) annually by 2030. This ambition is
   more than a twofold increase versus the previously announced target (130
   million tons of CO2eq). With no current plans to change its hydrocarbon
   production rates, this reduction in emissions would be achieved mainly
   through diversifying its energy mix, increasing the efficiency of
   industrial processes, and deploying carbon capture utilization and
   storage (CCUS). To achieve this goal, it is vital to establish a
   detailed register for CO2 emissions from stationary industrial sources
   to design optimum and effective CCUS applications. This register
   includes details about the emission source locations, rates, and
   char-acteristics. For the first time, this paper provides a country-wide
   extensive study that maps out CO2 emissions from stationary industrial
   emitters associated with the leading six industries in the country,
   which are electricity generation, desalination, oil refining, cement,
   petrochemicals, and iron \& steel. Moreover, CO2 concentrations within
   the emitted flue gas from these resources are estimated, which is
   crucial to determine the capture cost. This study aims to provide a
   vital resource for researchers and policymakers who seek to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions by promoting renewable energy, improving the
   efficiency of existing fossil-fuel-based industries, and evaluating the
   potential of CCUS in KSA.},

Title = {Stochastic energy management in a renewable energy-based microgrid
   considering demand response program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate changes increase concerns about global warming caused by
   greenhouse gases and have also increased the focus and implementation of
   renewable energy sources (RESs) planning. One of the important RESs is
   tidal energy or tidal power, which is a form of hydropower that converts
   the energy obtained from tides into the electrical power. Although tidal
   power is still not widely used, this energy resource has the potential
   for the future electricity generation. This paper addresses the
   stochastic energy management in a microgrid considering RESs such as
   solar, wind and tidal sources in the presence of the demand response
   program and storage devices. The uncertainty of the RESs, demand, and
   electricity price is handled by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The model
   is a linear multi-objective optimization which the first objective aims
   to reduce the cost and the second aims to reduce the emission. Augmented
   ?-constraint approach is applied to solve the problem in the CPLEX/ GAMS
   software environment. The interactive fuzzy decision-making is applied
   to choose the best answer among the Pareto answers according to the
   planner criteria.},

Abstract = {Geoengineering has been proposed as a feasible way of mitigating
   anthropogenic climate change, especially increasing global temperatures
   in the 21st century. The two main geoengineering options are limiting
   incoming solar radiation, or modifying the carbon cycle. Here we examine
   the impact of five geoengineering approaches on sea level; SO2 aerosol
   injection into the stratosphere, mirrors in space, afforestation,
   biochar, and bioenergy with carbon sequestration. Sea level responds
   mainly at centennial time scales to temperature change, and has been
   largely driven by anthropogenic forcing since 1850. Making use a model
   of sea-level rise as a function of time-varying climate forcing factors
   (solar radiation, volcanism, and greenhouse gas emissions) we find that
   sea-level rise by 2100 will likely be 30 cm higher than 2000 levels
   despite all but the most aggressive geoengineering under all except the
   most stringent greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The least risky and
   most desirable way of limiting sea-level rise is bioenergy with carbon
   sequestration. However aerosol injection or a space mirror system
   reducing insolation at an accelerating rate of 1 Wm(-2) per decade from
   now to 2100 could limit or reduce sea levels. Aerosol injection
   delivering a constant 4 Wm(-2) reduction in radiative forcing (similar
   to a 1991 Pinatubo eruption every 18 months) could delay sea-level rise
   by 40-80 years. Aerosol injection appears to fail cost-benefit analysis
   unless it can be maintained continuously, and damage caused by the
   climate response to the aerosols is less than about 0.6\% Global World

Abstract = {Adaptation is necessary if we are to minimize risks associated with
   climate change impacts. Vulnerability and resilience are two important
   concepts in the literature on hazards and climate change but have been
   used in a variety of ways to investigate human interaction with a
   hazardous environment. The result is widespread adoption of the terms
   but confusion about their relationship and how best they can advance
   work on climate change adaptation. This paper critically reviews the
   different understandings of the concepts and how they relate, and then
   proposes a framework that integrates vulnerability and resilience in
   order to advance adaptation thinking, planning and implementation. The
   paper concludes with a description of how the framework will apply
   findings on unequal social vulnerability to inform adaptation options
   that increase resilience in coastal cities.},

Abstract = {Japan has the sixth-largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world,
   covering approximately 4.47 million square kilometers. Methane hydrate
   is known to exist under the seafloor, with approximately 100 times the
   amount of Japan's annual natural gas consumption. To minimize the cost
   from extraction to the processing of such seabed resources, the
   installation of facilities that can generate electricity directly above
   the sea area where the resources are located is considered the most
   efficient strategy for the extraction and conversion to energy.
   Furthermore, methane gas can be converted to hydrogen gas through a
   steam reforming process, thereby minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. By
   arranging various factories around the facility as floating structures,
   it will be possible to reduce the costs from product processing to the
   manufacturing of finished products. Further, floating factories can
   minimize tsunami damage when compared with factories on reclaimed land
   in the coastal areas. To effectively utilize energy resources and reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions, we propose a floating structure that can
   consolidate the respective movements of people, products, and logistics
   from the seafloor to the sea and its surroundings.},

Title = {Methane and Nitrous Oxide Emission Fluxes Along Water Level Gradients in

   Extracted Peatland in Sweden},
Journal = {SOIL SYSTEMS},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rewetted extracted peatlands are sensitive ecosystems and they can act
   as greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks or sources due to changes in hydrology,
   vegetation, and weather conditions. However, studies on GHG emissions
   from extracted peatlands after rewetting are limited. Methane (CH4) and
   nitrous oxide (N2O) emission fluxes were determined using the opaque
   closed chamber method along water level gradients from littoral zones to
   the open water body of constructed shallow lakes with different
   vegetation zones in a nutrient-rich rewetted extracted peatland in
   Sweden. Vegetation communities and their position relative to water
   level, together with short-term water level fluctuations, such as
   inundation events and seasonal droughts, and temperature had a
   significant impact on CH4 emissions fluxes. During ``normal{''} and
   ``dry{''} conditions and high soil temperatures, CH4 emissions were
   highest from Carex spp.-Typha latifolia L. communities. During
   inundation events with water levels > 30 cm, sites with flooded
   Graminoids-Scirpus spp.-Carex spp. emitted most CH4. Methane emissions
   from the water body of the constructed shallow lakes were low during all
   water level conditions and over the temperature ranges observed. Nitrous
   oxide emissions contributed little to the emission fluxes from the
   soil-plant-water systems to the atmosphere, and they were only
   detectable from the sites with Graminoids. In terms of management, the
   construction of shallow lakes showed great potential for lowering GHG
   emission fluxes from nutrient rich peatlands after peat extraction, even
   though the vegetated shore emitted some N2O and CH4.},

Title = {Marshes with and without sills protect estuarine shorelines from erosion
   better than bulkheads during a Category 1 hurricane},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {102},
Number = {A},
Pages = {94-102},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Acting on the perception that they perform better for longer, most
   property owners in the United States choose hard engineered structures,
   such as bulkheads or riprap revetments, to protect estuarine shorelines
   from erosion. Less intrusive alternatives, specifically marsh plantings
   with and without sills, have the potential to better sustain marsh
   habitat and support its ecosystem services, yet their shoreline
   protection capabilities during storms have not been evaluated. In this
   study, the performances of alternative shoreline protection approaches
   during Hurricane Irene (Category 1 storm) were compared by 1)
   classifying resultant damage to shorelines with different types of
   shoreline protection in three NC coastal regions after Irene; and 2)
   quantifying shoreline erosion at marshes with and without sills in one
   NC region by using repeated measurements of marsh surface elevation and
   marsh vegetation stem density before and after Irene. In the central
   Outer Banks, NC, where the strongest sustained winds blew across the
   longest fetch; Irene damaged 76\% of bulkheads surveyed, while no damage
   to other shoreline protection options was detected. Across marsh sites
   within 25 km of its landfall, Hurricane Irene had no effect on marsh
   surface elevations behind sills or along marsh shorelines without sills.
   Although Irene temporarily reduced marsh vegetation density at sites
   with and without sills, vegetation recovered to pre-hurricane levels
   within a year. Storm responses suggest that marshes with and without
   sills are more durable and may protect shorelines from erosion better
   than the bulkheads in a Category 1 storm. This study is the first to
   provide data on the shoreline protection capabilities of marshes with
   and without sills relative to bulkheads during a substantial storm
   event, and to articulate a research framework to assist in the
   development of comprehensive policies for climate change adaptation and
   sustainable management of estuarine shorelines and resources in U.S. and
   globally. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-25},

Abstract = {Solar radiation management (SRM) is a climate engineering strategy to
   reduce temperature increases due to global climate change. The most
   well-researched SRM methodology is stratospheric aerosol injection
   (SAI), which involves increasing the concentration of aerosol particles
   in the stratosphere to reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching
   Earth's surface. The most considered and heavily researched aerosol for
   SAI is sulfate. SAI has been extensively modeled using various climate
   scenarios and investigated using data from previous volcanic eruptions,
   which provide an analog of the climate effects of SAI. Prior research
   has determined that SAI will not only decrease global temperatures but
   is likely to have direct impacts on ecosystem and public health. This
   review seeks to investigate the various ways by which SAI may impact
   global public health outcomes related to hydrologic cycling, atmospheric
   chemical cycling, frequency of natural disasters, food system
   disruptions, and ecological health through the pathways of water, air,
   soil, and biota. SAI has the potential to decrease negative health
   outcomes associated with rising temperatures but may have a myriad of
   impacts on global environmental systems. Anthropogenically altering the
   global climate, through both the release of greenhouse gases or through
   climatic engineering, has unknown consequences, many of which will
   likely impact global health and quality of life. A more holistic
   approach is necessary to understand the relative benefits and harms in
   using SAI as compared to the implication of global climate change.},

Title = {Using Historical Responses to Shoreline Change on Australia's Gold Coast
   to Estimate Costs of Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level Rise},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts, sea level rise, and changes to the frequency and
   intensity of storms, in particular, are projected to increase the
   coastal land and assets exposed to coastal erosion. The selection of
   appropriate adaptation strategies requires an understanding of the costs
   and how such costs will vary by the magnitude and timing of climate
   change impacts. By drawing comparisons between past events and climate
   change projections, it is possible to use experience of the way
   societies have responded to changes to coastal erosion to inform the
   costs and selection of adaptation strategies at the coastal settlement
   scale. The experience of implementing a coastal protection strategy for
   the Gold Coast's southern beaches between 1964 and 1999 is compiled into
   a database of the timing, units, and cost of coastal protection works.
   Records of the change to shoreline position and characteristics of local
   beaches are analysed through the Bruun model to determine the implied
   sea level rise at the time each of the projects was completed. Finally,
   an economic model updates the project costs for the point in the future
   based on the projected timing of sea level rise and calculates a net
   present value (NPV) for implementing a protection strategy, per km, of
   sandy beach shoreline against each of the four representative
   concentration pathways (RCP) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) to 2100. A key finding of our study is the significant
   step-up in expected costs of implementing coastal protection between RCP
   2.6 and RCP 8.5-from \$573,792/km to \$1.7 million/km, or a factor of
   nearly 3, using a social discount rate of 3\%. This step-up is by a
   factor of more than 6 at a social discount rate of 1\%. This step-up in
   projected costs should be of particular interest to agencies responsible
   for funding and building coastal defences.},

   Hazards and Sea Level Rise: A Case Study from Imperial Beach, California},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sea level rise increases community risks from erosion, wave flooding,
   and tides. Current management typically protects existing development
   and infrastructure with coastal armoring. These practices ignore
   long-term impacts to public trust coastal recreation and natural
   ecosystems. This adaptation framework models physical responses to the
   public beach and private upland for each adaptation strategy over time,
   linking physical changes in widths to damages, economic costs, and
   benefits from beach recreation and nature using low-lying Imperial
   Beach, California, as a case study. Available coastal hazard models
   identified community vulnerabilities, and local risk communication
   engagement prioritized five adaptation approaches-armoring, nourishment,
   living shorelines, groins, and managed retreat. This framework innovates
   using replacement cost as a proxy for ecosystem services normally not
   valued and examines a managed retreat policy approach using a public
   buyout and rent-back option. Specific methods and economic values used
   in the analysis need more research and innovation, but the framework
   provides a scalable methodology to guide coastal adaptation planning
   everywhere. Case study results suggest that coastal armoring provides
   the least public benefits over time. Living shoreline approaches show
   greater public benefits, while managed retreat, implemented sooner,
   provides the best long-term adaptation strategy to protect community
   identity and public trust resources.},

Journal = {SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {787-806},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Although many studies have examined the effects of structural factors
   and institutional interests on risk estimation practices, little is
   known about the political dynamics surrounding divergent responses to
   risk reduction measures. This article examines the political economy of
   risk reduction, using a case study of Louisiana's coastal restoration
   planning and decision-making process. Specifically, the article draws on
   documentary evidence, long-term ethnographic field observations, and
   semistructured interviews to investigate the proliferation of risk
   conflicts and disputes surrounding the 2012 Louisiana Comprehensive
   Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast, the latest long-term risk-reduction
   plan to slow coastal erosion and achieve a sustainable coast. As I point
   out, coastal restoration in Louisiana is contested terrain where a
   variety of contentious groups struggle to influence and control debates
   over climate change risk and coastal erosion risk reduction. By
   examining the proliferation of contested risk definitions and risk
   reduction strategies in Louisiana, I aim to provide new insight into the
   organizational and institutional forces that shape positions on risk,
   the political-economic forces that create and allocate risk, and the
   social construction of community identity and culture through risk
   debates.},

Title = {Porewater-Derived Blue Carbon Outwelling and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in
   a Subtropical Multi-Species Saltmarsh},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Saltmarshes can sequester atmospheric CO2 in sediments, but limited
   studies have quantified porewater-derived carbon exports and identified
   related carbon sources. Here, we estimated porewater exchange, carbon
   outwelling, and greenhouse gas emissions in a subtropical multi-species
   saltmarsh. The radon-based porewater exchange rate was estimated to be
   5.60 +/- 2.78 cm d(-1). As the most dominant (\~{}90\%) carbon species,
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes through porewater exchange and
   outwelling were 447 +/- 227 and 1200 +/- 61 mmol m(-2) d(-1),
   respectively, which were 1.2 and 3.2 times that of carbon burial. As
   most DIC can remain in the ocean for a long time, porewater-derived DIC
   outwelling represents another important carbon sink, in addition to
   carbon burial. CO2 and CH4 emissions from creek water were 54.6 +/- 0.5
   and 0.19 +/- 0.01 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively, which could offset
   16\% of carbon burial. The delta C-13 and C/N ratios suggest that
   saltmarsh organic carbon mainly originates from the C3 plant Scirpus
   mariqueter rather than the C4 plant Spartina alterniflora. Overall, we
   suggest that porewater-derived DIC outwelling is an important long-term
   carbon sink in multi-species saltmarshes, providing a scientific basis
   for the protection and restoration of saltmarshes in the context of
   global climate change.},

Title = {An Injury to the Inheritance: Locating an Affirmative Obligation to
   Climate Adaptation in the Law of Waste},
Journal = {COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF LAW AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {As global temperatures continue to rise, most climate policy
   conversations have focused on mitigation measures, aimed at reducing the
   proliferation of greenhouse gases and curbing the rise in temperatures.
   Discussions, especially in legal literature, about climate adaptation
   measures-those intended to, for example, prepare for rising sea levels
   or increasing incidence of extreme weather events-have generally focused
   on the powers and responsibilities of government actors. Private
   citizens too, however, may also have a duty to prepare for climate
   change.
   The law of waste is a longstanding doctrine under which holders of a
   current possessory interest in real property, such as tenants or
   mortgagors, bear certain responsibilities towards holders of concurrent
   or future interests, such as lessors or mortgagees. This Note argues
   that a subset of the law of waste, called permissive waste, may be read
   to impose a duty to affirmatively pursue climate adaptation measures on
   tenants and other similarly-situated individuals. Part II provides
   background information on current efforts to find a legal basis for a
   duty to pursue climate adaptation. Part III examines the history of the
   law of waste, with particular attention to the concept of permissive
   waste. Parts IV and V outline how the law of waste could be applied to
   the problem of climate adaptation, exploring the necessary conditions
   for such a claim to be made as well as the uses and limitations of using
   the law of waste in this fashion.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas production and consumption in High Arctic deserts},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {158-165},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Polar deserts dominate the High Arctic covering over 1 358 000 km(2) but
   little is known about greenhouse gas (GHG) production or flux in polar
   desert soils. We measured soil-atmosphere GHG exchange for CO2, CH4, and
   N2O, and net production of these gases in the active layer at 30 sites
   across three polar deserts in the High Arctic on Ellesmere Island,
   Canada for a total of 180 production/consumption estimates. There was
   inter-annual consistency in patterns of GHG net production and a
   consistent, significant, positive relationship (r(2) = 0.91-0.93; p <
   0.05) between CO2 production and N2O production in Arctic desert sites.
   This differs from the negative correlations found in wet or moist tundra
   ecosystems and may arise from the large N2O emissions in dolomitic
   desert ecosystems. Global change processes that increase microbial
   activity in deserts will likely increase N2O emissions but increases in
   activity in wetter tundra will decrease N2O emissions. However, given
   the unusual co-consumption of CH4 and N2O in the deserts, it is not
   clear if models of GHG production developed for other ecosystems will
   apply to these unique Arctic environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This paper proposes a management strategy for the daily operation of an
   isolated hybrid energy system (HES) using heuristic techniques.
   Incorporation of heuristic techniques to the optimal scheduling in
   day-head basis allows us to consider the complex characteristics of a
   specific battery energy storage system (BESS) and the associated
   electronic converter efficiency. The proposed approach can determine the
   discharging time to perform the load peak-shaving in an appropriate
   manner. A recently proposed version of binary particle swarm
   optimization (BPSO), which incorporates a time-varying mirrored S-shaped
   (TVMS) transfer function, is proposed for day-ahead scheduling
   determination. Day-ahead operation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   are studied through different operating conditions. The complexity of
   the optimization problem depends on the available wind resource and its
   relationship with load profile. In this regard, TVMS-BPSO has important
   capabilities for global exploration and local exploitation, which makes
   it a powerful technique able to provide a high-quality solution
   comparable to that obtained from a genetic algorithm.},

Title = {A national approach to greenhouse gas abatement through blue carbon
   management},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is increasing interest in protecting, restoring and creating `blue
   carbon' ecosystems (BCE; mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) to
   sequester atmospheric CO2-C and thereby contribute to climate change
   mitigation. While a growing number of countries aspire to report
   greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration changes from these
   ecosystems under voluntary international reporting requirements, few
   countries have domestic policy frameworks that specifically support the
   quantification and financing of carbon emission abatement through BCE
   management. Australia, as home to approximately 5-11\% of global blue
   carbon stocks, has a substantial interest in the development of blue
   carbon policy. Here we assess the potential inclusion of blue carbon
   within
   Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund, emphasizing issues and approaches
   that have global relevance. We used a participatory workshop of
   scientific experts and carbon industry stakeholders to identify blue
   carbon management actions that would meet the requirements of the Fund.
   In total, twelve actions were assessed for their greenhouse gas emission
   abatement potential and the ability to measure abatement reliably, using
   a combination of available data and qualitative and quantitative
   methods, including expert knowledge.
   We identify and discuss the five most relevant and promising activities,
   encompassing the protection, restoration and creation of mangroves,
   tidal marshes and seagrasses. On a per area basis, mean abatement
   intensity of organic carbon (C-org) was highest for the (re)introduction
   of tidal flow resulting in establishment of mangrove (13-15 Mg C-org
   ha(-1) yr(-1)) and tidal marsh (6-8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by
   land use planning for sea-level rise for the creation of new mangrove
   habitat (8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)). The avoided disturbance of existing
   mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses has the twofold benefit of
   avoiding remineralisation of existing stocks, plus the future annual
   abatement associated with the net sequestration of atmospheric CO2-C as
   C-org with the continued functioning of these BCE. Our approach offers a
   template that uses best available information to identify options for
   carbon abatement through management of coastal landscapes, and details
   current knowledge gaps and important technical aspects that need to be
   considered for implementation in carbon crediting schemes.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas measurements over a 144 km open path in the Canary

Abstract = {A new technique for the satellite remote sensing of greenhouse gases in
   the atmosphere via the absorption of short-wave infrared laser signals
   transmitted between counter-rotating satellites in low Earth orbit has
   recently been proposed; this would enable the acquisition of a
   long-term, stable, global set of altitude-resolved concentration
   measurements. We present the first ground-based experimental
   demonstration of this new infrared-laser occultation method, in which
   the atmospheric absorption of CO2 near 2.1 mu m was measured over a
   similar to 144 km path length between two peaks in the Canary Islands
   (at an altitude of similar to 2.4 km), using relatively low power diode
   lasers (similar to 4 to 10 mW). The retrieved CO2 volume mixing ratio of
   400 ppm (+/- 15 ppm) is consistent within experimental uncertainty with
   simultaneously recorded in situ validation measurements. We conclude
   that the new method has a sound basis for monitoring CO2 in the free
   atmosphere; other greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and
   water vapour can be monitored in the same way.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise and uncertainty in its projections pose a major challenge
   to flood risk management and adaptation investments in coastal mega
   cities. This study presents a comparative economic evaluation method for
   flood adaptation measures, which couples a cost-benefit analysis with
   the concept of adaptation pathways. Our approach accounts for
   uncertainty in sea level rise projections by allowing for flexibility of
   adaptation strategies over time. Our method is illustrated for Los
   Angeles County which is vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise.
   Results for different sea level rise scenarios show that applying
   adaptation pathways can result in higher economic efficiency (up to
   10\%) than individual adaptation strategies, despite the loss of
   efficiency at the initial strategy. However, we identified `investment
   tipping points', after which a transition could decrease the economic
   efficiencies of a pathway significantly. Overall, we recommend that
   studies evaluating adaptation strategies should integrate cost-benefit
   analysis frameworks with adaptation pathways since this allows for
   better informing decision makers about the robustness and economic
   desirability of their investment choices. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Title = {Contributing to regional decarbonization: Australia's potential to
   supply zero-carbon commodities to the Asia-Pacific},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {248},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The Asia-Pacific has experienced prodigious growth in energy use and is
   by far the world's largest greenhouse-gas emitting region. Australia has
   played a leading role in meeting the region's energy and resource needs,
   becoming the world's largest exporter of coal, liquefied natural gas,
   iron ore, and alumina. Our analysis shows that these exports are tied to
   sizeable consequential emissions at the point of use or processing,
   accounting for about 8.6\% of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the
   Asia-Pacific. The paper investigates three pathways by which Australia
   could instead export zero-carbon energy and products: direct exports of
   renewable electricity via sub-sea cables, exports of zero-carbon fuels
   such as green hydrogen, and the export of ``green{''} metals processed
   from Australian ores using renewable en-ergy. Carrying out robust,
   high-level calculations we find that Australia has the land and
   renewable energy resources to become a key exporter of these
   commodities. Realization of this potential relies on ongoing cost
   reductions, growing demand-side interest linked to meeting ambitious
   emission reduction targets in the region, and the development of
   cross-border frameworks for clean energy trade. If it were to achieve
   this goal, Australia could make a sizeable contribution to regional
   decarbonization via renewable-energy based exports.(c) 2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {Reliable and sustainable energy supply is fundamental to the economic
   and social fabric of nations, and to the well-being and quality of life
   for their citizens. Major power generation in India is carried out by
   conventional energy sources, coal and mineral oil-based power plants
   which contribute heavily to greenhouse gases emission. India has a vast
   supply of renewable energy resources, and it has one of the largest
   programs in the world for deploying renewable energy products and
   systems. Renewable energy is a clean and sustainable source of energy
   derived from nature and it has potential to provide solutions to the
   venerable energy problems being faced by the developing countries like
   India. To overcome energy shortage in India the renewable energy sources
   like wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, biomass
   energy and fuel cell technology can be used. Indeed, it is the only
   country in the world to have an exclusive ministry for renewable energy
   development, the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources (MNES).This
   paper reviews the renewable energy scenario of India. It begins by
   describing the importance of renewable energy and its advantages over
   fossil fuels. It gives an overview of the renewable energies in India
   while evaluating the current status and the deployment of each of these
   technologies to date in India.},

Title = {A dual-functional wave-power plant for wave-energy extraction and shore
   protection: A wave-flume study},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {The fundamental roadblock toward commercial-scale wave power operations
   is cost. The main objective of this work was to address the cost
   challenge facing wave energy commercialization through cost-sharing with
   pile breakwaters to be built for shore protection. This was achieved in
   this study through a dual-functional wave power plant for generation of
   wave-power electricity and protection against coastal erosion for
   sustainable coastal development. The dual-functional wave-power plant
   was formed by integrating oscillating-water-column (OWC) devices into a
   pile breakwater, with each pile being an OWC-pile equipped with a power
   take-off device. The power extraction efficiency and hydrodynamic
   characteristics of the dual-functional wave-power plant were measured in
   a wave flume under various wave conditions. An orifice was used at the
   top of the pneumatic chamber of each OWC-pile to simulate the power
   take-off device. To evaluate the performance of the power plant in wave
   power extraction and shore protection, the surface elevation and
   pressure inside the OWC chamber, as well as the scattered waves, were
   measured. It was found that comparing to a standalone OWC-pile device
   with an identical design and geometric characteristics, an OWC-pile in
   the dual -functional wave-power plant could achieve significantly larger
   power-extraction efficiency. Comparing to a pile breakwater with the
   same dimensions, the wave transmission and reflection of the
   dual-functional wave-power plant were both weaker, especially the wave
   reflection, which is beneficial for structure safety and shore
   protection. Based on the Froude's law of similarity and an estimation of
   the effect of air compressibility at full scale, an evaluation of the
   performance of a dual -functional wave-power plant at full scale was
   also provided. The findings of this work promote close collaboration
   between wave-energy utilization community and the shore-protection
   community for commercial-scale deployment of wave energy converters and
   contribute to making wave energy economically competitive.},

Title = {Carbon Footprint and Driving Forces of Saline Agriculture in Coastally
   Reclaimed Areas of Eastern China: A Survey of Four Staple Crops},

Abstract = {Carbon emissions have always been a key issue in agricultural
   production. Due to the specific natural factors in the soil of saline
   agriculture, there are distinctive characteristics in saline
   agricultural production as compared with traditional agricultural zones.
   Here, we have adopted the theory of life cycle assessment and employed
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gas
   (GHG) field calculation to estimate the GHG emissions, derived from the
   staple crop productions (i.e., barley, wheat, corn and rice). In
   addition, our study further analyzed the main driving forces of carbon
   emissions and proposed some effective measures to reduce them. Our
   results have showed that: (1) carbon footprint from the four crops in
   the study area varies from 0.63 to 0.77 kg CO2 eq.kg(-1), which is
   higher than that from traditional agriculture; (2) GHG emissions from
   Fertilizer-Nitrogen (N) manufacture and inorganic N application have
   contributed to the greatest percentage of carbon footprint. Compared
   with traditional agricultural zones, fertilizer-N application and paddy
   irrigation involved with crop productions have overall greater
   contributions to carbon footprint; (3) carbon emissions from saline
   agriculture can be reduced significantly by planting-breeding
   combination to reduce the amount of N fertilizer application, improving
   the traditional rotation system, and developing water-saving agriculture
   and ecological agriculture.},

Title = {Opportunities for coastal wetland restoration for blue carbon with
   co-benefits for biodiversity, coastal fisheries, and water quality},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are known to sequester significant amounts of carbon
   dioxide, while also providing valuable ecosystem services. We assessed
   the economic feasibility of restoring coastal wetlands for climate
   change mitigation by reinstating tidal flows on floodplain, agricultural
   land of the Wet Tropics catchments in Queensland, Australia. We assessed
   whether potential carbon credits would be sufficient to incentivise
   conversion of the land, or whether additional ecosystem service payments
   would be required. We explored the co-benefits for biodiversity,
   fisheries, and nitrogen removal using a prioritisation approach to
   identify profitable restoration solutions that maximise these benefits.
   We identified 5,046 ha of potential restorable area that could abate
   221,006 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-e) annually from carbon
   sequestration in vegetation and soils and avoided greenhouse gas
   emissions. Cost-benefit analysis over 25 years demonstrate that 3,399 ha
   (67\%) would be profitable under conventional farm management practice
   using the current Australian carbon price (\$13.85 per tonne CO2-e),
   which increased to 4,534 ha (90\%) at a higher carbon price (\$25 per
   tonne CO2-e). The profitability of coastal wetland restoration was
   enhanced by a higher carbon price, which can be achieved by bundling
   ecosystem services, or through stacking ecosystem service payments.
   Prioritising restoration sites by costeffectiveness and co-benefits can
   achieve multiple ecosystem services for a substantial profit.},

Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2118-2133},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Projections of climate change impacts on living resources are being
   conducted frequently, and the goal is often to inform policy. Species
   projections will be more useful if uncertainty is effectively
   quantified. However, few studies have comprehensively characterized the
   projection uncertainty arising from greenhouse gas scenarios, Earth
   system models (ESMs), and both structural and parameter uncertainty in
   species distribution modelling. Here, we conducted 8964 unique 21st
   century projections for shifts in suitable habitat for seven
   economically important marine species including American lobster,
   Pacific halibut, Pacific ocean perch, and summer flounder. For all
   species, both the ESM used to simulate future temperatures and the niche
   modelling approach used to represent species distributions were
   important sources of uncertainty, while variation associated with
   parameter values in niche models was minor. Greenhouse gas emissions
   scenario contributed to uncertainty for projections at the century
   scale. The characteristics of projection uncertainty differed among
   species and also varied spatially, which underscores the need for
   improved multi-model approaches with a suite of ESMs and niche models
   forming the basis for uncertainty around projected impacts. Ensemble
   projections show the potential for major shifts in future distributions.
   Therefore, rigorous future projections are important for informing
   climate adaptation efforts.},

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation Strategies at a Local Scale: The Portuguese
   Case Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal areas are home to more than 2 billion people around the globe
   and, as such, are especially vulnerable to climate change consequences.
   Climate change adaptation has proven to be more effective on a local
   scale, contributing to a bottom-up approach to the problems related to
   the changing climate. Portugal has approximately 2000 km of coastline,
   with 75\% of the population living along the coast. Therefore, this
   research had the main objective of understanding adaptation processes at
   a local scale, using Portuguese coastal municipalities as a case study.
   To achieve this goal, document analysis and a questionnaire to coastal
   municipalities were applied, and the existence of measures rooted in
   nature-based solutions, green infrastructures, and community-based
   adaptation was adopted as a variable. The main conclusion from this
   research is that 87\% of the municipalities that answered the
   questionnaire have climate change adaptation strategies implemented or
   in development. Moreover, it was possible to conclude that 90\% of the
   municipalities are familiar with the concept of nature-based solutions
   and all the municipalities with adaptation strategies include green
   infrastructure. However, it was also possible to infer that
   community-based adaptation is a concept that most municipalities do not
   know about or undervalue.},

Title = {Mix design and benefit evaluation of high solar reflectance concrete for
   pavements},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2007},
Number = {2011},
Pages = {11-20},
Abstract = {The use of cool paving materials, or cool pavements, has been identified
   as one strategy that can help mitigate the urban ``heat island{''}
   effect. One method of creating a cool pavement is to increase the solar
   reflectance, or albedo, of its surface. This increase can be achieved by
   many existing paving technologies. This study explores alternative ways
   of creating high-albedo concrete for use in pavement applications. The
   key approach is to make concrete whiter by replacing cement with whiter
   constituents. Fly ash and slag are used as the main constituents because
   they are environmentally friendly, readily available, and already
   familiar to the concrete industry. Compared with a conventional concrete
   mix, concrete mixes containing fly ash have lower albedo, whereas
   concrete mixes containing slag have higher albedo. Of all mixes tested,
   the mix with 70\% slag as cement replacement achieves the highest albedo
   of 0.582, which is 71\% higher than the conventional mix. It also has
   better compressive strength as tested at 7 and 28 days and modulus of
   rupture as tested at 7 days. The production of high solar reflectance
   concrete consumes 43.5\% less energy and results in less emission of
   pollutants and greenhouse gases (by 20\% to 60\%). Furthermore, the
   analysis of some urban cities shows that the implementation of this high
   solar reflectance concrete could increase the city albedo by 0.02 to
   0.07. This amount of albedo modification has the potential to benefit
   economics and the environment in many ways, ranging from decreasing
   energy demand to improving air quality.},

Title = {Integrating climate change adaptation in coastal governance of the
   Barcelona metropolitan area},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal cities are exposed to high risks due to climate change, as they
   are potentially affected by both rising sea levels and increasingly
   intense and frequent coastal storms. Socio-economic drivers also
   increase exposure to natural hazards, accelerate environmental
   degradation, and require adaptive governance structures to moderate
   negative impacts. Here, we use a social network analysis (SNA) combined
   with further qualitative information to identify barriers and enablers
   of adaptive governance in the Barcelona metropolitan area. By analyzing
   how climate change adaptation is mainstreamed between different
   administrative scales as well as different societal actors, we can
   determine the governance structures and external conditions that hamper
   or foster strategical adaptation plans from being used as operational
   adaptation tools. We identify a diverse set of stakeholders acting at
   different administrative levels (local to national), in public
   administration, science, civil society, and the tourism economy. The
   metropolitan administration acts as an important bridging organization
   by promoting climate change adaptation to different interest groups and
   by passing knowledge between actors. Nonetheless, national adaptation
   planning fails to take into account local experiences in coastal
   protection, which leads to an ineffective science policy interaction and
   limits adaptive management and learning opportunities. Overcoming this
   is difficult, however, as the effectiveness of local adaptation
   strategies in the Barcelona metropolitan area is very limited due to a
   strong centralization of power at the national level and a lack of
   polycentricity. Due to the high touristic pressure, the legal framework
   is currently oriented to primarily meet the demands of recreational use
   and tourism, prioritizing these aspects in daily management practice.
   Therefore, touristic and economic activities need to be aligned to
   adaptation efforts, to convert them from barriers into drivers for
   adaptation action. Our work strongly suggests that more effectively
   embedding adaptation planning and action into existing legal structures
   of coastal management would allow strategic adaptation plans to be an
   effective operational tool for local coastal governance.},

Abstract = {The global atmosphere is a chemically complex and dynamic system,
   interacting both internally, mostly within the troposphere and
   stratosphere, and with the oceans, land, and living organisms. Its
   composition is changing today, and has also changed markedly over the
   last 160 000 yr. Environmentally-significant chemical processes
   occurring in the atmosphere include those affecting the ozone layer and
   the levels of radiatively active gases and particles. Methane, a very
   important greenhouse gas, has major natural and anthropogenic sources;
   it is destroyed largely by reaction with the hydroxyl radical in the
   troposphere. Both its sources and sink are strongly influenced by human
   activity. Nitrous oxide, with a similar range of sources, and
   chlorofluorocarbons, purely anthropogenic, are also greenhouse gases;
   however, their potency is offset partially by the ozone they destroy.
   Ozone, a key chemical and protective ultraviolet shield, has a complex
   chemistry influenced by many other trace species and is also an
   important greenhouse gas. Many other trace gases play a key role through
   their influence on the concentrations of ozone, the hydroxyl radical,
   and methane. Gaseous sulfur compounds, both natural and anthropogenic,
   are oxidized to particulate sulfates which have an important effect on
   albedo, counteracting the influence of the greenhouse gases. Atmospheric
   chemistry is therefore closely linked to industrial activity, climate,
   and land use through many complex environmental processes; these
   interactions cannot be realistically described by single numbers such as
   potentials for ozone depletion or global warming. The International
   Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) project is underway and dedicated to
   understanding this complex system through a combination of observations,
   theory, and laboratory and modelling studies.},

Title = {Remarkable separability of circulation response to Arctic sea ice loss

Pages = {7955-7964},

Abstract = {Arctic sea ice loss may influence midlatitude climate by changing
   large-scale circulation. The extent to which climate change can be
   understood as greenhouse gas-induced changes that are modulated by this
   loss depends on how additive the responses to the separate influences
   are. A novel sea ice nudging methodology in a fully coupled climate
   model reveals that the separate effects of doubled atmospheric carbon
   dioxide (CO2) concentrations and associated Arctic sea ice loss are
   remarkably additive and insensitive to the mean climate state. This
   separability is evident in several fields throughout most of the year,
   from hemispheric to synoptic scales. The extent to which the regional
   response to sea ice loss sometimes agrees with and sometimes cancels the
   response to CO2 is quantified. The separability of the responses might
   provide a means to better interpret the diverse array of modeling and
   observational studies of Arctic change and influence.
   Plain Language Summary The decrease in Arctic sea ice area may influence
   midlatitude climate and weather by changing hemispheric-scale winds.
   Whether the change in winds due to this Arctic sea ice loss can be
   cleanly separated from the wind changes due to human-induced greenhouse
   gas increase remains a question. Here using a global climate computer
   model, we explicitly separate the climate response to Arctic sea ice
   loss from the climate response to a doubling of atmospheric carbon
   dioxide (CO2) concentration with fixed Arctic sea ice. We show that the
   two separate responses add up to the full climate response to a doubling
   of CO2 concentration. We also show that it is not important whether CO2
   is doubled with a large amount of Arctic sea ice or a small amount or
   whether Arctic sea ice decreases in a warm climate or in a cold climate.
   These results imply that some features of human-induced climate change
   may be explained by Arctic sea ice melting and may help to explain the
   many different greenhouse gas-induced wind changes found in modeling and
   observational studies.},

Abstract = {We measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) simultaneously in two typical fringing zones, sandy shore
   and salt marsh, of coastal lagoon, Lake Nakaumi, Japan, in mid-summer
   2003. Our aim was to quantify net the greenhouse gases (GHGs) fluxes and
   examine key factors, which control variation of the GHGs fluxes in the
   two sites. Net CO2 and CH4 fluxes were markedly different between the
   two sites; magnitudes and variations of the both fluxes in sandy shore
   were lower than those of salt marsh. Meanwhile, magnitude and variation
   of net N2O flux in the two sites were similar. In sandy shore, temporal
   and spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were highly controlled by
   water level fluctuation derived from astronomic tide. In salt marsh,
   spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were correlated with
   aboveground biomass, and temporal variation of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were
   correlated with soil temperature. The sum of global warming potential,
   which was roughly estimated using the observed GHGs fluxes, was ca.
   174-fold higher in salt marsh than in sandy shore. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from shipping activities increased by
   9\% in 2018. Tankers are one of the contributors to total ship
   emissions. To reduce these emissions, the International Maritime
   Organization adopted the Green House Gas Strategy by issuing a
   regulation in the form of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI).
   This study aims to obtain the distribution of EEDI tankers in Indonesia.
   The EEDI calculation uses empirical equations that consider the main
   engine power, auxiliary engine power, and reference speed. The ship data
   used are 638 units of Indonesian-flagged tankers, including ship
   particulars from the classification agency. The results of this study
   indicate that compliance with the EEDI regulation is 26\%. Through the
   application of engine power limitation technology and innovative
   technology in the form of weather routing, waste heat recovery, solar
   panels, and electronically controlled engines, EEDI fulfillment
   increased to 78\%. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This paper presents scenarios computed with IMAGE 2.0, an integrated
   model of the global environment and climate change. Results are
   presented for selected aspects of the society-biosphere-climate system
   including primary energy consumption, emissions of various greenhouse
   gases, atmospheric concentrations of gases, temperature, precipitation,
   land cover and other indicators. Included are a `'Conventional Wisdom''
   scenario, and three variations of this scenario: (i) the Conventional
   Wisdom scenario is a reference case which is partly based on the input
   assumptions of the IPCC's IS92a scenario; (ii) the `'Biofuel Crops''
   scenario assumes that most biofuels will be derived from new cropland;
   (iii) the `'No Biofuels'' scenario examines the sensitivity of the
   system to the use of biofuels; and (iv) the `'Ocean Realignment''
   scenario investigates the effect of a large-scale change in ocean
   circulation on the biosphere and climate. Results of the biofuel
   scenarios illustrate the importance of examining the impact of biofuels
   on the full range of greenhouse gases, rather than only CO2. These
   scenarios also indicate possible side effects of the land requirements
   for energy crops. The Ocean Realignment scenario shows that an
   unexpected, low probability event can both enhance the build-up of
   greenhouse gases, and at the same time cause a temporary cooling of
   surface air temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. However, warming of
   the atmosphere is only delayed, not avoided.},

Abstract = {The presented study focused on developing an innovative decision-making
   framework to select the best renewable-power-plant technologies,
   considering comprehensive techno-economic and environmental variables.
   Due to the favourable conditions, Australia was selected as the case
   study. A fuzzy-logic method and analytical hierarchy process were
   applied to prioritize different renewable-energy power plants. The
   techno-economic factors included levelized cost of energy, initial cost,
   simple payback time, and operation and maintenance costs along with
   environmental factors including carbon payback time, energy payback time
   and greenhouse-gas emissions were used to rank the power plants. The
   results showed that the capital cost and simple payback time had the
   highest priority from an economic point of view. In comparison,
   greenhouse-gas emissions and carbon payback time were the dominant
   environmental factors. The analysis results provided economic and
   environmental priority tables for developing different power plants in
   the current state and a future scenario by 2030. The fuzzy results and
   pairwise composite matrix of alternatives indicated that the onshore
   wind, offshore wind, single-axis tracker polycrystalline photovoltaic,
   single-axis tracker monocrystalline photovoltaic, fix-tilted
   polycrystalline photovoltaic and fix-tilted monocrystalline photovoltaic
   scored the highest in the current state. In contrast, by 2030, the
   single-axis tracker photovoltaic power plants will be the best choice in
   the future scenario in Australia. Finally, the results were used and
   analysed to recommend and suggest several policy implementations and
   future research studies.
   A fuzzy-logic method and analytical hierarchy process are applied to
   prioritize different renewable-energy power plants using a case study in
   Australia. The analysis results provide economic and environmental
   priorities for developing different power plants both currently and by
   2030.},

Abstract = {Along with public transport modification, building and consumer
   efficiency, renewable energy and bio-fuels, among other greenhouse gas
   mitigation strategies within the European Union (EU), Zero Emission
   Power utilising Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the key
   options to significantly reduce CO2 quickly as the world begins the
   transition away from fossil fuels and high CO2 emissions. Transporting
   CO2 from capture locations to storage sites will play an integral part
   in the implementation of this strategy, as geography, urbanism,
   regulation, regionalism and currently installed transport systems
   challenge the ability of the EU and its member states to store billions
   of tonnes of CO2 before the middle of this century.
   While the building of a CO2 transportation infrastructure is the primary
   subject of this paper, no discussion of transport can begin without at
   least a brief discussion of how and where CO2 will be safely and
   securely stored, and the identification and rationalization of the
   capture sites to the storage locations. Only after this exercise is
   complete can a transport infrastructure be devised that will safely
   deliver the captured CO2 for long-term storage and sequestration. The EU
   Zero Emissions Technology Platform SSI workgroup report used the latest
   data available from public sources to identify within each EU member
   state, both the largest point sources of CO2 emissions and the most
   likely storage locations. Early opportunities for success whereby
   relatively pure CO2 streams might be captured with minimal cost and
   complexity were also identified. Lastly, the concept of the EU Flagship
   programme was rationalized to storage locations. Recommendations were
   given for the assigned tasks.
   Within this context the SSI workgroup reviewed options that might afford
   member states the opportunity to begin the construction of transport
   systems and how an EU wide storage infrastructure might be devised and
   evolve, including efforts for the EU Flagship Programme, as well as a
   discussion on what such an infrastructure would likely not become. The
   report used as its primary analogue the history of the currently
   installed natural gas pipeline system in Northwest Europe. Transport
   considerations used estimations from energy modelling of how much CO2
   might ultimately be stored by 2050 as a basis for the EU wide transport
   design. From that, geographical and urban considerations, physical
   movement and pressure limitations, CO2 quality variations, regulatory
   impediments, legal options, economic unknowns and value chains, pubic
   acceptance and education, along with verifiable, certifiable storage
   locations, both offshore and onshore were used to create an overall
   transport scenario that may prove a workable option in the coming
   decades. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Especially fast-growing economies in emerging countries contribute to
   this increase. In addition, the climate change effects of greenhouse gas

   that end, research artifacts are constructed and evaluated according to
   the design science research (DSR) principles. A discounted cash flow
   (DCF) model in combination with a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to
   consider critical project risks forms the basis of our decision support
   system (DSS). The applicability of the DSS is evaluated with an offshore

Abstract = {Global warming is one of the most serious challenges facing us today. It
   may be linked to the increase in atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse
   gases (GHGs), leading to a rise in sea level, notable shifts in
   ecosystems, and in the frequency and intensity of wild fires. There is a
   strong interest in stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and
   other GHGs by decreasing carbon emission and/or increasing carbon
   sequestration. Biotic sequestration is an important and effective
   strategy to mitigate the effects of rising atmospheric CO2
   concentrations by increasing carbon sequestration and storage capacity
   of ecosystems using plant photosynthesis and by decreasing carbon
   emission using biofuel rather than fossil fuel. Improvement of
   photosynthetic carbon assimilation, using transgenic engineering,
   potentially provides a set of available and effective tools for
   enhancing plant carbon sequestration. In this review, firstly different
   biological methods of CO2 assimilation in C-3, C-4 and CAM plants are
   introduced and three types of C-4 pathways which have high
   photosynthetic performance and have evolved as CO2 pumps are briefly
   summarized. Then (i) the improvement of photosynthetic carbon
   assimilation of C-3 plants by transgenic engineering using non-C-4
   genes, and (ii) the overexpression of individual or multiple C-4 cycle
   photosynthetic genes (PEPC, PPDK, PCK, NADP-ME and NADP-MDH) in
   transgenic C-3 plants (e. g. tobacco, potato, rice and Arabidopsis) are
   highlighted. Some transgenic C-3 plants (e. g. tobacco, rice and
   Arabidopsis) overexpressing the FBP/SBPase, ictB and cytochrome C-6
   genes showed positive effects on photosynthetic efficiency and growth
   characteristics. However, over the last 28 years, efforts to overexpress
   individual, double or multiple C-4 enzymes in C-3 plants like tobacco,
   potato, rice, and Arabidopsis have produced mixed results that do not
   confirm or eliminate the possibility of improving photosynthesis of C-3
   plants by this approach. Finally, a prospect is provided on the
   challenges of enhancing carbon assimilation of C-3 plants using
   transgenic engineering in the face of global warming, and the trends of
   the most promising approaches to improving the photosynthetic
   performance of C-3 plants.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions from advanced nitrogen-removal onsite
   wastewater treatment systems},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {737},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Advanced onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) designed to remove
   nitrogen from residential wastewater play an important role in
   protecting environmental and public health. Nevertheless, the microbial
   processes involved in treatment produce greenhouse gases (GHGs) that
   contribute to global climate change, including CO2, CH4, N2O. We
   measured GHG emissions from 27 advanced N-removal OWTS in the towns of
   Jamestown and Charlestown, Rhode Island, USA, and assessed differences
   in flux based on OWTS technology, home occupancy (year-round vs.
   seasonal), and zone within the system (oxic vs. anoxic/hypoxic). We also
   investigated the relationship between flux and wastewater properties.
   Flux values for CO2, CH4, and N2O ranged from -0.44 to 61.8, -0.0029 to
   25.3, and -0.02 to 0.23 mu mol GHG m(-2) s(-1), respectively. CO2 and
   N2O flux varied among technologies, whereas occupancy pattern did not
   significantly impact any GHG fluxes. CO2 and CH4 - but not N2O flux was
   significantly higher in the anoxic/hypoxic zone than in the oxic zone.
   Greenhouse gas fluxes in the oxic zone were not related to any
   wastewater properties. CO2 and CH4 flux from the anoxic/hypoxic zone
   peaked at -22-23 degrees C, and was negatively correlated with dissolved
   oxygen levels, the latter suggesting that CO2 and CH4 flux result
   primarily from anaerobic respiration. Ammonium concentration and CH4
   flux were positively correlated, likely clue to inhibition of CH4
   oxidation by NH4+. N2O flux in the anoxic/hypoxic zone was not
   correlated to any wastewater property. We estimate that advanced
   N-removal OWTS contribute 262 g CO2 equivalents capita(-1) day(-1),
   slightly lower than emissions from conventional OWTS. Our results
   suggest that technology influences CO2 and N2O flux and zone influences
   CO2 and CH4 flux, while occupancy pattern does not appear to impact GHG
   flux. Manipulating wastewater properties, such as temperature and
   dissolved oxygen, may help mitigate GHG emissions from these systems.

Abstract = {CO2 geological storage is currently considered as the most stable and
   effective technology for greenhouse gas reduction. The saline formations
   for CO2 geological storage are generally located at a depth of more than
   800 m where CO2 can be stored in a supercritical state, and an extensive
   impermeable cap rock that prevents CO2 leakage to the surface should be
   distributed above the saline formations. Trough analysis of seismic and
   well data, we identified the basalt flow structure for potential CO2
   storage where saline formation is overlain by basalt cap rock around
   PZ-1 exploration well in the Southern Continental Shelf of Korea. To
   evaluate CO2 storage capacity of the saline formation, total porosity
   and CO2 density are calculated based on well logging data of PZ-1 well.
   We constructed a 3D geological grid model with a certain size in the x,
   y and z axis directions for volume estimates of the saline formation,
   and performed a property modeling to assign total porosity to the
   geological grid. The estimated average CO2 geological storage capacity
   evaluated by the U.S. DOE method for the saline formation covered by the
   basalt cap rock is 84.17 Mt of CO2(ranges from 42.07 to 143.79 Mt of
   CO2).},

Title = {Assessment of spatiotemporal variations in the fluvial wash-load

Abstract = {For stream water, in which a relationship exists between wash-load
   concentration and discharge, an estimate of fine-sediment delivery may
   be obtained from a traditional fluvial wash-load rating curve. Here, we
   demonstrate that the remaining wash-load material load can be estimated
   from a traditional empirical principle on a nationwide scale. The
   traditional technique was applied to stream water for the whole of
   Japan. Four typical GCMs were selected from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble to provide the driving
   fields for the following regional climate models to assess the wash-load
   component based on rating curves: the Model for Interdisciplinary
   Research on Climate (MIROC), the Meteorological Research Institute
   Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-GCM), the Hadley Centre
   Global Environment Model (HadGEM) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
   Laboratory (GFDL) climate model. The simulations consisted of an
   ensemble, including multiple physics configurations and different
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), which
   was used to produce monthly datasets for the whole country of Japan. The
   impacts of future climate changes on fluvial wash load in Japanese
   stream water were based on the balance of changes in hydrological
   factors. The annual and seasonal variations of the fluvial wash load
   were assessed from the result of the ensemble analysis in consideration
   of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission scenarios. The determined results
   for the amount of wash load increase range from approximately 20 to
   110\% in the 2040s, especially along part of the Pacific Ocean and the
   Sea of Japan regions. In the 2090s, the amount of wash load is projected
   to increase by more than 50\% over the whole of Japan. The assessment
   indicates that seasonal variation is particularly important because the
   rainy and typhoon seasons, which include extreme events, are the
   dominant seasons. Because fluvial wash-load-component turbidity appears
   to vary exponentially, this phenomenon has an impact on the management
   of social capital, such as drinking water services. Prediction of the
   impacts of future climate change on fluvial wash-load sediment is
   crucial for effective environmental planning and the management of
   social capital to adapt to the next century.
   Capsule: We demonstrate that simulations comprise an ensemble of
   factors, including multiple physical configurations, associated with the
   wash-load component for the whole of Japan. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Uncertainty in United States coastal wetland greenhouse gas inventorying},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands store carbon dioxide (CO2) and emit CO2 and methane
   (CH4) making them an important part of greenhouse gas (GHG)
   inventorying. In the contiguous United States (CONUS), a coastal wetland
   inventory was recently calculated by combining maps of wetland type and
   change with soil, biomass, and CH4 flux data from a literature review.
   We assess uncertainty in this developing carbon monitoring system to
   quantify confidence in the inventory process itself and to prioritize
   future research. We provide a value-added analysis by defining types and
   scales of uncertainty for assumptions, burial and emissions datasets,
   and wetland maps, simulating 10 000 iterations of a simplified version
   of the inventory, and performing a sensitivity analysis. Coastal
   wetlands were likely a source of net-CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions
   from 2006-2011. Although stable estuarine wetlands were likely a CO(2)e
   sink, this effect was counteracted by catastrophic soil losses in the
   Gulf Coast, and CH4 emissions from tidal freshwater wetlands. The
   direction and magnitude of total CONUS CO(2)e flux were most sensitive
   to uncertainty in emissions and burial data, and assumptions about how
   to calculate the inventory. Critical data uncertainties included CH4
   emissions for stable freshwater wetlands and carbon burial rates for all
   coastal wetlands. Critical assumptions included the average depth of
   soil affected by erosion events, the method used to convert CH4 fluxes
   to CO(2)e, and the fraction of carbon lost to the atmosphere following
   an erosion event. The inventory was relatively insensitive to mapping
   uncertainties. Future versions could be improved by collecting
   additional data, especially the depth affected by loss events, and by
   better mapping salinity and inundation gradients relevant to key GHG
   fluxes.},

Title = {Biofilm and temperature controls on greenhouse gas (CO2 and CH4)
   emissions from a Rhizophora mangrove soil (New Caledonia)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {650},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Seasonal variations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were investigated in a
   Rhizophora mangrove forest that develops under a semi-arid climate, in
   New Caledonia. Fluxes were measured using closed incubation chambers
   connected to a CRDS analyzer. They were performed during low tide at
   light, in the dark, and in the dark after having removed the top 1-2 mm
   of soil, which may contain biofilm. CO2 and CH4 fluxes ranged from 31.34
   to 187.48 mmol m(-2) day(-1) and from 39.36 to 428.09 mu mol m(-2)
   day(-1), respectively. Both CO2 and CH4 emissions showed a strong
   seasonal variability with higher fluxes measured during the warm season,
   due to an enhanced production of these two gases within the soil.
   Furthermore, CO2 fluxes were higher in the dark than at light,
   evidencing photosynthetic processes at the soil surface and thus the
   role of biofilm in the regulation of greenhouse gasemissions from
   mangrove soils. The mean delta(13) C-CO2 value of the CO2 fluxes
   measured was -19.76 +/- 1.19\%, which was depleted compared to the one
   emitted by root respiration (-22.32 +/- 1.06\%), leaf litter
   decomposition (-21.43 +/- 1.89\%) and organic matter degradation (-22.33
   +/- 1.82\%). This result confirmed the use of the CO2 produced within
   the soil by the biofilm developing at its surface. After removing the
   top 1-2 mm of soil, both CO2 and CH4 fluxes increased. Enhancement of
   CH4 fluxes suggests that biofilm may act as a physical barrier to the
   transfer of GHG from the soil to the atmosphere. However, the delta
   C-13-CO2 became more enriched, evidencing that the biofilm was not
   integrally removed, and that its partial removal resulted in physical
   disturbance that stimulated CO2 production. Therefore, this study
   provides useful information to understand the global implication of
   mangroves in climate change mitigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Mitigating uncertainty and enhancing resilience to climate change in the
   fisheries sector in Taiwan: Policy implications for food security},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {355-372},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The human population is projected to grow to more than 9 billion by
   2050. New farming and fishing techniques are continually being
   developed. However, food production remains restricted by the finiteness
   of natural resources and the rapid increase in the global population. In
   the future, food production may decline because of the aggravated
   effects of climate change. Food production will be unable to satisfy the
   demands of the global population, leading to a food security crisis. As
   the world population continues to increase, food shortages will become
   increasingly severe, particularly for regions located in ``climate
   impact hot spots{''} in tropical and subtropical zones and for
   small-island countries such as Taiwan. In the present study, supply and
   demand are analysed to examine the risks and uncertainties associated
   with the impact of climate change on the domestic and imported seafood
   supply. First, we conduct a literature review to identify the climate
   risk for sea food security, and then, we analyse the domestic production
   of both the marine fishing catch and aquaculture. This study also
   examines the critical problems of the imported seafood supply and
   applies a comparative analysis of impact type and differences in the top
   10 seafood import countries to organize adaptation strategies to climate
   change. Moreover, due to the type of climate impact and the differences
   between long-term climate impact and extreme climate impact, we collect
   and compile the existing climate adaptation strategies of fishery
   production, seafood importing, and the demand and supply of seafood in
   Taiwan. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis to seek any
   deficiencies in the existing climate adaptation strategies and offer new
   adaptation guidelines based on the existing climate adaptation
   strategies. The results show that Taiwan's major adaptation strategies
   have been precautionary mitigation measures. In terms of resilience
   management, only the buffer stock scheme plan and the stabilization
   funds method are selected for some specific species to mitigate the
   short-term fluctuation in both yield and price for imported domestic
   seafood. However, we will confront uncertainties stemming from global
   climate change in the future; the existing climate adaptation strategies
   of Taiwan are still not sufficient to respond to climate impacts. For
   example, the climate change early warning system is still very
   inadequate, the existing scientific knowledge is insufficient, and the
   current adaptation strategies are insufficient for resolving the
   fluctuations in the market mechanism of seafood. According to the
   principles of risk management, the adaptation strategies recommended in
   this study can be differentiated into two categories: precautionary
   mitigation measures can be used to adapt to domestic production and
   uncertainties; such measures include avoidance, transfer, and reduction
   to prevent the frequency and consequences of climate change for building
   a resilient fisheries sector. Moreover, resilience management (e.g.,
   risk retention) can be used to respond to uncertainties in supply for
   adjusting production and mitigating the risks of climate change. (C)

Abstract = {A growing world population and socio-economic development are at the
   root of an ever-increasing energy demand throughout the world. Much of
   this demand is met by means of fossil fuels, leading to greenhouse gas
   emissions and climate change-hence the need for increasing the share of
   renewable energy sources in the global energy mix. Marine energy is a
   reliable, high-density source of energy with limited environmental
   impacts. Iran, with its long coastline, growing population, increasing
   energy demands and extreme air pollution, has a great potential for the
   development of marine energy. However, this potential has not received
   sufficient legislative or entrepreneurial attention so far. This review
   covers renewable energy resources in Iran in general -including solar,
   hydropower, wind, biomass and geothermal energy -with a focus on marine
   resources-wave and tidal energy. On the basis of the review, it can be
   stated that there are many energy hotspots with a high potential for
   marine energy development in the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the
   Gulf of Oman.},

   to sea-level rise},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adaptation is the process of adjusting to climate change in order to
   moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities associated with it.
   Most adaptation strategies are designed to adjust to a new climate
   state. However, despite our best efforts to curtail greenhouse gas
   emissions, climate is likely to continue changing far into the future.
   Here, we show how considering rates of change affects the projected
   optimal adaptation strategy. We ground our discussion with an example of
   optimal investment in the face of continued sea-level rise, presenting a
   quantitative model that illustrates the interplay among physical and
   economic factors governing coastal development decisions such as rate of
   sea-level rise, land slope, discount rate, and depreciation rate. This
   model shows that the determination of optimal investment strategies
   depends on taking into account future rates of sea-level rise, as well
   as social and political constraints. This general approach also applies
   to the development of improved strategies to adapt to ongoing trends in
   temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables. Adaptation to
   some amount of change instead of adaptation to ongoing rates of change
   may produce inaccurate estimates of damages to the social systems and
   their ability to respond to external pressures.},

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment of Ocean Energy Technologies: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The increase of greenhouse gases (GHG) generated by the burning of
   fossil fuels has been recognized as one of the main causes of climate
   change (CC). Different countries of the world have developed new
   policies on national energy security directed to the use of renewable
   energies mainly, ocean energy being one of them. The implementation of
   ocean energy is increasing worldwide. However, the use of these
   technologies is not exempt from the generation of potential
   environmental impacts throughout their life cycle. In this context, life
   cycle assessment (LCA) is a holistic approach used to evaluate the
   environmental impacts of a product or system throughout its entire life
   cycle. LCA studies need to be conducted to foster the development of
   ocean energy technologies (OET) in sustainable management. In this
   paper, a systematic review was conducted and 18 LCA studies of OET were
   analyzed. Most of the LCA studies are focused on wave and tidal energy.
   CC is the most relevant impact category evaluated, which is generated
   mostly by raw material extraction, manufacturing stage and shipping
   operations. Finally, the critical stages of the systems evaluated were
   identified, together with, the opportunity areas to promote an
   environmental management for ocean energy developers.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise, a consequence of climate change, is progressively
   affecting coastal areas around the globe. In turn, protected areas are
   keystones or protecting coastal biodiversity and the ecosystems services
   ensuring sustainable livelihoods. Effective management and adaptation
   plans are needed to maintain ecological function and integrity. In the
   present article, we used a coastal digital elevation model to simulate
   inundation surfaces and a prioritization index for ranking management
   interventions in 278 coastal protected areas from 27 African countries.
   Of these, 15 areas and eight countries demonstrated a high need for
   proactive management actions because of high levels of biodiversity,
   international conservation relevance, and exposure to sea-level rise.
   From the array of management actions available, tailored solutions are
   being implemented according to the morphology and location of the areas.
   Concerted action by international, government, and local partners is
   required for successful protection of the areas, including
   implementation of adaptive plans and monitoring progress schemes.},

Title = {Atmospheric CO2 capture by algae: Negative carbon dioxide emission path},
Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {215},
Pages = {371-379},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gas, which
   concentration increase in the atmosphere is associated to climate change
   and global warming. Besides CO2 capture in large emission point sources,
   the capture of this pollutant from atmosphere may be required due to
   significant contribution of diffuse sources. The technologies that
   remove CO2 from atmosphere (creating a negative balance of CO2) are
   called negative emission technologies. Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and
   Storage may play an important role for CO2 mitigation. It represents the
   combination of bioenergy production and carbon capture and storage,
   keeping carbon dioxide in geological reservoirs. Algae have a high
   potential as the source of biomass, as they present high photosynthetic
   efficiencies and high biomass yields. Their biomass has a wide range of
   applications, which can improve the economic viability of the process.
   Thus, this paper aims to assess the atmospheric CO2 capture by algal
   cultures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Farming freshwater prawns with fish in rice fields is widespread in the
   coastal region of southwest Bangladesh because of favourable resources
   and ecological conditions. This article provides an overview of an
   ecosystem-based approach to integrated prawn-fish-rice farming in
   southwest Bangladesh. The practice of prawn and fish farming in rice
   fields is a form of integrated aquaculture-agriculture, which provides a
   wide range of social, economic and environmental benefits. Integrated
   prawn-fish-rice farming plays an important role in the economy of
   Bangladesh, earning foreign exchange and increasing food production.
   However, this unique farming system in coastal Bangladesh is
   particularly vulnerable to climate change. We suggest that
   community-based adaptation strategies must be developed to cope with the
   challenges. We propose that integrated prawn-fish-rice farming could be
   relocated from the coastal region to less vulnerable inland areas, but
   caution that this will require appropriate adaptation strategies and an
   enabling institutional environment.},

Abstract = {Fisheries are critically important for nutrition, food security,
   livelihoods, and culture of hundreds of millions of people globally. As
   climate impacts on ocean ecosystems increase, policy-makers are asking
   critical questions about how to implement reforms at local and national
   levels to reach goals around improving performance of management
   systems, sustainability, equity, and resilience to climate change. These
   goals can be achieved by enhancing the structure, function, and
   biodiversity of marine ecosystems as climate change proceeds, together
   with adaptive, sustainable management. However, resource, technical, and
   governance capacities vary widely across management systems. These
   capacities will determine, in part, the best policy approaches to build
   resilience and overcome systemic challenges to equity and sustainability
   to stressors such as climate change. To illuminate how fisheries
   resilience can be improved within the constraints imposed by these
   capacity limits, we present case studies from Myanmar, Belize, Peru, and
   Iceland, which offer a spectrum of capacity conditions to explore
   social-ecological resilience challenges and solutions. Using a set of
   nine social-ecological resilience criteria, we examine each system's
   attributes that may confer or undermine resilience and explore
   interactions between them. We use this assessment to identify policy
   approaches that can help build resilience in each particular context.},

Abstract = {To stabilize the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG), a
   huge reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is required. Although
   some people believe that this necessitates a considerable reduction in
   the use of fossil fuels or fuel switching, other options are available
   that allow the use of fossil fuels and reduce atmospheric emissions of
   CO2. Sequestration of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion in the subsurface
   could prevent the CO2 from reaching the surface for millions of years.
   Geological sequestration of CO2 in deep aquifers or in depleted oil and
   gas reservoirs is a mature technology. Despite the huge quantities of
   CO2 that can be sequestered in this way, this approach does not provide
   any economic benefit. This paper discusses a third option, which
   consists of injecting CO2 in deep coal seams to sequester the carbon and
   enhance the recovery of coalbed methane (CBM). Waste CO2 from CBM-fueled
   power plants could be injected into CBM reservoirs to produce more
   methane (CH4) for the power plant. The 2:1 coal-sorption selectivity for
   CO2 over CH4 supports the feasibility of operating fossil-fueled power
   plants without atmospheric CO2 emissions. Other CO2 sequestration
   technologies, such as ocean disposal and biofixation, are briefly
   discussed and the suitability of these approaches is evaluated for use
   in Alberta, Canada. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Global negative emissions capacity of ocean macronutrient fertilization},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In order to meet the goal of limiting global average temperature
   increase to less than 2 degrees C, it is increasingly apparent that
   negative emissions technologies of up to 10 Pg C yr(-1) will be needed
   before the end of the century. Recent research indicates that
   fertilization of the ocean with the macronutrients nitrogen and
   phosphorus where they limit primary production, may have sequestration
   advantages over fertilizing iron limited regions. Utilizing global
   datasets of oceanographic field measurements, and output from a high
   resolution global circulation model, the current study provides the
   first comprehensive assessment of the global potential for carbon
   sequestration from ocean macronutrient fertilization (OMF). Sufficient
   excess phosphate exists outside the iron limited surface ocean to
   support once-off sequestration of up to 3.6 Pg C by fertilization with
   nitrogen. Ongoing maximum capacity of nitrogen only fertilization is
   estimated at 0.7 +/- 0.4 Pg C yr(-1) . Sequestration capacity is
   expected to decrease from the upper toward the lower bound over time
   under continued intense fertilization. If N and P were used in
   combination the capacity is ultimately limited by societies willingness
   to utilize phosphate resources. Doubling current phosphate production
   would allow an additional 0.9 Pg C yr(-1) and consume 0.07\% yr(-1) of
   known global resources. Therefore offsetting up to around 15\% (1.5 Pg C
   yr(-1)) of annual global CO2 emissions is assessed as being technically
   plausible. Environmental risks which to date have received little
   quantitative evaluation, could also limit the scale of implementation.
   These results reinforce the need to consider a multi-faceted approach to
   greenhouse gasses, including a reduction in emissions coupled with
   further research into negative emissions technologies.},

Abstract = {China is now accelerating the development of an ecological engineering
   for carbon sequestration in coastal mariculture environments to cope
   with climate change. Artificial upwelling as the ecological engineering
   can mix surface water with bottom water and bring rich nutrients to the
   euphotic zone, enhance seaweed growth in the oligotrophic sea area, and
   then increase coastal carbon sequestration. However, one of the major
   obstacles of the artificial upwelling is the high energy consumption.
   This study focused on the development of energy management technology
   for air-lift artificial upwelling by optimizing air injection rate. The
   fundamental principle underlying this technology is that the mode and
   intensity of air injection are adjusted from the feedback of information
   on velocity variation in tidal currents, illumination, and temperature
   of the surface layer. A series of equations to control air injection was
   derived based on seaweed growth and solar power generation. Although
   this finding was originally developed for the air-lift artificial
   upwelling, it also can be used in other areas of engineering, such as
   water delivery, aeration, and oxygenation. The simulations show that
   using a variable air injection rate can lift more nitrogen nutrients of
   28.2 mol than using a fixed air injection rate of 26.6 mol, mostly with
   the same energy cost. Using this control algorithm, the changed
   temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles prove the effective upwelling
   in the experiments and the average weights of kelp are 33.1 g in the
   experimental group and 10.1 g in the control group. The ecological
   engineering was successfully increasing crop yield for carbon
   sequestration in coastal mariculture environments.},

Title = {Effects of land use and forest management on soil carbon in the
   ecoregions of Maryland and adjacent eastern United States},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {448},
Pages = {34-47},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The impacts of forest-related land use and management on soil organic
   carbon (SOC) stocks have been investigated through years of primary
   research and review articles. This attention is justified given the
   importance of land use and management to greenhouse gas mitigation, soil
   and forest productivity, and other ecosystem services. However, there is
   a gap of scale and scope between site-level studies that control for
   sources of variation, producing high-confidence results for limited
   locations, and the broad reviews that offer more general conclusions.
   The present analysis is intended to fill that gap. Here, we focus on six
   ecoregions of the eastern United States, and integrate meta-analysis of
   published literature with synthesis of geo-referenced soil observations
   to: (1) test whether common land use and management practices
   quantitatively impact SOC; (2) identify key sources of variation in
   these effects; (3) assess how sources of variation translate to
   decisions about land use and management at ecoregional to landscape
   levels. Results corroborate general trends, such as O horizon SOC losses
   with harvesting and fire and SOC gains during reforestation, but provide
   greater detail about the influence of specific practices and site-level
   controls on SOC stocks and change in the study region. Results also show
   that: (1) harvest impacts depend upon landform and soil taxonomy; (2)
   harvesting forests that are recovering on previously cultivated lands
   decreases SOC; (3) tree biomass and SOC recovery increase concurrently
   during reforestation; (4) specific harvest, site preparation, and fire
   management practices affect the magnitude and variability of changes in
   SOC. Perhaps more importantly, ecoregional classification and soil
   taxonomy provide spatial frameworks for placing quantitative estimates
   of SOC stocks and changes in the geographic context of the study region,
   providing greater detail and specificity for individuals and
   institutions concerned with SOC management at more localized levels.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {The response of the second-generation Canadian earth system model
   (CanESM2) to historical (1850-2005) and future (2006-2100) natural and
   anthropogenic forcing is assessed using the newly-developed
   representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
   and aerosols. Allowable emissions required to achieve the future
   atmospheric CO2 concentration pathways, are reported for the RCP 2.6,
   4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. For the historical 1850-2005 period, cumulative
   land plus ocean carbon uptake and, consequently, cumulative diagnosed
   emissions compare well with observation-based estimates. The simulated
   historical carbon uptake is somewhat weaker for the ocean and stronger
   for the land relative to their observation-based estimates. The
   simulated historical warming of 0.9 degrees C compares well with the
   observation-based estimate of 0.76 +/- 0.19 degrees C. The RCP 2.6, 4.5
   and 8.5 scenarios respectively yield warmings of 1.4, 2.3, and 4.9
   degrees C and cumulative diagnosed fossil fuel emissions of 182, 643 and
   1617 Pg C over the 2006-2100 period. The simulated warming of 2.3
   degrees C over the 1850-2100 period in the RCP 2.6 scenario, with the
   lowest concentration of GHGs, is slightly larger than the 2 degrees C
   warming target set to avoid dangerous climate change by the 2009 UN
   Copenhagen Accord. The results of this study suggest that limiting
   warming to roughly 2 degrees C by the end of this century is unlikely
   since it requires an immediate ramp down of emissions followed by
   ongoing carbon sequestration in the second half of this century.

   Photovoltaic cells generate electricity for an electrolytic cation

   and carbon dioxide, with freshwater for electrolysis via seawater
   reverse osmosis. Carbon dioxide hydrogenation in a low-pressure
   isothermal cascade-type reactor system produces methanol as a liquid
   fuel product. Thermodynamic assessment of the integrated system
   indicates solar-to-methanol energy and exergy conversion efficiencies of
   1.5\% and 1.3\%, respectively, with the most significant losses

   Relevance of the Paris Agreement, Law of the Sea, and Regional Seas
   Programmes},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {185},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Parties to the Paris Agreement have a binding obligation to collectively
   limit global temperature rises to an agreed upon target. Commitments
   include providing national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory reports to the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ('UNFCCC')
   secretariat, reporting their contributions towards the collective
   target. GHG emissions from upstream oil and gas (O\&G) facilities,
   including those in offshore areas under coastal State jurisdiction
   (where current activity is occurring in over 50 countries), are to be
   included within the scope of these reports. Parties to the United
   Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ('UNCLOS') are obligated to
   adopt and enforce laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control
   pollution arising from seabed exploration and exploitation activities
   under their jurisdiction. These are to be no less effective than
   international rules and standards as established through competent
   international organisations. The International Maritime Organization
   (IMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), via the Regional
   Seas Programmes (RSP), are two such organisations that develop
   international rules and standards covering certain aspects of offshore
   O\&G activities. IMO treaties, rules, and standards cover GHG emissions
   arising from vessel-related offshore O\&G activities, but emissions from
   O\&G industry-specific activities, such as the venting and flaring of
   reservoir hydrocarbons, are excluded. The only other source of
   international law, implementing UNCLOS' requirement, providing
   international rules and standards for coastal States to benchmark their
   laws against for the prevention of marine pollution in the form of GHG
   emissions from offshore O\&G activities are the regional instruments of
   the RSP. However, as this article will show, current RSP coverage is
   minimal and insufficient, particularly in light of Parties' Paris
   Agreement and UNCLOS obligations. Examples are provided showing
   inconsistencies in the reporting of offshore O\&G GHG emissions across
   national inventory reports, as well as examples of applicable
   requirements prescribed under various RSP instruments, or lack thereof,
   highlighting the deficiency of a relevant international pollution
   prevention rule and/or standard across all marine regions.},

Pages = {563-572},

Abstract = {The leading mode of southern hemisphere (SH) climatic variability, the
   southern annular mode (SAM), has recently seen a shift towards its
   positive phase due to stratospheric ozone depletion and increasing
   greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Here we examine how sensitive the
   SAM (defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function of SH sea
   level pressure anomalies) is to future GHG concentrations. We determine
   its likely evolution for three intergovernmental panel on climate change
   (IPCC) special report on emission scenarios (SRES) for austral summer
   and winter, using a multi-model ensemble of IPCC fourth assessment
   report models which resolve stratospheric ozone recovery. During the
   period of summer ozone recovery (2000-2050), the SAM index exhibits
   weakly negative, statistically insignificant trends due to stratospheric
   ozone recovery which offsets the positive forcing imposed by increasing
   GHG concentrations. Thereafter, positive SAM index trends occur with
   magnitudes that show sensitivity to the SRES scenario utilised, and thus
   future GHG emissions. Trends are determined to be strongest for SRES A2,
   followed by A1B and B1, respectively. The winter SAM maintains a similar
   dependency upon GHG as summer, but over the entire twenty-first century
   and to a greater extent. We also examine the influence of ozone recovery
   by comparing results to models that exclude stratospheric ozone
   recovery. Projections are shown to be statistically different from the
   aforementioned results, highlighting the importance of ozone recovery in
   governing SAM-evolution. We therefore demonstrate that the future SAM
   will depend both upon GHG emissions and stratospheric ozone recovery.},

Title = {Optimizing net greenhouse gas balance of a bioenergy cropping system in
   southeast China with urease and nitrification inhibitors},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Efforts to advance our knowledge on the potential of bioenergy instead
   of fossil fuels in terms of mitigating climatic impact are in urgent
   need. No data is currently available on the use of urease and
   nitrification inhibitors in costal saline bioenergy cropping systems. An
   overall accounting of net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) and greenhouse
   gas intensity (GHGI) affected by combined effects of urease inhibitor
   hydroquinone (HQ) and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD)
   amendment was examined in a coastal saline Jerusalem artichoke bioenergy
   cropping system. The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was determined
   by the difference between soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) and net
   primary production (NPP) using static chamber method. Urease and
   nitrification inhibitors amendment increased the NPP but exerted a
   suppression effect on soil RH over the Jerusalem artichoke cropping
   system. A trade-off relationship was observed by decreasing soil N2O but
   stimulating soil CH4 emissions following HQ+DCD amendment. The plots
   combined urea with HQ+DCD application increased soil CH4 by 167\% while
   decreased N2O by 16\% as compared to with urea only in the bioenergy
   cropping system. On average, the fertilizer N-induced emission factor of
   N2O was estimated to be 0.25\% across the fertilized plots. Compared
   with urea, the plots with urea and HQ+DCD resulted in a further decrease
   by 37\% and 15\% in estimated NGHGB and GHGI over the Jerusalem
   artichoke cropping system, respectively. Overall, Jerusalem artichoke
   production would achieve higher biomass as source of biofuels but lower
   climatic impacts, particularly when together with urease and
   nitrification inhibitors amendment in coastal saline soils. (C) 2015

Title = {Environmental performance and shell formation-related carbon flows for
   mussel farming systems},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {831},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {This study examined the environmental performance of mussel (Mytilus
   galloprovincialis) farming in the view of reduction of greenhouse gas
   emissions, through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The LCA
   has been integrated with the evaluation of the carbon sequestration
   potential of the biocalcification process. Three case studies of mussel
   farming sited along the coastal area in the north Adriatic Sea, Italy,
   were analyzed. Two of them concerned mussels that do not require a
   depuration process (area Class A), and one inspected mussel production
   in the rearing area of Class B, which imposes a depuration phase after
   harvesting. This study examined all the relevant flows of materials and
   energy across the systems and explored the potential role of mussel
   biocalcification in stocking seawater carbon into the shells. Global
   Warming (GW)-related emissions amounted to 0.07-0.12 kg CO2 eq for
   Class\_A case studies and to 0.53 kg CO2 eq for Class\_B case study.
   Through biogenic calcification, 0.19-0.20 kg CO2 kg(-1) mussel is fixed
   in the shells, and 0.12 kg CO2 kg(-1) mussel is released. These flows
   resulted in a net sequestration of about 0.08 kg CO2 kg(-1) mussel. This
   study confirmed the good environmental performance of the mussel
   production in the farming systems analyzed. When considering greenhouse
   gasses emissions, the extent to which the seawater carbon fixed in the
   shell as calcium carbonate can be considered a carbon sink was discussed
   and substantiated by locally collected environmental data.\& nbsp;\&

Title = {Mini-review: Assessing the drivers of ship biofouling management -
   aligning industry and biosecurity goals},
Journal = {BIOFOULING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {411-428},
Abstract = {Biofouling exerts a frictional and cost penalty on ships and is a direct
   cause of invasion by marine species. These negative consequences provide
   a unifying purpose for the maritime industry and biosecurity managers to
   prevent biofouling accumulation and transfer, but important gaps exist
   between these sectors. This mini-review examines the approach to
   assessments of ship biofouling among sectors (industry, biosecurity and
   marine science) and the implications for existing and emerging
   management of biofouling. The primary distinctions between industry and
   biosecurity in assessment of vessels biofouling revolve around the
   resolution of biological information collected and the specific wetted
   surface areas of primary concern to each sector. The morphological
   characteristics of biofouling and their effects on propulsion dynamics
   are of primary concern to industry, with an almost exclusive focus on
   the vertical sides and flat bottom of hulls and an emphasis on
   antifouling and operational performance. In contrast, the identity,
   biogeography, and ecology of translocated organisms is of highest
   concern to invasion researchers and biosecurity managers and
   policymakers, especially as it relates to species with known histories
   of invasion elsewhere. Current management practices often provide
   adequate, although not complete, provision for hull surfaces, but niche
   areas are well known to enhance biosecurity risk. As regulations to
   prevent invasions emerge in this arena, there is a growing opportunity
   for industry, biosecurity and academic stakeholders to collaborate and
   harmonize efforts to assess and manage biofouling of ships that should
   lead to more comprehensive biofouling solutions that promote industry
   goals while reducing biosecurity risk and greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {Generic adaptation pathways for coastal archetypes under uncertain
   sea-level rise},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Adaptation to coastal flood risk is hampered by high uncertainty in the
   rate and magnitude of sea-level rise. Subsequently, adaptation decisions
   carry strong risks of under- or over-investment, and could lead to
   costly retrofitting or unnecessary high margins. To better allocate
   resources timely and effectively, and achieve long-term sustainability,
   planners could utilise adaptation pathways, revealing the
   path-dependencies of adaptation options. This helps to identify
   low-regret short-term decisions that preserve options in an uncertain
   future, while monitoring to detect signals to adapt. A major barrier to
   the application of adaptation pathways is limited experience. To
   facilitate this, here we generalize this pathways approach for six
   common coastal archetypes, resulting in generic pathways suitable to be
   adjusted to local conditions. This provides a much richer analysis of
   coastal adaptation than provided by any previous analysis, by assessing
   the solution space and options over time for a variety of coastal
   regions. Based on this analysis, we find that the number of adaptation
   options declines while sea-level rises. For some archetypes, it becomes
   clear that long-term thinking is needed now, about if, how and when to
   move to transformative options, such as planned retreat, which may
   presently not be considered or acceptable. Our analysis further shows
   that coastal adaptation needs to start earlier than anticipated,
   especially given time required for local debate and choice and to
   implement measures.},

Title = {Community Perception and Adaptation to Climate Change in Coastal Areas
   of Mexico},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change adaptation is an increasingly important topic addressed
   in the face of the current and expected future impacts by climate change
   that the social, economic and ecological systems are experiencing
   worldwide. Despite the advances reported in the literature, adaptation
   to climate change is still considered a challenge to move from planning
   to the practical implementation of successful interventions. In this
   regard, identifying international key barriers, exchanges of experiences
   and lessons learned may facilitate the progress of the coasts'
   sustainable and resilient future. The coast of Mexico is an excellent
   study area. High population densities occur along the coastal zone,
   whose main economic activity is related to primary and tertiary sectors.
   Additionally, a great diversity of coastal ecosystems exists, which are
   threatened by anthropogenic and hydrometeorological impacts. Under these
   circumstances, the population is becoming aware of the urgent need to
   adapt to the consequences of climate change. In this sense, this paper
   reviews research contributions concerning population perception to
   climate change and adaptation strategies in Mexico's coastal zone. The
   findings highlight critical institutional difficulties and social
   barriers that have impeded the effective implementation of adaptation
   strategies to climate change in Mexico and consider steps to address
   them. However, adaptation strategies that show the prevention culture of
   some coastal communities have been found and also results of successful
   projects carried out, especially on mangrove forest and coral reef
   restoration, which are of essential importance to consider to progress
   on the path of a successful adaptation to climate change in Mexico.},

Abstract = {This study is a preliminary assessment of the greenhouse effect of
   methane (CH4) emissions in the South China Sea (SCS) on human welfare
   using the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework and
   the systems approach framework (SAF). The SCS is surrounded by nations
   of the Asia-Pacific region that are currently experiencing rapid
   urbanization, industrialization, and economic growth, and is one of the
   most contested maritime areas of the world. Climate change may aggravate
   regional tensions, promote natural disasters, create climate refugees,
   and reduce food security by reducing the size of o fish catches and
   crops. International environmental protection, as well as the mitigation
   of, and adaptation to, climate change not only protect environmental
   sustainability, but also provide an international platform of
   cooperation for all countries around the SCS. The study analyzed the
   economic drivers and human activities that cause the pressure on the
   environment and increase CH4 emissions in the region. In addition, the
   possible future impact of climate change on human welfare is also
   discussed in the study. Finally, the study identified eight management
   responses across various spatial and temporal scales that can o be
   useful in addressing the issue of greenhouse gas (CH4) in the SCS.},

Abstract = {This field study evaluated the building performance of a nearly
   zero-energy office building near Brussels, Belgium, located in the
   temperate climatic zone. The building's thermal comfort and energy
   parameters were monitored from May 2018 to April 2019. The
   time-integrated thermal discomfort, primary energy use, and greenhouse
   gas emissions from the building were then analyzed using the monitored
   data. The case study evaluated the HVAC system performance with an
   air-cooled chiller with water cooling coils and a water boiler with
   water heating coils. The findings indicated an indoor overheating degree
   of 0.05 degrees C and an indoor overcooling degree of 0 degrees C for
   the observed period. The building's primary cooling energy use was found
   to be 37.54 kWh(PE)/m(2).a and primary heating energy use was found to
   be 46.08 kWh(PE)/m(2).a for the monitored period. The cooling and
   heating greenhouse gas emissions were 10.14 kg.CO(2)e/m(2).a and 8.34
   kg.CO(2)e/m(2).a, respectively. The observed data also indicated that
   the HVAC system in the building was operational throughout the
   monitoring period from May 2018 to April 2019, including a 24/7
   schedule. Finally, the paper provided implications for practice and
   future work based on the study findings.},

Title = {Above and below ground measurements of greenhouse gases from swine

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {38},
Number = {17-18},
Pages = {2479-2503},
Abstract = {As a means of economic disposal and to reduce need for chemical
   fertilizer, waste generated from swine production is often applied to
   agricultural land. However, there remain many environmental concerns
   about this practice. Two such concerns, contribution to the greenhouse
   effect and stratospheric ozone depletion by gases emitted from
   waste-amended soils, have not been thoroughly investigated. An intact
   core study at Auburn University (32 36 ` N, 85 36 ` W) was conducted to
   determine the source-sink relationship of three greenhouse gases in
   three Alabama soils (Black Belt, Coastal Plain, and Appalachian Plateau
   regions) amended with swine waste effluent. Soil cores were arranged in
   a completely random design, and treatments used for each soil type
   consisted of a control, a swine effluent amendment (112 kg N ha(-1)),
   and an ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) fertilizer amendment (112 kg N ha(-1)).
   During a 2-year period, a closed-chamber technique was used to determine
   rates of emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) - nitrogen (N), carbon dioxide
   (CO2) - carbon (C), and methane (CH4)-C from the soil surface. Gas
   probes inserted into the soil cores were used to determine
   concentrations of N2O-N and CO2-C from depths of 5, 15, and 25 cm. Soil
   water was collected from each depth using microlysi-meters at the time
   of gas collection to determine soil-solution N status. Application of
   swine effluent had an immediate effect on emissions of N2O-N, CO2-C, and
   CH4-C from all soil textures. However, greatest cumulative emissions and
   highest peak rates of emission of all three trace gases, directly
   following effluent applications, were most commonly observed from
   sandier textured Coastal Plain and Appalachian Plateau soils, as
   compared to heavier textured Black Belt soil. When considering
   greenhouse gas emission potential, soil type should be a determining
   factor for selection of swine effluent waste disposal sites in Alabama.},

Title = {Using a social-ecological systems perspective to identify context
   specific actions to build resilience in small scale fisheries in Mexico},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {To promote the resilience and sustainability of coastal
   social-ecological systems (SES), it is necessary to implement adaptive
   and participatory management schemes. Successful examples of adaptation
   to the rapid change in coastal SES exist, but the question of whether
   these cases may be scalable to other regions and contexts remains. To
   this end, the present study aimed to identify how successful management
   strategies implemented in a fishing cooperative in Baja California,
   Mexico, can be adapted to other coastal SES. In particular, this study
   aimed to understand whether adaptive co-management of Isla Natividad
   (IN) could be replicated in Isla Todos Santos (ITS), a biophysically
   similar coastal SES to IN but with different results with regard to
   fisheries management. We found that the resource systems and resources
   in both SESs were similar. However, there were substantial differences
   with regard to governance and resource users. In Isla Natividad, the
   level of organization orchestrated by the resource users has contributed
   to establishing rules and sanctions that have supported the sustainable
   use of fishery resources. On the contrary, in ITS, the number of
   resource users and their socioeconomic attributes have impeded the
   establishment of effective rules or sanctions. The results of this study
   suggest that the ITS governance system needs to be improved in order to
   adapt some of the IN management strategies to increase its adaptive
   capacity. To promote successful adaptive management, it is necessary to
   develop context-specific adaptive pathways that contribute to greater
   resilience in the SESs of this region and in other regions that face
   similar conditions.},

Title = {From Dichotomy to an Integrated Approach: Cities' Benefits of
   Integrating Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cities are facing impacts of climate change and encountering risks such
   as extreme weather events, while cities are also aiming to contribute to
   their mitigation goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   the differences in characteristics of climate change mitigation and
   adaptation have shown the possible reasons for a dichotomy in climate
   policy. This has motivated us to further look into whether cities could
   integrate their actions in climate change mitigation and adaptation in
   their planning and how they achieve benefits to overcome the dichotomy.
   To answer our research question, we have developed an analysis framework
   built on the endogenous risk theory to analyse how cities overcome the
   different characteristics to integrate their climate strategies and
   obtain benefits. The theory of endogenous risk involves seeing both
   climate change mitigation and adaptation as risk reduction strategies
   because both of them aim to reduce climate risks and can be carried out
   by actors who perceive such risks. Therefore, the actors will be more
   willing to integrate and implement both mitigation and adaptation
   policy. Our results show that mitigation and adaptation in cities are
   interlinked and that benefits of an integrated climate change policy
   exist. A list of entry points how cities overcome the dichotomy are also
   identified. Our research outcomes also provide a list of benefits
   identified by the cities in their integrated climate strategies and we
   call for more public disclosed data for future research and policy
   assessments.},

Title = {Transformative learning and community resilience to cyclones and storm
   surges: The case of coastal communities in Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While it has been widely recognized that building community resilience
   to climate induced shocks requires learning processes at multiple
   societal levels, there has been limited research on the specific types
   of learning required at individual level to influence change and
   transformation at the community level. To determine how transformative
   learning and risk-mitigation actions shape community resilience to
   climate-induced disasters, we carried out a mixed-method empirical
   investigation on the southern coast of Bangladesh. We found that the
   relationship between transformative learning and resilience-building is
   complex, involving multiple social cultural-structural factors (e.g.,
   beliefs, values, power structures), practical considerations (e.g.,
   impact on livelihood, evacuation and relocation logistics), and
   cognitive factors. From our observations, we draw four general
   conclusions: i) local culture can constrain people?s framing of risk and
   capacity for critical reflection, resulting in a deliberate denial and
   amnesia of past traumatic experiences; ii) learning alone cannot enhance
   resilience unless it is translated into action; iii) dependence on
   experiential learning can lead to the assumption that the severity of
   past disasters will not be surpassed, generating a false sense of
   security; and iv) the cultivation of forward-thinking attitudes coupled
   with innovative strategies, such as social networking, can successfully
   enhance resilience to climate-related disasters. Future policymaking
   aimed at building community resilience to climate shocks should
   therefore take into account cultural and individual cognitive barriers
   to transformative learning and attempt to remove structural barriers to
   translating learning into practical action.},

Title = {Dynamical response of Mediterranean precipitation to greenhouse gases

Abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols and greenhouse gases affect cloud properties,
   radiative balance and, thus, the hydrological cycle. Observations show
   that precipitation has decreased in the Mediterranean since the
   beginning of the 20th century, and many studies have investigated
   possible mechanisms. So far, however, the effects of aerosol forcing on
   Mediterranean precipitation remain largely unknown. Here we compare the
   modeled dynamical response of Mediterranean precipitation to individual
   forcing agents in a set of global climate models (GCMs). Our analyses
   show that both greenhouse gases and aerosols can cause drying in the
   Mediterranean and that precipitation is more sensitive to black carbon
   (BC) forcing than to well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs) or sulfate
   aerosol. In addition to local heating, BC appears to reduce
   precipitation by causing an enhanced positive sea level pressure (SLP)
   pattern similar to the North Atlantic Oscillation Arctic Oscillation,
   characterized by higher SLP at midlatitudes and lower SLP at high
   latitudes. WMGHGs cause a similar SLP change, and both are associated
   with a northward diversion of the jet stream and storm tracks, reducing
   precipitation in the Mediterranean while increasing precipitation in
   northern Europe. Though the applied forcings were much larger, if
   forcings are scaled to those of the historical period of 1901-2010,
   roughly one-third (31 +/- 17 \%) of the precipitation decrease would be
   attributable to global BC forcing with the remainder largely
   attributable to WMGHGs, whereas global scattering sulfate aerosols would
   have negligible impacts. Aerosol-cloud interactions appear to have
   minimal impacts on Mediterranean precipitation in these models, at least
   in part because many simulations did not fully include such processes;
   these merit further study. The findings from this study suggest that
   future BC and WMGHG emissions may significantly affect regional water
   resources, agricultural practices, ecosystems and the economy in the
   Mediterranean region.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas fluxes from natural ecosystems},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {56},
Number = {5},
Pages = {369-407},
Abstract = {Besides water vapour, greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, O-3 and N2O contribute
   similar to 60\%, 20\%, 10\% and 6\% to global warming, respectively;
   minor contribution is made by chlorofluorocarbons and volatile organic
   compounds (VOC). We present CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes from natural and
   relatively unmanaged soil-plant ecosystems (the ecosystems minimally
   disturbed by direct human or human- induced activities). All natural
   ecosystems are net sinks for CO2, although tundra and wetlands
   (including peatlands) are large sources of CH4, whereas significant N2O
   emissions occur mainly from tropical and temperate forests. Most natural
   ecosystems decrease net global warming potential (GWP) from - 0.03 +/-
   0.35 t CO2-eha(-1) y(-1) (tropical forests) to - 0.90 +/- 0.42 t CO2-e
   ha(-1) y(-1) (temperate forests) and - 1.18 +/- 0.44 t CO2-e ha(-1)
   y(-1) (boreal forests), mostly as CO2 sinks in phytobiomass, microbial
   biomass and soil C. But net GWP contributions from wetlands are very
   large, which is primarily due to CH4 emissions. Although the tropical
   forest system provides a large carbon sink, the negligible capacity of
   tropical forests to reduce GWP is entirely due to N2O emissions,
   possibly from rapid N mineralisation under favourable temperature and
   moisture conditions. It is estimated that the natural ecosystems reduce
   the net atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 3.55 +/- 0.44
   GtCO(2)-ey(-1) or similar to 0.5 ppm(v) CO2-e y(-1), hence, the
   significant role of natural and relatively unmanaged ecosystems in
   slowing global warming and climate change. However, the impact of
   increasing N deposition on natural ecosystems is poorly understood, and
   further understanding is required regarding the use of drainage as a
   management tool, to reduce CH4 emissions from wetlands and to increase
   GHG sink from the restoration of degraded lands, including saline and
   sodic soils. Data on GHG fluxes from natural and relatively unmanaged
   ecosystems are further compounded by large spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity, limited sensitivity of current instruments, few and poor
   global distribution of monitoring sites and limited capacity of models
   that could integrate GHG fluxes across ecosystems, atmosphere and oceans
   and include feedbacks from biophysical variables governing these fluxes.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have substantially

   to continue for many centuries. Thus, precise quantification of
   human-induced GHG emissions is urgently required for modeling future
   global warming and precipitation changes, which is strongly linked to
   flood disasters. Recently, GHG evasion from hydroelectric reservoirs was
   estimated to be 48 Tg C as CO2 and 3 Tg C as CH4 annually, lower than
   earlier estimate (published in Nature Geoscience; 2011). Here, we
   analyzed the uncertainties of GHG emissions from hydroelectric
   reservoirs, that is, reservoir surface area, data paucity and carbon
   emission relating to ecological zone, and argued that GHG evasion from
   global hydroelectric reservoirs has been largely under-estimated. Our
   study hopes to improve the quantification for future researches.},

Title = {Pond Excavation Reduces Coastal Wetland Carbon Dioxide Assimilation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands comprise important global carbon sinks; however,
   anthropogenic disturbance accompanied with accelerating sea level rise
   threaten their continued survival. In this study, we quantified habitat
   disturbance to salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, resulting from
   the construction of ponds for mosquito control. Geographic object-based
   image analysis of high-resolution four-band aerial imagery revealed that
   over 7,000 ponds were constructed in the marsh complex with pond
   densities as high as 290 ponds per km(2). Physical disturbance from pond
   creation and sediment dispersal extended to over 17\% of the bay's tidal
   wetlands. By tracking recolonization of vegetation, we estimated that it
   took 5 years for 51\% vegetation recovery and 10 years for 69\%
   recovery, with complete recover (100\%) not expected for more than 50
   years. This suggests that efforts to extend the lifespan of drowning
   coastal wetlands through sediment additions might disrupt carbon dioxide
   assimilation, as effects of disturbance persist. Focusing on greenhouse
   gas exchange, our work found that areas of marsh vegetation contribute
   to carbon assimilation (-42 g C . m(-2) . year(-1)), while ponds and
   areas of bare peat created by pond excavation were associated with
   carbon emissions (44 and 125 g C . m(-2) . year(-1), respectively).
   These results suggest that the conversion of wetlands to ponds-which is
   a significant driver of coastal wetland loss worldwide-may convert
   coastal wetlands from greenhouse gas sinks to sources. Additionally,
   quantifying the area of vegetation within a marsh (vs. bare ground or
   open water) is important for quantifying their greenhouse gas mitigation
   function.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal wetlands are important for our planet as
   they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Our goal was to
   determine how the construction of ponds in wetlands-which is common
   worldwide to support expanding aquaculture-affects the ability of
   marshes to take up carbon dioxide. We estimated the number and extent of
   ponds constructed for mosquito control in coastal wetlands in Barnegat
   Bay, New Jersey. Additionally, we measured greenhouse gas exchange from
   the ponds, surrounding intact marsh, and in bare areas at several sites
   across the growing season to estimate the total carbon uptake of the
   whole marsh. We found that over 7,000 ponds have been dug for mosquito
   control in New Jersey and that pond density is as high as 290 ponds per
   km(2). We also found that the ponds constructed in wetlands reduce the
   ability of wetlands to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {We analyse possible causes of twentieth century near-surface temperature
   change. We use an ``optimal detection{''} methodology to compare
   seasonal and annual data from the coupled atmosphere-ocean general
   circulation model HadCM2 with observations averaged over a range of
   spatial and temporal scales. The results indicate that the increases in
   temperature observed in the latter half of the century have been caused
   by warming from anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases offset by
   cooling from tropospheric sulfate aerosols rather than natural
   variability, either internal or externally forced. We also find that
   greenhouse gases are likely to have contributed significantly to the
   warming in the first half of the century. In addition, natural effects
   may have contributed to this warming. Assuming one particular
   reconstruction of total solar irradiance to be correct implies, when we
   take the seasonal cycle into account, that solar effects have
   contributed significantly to the warming observed in the early part of
   the century, regardless of any relative error in the amplitudes of the
   anthropogenic forcings prescribed in the model. However, this is not the
   case with an alternative reconstruction of total solar irradiance, based
   more on the amplitude than the length of the solar cycle. We also find
   evidence for volcanic influences on twentieth century near-surface
   temperatures. The signature of the eruption of Mount Pinatubo is
   detected using annual-mean data. We also find evidence for a volcanic
   influence on warming in the first half of the century associated with a
   reduction in mid-century volcanism.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Arctic sea ice decline has led to an amplification of surface warming
   and is projected to continue to decline from anthropogenic forcing,
   although the exact timing of ice-free summers is uncertain owing to
   large natural variability. Sea ice reductions affect surface heating
   patterns and the atmospheric pressure distribution, which may alter
   midlatitude extreme weather patterns. Increased light penetration and
   nutrient availability during spring from earlier ice breakup enhances
   primary production in the Arctic Ocean and its adjacent shelf seas.
   Ice-obligate marine mammals may be losers, whereas seasonally migrant
   species may be winners from rapid sea ice decline. Tundra greening is
   occurring across most of the Arctic, driven primarily by warming
   temperatures, and is displaying complex spatial patterns that are likely
   tied to other factors. Sea ice changes are affecting greenhouse gas
   exchanges as well as halogen chemistry in the Arctic. This review
   highlights the heterogeneous nature of Arctic change, which is vital for
   researchers to better understand.},

Title = {The determinants of integrating policy-based and community-based
   adaptation into coastal hazard risk management: a resilience approach},

Abstract = {A growing number of studies focus on improving the understanding of how
   the households' adaptations can be encouraged in the process of coastal
   hazards and risk management. Particularly, this process is undergoing a
   major paradigm shift as it moves from an approach dominated by
   policy-based adaptation to another one in which community-based
   resilience building is favored. Thus, this article aims to apply a
   resilience approach to improve the knowledge about how public measures
   influence private autonomous adaptation behavior, through a
   transdisciplinary investigation of household adaptation behavior and its
   determinants. The Resilience Framework of Household Autonomous
   Adaptation to Climate- and Weather-Related Hazard Risks (ROHACHR) is
   proposed and combined with a focus group meeting and multivariate
   analysis to compare pre-disaster, during a disaster, post-disaster
   adaptations, and resilience behavior of households. Using an empirical
   survey of the households in three coastal municipalities in Taiwan, we
   examine the relationships between public measures and private
   adaptations that provides three distinguishing types of household
   behavior: `core', `trust in governmental aid', and `awareness and
   structures'. Results show that providing hazard risk information may be
   one step toward encouraging private autonomous adaptations. Several
   factors that help foster resilience also appear to be influential in
   households' adaptation decisions, such as specific and positive
   governmental aid, information trust, and social capital. Based on these
   results, it shows that the ROHACHR is useful to characterize households'
   adaptation and resilience behavior and explain how they respond to
   public measures. Finally, the policy implications of our findings for
   improving resilience of coastal communities and encouraging
   public-private collaboration in the process of hazard risk management
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {In the context of increasing climate change, fishery-based livelihoods
   as major means of income and well-beings for millions of population in
   coastal communities around the world are most affected. Yet, available
   information how fishery-based livelihood system at local level are
   vulnerable to climate change, especially in developing countries is very
   limited. Using an indicator-based vulnerability assessment framework,
   this study examined the household-level vulnerability of fishery-based
   livelihoods in two coastal communities in Central Vietnam. The results
   showed that the nature and degree of livelihood vulnerability to climate
   change among fishing households depend on their own characteristics and
   conditions as well as accessibility to livelihood diversification
   opportunities. Developing appropriate adaptation policies and coastal
   management measures to reduce livelihood vulnerability should enhance
   positive indicators of household's adaptive capacity and create a better
   environment for alternative livelihood opportunities.},

Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A terrestrial ecosystem model, called the Vegetation Integrative
   Simulator for Trace gases model (VISIT), which fully integrates
   biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles, was developed to simulate
   atmosphere-ecosystem exchanges of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O),
   and to determine the global warming potential (GWP) taking into account
   the radiative forcing effect of each gas. The model was then applied to
   a cool-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest in Takayama, central
   Japan (36A degrees 08'N, 137A degrees 25'E, 1420 m above sea level).
   Simulations were conducted at a daily time step from 1948 to 2008, using
   time-series meteorological and nitrogen deposition data. VISIT
   accurately captured the carbon and nitrogen cycles of this typical
   Japanese forest, as validated by tower and chamber flux measurements.
   During the last 10 years of the simulation, the model estimated that the
   forest was a net greenhouse gas sink, having a GWP equivalent of 1025.7
   g CO2 m(-2) y(-1), most of which (1016.9 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) was
   accounted for by net CO2 sequestration into forest biomass regrowth. CH4
   oxidation by the forest soil made a small contribution to the net sink
   (11.9 g CO2-eq. m(-2) y(-1)), whereas N2O emissions were a very small
   source (3.2 g CO2-eq. m(-2) y(-1)), as expected for a volcanic soil in a
   humid climate. Analysis of the sensitivity of GWP to changes in
   temperature, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition indicated that
   warming temperatures would decrease the size of the sink, mainly as a
   result of increased CO2 release due to increased ecosystem respiration.},

Abstract = {This research analyzes the water-energy nexus contribution to climate
   change from the integral water cycle perspective. A prior analysis of
   the sectors involved in global warming showed that clear water/energy
   interdependence was a crucial factor in increasing greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. Although the analysis of water consumption in the energy
   sector has been widely studied, global requirements of energy for water
   are still poorly understood as is their contribution to climate change.
   With this in mind, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were chosen for
   the specific analysis conducted in the present study as they are one of
   the biggest GHG emitters in the water industry. They are located in the
   Canary Islands (Spain), an archipelago that, like many others, is
   characterized by its dependence on external water and energy resources.
   The methodology employed involved an initial analysis of the WWTPs in
   the islands and the selection of four full-scale WWTPs of varying
   capacity for further in-depth analysis. This was followed by
   consideration of the different protocols and tools that can be used to
   quantify direct and indirect GHGs emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change protocol was selected due to the great diversity of
   operational data and the emission factors proposed by experts when the
   data are not available for a specific region under analysis. The results
   show that the highest emission source is due to energy consumption
   (ranging from 165 to 2,716 Tm-eq CO2/y for the smallest and largest size
   WWTPs, respectively). To solve the problem, the introduction of
   renewable energies is presented as a feasible and attractive option due
   to the specific characteristics of the analyzed territory. Likewise, the
   use of sludge as an internal energy resource (in anaerobic digestion)
   obviates the need for its transport and management, contributing to the
   circular technology and reducing emissions.},

Title = {Low-income residents' strategies to cope with urban heat},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rising temperatures due to climate change and urban heat island effects
   lead to heat stress and need remedial actions at all city planning
   scales. The design of built spaces strongly influences residents'
   exposure to heat risks. However, practices that increase communities'
   resilience to heat are not yet influencing decision-making in urban
   planning. In this study, qualitative interviews were conducted in
   low-income households in three different cities in India and Austria to
   understand residents' strategies for coping with excess summer heat in
   their homes. Although significant differences are discernible between
   India and Austria, low-income households in both continents lack agency
   over their housing situation and have little means to adapt it to heat.
   This lack strongly influences how they can handle the heat. Lack of
   resources forces them to accept unfavourable thermal conditions and
   keeps them from affording any but the most basic remedies. While
   buildings constitute the single most important and effective means of
   protection against heat stress for most interviewees in India, design
   restrictions and the appliance of cheap building materials limit this
   protection's effectiveness, especially during evening and night times.},

Abstract = {Increasing demand for metals used in clean energy technologies,
   including electric vehicles, has led to an increased demand in certain
   metals such as Ni, Co, and Mn. This demand has in turn led to an
   expanding interest in deep-seabed mining (DSM) of polymetallic nodule
   deposits that contain these exact metals. The main concerns about DSM
   relate to the incomplete information available about the environmental
   risks associated with seabed mineral extraction. Key uncertainties need
   to be systematically addressed to refine environmental impact
   predictions and establish effective mitigation measures. Adaptive
   management is an iterative process for reducing the uncertainty that can
   be applied by both mining companies and regulatory bodies. This Special
   Series paper reviews the key opportunities and challenges to
   operationalizing adaptive management in DSM projects and highlights the
   need for a framework to move from theory to practice. The discussion
   proposes a systems approach to adaptive management, which could help to
   guide the environmental management of deep-sea mineral extraction.

Abstract = {Future coral reefs are expected to be subject to higher pCO(2) and
   temperature due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Such global
   stressors are often paired with local stressors thereby potentially
   modifying the response of organisms. Benthic macroalgae are strong
   competitors to corals and are assumed to do well under future
   conditions. The present study aimed to assess the impact of past and
   future CO2 emission scenarios as well as nutrient enrichment on the
   growth, productivity, pigment, and tissue nutrient content of the common
   tropical brown alga Chnoospora implexa. Two experiments were conducted
   to assess the differential impacts of the manipulated conditions in
   winter and spring. Chnoosporaimplexa's growth rate averaged over winter
   and spring declined with increasing pCO(2) and temperature. Furthermore,
   nutrient enrichment did not affect growth. Highest growth was observed
   under spring pre-industrial (PI) conditions, while slightly reduced
   growth was observed under winter A1FI (business-as-usual) scenarios.
   Productivity was not a good proxy for growth, as net O-2 flux increased
   under A1FI conditions. Nutrient enrichment, whilst not affecting growth,
   led to luxury nutrient uptake that was greater in winter than in spring.
   The findings suggest that in contrast with previous work, C.implexa is
   not likely to show enhanced growth under future conditions in isolation
   or in conjunction with nutrient enrichment. Instead, the results suggest
   that greatest growth rates for this species appear to be a feature of
   the PI past, with A1FI winter conditions leading to potential decreases
   in the abundance of this species from present day levels.},

Abstract = {There is a clear need to apply better and more affective management
   schemes to coastal ecosystem restoration projects. It is very common for
   aquatic ecosystem restoration projects not to meet their goals. Poor
   performance has led to a high degree of uncertainty about the potential
   success of any restoration effort. Under adaptive management, the
   knowledge gained through monitoring of the project and social policies
   is translated into restoration policy and program redesign. Planners and
   managers can utilize the information from the monitoring programs in an
   effective way to assure that project goals are met or that informed and
   objective decisions are made to address both ecological and societal
   needs. The three main ingredients of an effective adaptive management
   plan in a restoration project are: 1. a clear goal statement; 2. a
   conceptual model; and 3. a decision framework. The goal `drives' the
   design of the project and helps guide the development of performance
   criteria. The goal statement and performance criteria provide the means
   by which the system can be judged. With the conceptual model, the
   knowledge base from the field of ecological science plays an active and
   critical role in designing the project to meet the goal. A
   system-development matrix provides a simple decision framework to view
   the alternative states for the system during development, incorporate
   knowledge gained through the monitoring program, and formulate a
   decision on actions to take if the system is not meeting its goal. (C)

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Climatic and non-climatic stressors, such as temperature increases,
   rainfall fluctuations, population growth and migration, pollution,
   land-use changes and inadequate gender-specific strategies, are major
   challenges to coastal agricultural sustainability. In this paper, we
   discuss all pertinent issues related to the sustainability of coastal
   agriculture under climate change. It is evident that some
   climate-change-related impacts (e.g., temperature and rainfall) on
   agriculture are similarly applicable to both coastal and non-coastal
   settings, but there are other factors (e.g., inundation, seawater
   intrusion, soil salinity and tropical cyclones) that particularly impact
   coastal agricultural sustainability. Coastal agriculture is
   characterised by low-lying and saline-prone soils where spatial
   competition with urban growth is an ever-increasing problem. We
   highlight how coastal agricultural viability could be sustained through
   blending farmer perceptions, adaptation options, gender-specific
   participation and integrated coastal resource management into policy
   ratification. This paper provides important aspects of the coastal
   agricultural sustainability, and it can be an inspiration for further
   research and coastal agrarian planning.},

   Mexico: A Review},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},

Abstract = {Land use change from forests to grazing lands is one of the important
   sources of greenhouse gas emissions in many parts of the tropics. The
   objective of this study was to analyze the extent of soil organic carbon
   (SOC) loss from the conversion of native forests to pasturelands in
   Mexico. We analyzed 66 sets of published research data with simultaneous
   measurements of soil organic carbon stocks between native forests and
   pasturelands in Mexico. We used a generalized linear mixed effect model
   to evaluate the effect of land use change (forest versus pasture), soil
   depth, and original native forest types. The model showed that there was
   a significant reduction in SOC stocks due to the conversion of native
   forests to pasturelands. The median loss of SOC ranged from 31.6\% to
   52.0\% depending upon the soil depth. The highest loss was observed in
   tropical mangrove forests followed by highland tropical forests and
   humid tropical forests. Higher loss was detected in upper soil horizon
   (0-30 cm) compared to deeper horizons. The emissions of CO2 from SOC
   loss ranged from 46.7 to 165.5 Mg CO2 eq. ha(-1) depending upon the type
   of original native forests. In this paper, we also discuss the effect
   that agroforestry practices such as silvopastoral arrangements and other
   management practices like rotational grazing, soil erosion control, and
   soil nutrient management can have in enhancing SOC stocks in tropical
   grasslands. The results on the degree of carbon loss can have strong
   implications in adopting appropriate management decisions that recover
   or retain carbon stocks in biomass and soils of tropical livestock
   production systems.},

Abstract = {Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the first, but temporary,
   substitution products for the strong ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons
   (CFCs). HCFC consumption and production are currently regulated under
   the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and
   their emissions have started to stabilize or even decrease. As HCFC-22
   (CHClF2) is by far the most abundant HCFC in today's atmosphere, it is
   crucial to continue to monitor the evolution of its atmospheric
   concentration. In this study, we describe an improved HCFC-22 retrieval
   strategy from ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) solar spectra recorded at the high-altitude scientific station of
   Jungfraujoch, the Swiss Alps, 3580 m a.m.s.l. (above mean sea level).
   This new strategy distinguishes tropospheric and lower-stratospheric
   partial columns. Comparisons with independent datasets, such as the
   Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and the Michelson
   Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), supported by
   models, such as the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObErvation
   (BASCOE) and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM),
   demonstrate the validity of our tropospheric and lower-stratospheric
   long-term time series. A trend analysis on the datasets used here, now
   spanning 30 years, confirms the last decade's decline in the HCFC-22
   growth rate. This updated retrieval strategy can be adapted for other
   ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), such as CFC-12. Measuring or
   retrieving ODS atmospheric concentrations is essential for scrutinizing
   the fulfilment of the globally ratified Montreal Protocol.},

Abstract = {Due to environmental concern, Taiwan aims to remove nuclear power from
   its energy structure. Since an increase in fossil fuel-based generation
   is foreboded by law, the lost nuclear power can only be replaced by
   renewable energy sources. The maritime climate and constant monsoons
   make wind power a feasible alternative energy source to Taiwan. With
   more than 300 potential wind farm sites under consideration, the
   government does not have enough information to determine the best sites
   in terms of power generation and capital investments. To explore such
   information, this study employs a lifecycle analysis to identify the
   economic components of these sites under the estimates of wind speed
   data and potential wind power generation obtained in our previous study.
   We also use a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of construction
   cost, maintenance cost, energy sale, and emission trade on the site
   selection decision. We show that variations in construction costs and
   energy prices have larger impacts than greenhouse gases prices. In
   addition, the results point out that most sites pass the cost-benefit
   examination, but site rankings may alter in the face of capital
   rationing and climate change. Some policy implications derived from the
   results are discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {This paper is an outgrowth of an effort undertaken by the Department of
   Energy's Office of Energy Research to assess the fundamental research
   needs to support a national program in carbon management (Benson et al,
   1998). Five topics were identified as areas where carbon management
   strategies and technologies might be developed: (1) capture of carbon
   dioxide, decarbonization strategies, and carbon dioxide disposal and
   utilization; (2) hydrogen development and fuel cells; (3) enhancement of
   the natural carbon cycle; (4) biomass production and utilization; and
   (5) improvement of the efficiency of energy production, conversion, and
   utilization. Within each of these general areas, experts came together
   to identify targets of opportunity for fundamental research likely to
   lead to the development of mid- to long-term solutions for stabilizing
   or decreasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the
   atmosphere. Basic research to support the options outlined above are far
   reaching-from understanding natural global processes such as the ocean
   and terrestrial carbon cycles to development of new materials and
   concepts for chemical separation. Examples of fundamental research needs
   are described in this paper.},

Title = {Climate change, human health, and epidemiological transition},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {69-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The health of populations depends on the availability of clean air,
   water, food, and sanitation, exposure to pathogens, toxins and
   environmental hazards, and numerous genetic, behavioral and social
   factors. For many thousands of years, human life expectancy was low, and
   population growth was slow. The development of technology-based
   civilizations facilitated what Abdel Omran called ``epidemiological
   transition,{''} with increasing life expectancy and rapid population
   growth. To a large extent, the spectacular growth of human populations
   during the past two centuries was made possible by the energy extracted
   from fossil fuels. We have now learned, however, that greenhouse gases
   from fossil fuel combustion are warming the planet's surface, causing
   changes in oceanic and atmospheric systems, and disrupting weather and
   hydrological patterns. Climate change poses unprecedented threats to
   human health by impacts on food and water security, heat waves and
   droughts, violent storms, infectious disease, and rising sea levels.
   Whether or not humanity can reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly
   enough to slow climate change to a rate that will allow societies to
   successfully adapt is not yet known. This essay reviews the current
   state of relevant knowledge, and points in a few directions that those
   interested in human health may wish to consider. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Benefits humans rely on from the ocean - marine ecosystem services - are
   increasingly vulnerable under future climate. This paper reviews how
   three valued services have, and will continue to, shift under climate
   change: (1) capture fisheries, (2) food from aquaculture, and (3)
   protection from coastal hazards such as storms and sea-level rise.
   Climate adaptation planning is just beginning for fisheries, aquaculture
   production, and risk mitigation for coastal erosion and inundation. A
   few examples are highlighted, showing the promise of considering
   multiple ecosystem services in developing approaches to adapt to
   sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and rising sea temperatures.
   Ecosystem-based adaptation in fisheries and along coastlines and changes
   in aquaculture practices can improve resilience of species and habitats
   to future environmental challenges. Opportunities to use market
   incentives - such as compensation for services or nutrient trading
   schemes - are relatively untested in marine systems. Relocation of
   communities in response to rising sea levels illustrates the urgent need
   to manage human activities and investments in ecosystems to provide a
   sustainable flow of benefits in the face of future climate change. (C)

Title = {Social Resilience and Commercial Fishers' Responses to Management
   Changes in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Understanding how social resilience influences resource users' responses
   to policy change is important for ensuring the sustainability of
   social-ecological systems and resource-dependent communities. We use the
   conceptualization and operationalization of social resilience proposed
   by Marshall and Marshall (2007) to investigate how resilience level
   influenced commercial fishers' perceptions about and adaptation to the
   2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We conducted
   face-to-face interviews with 114 commercial and charter fishers to
   measure their social resilience level and their responses and adaptation
   strategies to the 2004 zoning plan. Fishers with higher resilience were
   more likely to believe that the zoning plan was necessary, more likely
   to be supportive of the plan, and more likely to have adapted their
   fishing business and fishing activity to the plan than were fishers with
   lower social resilience. High-resilience fishers were also less likely
   to perceive negative impacts of the plan on their fishing business, less
   likely to have negative attitudes toward the consultation process used
   to develop and implement the plan, and less likely to have applied for
   financial compensation under the structural adjustment program. Results
   confirm the utility of the social resilience construct for identifying
   fishers who are likely to be vulnerable to changes, and those who are
   struggling to cope with change events. We conclude that managing for
   social resilience in the GBR would aid in the design and implementation
   of policies that minimize the impacts on resource users and lead to more
   inclusive and sustainable management, but that further research is
   necessary to better understand social resilience, how it can be fostered
   and sustained, and how it can be effectively incorporated into
   management.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors of global
   society. Agricultural production continues to expand into forest lands
   and marginal crop areas, in an attempt to keep pace with the
   ever-increasing world population. Environmental damage is increasing,
   including erosion, salinity, desertification, deforestation, threats, to
   biodiversity, and water scarcity. Moreover, climate change/variability
   is having a profound influence on agroecosystems, posing serious threats
   to food security, human, health, and protection of the environment.
   Thus, comprehensive agrometeorological adaptation policy guidelines,
   focusing on preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation measures to support
   sustainable agricultural development, are needed to cope with the
   impacts of climate change/variability. Adaptation policy can not be an
   effective ``stand alone{''} strategy, but should be incorporated into a
   broader policy objective. For example, adaptation to climate change
   should be a part of a broader socio-economic policy such as
   agricultural, forest, water resources, natural resources, or
   coastal-zone management policy. Poorer countries that will require
   resources to improve capacity in order to cope with impacts, undertake
   specific adaptation measures.},

   shoreline protection},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {228},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Coastal protection measures and management play an important role in
   coping with coastal disasters and climate-induced sea-level rise. In
   this study, the success and failure of typical coastal protection works
   of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) are reported and documented from
   field observations over a study period of 10-15 years. The coastal
   protection structures evaluated include revetments, geotubes, t-shaped
   bamboo fences, Pile-rock breakwaters, Busadco's breakwaters,
   Semi-Circular breakwaters, and Hollow triangle breakwaters. This paper
   briefly reviews the current situation of coastline erosion problem and
   accretion in the VMD and illustrates the severity of the current erosion
   rate that threatens the safety of coastal communities. The paper then
   evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various coastal management
   approaches currently in practice in the VMD to classify different types
   of possible measures for coastal management with the aim to find
   holistic measures for planning which require low construction
   investment. Integrated coastal management and planning are outlined at a
   regional scale followed by the lessons learned from the previous coastal
   protection works, and finally the multiple lines of defense (MLD)
   solution is proposed, which is a green infrastructure inspired
   nature-based solution. The MLD solution can improve biodiversity,
   facilitate mangrove forest restoration, and ensure sustainable
   livelihoods for local communities. Integrated coastal planning and
   management solutions that are based on the MLD principle are expected to
   withstand coastal disasters under future climate change, and sea-level
   rise on the VMD.},

Abstract = {We explored the impacts of fertilization on soil greenhouse gas fluxes
   and underlying soil nutrient transformations using short-term (up to 7
   months) simulated operational fertilization with urea-nitrogen or
   nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients in lodgepole pine
   (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.), western hemlock
   (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarge.), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forests in British Columbia. Urea appeared to
   be rapidly mineralized to ammonium, and nitrification (relative to
   controls) was only observed at the lodgepole pine site and represented
   only 0.5 \% of added nitrogen. All sites were small net sinks for
   atmospheric methane, and fertilization effects, both stimulatory and
   inhibitory, were short-lived. Across all sites and treatments, soils
   were as likely to consume as emit nitrous oxide, and among treatment
   replicates, rates were never significantly different from 0, with the
   exception of one efflux rate of 1.5 mu g.m(-2).h(-1) on the warmest day
   in the study. We conclude from this pilot study that in acidic,
   unpolluted (with regard to nitrogen deposition) upland conifer forest
   soils in western Canada fertilized once or infrequently with urea,
   ammonium, or a combination of nutrients, the dynamics of soil
   greenhouse-gas fluxes are generally not disturbed over the short-term,
   with soils remaining small sinks for atmospheric methane and neutral
   with regard to flux of nitrous oxide.},

Title = {In-situ measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from a coastal estuarine
   wetland using a novel continuous monitoring technology: Comparison of
   indigenous and exotic plant species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {281},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {This study investigated in-situ the seasonal and diurnal variation of
   emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from both indigenous and exotic
   plant species and different environments in the Kaomei Estuary Wetland
   in central Taiwan with a self-designed non-dispersive infrared
   monitoring system. This study computed CO2 equivalent (CO2-e) emissions
   to identify their contribution to global warming. The net primary
   production and carbon sequestration were then estimated to determine the
   carbon budget of the coastal estuarine wetland. It concluded that the
   Kaomei Estuary Wetland functioned as a GHG source and a carbon sink. A
   significant diurnal variation of GHG emissions was observed, with
   generally lower daytime CO2 emissions than those at nighttime, while an
   opposite trend was observed for CH4 and N2O emissions. High solar
   radiation in the daytime enhanced the CO2 uptake by plant species via
   photosynthesis, and also accelerated the microbial activities in waters
   and soil/mud, both resulting in the decrease in atmospheric CO2
   concentration. The highest GHG emissions were observed in summer,
   followed by fall, spring, and winter. Although the concentrations of GHG
   emissions from the coastal estuarine wetland were in the order as CO2
   >CH4>N2O, N2O has the highest impact on global warming. Biomass debris
   played an important role in carbon sequestration, which is stored in
   soils and muds and stimulated methanogenic bacteria to emit CH4. Tidal
   fluctuation and sewage discharge brought nitrogen-containing organics to
   the coastal estuarine wetland, resulting in high emission of N2O from
   nitrification and denitrification processes. Two vascular plants,
   Spartina alterniflora, and Phragmites australis emitted more GHGs than
   the other two plant species. However, the highest GHG emissions from the
   Kaomei Estuary Wetland was attributed to Bolboschoenus planiculmis due
   to its largest coverage area. The annual net primary production (NPP)
   varied mainly with vegetation coverage and season. The exotic Spartina
   alterniflora had the highest annual NPP compared to the indigenous plant
   species because of its high nutrient uptake from the soil/mud by its
   thriving roots.},

Title = {Biomass production in agroforestry and forestry systems on salt-affected
   soils in South Asia: Exploration of the GHG balance and economic
   performance of three case studies},

Abstract = {This study explores the greenhouse gas balance and the economic
   performance (i.e. net present value (NPV) and production costs) of
   agroforestry and forestry systems on salt-affected soils (biosaline
   (agro) forestry) based on three case studies in South Asia. The economic
   impact of trading carbon credits generated by biosaline (agro)forestry
   is also assessed as a potential additional source of income. The
   greenhouse gas balance shows carbon sequestration over the plantation
   lifetime of 24 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) in a rice-Eucalyptus camaldulensis
   agroforestry system on moderately saline soils in coastal Bangladesh
   (case study 1), 6 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) in the rice-wheat- Eucalyptus
   tereticornis agroforestry system on sodic/saline-sodic soils in Haryana
   state, India (case study 2), and 96 Mg CO2-eq. ha(-1) in the compact
   tree (Acacia nilotica) plantation on saline-sodic soils in Punjab
   province of Pakistan. The NPV at a discount rate of 10\% is 1.1 k(sic)
   ha(-1) for case study 1, 4.8 k(sic) ha(-1) for case study 2, and 2.8
   k(sic) ha(-1) for case study 3. Carbon sequestration translates into
   economic values that increase the NPV by 1-12\% in case study 1, 0.1
   -1\% in case study 2, and 2-24\% in case study 3 depending on the carbon
   credit price (1-15 (sic) Mg-1 CO2-eq.). The analysis of the three cases
   indicates that the economic performance strongly depends on the type and
   severity of salt-affectedness (which affect the type and setup of the
   agroforestry system, the tree species and the biomass yield), markets
   for wood products, possibility of trading carbon credits, and discount
   rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The dangerous effects of burning fossil fuels on global warming,
   alternative energy sources will become indeed important in the future.
   Because of fossil fuels energy sources shall run out by the early 22nd
   century given the present rate of consumption. Atmospheric concentration
   of greenhouse gases is trapping heat radiated from the Earth's surface,
   which cause global warming and environmental problems such as
   greenhouses effect, stratospheric ozone depletion, acid precipitation,
   and flooding of coastal settlements. This implies that sooner or later
   humanity will rely heavily on renewable energy sources. Here we have
   introduced light energy at an idealized large-scale application to
   produce solar energy, where exterior skin and roof of buildings shall be
   at least 25\% blackbody-assisted photovoltaic to capture solar energy
   during the whole year. Simply, it is a calculative reaction of solar
   irradiance on innovative building design to capture sunlight most
   efficiently that would be the cutting edge technology for the ultimate
   solution of global energy, environment, and climate crisis. Copyright

Title = {Resolving environmental issues in the southern Brazilian artisanal
   penaeid-trawl fishery through adaptive co-management},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many conventional management strategies have been demonstrated to be
   ineffective in achieving sustainable fisheries, and new approaches are
   required to overcome existing environmental, social and economic
   problems. Adaptive co-management represents the combination of a
   learning-by-doing approach (adaptive management) involving all related
   and legitimate stakeholders in the decision-making process
   (collaborative management). In this study, the relevant experiences from
   a fishery in southern Brazil are reported. The first section of the
   paper summarizes the broad history of national fisheries and their
   management. Then the southern Brazilian artisanal penaeid-trawl fishery
   is briefly described and the three main problems associated with the
   common gears used are discussed, including their (1) poor size and
   species selectivities, (2) poor efficiencies, and (3) their mechanical
   impacts on benthic habitats. Finally, a framework is proposed to address
   the environmental and socioeconomic issues in the fishery and its
   implementation discussed via an adaptive co-management approach. (C)

Title = {Application of Monitoring Network Design and Feedback Information for
   Adaptive Management of Coastal Groundwater Resources},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Optimal strategies for the management of coastal groundwater resources
   can be derived using coupled simulation-optimization based management
   models. However, the management strategy actually implemented on the
   field sometimes deviates from the recommended optimal strategy,
   resulting in field-level deviations. Monitoring these field-level
   deviations during actual implementation of the recommended optimal
   management strategy and sequentially updating the management model using
   the feedback information is an important step towards efficient adaptive
   management of coastal groundwater resources. In this study, a
   three-phase adaptive management framework for a coastal aquifer
   subjected to saltwater intrusion is applied and evaluated for a
   regional-scale coastal aquifer study area. The methodology adopted
   includes three sequential components. First, an optimal management
   strategy (consisting of groundwater extraction from production and
   barrier wells) is derived and implemented forptimal management of the
   aquifer. The implemented management strategy is obtained by solving a
   homogenous ensemble-based coupled simulation-optimization model. Second,
   a regional-scale optimal monitoring network is designed for the aquifer
   system considering possible user noncompliance of a recommended
   management strategy, and uncertainties in estimating aquifer parameters.
   A new monitoring network design objective function is formulated to
   ensure that candidate monitoring wells are placed in high risk (highly
   contaminated) locations. In addition, a new methodology is utilized to
   select candidate monitoring wells in areas representative of the entire
   model domain. Finally, feedback information in the form of measured
   concentrations obtained from the designed optimal monitoring wells is
   used to sequentially modify pumping strategies for future time periods
   in the management horizon. The developed adaptive management framework
   is evaluated by applying it to the Bonriki aquifer system located in
   Kiribati, which is a small developing island country in the South
   Pacific region. Overall, the results from this study suggest that the
   implemented adaptive management strategy has the potential to address
   important practical implementation issues arising due to noncompliance
   of an optimal management strategy and uncertain aquifer parameters.},

Title = {If Anthropogenic CO2 Emissions Cease, Will Atmospheric CO2 Concentration
   Continue to Increase?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {23},
Pages = {9563-9576},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {If anthropogenic CO2 emissions were to suddenly cease, the evolution of
   the atmospheric CO2 concentration would depend on the magnitude and sign
   of natural carbon sources and sinks. Experiments using Earth system
   models indicate that the overall carbon sinks dominate, such that upon
   the cessation of anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric CO2 levels
   decrease over time. However, these models have typically neglected the
   permafrost carbon pool, which has the potential to introduce an
   additional terrestrial source of carbon to the atmosphere. Here, the
   authors use the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic
   ESCM), which has recently been expanded to include permafrost carbon
   stocks and exchanges with the atmosphere. In a scenario of zeroed CO2
   and sulfate aerosol emissions, whether the warming induced by specified
   constant concentrations of non-CO2 greenhouse gases could slow the CO2
   decline following zero emissions or even reverse this trend and cause
   CO2 to increase over time is assessed. It is found that a radiative
   forcing from non-CO2 gases of approximately 0.6 W m(-2) results in a
   near balance of CO2 emissions from the terrestrial biosphere and uptake
   of CO2 by the oceans, resulting in near-constant atmospheric CO2
   concentrations for at least a century after emissions are eliminated. At
   higher values of non-CO2 radiative forcing, CO2 concentrations increase
   over time, regardless of when emissions cease during the twenty-first
   century. Given that the present-day radiative forcing from non-CO2
   greenhouse gases is about 0.95 W m(-2), the results suggest that if all
   CO2 and aerosols emissions were eliminated without also decreasing
   non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions CO2 levels would increase over time,
   resulting in a small increase in climate warming associated with this
   positive permafrost-carbon feedback.},

Title = {Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {{[}1] Wetlands represent the largest component of the terrestrial
   biological carbon pool and thus play an important role in global carbon
   cycles. Most global carbon budgets, however, have focused on dry land
   ecosystems that extend over large areas and have not accounted for the
   many small, scattered carbon-storing ecosystems such as tidal saline
   wetlands. We compiled data for 154 sites in mangroves and salt marshes
   from the western and eastern Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as the
   Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico. The set of sites
   spans a latitudinal range from 22.4degreesS in the Indian Ocean to
   55.5degrees N in the northeastern Atlantic. The average soil carbon
   density of mangrove swamps (0.055 +/- 0.004 g cm(-3)) is significantly
   higher than the salt marsh average (0.039 +/- 0.003 g cm(-3)). Soil
   carbon density in mangrove swamps and Spartina patens marshes declines
   with increasing average annual temperature, probably due to increased
   decay rates at higher temperatures. In contrast, carbon sequestration
   rates were not significantly different between mangrove swamps and salt
   marshes. Variability in sediment accumulation rates within marshes is a
   major control of carbon sequestration rates masking any relationship
   with climatic parameters. Globally, these combined wetlands store at
   least 44.6 Tg C yr(-1) and probably more, as detailed areal inventories
   are not available for salt marshes in China and South America. Much
   attention has been given to the role of freshwater wetlands,
   particularly northern peatlands, as carbon sinks. In contrast to
   peatlands, salt marshes and mangroves release negligible amounts of
   greenhouse gases and store more carbon per unit area.},

Abstract = {In this study, we conducted a literature review of relevant research and
   then statistically analyzed global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
   natural systems, including forest fires, oceans, wetlands, permafrost,
   mud volcanoes, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Drawing on the Global Carbon
   Project (GCP) report, we also summarized the global anthropogenic GHG
   emissions. We then compared the global annual GHG emissions from natural
   systems with those generated by human activity. The results indicate
   that the global annual GHG emissions range approximately between 54.33
   and 75.50 Gt CO2-eq, of which natural emissions account for 18.13-39.30
   Gt CO2-eq, with the most likely value being approximately 29.07 Gt
   CO2-eq. According to the GCP report, the global anthropogenic emissions
   have increased from 22 Gt CO2-eq in 1990 to 36.2 Gt CO2-eq in 2016. The
   amounts of natural and anthropogenic GHGs emissions are roughly of the
   same order of magnitude. Anthropogenic emissions account for
   approximately 55.46\% of the total global GHGs emissions (2016 value),
   i.e., the ratio of natural to anthropogenic emissions is approximately
   0.8. In addition, the annual amount of GHGs absorbed by Earth systems
   (ocean and terrestrial ecosystems) ranges between approximately 14.4 Gt
   CO2-eq and 26.5 Gt CO2-eq, with natural system GHG emissions and sinks
   also having roughly the same order of magnitude. This finding indicates
   that the GHG emissions generated by human activity exert extra pressure
   on what is otherwise a self-balancing Earth system.},

Abstract = {Traditional biomass remains the dominant contributor to the energy
   supply of a large number of developing countries, where it serves the
   household energy needs of over a third of humanity in traditional
   cookstoves or open fires. Efforts to reduce the enormous human health,
   socioeconomic, and environmental impacts by shifting to cleaner
   cookstoves and cleaner biomass-derived fuels have had some success, but
   much more needs to be done, possibly including the expanded use of
   fossil-derived fuels. Concurrently, biomass is rapidly expanding as a
   commercial energy source, especially for transport fuels. Bioenergy can
   positively contribute to climate goals and rural livelihoods; however,
   if not implemented carefully, it could exacerbate degradation of land,
   water bodies, and ecosystems; reduce food security; and increase
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For large-scale commercial biofuels to
   contribute to sustainable development will require agriculturally
   sustainable methods and markets that provide enhanced livelihood
   opportunities and equitable terms of trade. The challenge lies in
   translating the opportunity into reality.},

Title = {A global perspective on African climate},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {90},
Number = {4},
Pages = {359-383},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We describe the global climate system context in which to interpret
   African environmental change to support planning and implementation of
   policymaking action at national, regional and continental scales, and to
   inform the debate between proponents of mitigation v. adaptation
   strategies in the face of climate change. We review recent advances and
   current challenges in African climate research and exploit our physical
   understanding of variability and trends to shape our outlook on future
   climate change. We classify the various mechanisms that have been
   proposed as relevant for understanding variations in African rainfall,
   emphasizing a ``tropospheric stabilization{''} mechanism that is of
   importance on interannual time scales as well as for the future response
   to warming oceans. Two patterns stand out in our analysis of twentieth
   century rainfall variability: a drying of the monsoon regions, related
   to warming of the tropical oceans, and variability related to the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation. The latest generation of climate models
   partly captures this recent continent-wide drying trend, attributing it
   to the combination of anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and greenhouse
   gases, the relative contribution of which is difficult to quantify with
   the existing model archive. The same climate models fail to reach a
   robust agreement regarding the twenty-first century outlook for African
   rainfall, in a future with increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing
   aerosol loadings. Such uncertainty underscores current limitations in
   our understanding of the global climate system that it is necessary to
   overcome if science is to support Africa in meeting its development
   goals.},

Abstract = {Most studies on greenhouse gas emissions from animals concentrated on
   domestic animals, with limited data available from wild animals. The
   number of marine animals is potentially large in coastal Antarctica. In
   this paper, N2O and CH4 emissions were investigated from a penguin
   colony, a seal colony, a skua colony, the adjacent animal-lacking
   tundra, and background tundra sites to test the effects of marine
   animals on their fluxes in maritime Antarctica. Extremely high N2O
   emissions occurred in the penguin puddles (mean 392 mu g N2O m(-2)
   h(-1)) and seal wallows (mean 579 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)). The N2O
   emissions from animal colony tundra (13-57 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)) are
   much higher than those from the animal-lacking tundra, whereas the
   background tundra showed negligible N2O fluxes. Penguin puddles and seal
   wallows were stronger CH4 emitters than animal colony tundra soils,
   while animal-lacking tundra soils were strong CH4 sinks. Overall high
   N2O and CH4 emissions were modulated by soil physical and chemical
   processes associated with marine animal activities: sufficient supply of
   the nutrients NH4+-N and NO3--N, total nitrogen, and total organic
   carbon from marine animal excreta, animal tramp, and high soil
   water-filled pore space. Laboratory incubation experiments further
   confirmed that penguin and seal colony soils produced much higher N2O
   and CH4 emissions than animal-lacking tundra soils. Our results indicate
   that marine animal colonies are the hot spots for N2O and CH4 emissions
   in maritime Antarctica, and even at the global scale, and current
   climate warming will further increase their emissions.},

Abstract = {There are several opportunities for Renewable Energy Sources (RES),
   within the new climate change regime as they meet the two basic
   conditions to be eligible under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
   RES contribute to global sustainability through greenhouse gas (GHG)
   mitigation and, they conform to national priorities by leading to the
   enhancement of local economic activity, capacities and infrastructure.
   However, RES knowledge regarding their benefits, needs and priorities is
   not easily fed into the developing countries' decision-making process,
   since it is not provided to all relevant stakeholders in a structured
   and transparent way. The main scope of this paper is an exploratory
   analysis of five renewable energy options, namely Hydro, Wind, Solar,
   Geothermal and Ocean energy, in terms of their status in the developed
   world and their potential and perspectives for deployment in the
   developing world. Particular emphasis will be laid on the emerging
   opportunities for sustainable technology transfer under the umbrella of
   the CDM. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Many believe that conservation tillage practices could increase the
   sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide into agricultural soils and
   this sequestered carbon may partially offset the greenhouse gas effect
   and thus reduce the impact of global warming. Recent advances in soil
   carbon (C) and greenhouse gas analysis have made it possible to evaluate
   the impacts of conservation tillage on C sequestration from various
   perspectives. Although conservation tillage favors soil and water
   conservation, there are biased estimates of C sequestration associated
   with conservation tillage, and it is particularly an issue for a pure
   no-tillage (NT) system. Accordingly, this paper presents an overview of
   the progress achieved in evaluating C sequestration in no-till (the
   extreme type of conservation tillage) and conventional tillage
   production systems. In addition to extended discussion of how soil
   sampling and calculations could influence the estimates of C gains or
   losses in no-till versus conventional tilled soil, this review will also
   focus on following aspects, including (1) the impact of NT on crop
   yields which governs organic C inputs to soil from crop residue, (2) the
   impact of NT on soil organic C mineralization which is a major pathway
   of soil C output, and (3) the roles of the initial levels of C stocks
   and soil erosion rates which are crucial for estimating soil C
   sequestration under different tillage systems. Many soil C studies have
   indicated that the impacts of NT on soil C sequestration are compounded
   by many factors and should not be generalized.},

Abstract = {Hybrid energies interest many companies and countries. No form of
   electricity production is optimal in all situations. The wind and the
   sun are intermittent but do not consume fuel and do not emit greenhouse
   gases. Natural gas electricity production emits greenhouse gases but is
   distributable (i.e. it has a yield that can be easily controlled between
   maximum values of nominal capacity or reduced to zero) to help balance
   supply and demand. Hydroelectric power often requires and devotes large
   areas, but is renewable and distributable. However, the realization of
   all these projects remains dependent on the development of more
   efficient and more economical electrical energy storage systems. Hybrid
   power plants: a solution for the future? To provide energy that is more
   affordable, more reliable, and more sustainable. AI, smart grid {[}6]
   and Energy storage: The dynamics of new energies, that is to say, local
   and renewable, are indeed launched. To succeed in this revolution, the
   problem of storing renewable energies, due to their intermittent nature,
   remains to be resolved. Machine learning and neural networks play an
   important role in improving forecasts in the energy industry.},

Abstract = {Obtaining energy from renewable resources is a powerful measure in
   eliminating the impact of greenhouse gas and environmental pollution. At
   present, only 20\% of energy comes from renewable energy sources, such
   as wind, solar, ocean, biomass, and geothermal energy. Sea water is the
   most abundant natural resource, accounting for more than 97\% of total
   water resources. From a practical standpoint, it is very desirable to
   use seawater for conversion and energy production. Salinity gradient
   energy is the chemical potential energy difference between two kinds of
   water with different salt concentrations. It has a large energy density
   and is considered to be the most promising ocean energy. Here, we
   discuss the important features of energy production technologies with
   salinity gradient energy. The principles and related materials and
   important finding of the available technologies, such as
   pressure-retarded osmosis, reverse electro-dialysis, capacitive mixing,
   concentration capacitor, and mixing entropy battery, have been described
   in this review. We also found that the current research mainly uses
   seawater to harvest salinity gradient energy. Because of its high
   concentration, the salinity gradient energy of salt lake brine is
   larger, it can be researched by further experiments.},

Title = {Detection and Characterization of Low Temperature Peat Fires during the
   2015 Fire Catastrophe in Indonesia Using a New High-Sensitivity Fire
   Monitoring Satellite Sensor (FireBird)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Vast and disastrous fires occurred on Borneo during the 2015 dry season,
   pushing Indonesia into the top five carbon emitting countries. The
   region was affected by a very strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   climate phenomenon, on par with the last severe event in 1997/98. Fire
   dynamics in Central Kalimantan were investigated using an innovative
   sensor offering higher sensitivity to a wider range of fire intensities
   at a finer spatial resolution (160 m) than heretofore available. The
   sensor is onboard the TET-1 satellite, part of the German Aerospace
   Center (DLR) FireBird mission. TET-1 images (acquired every 2-3 days)
   from the middle infrared were used to detect fires continuously burning
   for almost three weeks in the protected peatlands of Sebangau National
   Park as well as surrounding areas with active logging and oil palm
   concessions. TET-1 detection capabilities were compared with MODIS
   active fire detection and Landsat burned area algorithms. Fire dynamics,
   including fire front propagation speed and area burned, were
   investigated. We show that TET-1 has improved detection capabilities
   over MODIS in monitoring low-intensity peatland fire fronts through
   thick smoke and haze. Analysis of fire dynamics revealed that the
   largest burned areas resulted from fire front lines started from
   multiple locations, and the highest propagation speeds were in excess of
   500 m/day (all over peat > 2m deep). Fires were found to occur most
   often in concessions that contained drainage infrastructure but were not
   cleared prior to the fire season. Benefits of implementing this sensor
   system to improve current fire management techniques are discussed. Near
   real-time fire detection together with enhanced fire behavior monitoring
   capabilities would not only improve firefighting efforts, but also
   benefit analysis of fire impact on tropical peatlands, greenhouse gas
   emission estimations as well as mitigation measures to reduce severe
   fire events in the future.},

Title = {Changes in global-mean precipitation in response to warming, greenhouse
   gas forcing and black carbon},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Precipitation changes are a key driver of climate change impacts. On
   average, global precipitation is expected to increase with warming.
   However, model projections show that precipitation does not scale
   linearly with surface air temperature. Instead, global hydrological
   sensitivity, the relative change of global-mean precipitation per degree
   of global warming, seems to vary across different scenarios and even
   with time. Based on output from 20 coupled
   Atmosphere-Ocean-General-Circulation-Models for up to 7 different
   scenarios, we discuss to what extent these variations can be explained
   by changes in the tropospheric energy budget. Our analysis supports
   earlier findings that long-and shortwave absorbers initially decrease
   global-mean precipitation. Including these absorbers into a multivariate
   scaling approach allows to closely reproduce the simulated global-mean
   precipitation changes. We find a sensitivity of global-mean
   precipitation to tropospheric greenhouse gas forcing of -0.42 +/-
   0.23\%/(W/m(2)) ( uncertainty given as one std of inter-model
   variability) and to black carbon emissions of -0.07 +/- 0.02\%/(Mt/yr).
   In combination with these two predictors the dominant longer-term effect
   of surface air temperatures on precipitation is estimated to be 2.2 +/-
   0.52\%/K - much lower than the 6.5\%/K that may be expected from the
   Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Citation: Frieler, K., M. Meinshausen,

Abstract = {The call for concerted global action against the climate change impact
   is well heard. 191 countries would communicate their progressive plans
   through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as signatories to the
   Paris Agreement. Harbour crafts as part of the larger maritime
   ecosystem, can significantly contribute to reduced emissions. In this
   paper, HyForce, the next generation 2 MW hydrogen powered virtual
   tugboat was designed for a feasibility assessment for her
   techno-economic and environmental footprint to replace existing
   diesel-powered tugboats. The study compares the use of hydrogen fuel
   cells and an internal combustion engine to perform the same dynamic load
   profile for a typical tugboat mission. The results from the study show
   that a signpost for commercial competitiveness of HyForce is influenced
   primarily by the projected liquid hydrogen cost of 5.10 USD per kg in
   2040 with a 2,000 USD/kW capital cost for the fuel cells. Greenhouse Gas
   (GHG) emissions from a ``well-to-wake{''} analysis for fossil-based
   hydrogen and renewable hydrogen supply chains were conducted, and the
   results show 26.9\% and 75.6\% reduction, respectively, compared to
   similar tug running on diesel fuel. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {This paper proposes an optimal power system model for coastal area of
   Bangladesh where sufficient renewable energy source is available for
   hybrid power generation. The simulation and analysis is performed on a
   highly recognized renewable energy research tool called `HOMER'
   considering the electrical demand of a coastal area, Patenga. Generation
   of electricity from different types of fuel affects on environment
   creating tons of greenhouse gases and thereby causing global warming. In
   this situation, a power system model with shortest possible effect on
   environment is of great interest now a days. Remarkable outline of this
   paper is that the proposed model enable sharing of power between grid
   and power generated from renewable sources which is known as ongrid
   hybrid renewable energy model and thereby reducing the generation cost
   of energy. Another significance of the research is to create a new era
   in the green energy research for coastal area of Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Regional variability in the carbon-cycle response of terrestrial

   The terrestrial net flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the period
   2001-2099, was globally simulated on the basis of greenhouse gas
   emission scenarios (IPCC-SRES), and climate projections by coupled
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Most terrestrial
   ecosystems acted as net carbon sinks but with different magnitudes among
   the experiments (globally, 24 to 286 Pg C). Substantial inter-regional
   variability was found in terrestrial carbon-cycle response, because of
   differences in biome distributions and climate-change regimes. Moreover,
   among the experiments using the same CO2 scenario, but different AOGCM
   climate projections, inconsistent results were obtained in the Amazon
   basin, Africa, Australia, and northern Asia, indicating the need for

Title = {Contributions of Internal Variability and External Forcing to the Recent

Abstract = {In a warming world context, sea surface temperature (SST) off
   central-south Peru, northern Chile, and farther offshore increases at a
   slower rate than the global average since several decades (i.e., cools,
   relative to the global average). This tendency is synchronous with an
   interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) negative trend since similar to
   1980, which has a cooling signature in the southeastern Pacific. Here,
   we use a large ensemble of historical coupled model simulations to
   investigate the relative roles of internal variability (and in
   particular the IPO) and external forcing in driving this relative
   regional cooling, and the associated mechanisms. The ensemble mean
   reproduces the relative cooling, in response to an externally forced
   southerly wind anomaly, which strengthens the upwelling off Chile in
   recent decades. This southerly wind anomaly results from the poleward
   expansion of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell. Attribution
   experiments reveal that this poleward expansion and the resulting
   enhanced upwelling mostly occur in response to increasing greenhouse
   gases and stratospheric ozone depletion since similar to 1980. An
   oceanic heat budget confirms that the wind-forced upwelling enhancement
   dominates the relative cooling near the coast. In contrast, a
   wind-forced deepening of the mixed layer drives the offshore cooling.
   While internal variability contributes to the spread of tendencies, the
   ensemble-mean relative cooling in the southeastern Pacific is consistent
   with observations and occurs irrespectively of the IPO phase, hence,
   indicating the preeminent role of external forcing.},

Title = {The dynamics of architectural complexity on coral reefs under climate
   change},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {223-235},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {One striking feature of coral reef ecosystems is the complex benthic
   architecture which supports diverse and abundant fauna, particularly of
   reef fish. Reef-building corals are in decline worldwide, with a
   corresponding loss of live coral cover resulting in a loss of
   architectural complexity. Understanding the dynamics of the reef
   architecture is therefore important to envision the ability of corals to
   maintain functional habitats in an era of climate change. Here, we
   develop a mechanistic model of reef topographical complexity for
   contemporary Caribbean reefs. The model describes the dynamics of corals
   and other benthic taxa under climate-driven disturbances (hurricanes and
   coral bleaching). Corals have a simplified shape with explicit diameter
   and height, allowing species-specific calculation of their colony
   surface and volume. Growth and the mechanical (hurricanes) and
   biological erosion (parrotfish) of carbonate skeletons are important in
   driving the pace of extension/reduction in the upper reef surface, the
   net outcome being quantified by a simple surface roughness index (reef
   rugosity). The model accurately simulated the decadal changes of coral
   cover observed in Cozumel (Mexico) between 1984 and 2008, and provided a
   realistic hindcast of coral colony-scale (1-10m) changing rugosity over
   the same period. We then projected future changes of Caribbean reef
   rugosity in response to global warming. Under severe and frequent
   thermal stress, the model predicted a dramatic loss of rugosity over the
   next two or three decades. Critically, reefs with managed parrotfish
   populations were able to delay the general loss of architectural
   complexity, as the benefits of grazing in maintaining living coral
   outweighed the bioerosion of dead coral skeletons. Overall, this model
   provides the first explicit projections of reef rugosity in a warming
   climate, and highlights the need of combining local (protecting and
   restoring high grazing) to global (mitigation of greenhouse gas
   emissions) interventions for the persistence of functional reef
   habitats.},

Abstract = {There is a worldwide compromise toward increasing the proportion of
   renewable energy in future electricity production to mitigate the
   impacts of greenhouse gases. This study explores the sustainability of
   wave energy resources in the northern part of the Gulf of Oman,
   considering the impact of climate change using a Shared Socio-economic
   Pathway (SSP5-8.5) representing a high increase in CO2 concentration by
   2100. Near-surface wind speed dataset from a high-resolution CNRM
   (CNRM-CM6-1-HR) global climate model was employed to force a
   third-generation wave model. A novel statistical bias-correction
   technique was developed based on Weibull distribution to generate
   high-resolution input wind for the wave model, and various criteria were
   employed to assess the sustainability of the wave energy in the study
   area. Comparing future projections of wave energy under SSP5-8.5 with
   those of historical simulations demonstrated the sustainability of the
   wave resources in the study area. The methodology of utilizing multiple
   criteria assessments, including accessibility, availability, and
   exploitable storage of wave energy predicts an increase ranging from 21
   to 45\% in the future wave power under a high emission scenario.},

Abstract = {Pakistan is facing a somber power crisis due to lessening of
   conventional energy sources of energy. There is a large gap between
   demand and supply of electricity, which is about 2.5-5 GW, registering a
   shortfall of more than 20\%. Alertness of global warming and climate
   changes menacing the earth noticeably, we are all responsible to evade
   exploitation of fuel energy, particularly CO2 emitting. The need for
   exploring alternative, environmental-friendly, and renewable energy
   resources has therefore become more foreseeable.
   Tidal power is the clean and white energy technology, which is available
   at no fuel cost and minimal running cost. The coastline of Pakistan,
   which is about 1,045 km long with dominant features, is the best
   resource for harnessing tidal energy. The tidal energy resources present
   in the oceans are of much higher density and better reliability than any
   other renewable for the likely future. Though tidal power is predictable
   and available in the form of blocks of energy, it may not solve the
   energy crisis, but can decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. It can
   spread our energy resources and meet stringent greenhouse gas emission
   targets.
   The chapter presents the assessment of tidal power harnessing
   technologies and selection of suitable technology for Pakistan. Despite
   the fact that tidal power has not yet been introduced in Pakistan
   compared to other renewable energy technologies, but in near future it
   may play a key role. The study concludes that the tidal stream power
   technology is the best technology for tidal pilot power plants in the
   coastal creeks of Pakistan.},

Title = {A Scaling Approach to Probabilistic Assessment of Regional Climate
   Change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {9},

Abstract = {A new approach to probabilistic projections of regional climate change
   is introduced. It builds on the already established quasi-linear
   relation between global-mean temperature and regional climate change
   found in atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). The new
   approach simultaneously 1) takes correlations between temperature- and
   precipitation-related uncertainty distributions into account, 2) enables
   the inclusion of predictors other than global-mean temperature, and 3)
   checks for the interscenario and interrun variability of the scaling
   relationships. This study tests the effectiveness of SOx and black
   carbon emissions and greenhouse gas forcings as additional predictors of
   precipitation changes. The future precipitation response is found to
   deviate substantially from the linear relationship with global-mean
   temperature change in some regions; thereby, the two main limitations of
   a simple linear scaling approach, namely having to rely on exogenous
   aerosol experiments (or ignoring their regional effect), and ignoring
   changes in scaling coefficients when approaching equilibrium conditions,
   are addressed. The additional predictors can markedly improve the
   emulation of AOGCM simulations. In some regions, variations in
   hydrological sensitivity (the percentage change of precipitation per
   degree of warming) across different scenarios can be reduced by more
   than 50\%. Coupled to probabilistic projections of global-mean
   temperatures and greenhouse gas forcings, bidimensional distributions of
   regional temperature and precipitation changes accounting for multiple
   uncertainties are derived. Based on 20 Fourth Assessment Report AOGCMs
   (AR4 AOGCMs), probabilistic projections are provided for two
   representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and 31 world
   regions (online database at
   www.pik-potsdam.de/primap/regional\_temp\_and\_precip). As an example
   application of the projections for climate adaptation and vulnerability
   studies, future changes in the surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice
   Sheet are computed.},

Title = {An inter-regional assessment of concentrations and delta C-13 values of

Journal = {AQUATIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide emissions from lakes are relevant for
   assessing the greenhouse gas output of wetlands. However, only few
   standardized datasets describe concentrations of these gases in lakes
   across different geographical regions. We studied concentrations and
   stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of CH4 and dissolved
   inorganic carbon (DIC) in 32 small lakes from Finland, Sweden, Germany,
   the Netherlands, and Switzerland in late summer. Higher concentrations
   and delta C-13 values of DIC were observed in calcareous lakes than in
   lakes on non-calcareous areas. In stratified lakes, delta C-13 values of
   DIC were generally lower in the hypolimnion due to the degradation of
   organic matter (OM). Unexpectedly, increased delta C-13 values of DIC
   were registered above the sediment in several lakes. This may reflect
   carbonate dissolution in calcareous lakes or methanogenesis in deepwater
   layers or in the sediments. Surface water CH4 concentrations were
   generally higher in western and central European lakes than in
   Fennoscandian lakes, possibly due to higher CH4 production in the
   littoral sediments and lateral transport, whereas CH4 concentrations in
   the hypolimnion did not differ significantly between the regions. The
   delta C-13 values of CH4 in the sediment suggest that delta C-13 values
   of biogenic CH4 are not necessarily linked to delta C-13 values of
   sedimentary OM but may be strongly influenced by OM quality and
   methanogenic pathway. Our study suggests that CH4 and DIC cycling in
   small lakes differ between geographical regions and that this should be
   taken into account when regional studies on greenhouse gas emissions are
   upscaled to inter-regional scales.},

Abstract = {The loss and deterioration of mangroves would lead to potentially
   important greenhouse gases (GHG) from the mangrove ecosystem. Seasonal
   variations of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes are studied
   in the Indian part of the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem. Considering the
   importance of CH4 and CO2 fluxes, a dynamic model is proposed here with
   CH4 and CO2 as state variables. The data used in the model are collected
   and analysed from the field over two years. The parameters that are
   taken from the literature sources are calibrated in the model.
   Sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the valuable contribution of
   various parameters to the dynamics of CH4 and CO2 emissions from the
   mangrove beds. Model simulation results are appropriately validated with
   the observed data. Results showed that CH4 and CO2 fluxes were higher
   during monsoon. Pearson correlation was done to assess the relationships
   between emissions and all the physical-chemical factors involved in the
   model. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the temperature sensitivity
   (Q(10)) was the system-sensitive parameter for CH4 and CO2 emissions.
   The soil moisture and relative light intensity were the sensitive
   parameters for CH4 and CO2 emissions, respectively. Model showed that
   the increase in the anthropogenic emissions including emissions from
   livestock and fossil fuel caused an increase of 2\% of CH4 and 3\% of
   CO2 in the system, respectively. The proposed model could be a tool for
   environmental managers to assess the emission process at different
   global locations.},

Title = {Uncovering Engagement Networks for Adaptation in Three Regional
   Communities: Empirical Examples from New South Wales, Australia},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change is a significant challenge for policy makers, planners
   and communities. While adaptation responses are generally recognised to
   be place-based, policy processes on adaptation often reside with central
   (state or national) governments that may be remote from regional
   communities. In this paper, we contribute to the literature regarding
   how diverse regional communities engage with planning and policy for
   climate adaptation, which is important for successful implementation. We
   adopt a social network analysis (SNA) approach that enables an
   exploration of the interaction of community networks with policy
   information. There are limited empirical studies of information sharing
   about climate adaptation policy through community knowledge networks.
   One previous study, located in coastal New South Wales, Australia,
   mapped the community's knowledge acquisition and diffusion to reveal the
   underlying network structures that influenced policy engagement
   pathways. However, further studies are needed to determine how the
   features of community networks may change with local context (e.g.,
   coastal versus inland). This paper extends previous studies to compare
   and contrast adaptation knowledge networks in three NSW communities:
   Shoalhaven (the original coastal study site), Bega (coastal) and Orange
   (inland). Findings suggest that the presence of a natural
   resource-dependent industry, local geographies and boundary spanners
   acting as network knowledge brokers are factors influencing community
   knowledge flows. The work further demonstrates the utility of SNA to
   measure knowledge networks that can inform government engagement and
   communication with communities on climate adaptation policy.},

Title = {Comparative analysis of adaptation strategies for coastal climate change
   in North West Europe},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change has experienced a recent rapid increase in
   guides, manuals and strategies, including the EU adaptation strategy of
   2013. However, minimal critical review or evaluation has been done on
   the process and outcomes of adaptation strategies. This work presents a
   comparative analysis of progress towards adaptation strategies in nine
   coastal areas in NW Europe (from Belgium, France, Ireland and UK) where
   the INTERREG IVb IMCORE project was implemented. Adaptation progress was
   evaluated using a suite of indicators in six categories: Relevance,
   Effectiveness, Efficiency, Results \& Impact, Sustainability and
   Management. Data were obtained through a combination of questionnaires
   and interviews. Although a similar IMCORE adaptation process was
   implemented there were notable differences between areas. Two alternate
   modes of implementation were identified: one focused more on impact and
   results and one on institutionalisation and future security of the
   adaptation process. The length of history of collaborative working was
   positively associated with progress in adaptation planning. The results
   thus recommend creation of a base for collaborative working prior to
   undertaking an adaptation initiative. However, this contrasts with the
   EU approach for developing adaptation strategies in which seeking
   agreement with stakeholders responsible for implementation is the
   penultimate stage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adaptation of water management to regional climate change in a coastal
   region - Hydrological change vs. community perception and strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {454},
Pages = {64-75},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {The climate scenarios of the IPCC suggest that adaptation to future
   climate change will be required. The North Sea Region, a marginal sea of
   the Atlantic Ocean between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the
   Netherlands and Belgium, is particularly affected due to rising sea
   level and a changing water balance. Water management plays a key role in
   sustainable management of natural and societal resources. This paper
   presents a participatory study of community approaches to regional
   adaptation to climate change. Water management adaptation options to
   regional climate induced changes until 2050 were developed together with
   stakeholders for the Wesermarsch County (Northern Germany). Available
   information on expected regional climate change and a modelling study on
   hydrological change suggested that adaptation of water management will
   be required until 2050. A regional stakeholder forum formulated a vision
   on how the Wesermarsch should look like in 2050. Following the holistic
   approach of collaborative planning, two stakeholder groups developed an
   adaptation portfolio on how urban and rural areas could adapt their
   water management to cope with the expected changes. Since most of the
   stakeholders do not want the county to undergo significant changes in
   terms of landscape and land use, they proposed technical measures to
   enforce flood protection and enhance the performance of the existing
   water management system. Adaptation in terms of land use change was not
   proposed although information on comparable examples from similar
   regions was available. To justify the proposed adaptation options,
   available information on expected climate change impacts was used
   selectively. Uncertainty in model projections was partly ignored to
   legitimate suggesting inflexible (technical) adaptation measures.
   However, collaborative planning proved to be helpful for a joint
   adaptation to climate change at the regional scale. Stakeholders as well
   as scientists took active part in the participatory learning process as
   required by EU directives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The reduction of greenhouse gases CO2 emission is a growing concern of
   many countries. The geological storage of CO2 is useful and effective
   approaches to reduce CO2 emission. The oil and natural gas industries
   have long commercial practice of CO2 gas injection, enhanced oil
   recovery (CO2-EOR). Because coal seam has strong absorption capacity for
   CO2, the coal seam can be used as CO2 geological storage reservoirs, and
   coal seam has such characteristics that coal seam is preference for CO2
   absorption and postponement for CH4 absorption, CO2 injection into coal
   seam can enhanced coal bed methane recovery, CO2-ECBM, CH4 is a new
   energy generated by methane from CO2 injection into coal seam, and CH4
   is beneficial complement of the energy, CO2 injection into coal seam can
   not only reduce greenhouse gases CO2 emission and but also enhance coal
   bed methane recovery, which is very significance to environment
   protection and energy sustainable development in china.},

Abstract = {Future changes in climate pose significant challenges for society, not
   the least of which is how best to adapt to observed and potential future
   impacts of these changes to which the world is already committed.
   Adaptation is a dynamic social process: the ability of societies to
   adapt is determined, in part, by the ability to act collectively. This
   article reviews emerging perspectives on collective action and social
   capital and argues that insights from these areas inform the nature of
   adaptive capacity and normative prescriptions of policies of adaptation.
   Specifically, social capital is increasingly understood within economics
   to have public and private elements, both of which are based on trust,
   reputation, and reciprocal action. The public-good aspects of particular
   forms of social capital are pertinent elements of adaptive capacity in
   interacting with natural capital and in relation to the performance of
   institutions that cope with the risks of changes in climate. Case
   studies are presented of present-day collective action for coping with
   extremes in weather in coastal areas in Southeast Asia and of
   community-based coastal management in the Caribbean. These cases
   demonstrate the importance of social capital framing both the public and
   private institutions of resource management that build resilience in the
   face of the risks of changes in climate. These cases illustrate, by
   analogy, the nature of adaptation processes and collective action in
   adapting to future changes in climate.},

   County Sanitation District and Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts
   have performed assessments to identify climate threats, assess
   vulnerabilities, and develop resilience measures to adapt existing
   wastewater facilities to climate change. Coastal and inland facilities
   were assessed including six wastewater treatment plants, 16 pump
   stations, and collection systems. Climate threats considered in the
   assessments included flooding, sea level rise, tsunami, wildfire,
   extreme heat, extreme winds, and drought. The collection of climate
   threats, vulnerabilities, and resilience measures have been summarized
   in climate resilience plans, which provide a systematic approach for
   adapting existing infrastructure to climate change. Comparison of
   resilience plans for coastal versus inland facilities identified
   flooding due to sea level rise as the main climate threat for coastal
   facilities while wildfire, localized flooding, and extreme heat posed
   the greatest threat to inland facilities.},

Title = {Polluted waters of the reclaimed islands of Indian Sundarban promote
   more greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove ecosystem},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the
   mangrove ecosystem are causing serious concern. Some of the coastal
   reclaimed islands of Sundarban mangrove ecosystem in India were studied
   for environmental variables and soil-atmosphere fluxes mainly, methane
   (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Gas samples were
   taken from the mangrove bed during three seasons; pre-monsoon, monsoon,
   and post-monsoon. Monsoonal CH4 fluxes were higher than pre- and
   post-monsoon, resulting in a rise in the number of pneumatophores,
   making transpiration easier. CO2 emission was higher in monsoon due to
   increased microbial soil respiration. Whereas N2O fluxes were higher in
   pre-monsoon followed by monsoon and post-monsoon period because of a
   higher denitrifying rates as a function of soil temperature. Considering
   the importance of GHG fluxes, an ANN (artificial neural networking)
   model is proposed for forecasting and sensitivity analysis of different
   environmental variables and GHG emissions. The most sensitive
   environmental factor was the soil nitrate content affecting the GHG
   emissions. Principal component analysis showed that the litterfall
   biomass was strongly correlated with the soil oxygen reduction
   potential. A GIS (geographic information system) based correlation was
   done between the site wise GHG emissions and water quality index to
   determine the relationship between GHG emission and water pollution.
   Sagar is the most polluted island in Sundarban mangrove ecosystem due to
   large urbanization. The proposed model would serve as a guide for
   environmental managers to evaluate the pollution process in various
   parts of the world.},

Title = {Pathways to climate-neutral shipping: A Danish case study},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {188},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In this paper, we describe pathways for the Danish maritime cargo sector
   to achiev CO(2)e (equivalent) neutrality by 2050 in compliance with the
   Paris Agreement. In the approach of our model, we not only include
   national greenhouse gas emissions, but also suggest a method for
   assigning greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping to
   countries. Our modelling results indicate either that strong regulatory
   carbon budgets or a carbon price of at most 350-450 (sic)(2016)/t CO(2)e
   would be necessary to induce this urgently needed transition. This would
   double today's average cargo transport costs, while increasing average
   import values by only 6-8\%. Regarding fuel technologies, hydrogen,
   methanol and ammonia are the most suitable from a socio-economic cost
   perspective, though, due to the high cost uncertainties, there is no
   clear winner. Liquefied natural gas as an alternative intermediate
   solution would only have a short window of opportunity, due to methane
   leakage causing high greenhouse gas emissions as well as high fuel and
   technology costs. In so far as this gaseous fuel is based on renewable
   sources it can play a role, but only if methane leakage is drastically
   reduced. At present battery storage is only an option for short ranges.

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Climate change adaptation presents a difficult challenge for coastal
   towns around the world, forcing local governments to plan for sea level
   rise in a contentious decision-making space. The concept of ``adaptation
   pathways,{''} a diagnostic and analytical tool to assist in adaptive
   planning and decision-making, is gaining traction as a way of framing
   and informing climate adaptation. It provides decisionmakers a way to
   acknowledge the inter-temporal complexities and uncertainties associated
   with the novel dynamics of climate change and a mechanism to manage
   these challenges in the local context. In 2012, the Australian
   Government funded an 18-month program to provide decisionmakers in the
   coastal zone an opportunity to test the utility of the adaptation
   pathways concept for coastal climate adaptation. Using a selection of
   completed projects as case studies, we performed a document analysis to
   better understand the learnings from the projects. The main themes
   surrounded: (1) the utility of the adaptation pathway framework in
   developing options, (2) decision-making rationale and criteria, and (3)
   stakeholder participation in pathway development. A project participant
   survey was developed to further understand these themes. Our analysis
   reveals that ``adaptation pathways{''} was generally framed narrowly and
   conservatively to emphasize extant economic, administrative and legal
   considerations over community, participatory, or exploratory ones.
   Although some case study projects were able to reach a point in the
   pathway discussion to actively involve stakeholders in their
   decision-making process, many case studies continued to build technical
   data as a method for defending policies and actions. These results
   indicate that coastal adaptation can take-up adaptation pathways as a
   useful concept for decision-making and planning; however, many councils
   may still require assistance in stakeholder communication processes in
   order to develop sociallyacceptable plans that take into account the
   full range of values affecting local coastal environments.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sea-levels have been rising at a faster rate than expected. Because of
   the maladaptive outcomes of engineering-based hard coastal protection
   infrastructure, policy makers are looking for alternative adaptation
   approaches to buffer against coastal flooding commonly known as
   nature-based coastal adaptation (NbCA). However, how to implement NbCA
   under an institutional structure demonstrating `inertia' to alternative
   adaptation approaches is a question that seeks scientific attention.
   Building on a case study derived from a highly climate-vulnerable
   Canadian province, this study shows how the entrepreneurial use of
   scientific information and institutional opportunities helped
   institutional actors overcome the inertia. Drawing on secondary document
   analysis and primary qualitative data, this study offers five key
   lessons to institutional actors aiming at implementing NbCA: (i) develop
   knowledge networks to help avoid uncertainty; (ii) identify and utilize
   opportunities within existing institutions; (iii) distribute roles and
   responsibilities among actors based on their capacity to mobilize
   required resources; (iv) provide entrepreneurial actors with
   decision-making autonomy for developing agreed-upon rules and norms; and
   (v) facilitate repeated interactions among institutional actors to
   develop a collaborative network among them. This study, therefore, helps
   us to understand how to implement a relatively new adaptation option by
   building trust-based networks among diverse and relevant institutional
   actors.},

Title = {Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Public Health Practice: Using
   Adaptive Management to Increase Adaptive Capacity and Build Resilience},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate change is expected to have a range of health
   impacts, some of which are already apparent. Public health adaptation is
   imperative, but there has been little discussion of how to increase
   adaptive capacity and resilience in public health systems.
   OBJECTIVES: We explored possible explanations for the lack of work on
   adaptive capacity, outline climate-health challenges that may lie
   outside public health's coping range, and consider changes in practice
   that could increase public health's adaptive capacity.
   METHODS: We conducted a substantive, interdisciplinary literature review
   focused on climate change adaptation in public health, social learning,
   and management of socioeconomic systems exhibiting dynamic complexity.
   DISCUSSION: There are two competing views of how public health should
   engage climate change adaptation. Perspectives differ on whether climate
   change will primarily amplify existing hazards, requiring enhancement of
   existing public health functions, or present categorically distinct
   threats requiring innovative management strategies. In some contexts,
   distinctly climate-sensitive health threats may overwhelm public
   health's adaptive capacity. Addressing these threats will require
   increased emphasis on institutional learning, innovative management
   strategies, and new and improved tools. Adaptive management, an
   iterative framework that embraces uncertainty, uses modeling, and
   integrates learning, may be a useful approach. We illustrate its
   application to extreme heat in an urban setting.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increasing public health capacity will be necessary for
   certain climate-health threats. Focusing efforts to increase adaptive
   capacity in specific areas, promoting institutional learning, embracing
   adaptive management, and developing tools to facilitate these processes
   are important priorities and can improve the resilience of local public
   health systems to climate change.},

Title = {Recovery of Soil Processes in Replanted Mangroves: Implications for Soil
   Functions},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mangrove revegetation is a vital strategy to recover ecosystem services
   (e.g., climate regulation and pollutants retention) provided by these
   ecosystems. Although soils are directly or indirectly responsible for
   diverse ecosystem services in mangrove ecosystems, few studies have
   focused on the recovery of soil functions (e.g., carbon sequestration)
   after mangrove replanting. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery of
   soil processes associated with Fe, S, and C dynamics and its
   implications for the restoration of soil functions. Two mangrove sites
   under replanting initiatives were studied along the Brazilian coast
   (i.e., NE and SE). The study was conducted in 3- and 7-year-old
   replanted mangrove forests, and a comparison was made with degraded and
   mature mangroves. Particle size, soil C stocks, Fe forms, total Fe and S
   contents, degrees of pyritization of Fe, and mineralogical assemblages
   were assessed. Seven years after replanting, soil C stocks increased by
   42\% and 29\% in mangrove soils from the NE and SE sites, respectively.
   In addition, significant increases were observed in fine particles,
   reactive Fe, and pyrite contents in replanted plots. These new
   conditions promoted organic matter accumulation, stabilization, and
   potential metal retention. Our findings highlight the potential of
   revegetation programs for recovering soil processes and essential soil
   functions.},

Abstract = {We present ideas about concepts underlying climate change, held by
   students in years 9 and 10. Misconceptions about climate change are
   common among students, and may be due to misconceptions about underlying
   concepts. To investigate this, we developed the Climate Change Concept
   Inventory (CCCI), and trialed it with 229 students; corroborating
   findings through focus group interviews. Our interview method and data
   analysis methods are described. Findings included overestimation of
   human contributions to atmospheric carbon inputs, ultra violet radiation
   in sunlight, and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Students were
   unaware that CO2 dissolves in water, and of the role of oceans in the
   carbon cycle. Greenhouse gases other than CO2 were rarely known. Earth's
   energy balance and black body radiation were not well understood. There
   were misconceptions about interactions between electromagnetic radiation
   and atmospheric gases; and limited understanding of carbon chemistry.
   The CCCI is available from the corresponding author.},

Abstract = {A range of environmental stressors are estimated for farmed and wild
   capture blue foods, including bivalves, seaweed, crustaceans and
   finfish, with the potential to inform more sustainable diets.
   Fish and other aquatic foods (blue foods) present an opportunity for
   more sustainable diets(1,2). Yet comprehensive comparison has been
   limited due to sparse inclusion of blue foods in environmental impact
   studies(3,4) relative to the vast diversity of production(5). Here we
   provide standardized estimates of greenhouse gas, nitrogen, phosphorus,
   freshwater and land stressors for species groups covering nearly three
   quarters of global production. We find that across all blue foods,
   farmed bivalves and seaweeds generate the lowest stressors. Capture
   fisheries predominantly generate greenhouse gas emissions, with small
   pelagic fishes generating lower emissions than all fed aquaculture, but
   flatfish and crustaceans generating the highest. Among farmed finfish
   and crustaceans, silver and bighead carps have the lowest greenhouse
   gas, nitrogen and phosphorus emissions, but highest water use, while
   farmed salmon and trout use the least land and water. Finally, we model
   intervention scenarios and find improving feed conversion ratios reduces
   stressors across all fed groups, increasing fish yield reduces land and
   water use by up to half, and optimizing gears reduces capture fishery
   emissions by more than half for some groups. Collectively, our analysis
   identifies high-performing blue foods, highlights opportunities to
   improve environmental performance, advances data-poor environmental
   assessments, and informs sustainable diets.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change and adaptations in shrimp aquaculture: A study

Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Shrimp aquaculture in India is synonymous with coastal aquaculture. Like
   other agricultural activities, it appropriates a wide range of
   environmental goods and services, and is vulnerable to impacts of
   climate change as the cultured animals are sensitive to various kinds of
   biotic and abiotic stressors. Climate change affects the shrimp
   aquaculture directly by extreme weather events and seasonal variations,
   and indirectly alter the primary and secondary productivity, structure
   and composition of the ecosystems or by influencing the availability of
   fishmeal, fish oil and other goods and services required for aquaculture
   farmers. The perceptions of farmers on the impacts of climate change on
   shrimp aquaculture in inland and coastal areas of Krishna District,
   Andhra Pradesh are discussed. Cyclone and flood were perceived by all
   the farmers, whereas irregular season, high temperature, heavy rain and
   drought were perceived by 79, 89, 91 and 5 \% of farmers, respectively.
   Environmental, biological, and economic impacts of climate change
   drivers on aquaculture indicated 20 to 30 \% loss due to seasonal
   variations and 50 to 100\% loss due to extremely heavy rainfall, flood
   and cyclones. The economic risk rating was high with flood followed by
   the cyclone and the magnitude was more in coastal areas compared to
   inland areas. There is no universally applicable list of adaptation
   measures and need to be evaluated for individual aquaculture systems.
   Autonomous and planned adaptation measures to be implemented by farmers,
   researchers and policymakers are discussed for climate-resilient
   aquaculture. Planned adaptive measures are either at the primary level
   or non-existence, hence policy initiatives are required to formulate
   planned adaptive measures to enhance the adaptive capacity of the
   farmers.},

Abstract = {Today's environmental balance has been compromised by the unreasonable
   and sometimes dangerous actions committed by humans to maintain their
   dominance over the Earth's natural resources. As a result, oceans are
   contaminated by the different types of plastic trash, crude oil coming
   from mismanagement of transporting ships spilling it in the water, and
   air pollution due to increasing production of greenhouse gases, such as
   CO2 and CH4 etc., into the atmosphere. The lands, agricultural fields,
   and groundwater are also contaminated by the infamous chemicals viz.,
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pyrethroids pesticides, bisphenol-A,
   and dioxanes. Therefore, bioremediation might function as a convenient
   alternative to restore a clean environment. However, at present, the
   majority of bioremediation reports are limited to the natural
   capabilities of microbial enzymes. Synthetic biology with uncompromised
   supervision of ethical standards could help to outsmart nature's
   engineering, such as the CETCH cycle for improved CO2 fixation.
   Additionally, a blend of synthetic biology with machine learning
   algorithms could expand the possibilities of bioengineering. This review
   summarized current state-of-the-art knowledge of the data-assisted
   enzyme redesigning to actively promote new research on important enzymes
   to ameliorate the environment.},

Abstract = {The government of China has committed to bring carbon dioxide emissions
   to a peak before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutral before 2060 to
   tackle climate change. Renewable energy plays a key role in the energy
   strategy of China in order to achieve the targets for reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring energy security. China has
   abundant offshore wind resource, distributed along its 18,000 km long
   coastline and 6000 islands. The first offshore wind farm of China was
   built in 2008 and put into operation in 2010. It provided green energy
   for 2010 Shanghai World Expo and then launched an era of offshore wind
   power development in the coastal areas adjacent to highly populated
   regions. Over the last decades, many thousands wind turbines have been
   installed, with an accumulated installed capacity of over 13 GW. This
   paper reviews the development of offshore wind power and foundation
   technology used for offshore wind turbines in China using published
   information, data, and web sources. An ongoing offshore wind farm
   project is taken as an example to describe the foundation technologies
   involved.},

Abstract = {Environmental pollution, energy supply and security of supply have
   become major issues across the world due to climate change, limited
   energy sources, energy price volatility and energy supply constraints.
   Energy availability, energy efficiency and the replacement of fossil
   fuels by renewable energy sources are key factors in the global
   development of sustainable energy. In many countries with limited fossil
   fuel resources, the sustainable development of renewable energy sources
   is an important tool in reducing dependence on imported fuels. Some
   alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar, tidal and hydropower,
   seem almost inexhaustible. With the exception of tidal energy, all of
   these sources have been used extensively and for a long time. This
   article examines the improvement of energy security and the government's
   actions to promote the use of renewable energy sources, focusing on
   increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy intensity and
   dependence on energy imports in Lithuania. In addition, the article
   provides the state of renewable energy sources in Lithuania, aspects of
   sustainability and future development directions and perspectives.},

Abstract = {Modeling studies suggest that Antarctic ozone depletion and, to a lesser
   degree, greenhouse gas (GHG) increase have caused the observed poleward
   shift in the westerly jet during the austral summer. Similar studies
   have not been performed previously with observational data because of
   difficulties in separating the two contributions. By applying a cluster
   analysis to daily ERA-Interim data, we found two 7- to 11-day wind
   clusters, one resembling the models' responses to GHG forcing and the
   other resembling ozone depletion. The trends in the clusters' frequency
   of occurrence indicate that the ozone contributed about 50\% more than
   GHG toward the jet shift, supporting the modeling results. Moreover,
   tropical convection apparently plays an important role for the
   GHG-driven trend.},

Abstract = {In the second half of the 20th century, the amount of fossil energy
   consumed on city traffic, construction, manufacturing, and consumption
   areas was soaring with the speeding up urbanization in developed
   centuries all over the world. Increased Greenhouse gas emissions and
   intensified urban heat island effects lead to global warming and extreme
   climate disasters. Haze weather has been a threat to the survival of
   mankind and further human development. None of the countries can get
   away from it when a global weather disaster comes. As a developing
   country, China is still in the middle of urbanization. It is facing an
   inevitable dilemma of high-carbon eco-environment, especially with the
   weak anti-disaster capability. Many countries are all reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions, trying to make urban development
   transformation work by paying equal attentions to economic development
   and the environmental protection. The goals of China changing the urban
   development path and building clean cities will not only boost the
   economic but also protect urban development safety. This article deeply

Abstract = {Arctic climate change is leading to accelerated melting of permafrost
   and the mobilization of soil organic carbon pools that have accumulated
   over thousands of years. Photochemical and microbial transformation will
   liberate a fraction of this carbon to the atmosphere in the form of CO2
   and CH4. We quantified these fluxes in a series of permafrost thaw ponds
   in the Canadian Subarctic and Arctic and further investigated how
   optical properties of the carbon pool, the type of microbial
   assemblages, and light and mixing regimes influenced the rate of gas
   release. Most ponds were supersaturated in CO2 and all of them in CH4.
   Gas fluxes as estimated from dissolved gas concentrations using a
   wind-based model varied from -20.5 to 114.4 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1), with
   negative fluxes recorded in arctic ponds colonized by benthic microbial
   mats, and from 0.03 to 5.62 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1). From a time series set
   of measurements in a subarctic pond over 8 d, calculated gas fluxes were
   on average 40\% higher when using a newly derived equation for the gas
   transfer coefficient developed from eddy covariance measurements. The
   daily variation in gas fluxes was highly dependent on mixed layer
   dynamics. At the seasonal timescale, persistent thermal stratification
   and gas buildup at depth indicated that autumnal overturn is a
   critically important period for greenhouse gas emissions from subarctic
   ponds. These results underscore the increasingly important contribution
   of permafrost thaw ponds to greenhouse gas emissions and the need to
   account for local and regional variability in their limnological
   properties for global estimates.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},

Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {The centennial trends in the surface wind speed over North America are
   deduced from global climate model simulations in the Climate Model
   Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive. Using the 21st century
   simulations under the RCP 8.5 scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, 5-10
   percent increases per century in the 10 m wind speed are found over
   Central and East-Central United States, the Californian Coast, and the
   South and East Coasts of the USA in winter. In summer, climate models
   projected decreases in the wind speed ranging from 5 to 10 percent per
   century over the same coastal regions. These projected changes in the
   surface wind speed are moderate and imply that the current estimate of
   wind power potential for North America based on present-day climatology
   will not be significantly changed by the greenhouse gas forcing in the
   coming decades.},

Abstract = {Climate change induced sea-level rise poses serious threats to valuable
   coastal ecosystems like mangroves. However, projections of sea level
   rise at local level under different scenarios and for different time
   scale set forth greatest challenges to climate modelers. Further,
   information on location specific sea-level rise projections at local
   level are seldom available and rarely in the possession for the coastal
   managers and adaptation planners to frame suitable adaptation strategies
   to sea-level rise. In this context, this paper endeavors to provide
   local level sea-level rise projection for the Pichavaram mangrove region
   of the Tamil Nadu coast, India. A climate simulator model based on IPCC
   AR4 (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) has been used to project the
   sea-level rise at local level under different scenarios. The results
   revealed that the study area may experience sea-level rise ranging from
   22.40 to 53.70 cm by 2100. Thus, the objective of this paper is to
   provide hands on information to facilitate coastal manager and
   adaptation planners to frame location specific and time based mangrove
   adaptation strategies to sea-level rise.},

Abstract = {Taiwan is a subtropical island nation with high dependence upon imported
   energy, about 97\% of its energy is supplied by imported fuels.
   Environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are becoming
   significant issues in Taiwan. In this regard, renewable energy like
   bio-gas energy, wind energy and solar energy are thus becoming
   attractive because the Energy Commission under the Ministry of Economic
   Affairs and other government energy expenditures pledged about annual
   US\$ 100 millions in total to promote renewable energy and energy
   conservation based on the renewable energy development policy approved
   by the Executive Yuan (Cabinet) in January 2002. Also, the Taiwan
   government announced the ambitious target to achieve about 6500 MW of
   energy from renewable sources by 2020, which is equivalent to increase
   Taiwan's installed capacity of power supply from renewable sources to
   above 10\%. The objective of this paper is to present an updated
   overview of energy policy from renewable sources in Taiwan, including
   the government's organizational response and special funds for
   supporting renewable energy promotion and technology development. Then,
   current status of usage and technology development of renewable energy
   is further addressed in this paper, concentrating on biomass energy,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The harnessing of renewable sources of marine energy has become a
   promising solution for a number of problems, namely satisfying the
   increasing demand for electricity, the reduction of greenhouse gas
   emissions, and the provision of energy to regions unconnected to a
   national grid. Tropical countries have an interesting dichotomy: Despite
   their varied potential sources of marine energy, their environmental and
   social conditions impose severe constraints on the development of a
   renewable energy industry. Moreover, the exploitation of these
   opportunities is limited by national economies' reliance on fossil
   fuels, political and social restraints, and technological immaturity.
   The present work addresses challenges and opportunities common to wave
   energy implementation in tropical nations, as a first approach to a
   regional diagnosis. The motivation for this work is to encourage
   research on wave energy policies in the Tropics. Technical,
   environmental, and social challenges to be overcome in wave energy
   projects are discussed. The technical challenges are grouped into
   development, deployment, and operation stages of wave energy converters;
   environmental challenges are divided into biodiversity, cumulative
   effects, and monitoring aspects, whilst social issues include population
   growth and energy access matters. The Mexican strategy for developing
   sustainable technology throughout the wave energy production chain is
   also presented.},

Title = {Beyond burial: lateral exchange is a significant atmospheric carbon sink
   in mangrove forests},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The blue carbon paradigm has evolved in recognition of the high carbon
   storage and sequestration potential of mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass
   ecosystems. However, fluxes of the potent greenhouse gases CH4 and N2O,
   and lateral export of carbon are often overlooked within the blue carbon
   framework. Here, we show that the export of dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC) and alkalinity is approximately 1.7 times higher than burial as a
   long-term carbon sink in a subtropical mangrove system. Fluxes of
   methane offset burial by approximately 6\%, while the nitrous oxide sink
   was approximately 0.5\% of burial. Export of dissolved organic carbon
   and particulate organic carbon to the coastal zone is also significant
   and combined may account for an atmospheric carbon sink similar to
   burial. Our results indicate that the export of DIC and alkalinity
   results in a long-term atmospheric carbon sink and should be
   incorporated into the blue carbon paradigm when assessing the role of
   these habitats in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change.},

Journal = {SHIPS AND OFFSHORE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Pages = {868-876},
Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization introduced two energy efficiency
   indexes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. One of the
   short-run solutions is to reduce ship speed. The present research
   calculates the cost-effectiveness of reducing CO2 emissions and the
   improved Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) corresponded to the
   reduced Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) due to slow
   steaming. As a case study, RO-RO cargo vessel has been investigated.
   Reducing ship speed by 10\% and 40\% will reduce CO2 emission by 27.05\%
   and 78.39\% with cost-effectiveness of 121.2 \$/ton CO2 and 287.6 \$/ton
   CO2, respectively. The attained EEDI values will be improved by 2.04\%
   and 35.81\% with the reduced EEOI values by 8.76\% and 70.65\%,
   respectively. Although ship slow steaming by 40\% would comply with the
   required EEDI for the first and the second phases, the complied EEDI
   value needs to be further reduced by 7\% in the year 2025.},

Title = {Social connectivity and adaptive capacity strategies in large-scale
   fisheries},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Large-scale fisheries are important social-ecological systems that are
   increasingly being threatened by global climate change. Adaptive
   capacity is key for moving fisheries onto climate resilient pathways,
   however, implementing policies to improve adaptive capacity is
   challenging given the many diverse stakeholders involved in fisheries.
   Previous research suggests social networks are integral to adaptive
   capacity because social connectivity can enable, or constrain, knowledge
   and information sharing. We examine the network of communication among
   stakeholders in the Basque tropical tuna freezer purse seine fishery in
   the eastern Atlantic Ocean. We use cluster analysis, descriptive
   statistics, and exponential random graph models to assess whether
   different types of actors, occupying different network positions, value
   similar adaptive capacity strategies. The results indicate that many
   actor types are frequently connected within the fishery. Preferences for
   adaptive capacity strategies vary within and across actor types, and the
   preferences of highly central actors are generally more homogeneous and
   narrowly focused. All actors agree on the importance of the social
   organization domain from adaptive capacity, while fishing industry
   representatives tend to have the most holistic perspective on adaptive
   capacity overall. We discuss the implications of these findings as they
   relate to policies for supporting adaptive capacity and climate
   resilient fisheries.},

Title = {Mapping of the Greenhouse Gas Emission Potential for the Offshore Wind
   Power Sector in Guangdong, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study aims to assess the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   of delivering 1 kWh from planned offshore wind farm sites to the grid in
   the Guangdong Province, China. In contrast to most previous studies, we
   avoided underestimating GHG emissions per kWh by approximately 49\% by
   adopting a spatialized life-cycle inventory (LCI)-improved stock-driven
   model under the medium scenario combination. We also developed a
   callable spatialized LCI to model the spatial differences in the GHG
   emissions per kWh by cells in planned offshore wind farm sites in
   Guangdong. The modeling results indicate that, under the medium scenario
   combination, the GHG emissions per kWh will range from 4.6 to 19
   gCO(2eq)/kWh and the cells with higher emissions are concentrated in the
   deep-water wind farms in the eastern ocean of the Guangdong Province.
   According to the mechanism by which the different scenarios affect the
   modeling results, increasing the unit capacity of turbines is the most
   effective approach for reducing the GHG emissions per kWh and decreasing
   the impact of natural conditions. Air density can be used as an
   empirical spatial variable to predict the GHG emission potential of
   planned wind farm sites in Guangdong. The modeling framework in this
   study provides a more reliable quantitative tool for decision-makers in
   the offshore wind sector that can be used directly for any offshore wind
   system with a monopile foundation and be extended to wind power systems
   with other foundation types, or even to the entire renewable energy and
   other infrastructure systems after certain modifications.},

Title = {Higher tropical SSTs strengthen the tropical upwelling via deep
   convection},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Recent observations show a distinct cooling of the tropical lower
   stratosphere, and chemistry-climate models (CCMs) suggest a link to a
   strengthening tropical upwelling, arguably related to increases in
   greenhouse gas concentrations from anthropogenic activity. The present
   study explores the strengthening of tropical upwelling by comparing
   ensemble realisations of two different transient scenarios with the CCM
   E39/C. Both scenarios share the same boundary conditions, including
   concentrations of ozone-depleting substances, but differ in their
   climate forcing via prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and
   well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations. In the summer hemisphere
   tropics, higher SSTs amplify deep convection locally and hence the
   convective excitation of quasistationary waves. These waves propagate
   upward through the region of easterly winds while dissipating, but still
   carry enough of the signal into the low-latitude lower stratosphere to
   induce an anomalous low-latitude Brewer-Dobson (BD) cell. The transport
   change in turn increases the flux of ozone-poor tropospheric air into

Title = {Effect of hydrological conditions on nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon

   soil carbon sequestration},

Abstract = {This study was conducted at three locations in a bottomland hardwood
   forest with a distinct elevation and hydrological gradient: ridge (high,
   dry), transition, and swamp (low, wet). At each location, concentrations
   of soil greenhouse gases (N2O, CH4, and CO2), their fluxes to the
   atmosphere, and soil redox potential (Eh) were measured bimonthly, while
   the water table was monitored every day. Results show that soil Eh was
   significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with water table: a negative
   correlation at the ridge and transition locations, but a positive
   correlation at the permanently flooded swamp location. Both soil gas
   profile analysis and surface gas flux measurements indicated that the
   ridge and transition locations could be a sink of atmospheric CH4,
   especially in warm seasons, but generally functioned as a minor source
   of CH4 in cool seasons. The swamp location was a major source of CH4,
   and the emission rate was higher in the warm seasons (mean 28 and median
   23 mg m(-2) h(-1)) than in the cool seasons (both mean and median 13 mg
   m(-2) h(-1)). Average CO2 emission rate was 251, 380 and 52 mg m(-2)
   h(-1) for the ridge, transition and swamp location, respectively. At
   each location, higher CO2 emission rates were also found in the warm
   seasons. The lowest CO2 emission rate was found at the swamp location,
   where soil C content was the highest, due to less microbial biomass,
   less CO2 production in such an anaerobic environment, and greater
   difficulty of CO2 diffusion to the atmosphere. Cumulative global warming
   potential emission from these three greenhouse gases was in an order of
   swamp > transition > ridge location. The ratio CO2/CH4 production in
   soil is a critical factor for evaluating the overall benefit of soil C
   sequestration, which can be greatly offset by CH4 production and
   emission.},

Title = {Power to the people: Electric utility restructuring and the commitment
   to renewable energy},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {94},

Abstract = {With electric generation responsible for 41 percent of U.S anthropogenic
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy use, development of clean
   energy sources is essential if the United States is to reduce release of
   greenhouse gases and slow global warming. Many proponents of sustainable
   energy anticipate that electric generation from renewable sources would
   thrive in a deregulated market, driven by consumer demand for
   ``green{''} energy and the end of incentives to build large central
   power plants under the cost-plus profits guaranteed by state utility
   commissions. This paper examines the flaws in this expectation. After
   reviewing the highly cyclical nature of U.S. energy policy making in
   recent decades, the study links the ineffectiveness of policy with the
   institutional setting. Under electric utility market restructuring,
   renewable energy generation (wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, and
   small-scale hydro) must overcome barriers such as price distortions,
   lack of storage capability, discriminatory transmission system access,
   and the end of linked utility rate hikes guaranteed to cover the
   additional expense of renewable generation. In the absence of strong
   federal leadership, the state commitment to renewable energy has been
   uneven under utility restructuring. Moreover, nuclear power-the other
   leading alternative to fossil fuel use-is beset by serious problems.
   Only renewable energy options offer long-term hope for sustainability.
   Along these lines, green marketing, renewable portfolio standards,
   system benefit charges, carbon taxes, public power, ``Community
   Choice,{''} and production credits-all based on recent U.S. and European
   experience-are critically examined and recommendations made for changing
   course. At present, during this highly fluid period of utility
   restructuring, and absent more forceful regulation and demand
   management, it is dubious whether U.S. electricity market reform can
   encourage sufficient conversion to renewable energy to stem a rising
   tide of greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {Sediment properties and CO2 efflux from intact and cleared temperate
   mangrove forests},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {20},
Pages = {6169-6180},
Abstract = {Temperate mangrove forests in New Zealand have increased in area over
   recent decades. Expansion of temperate mangroves in New Zealand is
   associated with perceived loss of other estuarine habitats, and
   decreased recreational and amenity values, resulting in clearing of
   mangrove forests. In the tropics, changes in sediment characteristics
   and carbon efflux have been reported following mangrove clearance. This
   is the first study in temperate mangrove (Avicennia marina) forests
   investigating the impact of clearing on sediment CO2 efflux and
   associated biotic and abiotic factors.
   Sediment CO2 efflux rates from intact (168.5 +/- 45.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1))
   and cleared (133.9 +/- 37.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) mangrove forests in New
   Zealand are comparable to rates measured in tropical mangrove forests.
   We did not find a significant difference in sediment CO2 efflux rates
   between intact and cleared temperate mangrove forests. Pre-shading the
   sediment for more than 30 min prior to dark chamber measurements was
   found to have no significant effect on sediment CO2 efflux. This
   suggests that the continuation of photosynthetic CO2 uptake by biofilm
   communities was not occurring after placement of dark chambers. Rather,
   above-ground mangrove biomass, sediment temperature and chlorophyll a
   concentration were the main factors explaining the variability in
   sediment CO2 efflux in intact mangrove forests. The main factors
   influencing sediment CO2 efflux in cleared mangrove forest sites were
   sediment organic carbon concentration, nitrogen concentration and
   sediment grain size. Our results show that greater consideration should
   be given regarding the rate of carbon released from mangrove forest
   following clearance and the relative contribution to global carbon
   emissions.},

Abstract = {Reducing greenhouse gas emissions becomes a top priority in the world
   with the emergence of global warming and environmental problems. Thus, a
   variety of renewable energy appears during the last decades. The Ocean,
   which covers two-thirds of the world, captures and stores huge amounts
   of energy which could satisfy 5 times of world energy demand. During the
   last 10 years, various Marine Current Energy Conversion Systems (MCECSs)
   have been developed around the world. In this paper, the marine current
   energy and its extraction forms are briefly presented. Then, various
   projects are classified into two categories, geared drive train system
   and direct drive train system, according to the different generators.
   The mainly characteristics of the different generators are also
   discussed. The relative converters are future presented. According to
   this paper, the researchers will easily find that the Permanent Magnet
   Synchrous Generator (PMSG) and Induction Generator (IG) are preferred in
   MCECS.},

Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {59-70},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Electricity production by wind turbines is considered a clean energy
   technology, but the life cycle of wind turbines could introduce
   environmental risks due to waste generation, especially at the
   decommissioning process. This study predicts the future wind turbine
   blade waste arising in Canada, throughout all life cycle stages, from
   manufacturing until end of life, based on the installed capacities of
   existing Canadian wind farms and projected future installations. Five
   alternative strategies for managing this waste stream are assessed in
   terms of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy demand,
   including landfilling, incineration, and mechanical recycling. For the
   base case scenario, it is observed that the total cumulative waste until
   2050 is 275,299 tonnes, with on-site waste accounting for around 75\% of
   this total. Waste generation is concentrated in provinces with greater
   wind power deployment: Ontario and Quebec alone account for 70\% of
   total blade waste. Life cycle environmental impacts of waste management
   strategies are dependent on background energy systems, with incineration
   a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly when
   displacing low-carbon grid mixes. Cement kiln coprocessing achieves net
   zero emission by converting waste into energy and raw materials for the
   cement. Mechanical recycling can achieve substantial reductions in
   primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions but achieving
   financial viability would likely require substantial regulatory support.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions from intact riparian wetland soil columns
   continuously loaded with nitrate solution: a laboratory microcosm study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {32, SI},
Pages = {33702-33714},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this study, we aimed at determining greenhouse gas (GHG) (CO2, CH4,
   and N2O) fluxes exchange between the soil collected from sites dominated
   by different vegetation types (Calamagrostis epigeios, Phragmites
   australis, and Carex schnimdtii) in nitrogenous loaded riparian wetland
   and the atmosphere. The intact soil columns collected from the wetland
   were incubated in laboratory and continuously treated with NO3- enriched
   water simulating downward surface water percolating through the soil to
   become groundwater in a natural system. This study revealed that the
   soil collected from the site dominated by C. epigeios was net CO2 and
   N2O sources, whereas the soil from P. australis and C. schnimdtii were
   net sinks of CO2 and N2O, respectively. The soil from the site dominated
   by C. schnimdtii had the highest climate impact, as it had the highest
   global warming potential (GWP) compared with the other sites. Our study
   indicates that total organic carbon and NO3- concentration in the soil
   water has great influence on GHG fluxes. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and N2O
   fluxes were accelerated by the availability of higher NO3- concentration
   in soil water. On the other hand, higher NO3- concentration in soil
   water favors CH4 oxidation, hence the low CH4 production. Temporally,
   CO2 fluxes were relatively higher in the first 15 days and reduced
   gradually likely due to a decline in organic carbon. The finding of this
   study implies that higher NO3- concentration in wetland soil, caused by
   human activities, could increase N2O and CO2 emissions from the soil.
   This therefore stresses the importance of controls of NO-3 leaching in
   the mitigation of anthropogenic N2O and CO2 emissions.},

Abstract = {As global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions seem an ever more
   distant prospect, attention has turned to adaptation to the unavoidable
   impacts of climate change. On the key frontier of sea level rise, this
   amounts to the injunction `build sea walls'. But what are the
   implications of a scramble for coastal protection technologies? This
   article explores sea wall politics in one of the countries most
   vulnerable to sea level rise: Egypt. It is shown that protection of the
   Nile Delta coastline is skewed towards sunk capital and expected
   investments rather than poor people. This is a consequence of the
   neoliberal policies of the Mubarak regime and, on a more fundamental
   level, of uneven and combined development in Egypt. The latter process
   is thus undergoing an inversion and reappearing as `uneven and combined
   apocalypse', on the threatened coastlines of Egypt and elsewhere.},

   carbon footprint of the port that is located in the city centre based on
   emission sources of ships. The inventory analysis mainly uses primary
   data collected from the port. The number of ships coming to the port and
   their types of engines and amount of fuels were taken into account in
   the calculation of the carbon footprint. Every type of engine has
   different operation modes. The results of this study show that the port
   has a carbon footprint 65043 tonnes CO2 equivalent per year.},

Title = {Stakeholders' Perceptions of Nature-Based Solutions for Hurricane Risk
   Reduction Policies in the Mexican Caribbean},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NbSs) have long recognized the value of coastal
   and marine ecosystem management and associated ecosystem services as
   useful tools for climate change mitigation (e.g., blue carbon) and
   adaptation (e.g., coastal protection against flooding and storm surges).
   However, NbSs remain poorly acknowledged and mostly absent from coastal
   planning for disaster risk reduction policies in the Caribbean, as well
   as from ex-post disaster reconstruction funds. With the increasing
   frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the region, NbSs are now more
   needed than ever. Taking Mexico as a representative case study for the
   wider Caribbean, we here seek to identify and analyze the barriers and
   opportunities perceived by relevant stakeholders for mainstreaming
   coastal-marine NbSs into coastal management and disaster risk reduction
   policies (e.g., mangroves as green infrastructure) to protect coastal
   societies and national economies against hurricanes. We conduct
   semi-structured, in-depth interviews with twenty stakeholders covering
   academic, governmental, tourism, NGO, coastal planning, and financial
   domains. Among the twenty-three identified barriers, governance,
   institutional, financial, and human-capacity aspects are the most
   dominant perceptions behind the current lack of NbS implementation.
   Future action for the policy integration of NbSs requires widespread
   political will and better quantification of both the provision of
   ecosystem services and their economic benefits under conventional
   markets.},

   technologies},
Journal = {MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {85-90},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Renewable energy sources from the oceans include offshore wind, wave
   energy, and underwater currents. Sustainable future economies require
   renewable energy sources. Recent developments in ocean-based renewable
   energy systems are outlined and forecasts for the next decade are put
   forth. Offshore wind energy is the fastest growing sector in renewable
   energy. Anticipated to reach \$ 6 billion per year in Europe by 2006,
   upwards of 86 MW of capacity from 88 turbines are in place today.
   Capacity by 2010 is projected to grow to at least 2000 MW. Governmental
   support in Europe is fueling the development, in part, because of
   greenhouse gas emission targets. The first commercial-scale wave power
   facility was established in Scotland. Several proponents plan prototype
   demonstrations over the next few years. Growth in this sector is
   anticipated to reach \$100 million per annum by 2010. Projects
   harnessing tidal currents have shifted toward capturing tidal-driven
   coastal currents. Conservative estimates of \$40 million per annum by
   2010 appear realistic. Ocean-based renewable energy development lag
   land-based systems because of significant capital requirements and
   difficulty obtaining the necessary financing due to risk and market
   barriers. The technical capabilities, both in engineering and
   management, exist in the offshore sector to undertake the size and scope
   of projects envisioned.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE COASTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},

Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {For operational use there is a need to identify a set of measures that
   quantify the resilience. The `CoastRes' project, a component of the UK
   Climate Resilience Programme, examined how an operational interpretation
   of resilience might be applied to the coast, building on existing
   approaches to shoreline management in the UK. The development of the
   methodology and resulting Coastal Resilience Model has been reported
   elsewhere. For this communication, we provide a brief summary of the
   management framework, the Coastal Resilience Model (CRM) and the
   preparation of the datasets, so that the limitations of the data
   available at a national scale are clear. We then illustrate how the
   Coastal Resilience Model has been implemented as the web-based CRM
   Portal. The purpose of the portal is to allow users to explore (i) the
   implications of future change on local and national resilience; and (ii)
   their own view of the relative importance of the Performance Measures
   that make up the Coastal Resilience Index. By exploring the influence of
   these weightings it is hoped that Stakeholders can develop a shared
   understanding of what is important for coastal communities. The CRM
   Portal can be accessed at: .},

   Spatial Correlation and Convergence},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The agricultural ecosystem has dual attributes of greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emission and absorption, which both influence the net amount of GHG. To
   have a clearer understanding of the net GHG effect, we linked up the
   emission and absorption of the agricultural ecosystem, estimated the net
   emissions of 30 provinces in China from 2007 to 2016, then explored the
   spatial correlation from global and local perspectives by Moran's I, and
   finally tested the convergence of the net emissions by alpha convergence
   test, conditional beta convergence test and spatial econometric methods.
   The results were: (1) The average of provincial agricultural net GHG
   emissions was around 4999.916 x 10(4) t, showing a fluctuating trend in
   the 10 years. Meanwhile, the gaps among provinces were gradually
   widening, as the provinces with high emissions were mainly agglomerated
   in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, while those with less
   emissions mainly sat in the northwest. (2) The net emissions correlated
   spatially in close provinces. The agglomeration centers were located in
   the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the northern coastal region,
   showing ``high-high{''} and ``low-low{''} agglomeration, respectively.
   (3) The net emissions did not achieve alpha convergence or conditional
   beta convergence in the whole country, but the growth rate had a
   significant positive spillover effect among adjacent provinces, and two
   factors, the quantity of the labor force and the level of agricultural
   economy, had a negative impact on the rate. It is suggested that all
   provinces could strengthen regional cooperation to reduce agricultural
   net GHG emissions.},

Title = {The role of seagrasses in coastal protection in a changing climate},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {87},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {158-168},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The contribution of seagrasses to coastal protection is examined through
   the review of the most relevant existing knowledge. Seagrasses are the
   largest submerged aquatic vegetation ecosystem protected in Europe and
   it is worth examining their contribution to coastal protection. The
   review performed highlights incident energy flux, density, standing
   biomass and plant stiffness as the main physical and biological factors
   influencing the efficiency of the protection provided by seagrasses. The
   main conclusion achieved is that seagrass meadows cannot protect
   shorelines in every location and/or scenario. The optimal conditions for
   enhancing the protection supplied might be achieved in shallow waters
   and low wave energy environments, with high interaction surface, at the
   vertical and horizontal dimension, between water flow and seagrasses.
   Likewise, the most favorable protection might be provided by large, long
   living and slow growing seagrass species, with biomass being largely
   independent of seasonal fluctuations and with the maximum standing
   biomass reached under the highest hydrodynamic forcings. It is shown
   that seawater warming, increasing storms and sea level rise, together
   with the increasing population and anthropogenic threats in the coastal
   area may lead to rates of change too fast to allow seagrasses to adapt
   and keep their coastal defense service. Finally, to amend the decline of
   seagrasses and consequent coastal protection loss, different artificial
   and natural adaptation measures are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {This paper discusses the key aspects of the recent Coastal Plan of the
   Veneto Region (IT). Its aim is to propose a single mitigation strategy
   for coastal erosion that is valid for the whole Veneto Region, and
   possibly elsewhere, as well as a method to assign a priority level to
   any action. The suggested mitigation action against erosion depends on
   urbanization level, beach width, as well as cross-shore and long-shore
   sediment transport. The criterion used to give a priority level to
   mitigation actions is based on a vulnerability index that takes into
   account erosive tendency, existing coastal flooding hazards, coast
   value, environmental relevance, tourist pressure, urbanization level,
   the presence of production activities, and cultural heritage. A sample
   case featuring the littoral of Rosolina is also provided and includes a
   site description, the sediment budget, critical issues and possible
   mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of CH4 and CO2, resulting from
   decomposition of flooded organic matter from the hydroelectric reservoir
   of Petit Saut in the tropical rain forest of French Guiana have been
   monitored since reservoir impoundment in January 1994. This data set
   along with complementary data taken from older reservoirs in forested
   regions of the southern Ivory Coast provides an estimate of long-term
   GHG emission trends from a tropical reservoir. The trends are used to
   calculate the contribution of this reservoir to global warming on a 100
   year timescale, assumed to be consistent with the life cycle of the
   reservoir. Calculations are based on the concept of global warming
   potential (GWP). Natural emission of greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) from
   soils of the reservoir before impoundment is estimated through field
   measurements and literature data. Then net GHG emissions from the
   reservoir on a 100 hundred year timescale (30 million tons of equivalent
   CO2, with an uncertainty range of 7-54 Mt CO2eq) are compared with
   predicted emissions from thermal power plants of equivalent power (115
   MW). The final comparison takes into account the actual energy
   production of the dam power station at only 50\% of the installed
   capacity. Emission from this reservoir, whose power density is low
   (0.315 MW km(-2) flooded), would be similar to emissions from a gas
   power plant (33 Mt CO2eq) producing the same energy amount and less than
   emissions from other thermal alternatives, among which the most
   polluting are coal plants. Such a result, however, strongly depends on
   the choice of the integration time.},

Abstract = {It is increasingly evident that climate change is having significant
   impacts on marine ecosystems and dependent fisheries. Yet, translating
   climate science into management actions and policies is an ongoing
   challenge. In particular, four aspects have confounded implementation of
   climate-resilient management: (i) regional management tools may not be
   well-suited for managing the same systems under climate change, (ii)
   individual management policies and climate research studies are often
   implicitly focussed on spatio-temporal scales that are rarely aligned,
   (iii) management approaches seldom integrate across spatio-temporal
   scales and are, therefore, maladapted to unidirectional change and
   extreme events, and (iv) challenges to modelling socio-economic
   implications of climate change impede projections of cumulative costs to
   society, disguise adaptive limits, and ultimately impact climate risk
   and management trade-off assessments. We suggest that addressing
   environmental change favours adaptive and dynamic management approaches,
   while addressing shifting socio-economic and political conditions
   favours fixed long-term measures; considering both jointly requires a
   combination of dynamic-adaptive-fixed approaches. We outline a framework
   to integrate climate-responsive tools into a unified climate-resilient
   management approach using nested dynamic-adaptive-fixed management
   portfolios that improve management effectiveness and efficiency. This
   approach may help reduce future conflict between marine resource
   extractive and conservation goals through more explicit characterization
   of management trade-offs and identification of social and ecological
   tipping points.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {90-96},
Abstract = {The abrupt climate change, attributed to increase in atmospheric
   concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, has necessitated
   identification of technological options to sequester CO2 into other
   long-lived pools. Other viable pools for C sequestration include
   geologic, oceanic, and the terrestrial. There is also a potential to
   convert CO2 into stable minerals. There are geoengineering techniques of
   CO2 capture and storage into old oil wells to enhance oil recovery (EOR)
   and access coalbed methane (CBM), store in saline aquifers and
   sedimentary rocks, and combine it with basalt where it goes through
   chemical transformations. Geoengineering techniques have relatively high
   sink capacity and also high costs. Further, geoengineering techniques
   require measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) protocols. In
   contrast, C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems (soil and biota) is
   based on the natural process of photosynthesis, and humification of
   biosolids applied to the soil. Terrestrial pools have relatively lower
   sink capacity, but are cost-effective and have numerous ancillary
   benefits. Total CO2 drawdown is estimated at reduction in 50 ppm of
   atmospheric concentration over 5 decades. Increasing C pool in
   agricultural soils is essential to advancing food security, and that in
   degraded/desertified soils to improve the environment. Rather than
   either/or scenarios, both strategies of C sequestration via
   geoengineering and terrestrial strategies have specific niches which
   need to be carefully and objectively identified and implemented. The
   terrestrial C sequestration is a win-win strategy because of its
   numerous benefits, especially its positive impact on food security while
   mitigating climate change and improving the environment.},

Abstract = {Solar technologies are viewed as feasible options for reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging long-term adaptation in the
   context of climate change and rising energy demand. Solar energy is
   India's second-largest Renewable Energy (RE) source, and playing
   increasingly important role in the country's low-carbon energy
   portfolio. Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are the northernmost states of
   India, with elevations ranging from 205 to 8564 meters above the mean
   sea level. Both states are located just south of the Karakorum and have
   a subtropical and cold-arid environment with scarce renewable energy
   resources. This study is performed to identify the annual and monthly
   variation of solar energy potentials for the recent climatological
   future over the western Himalayan region. The long-term annual average
   demonstrated the high efficiency of GUI over Leh and Kargil and low over
   the Jammu and Kashmir region. The monthly variation shows greater GUI
   values between March and October, varying from 225 to 375 W m(-2), and
   lower from November to February, less than 220 W m(-2). The mean ambient
   2-m temperature indicates December and January months are bad for solar
   energy installations, while June and July are excellent. Overall, the
   fmdings show that Ladakh has a remarkable solar energy potential and is
   recommendable for further investigation.},

Title = {Considering local adaptation increases willingness to mitigate},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {69-75},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Discussing adaptation has previously been viewed as ``taboo{''}, a
   distraction that shifts focus away from mitigation of greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, this view has recently changed as researchers,
   governments, and the UNFCCC have acknowledged the necessity of both
   mitigation and adaptation. Yet there has been little research on the
   public's view of adaptation and whether public consideration of
   adaptation (local or otherwise) might have positive effects or, as
   feared, distract people from mitigation. Contrary to these fears, here
   we experimentally show that consideration of local adaptation to
   sea-level rise significantly increased people's willingness to perform
   personal emissions-reducing behaviors, such as using public transport,
   eating less meat, and flying less. We surveyed residents in the
   Wellington region of New Zealand, randomly assigning respondents either
   to answer questions about climate change and mitigation only, or first
   to answer questions about potential local sea-level rise and adaptation
   measures that could be taken in their region. Respondents who first
   considered this local adaptation scored significantly higher on a
   measure of personal willingness to mitigate, and responses did not
   change depending on participants' level of skepticism of anthropogenic
   climate change. These results reveal the potential for discussion and
   consideration of local adaptation to engage the public in mitigation
   actions, possibly by making the problem of climate change less distant
   and more tangible. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Potential greenhouse gas reductions from Natural Climate Solutions in
   Oregon, USA},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are causing global
   climate change and decreasing the stability of the climate system.
   Long-term solutions to climate change will require reduction in GHG
   emissions as well as the removal of large quantities of GHGs from the
   atmosphere. Natural climate solutions (NCS), i.e., changes in land
   management, ecosystem restoration, and avoided conversion of habitats,
   have substantial potential to meet global and national greenhouse gas
   (GHG) reduction targets and contribute to the global drawdown of GHGs.
   However, the relative role of NCS to contribute to GHG reduction at
   subnational scales is not well known. We examined the potential for 12
   NCS activities on natural and working lands in Oregon, USA to reduce GHG
   emissions in the context of the state's climate mitigation goals. We
   evaluated three alternative scenarios wherein NCS implementation
   increased across the applicable private or public land base, depending
   on the activity, and estimated the annual GHG reduction in carbon
   dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e) attributable to NCS from 2020 to 2050. We
   found that NCS within Oregon could contribute annual GHG emission
   reductions of 2.7 to 8.3 MMT CO(2)e by 2035 and 2.9 to 9.8 MMT CO(2)e by
   2050. Changes in forest-based activities including deferred timber
   harvest, riparian reforestation, and replanting after wildfires
   contributed most to potential GHG reductions (76 to 94\% of the overall
   annual reductions), followed by changes to agricultural management
   through no-till, cover crops, and nitrogen management (3 to 15\% of
   overall annual reductions). GHG reduction benefits are relatively high
   per unit area for avoided conversion of forests (125-400 MT CO(2)e
   ha(-1)). However, the existing land use policy in Oregon limits the
   current geographic extent of active conversion of natural lands and
   thus, avoided conversions results in modest overall potential GHG
   reduction benefits (i.e., less than 5\% of the overall annual
   reductions). Tidal wetland restoration, which has high per unit area
   carbon sequestration benefits (8.8 MT CO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1)), also has
   limited possible geographic extent resulting in low potential (< 1\%) of
   state-level GHG reduction contributions. However, co-benefits such as
   improved habitat and water quality delivered by restoration NCS pathways
   are substantial. Ultimately, reducing GHG emissions and increasing
   carbon sequestration to combat climate change will require actions
   across multiple sectors. We demonstrate that the adoption of alternative
   land management practices on working lands and avoided conversion and
   restoration of native habitats can achieve meaningful state-level GHG
   reductions.},

Title = {Techno-economic assessment of renewable methanol from biomass
   gasification and PEM electrolysis for decarbonization of the maritime
   sector in California},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {257},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {At scale, biomass-based fuels are seen as long-term alternatives to
   conventional shipping fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the
   maritime sector. While the operational benefits of renewable methanol as
   a marine fuel are well-known, its cost and environmental performance
   depend largely on production method and geographic context. In this
   study, a techno-economic and environmental assessment of renewable
   methanol produced by gasification of forestry residues is performed. Two
   biorefinery systems are modeled thermody-namically for the first time,
   integrating several design changes to extend past work: (1) methanol
   synthesized by gasification of torrefied biomass while removing and
   storing underground a fraction of the carbon initially contained in it,
   and (2) integration of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer
   for increased carbon efficiency via hydrogen injection into the methanol
   synthesis process. The chosen use case is set in California, with forest
   residue biomass as the feedstock and the ports of Los Angeles and Long
   Beach as the shipping fuel demand point. Methanol produced by both
   systems achieves substantial lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions savings
   compared to traditional shipping fuels, ranging from 38 to 165\%, from
   biomass roadside to methanol combustion. Renewable methanol can be
   carbon-negative if the CO2 captured during the biomass conversion
   process is sequestered underground with net greenhouse gas emissions
   along the lifecycle amounting to-57 gCO(2)eq/MJ. While the produced
   methanol in both pathways is still more expensive than conventional
   fossil fuels, the introduction of CO(2)eq abatement incentives available
   in the U.S. and California could bring down minimum fuel selling prices
   substantially. The produced methanol can be competitive with fossil
   shipping fuels at credit amounts ranging from \$150 to \$300/tCO(2)eq,
   depending on the eligible credits.},

Title = {Building capacity on ecosystem-based adaptation strategy to cope with
   extreme events and sea-level rise on the Uruguayan coast},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {504-522},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to show a case study of ecosystem-based
   adaptation (EbA) measures to increase coastal system's resilience to
   extreme weather events and sea-level rise (SLR) implemented at Kiyu
   (Uruguayan coast of the Rio de la Plata river estuary).
   Design/methodology/approach A participatory process involving the
   community and institutional stakeholders was carried out to select and
   prioritise adaptation measures to reduce the erosion of sandy beaches,
   dunes and bluffs due to extreme wind storm surge and rainfall, SLR and
   mismanagement practices. The recovery of coastal ecosystems was
   implemented through soft measures (green infrastructure) such as
   revegetation with native species, dune regeneration, sustainable
   drainage systems and the reduction of use pressures.
   Findings Main achievements of this case study include capacity building
   of municipal staff and stakeholders, knowledge exchanges with
   national-level decision makers and scientists and the incorporation of
   EbA approaches by subnational-level coastal governments. To consolidate
   EbA, the local government introduced innovations in the coastal
   management institutional structure.
   Originality/value The outcomes of the article include, besides the
   increase in the resilience of social-ecological systems, the
   strengthening of socio-institutional behaviour, structure and
   sustainability. This experience provides insights for developing a
   strategy for both Integrated Coastal Management and climate adaptation
   at the national scale.},

Abstract = {The dynamic coastlines in the Lower Mekong Delta of Vietnam are
   threatened by the impacts of climate change, particularly by the
   increased intensity and frequency of storms and floods, as well as by
   rising sea levels. The most effective coastal protection systems consist
   of different elements arranged in series, for instance natural
   floodplains vegetated with mangroves and a sound dyke line. However, the
   unsustainable use of natural resources and development in the coastal
   zone are threatening the protection function of the mangrove forest
   belt. In sites where severe erosion has destroyed the mangrove belt,
   restoration of floodplains and mangrove rehabilitation is only possible
   after the wave energy has been reduced by physical barriers. This can be
   achieved with bamboo fences, which reduce erosion and stimulate
   sedimentation. Restoration of the eroded floodplains creates the
   pre-conditions for rehabilitation of the destroyed mangrove forest.
   Mangrove management is an important element of an area costal protection
   strategy.},

   result in both increased risks and opportunities for the following areas
   of interest: ``Ecosystems{''}, ``Fisheries and Aquaculture{''},
   ``Communities{''}, and ``Marine Infrastructure{''}. As next steps within

Abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of an actual scaled-IEEE-13
   distribution feeder under different operating conditions including the
   modelling and simulation of variating solar energy contribution. The
   actual distribution feeder was built under the Universidad del Norte
   strategic energy area as a laboratory; therefore, the scaling and
   generator-load modules where carried out given the particular conditions
   of the university. This project becomes an actual test bench to fully
   explore strategies to many needs that exists today such as: energy
   efficiency, increased use of renewable energy, reduction of greenhouse
   gas emissions, increased safety of the supply and minimization of
   electrical losses. The main result of the present work is to defined the
   amount of solar energy that can be injected to a conventional power
   system, so that it can keep operation under a regulatory frame even
   under island operation, which allows to possibility to become a solution
   for lack of power from the network operator and/or explore schemes of
   distributed generation.},

   and Satilla Rivers in southeast Georgia to characterize nitrogen removal
   from these understudied systems. Further, we measured the response of
   denitrification, greenhouse gas production (CO2, CH4, N2O), and the
   formation of reduced inorganic sulfur species following laboratory
   incubations simulating saltwater intrusion with salinity levels of 2 and
   5. Ambient denitrification ranged from 0.03 mu g N2O/g/hr in the Satilla
   River to 0.40 mu g N2O/g/hr in the Altamaha River. Potential
   denitrification was two to eight times greater than ambient
   denitrification. Denitrification from Satilla River soils increased with
   salinity, while Altamaha and Ogeechee River soils were unaffected.
   Methane production, however, was inhibited by salinity, decreasing by
   77\% in the 2 treatment and 89\% in the 5 treatment whereas CO2
   generally increased with salinity, though exhibited a variable response
   between the three rivers. Formation of reduced sulfur species followed a
   similar trend to CO2 production. Our findings suggest that tidal forests
   are effective sinks for N, capable of producing anywhere from 0.032 to
   1.9 mu g N2O/g soil/hr. Overall, salinity increased the amount of C
   mineralized suggesting that low levels of salinity can alter the
   short-term C dynamics of tidal freshwater forests.},

Pages = {807-823},
Abstract = {The eastern boundary upwelling systems, located in the subtropics at the
   eastern boundary of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and mainly driven by
   the trade winds, are the major coastal upwelling regions. Previous
   studies have suggested that the intensity of upwelling in these areas in
   the past centuries may have been influenced by the external radiative
   forcing, for instance by changes in solar irradiance, and it will also
   be influenced in the future by the increasing atmospheric greenhouse
   gases. Here, we analyse the impact of the external climate forcing on
   these upwelling systems in ensembles of simulations of two Earth system
   models. The ensembles contain three simulations for each period covering
   the past millennium (900-1849) and the 20th century (1850-2005). One of
   these Earth system models additionally includes the near future
   (2006-2100). Using a set of simulations, differing only in their initial
   conditions, enables us to test whether the observed variability and
   trends are driven by the external radiative forcing. Our analysis shows
   that the variability of the simulated upwelling is largely not affected
   by the external forcing and that, generally, there are no significant
   trends in the periods covering the past and future. Only in future
   simulations with the strongest increase of greenhouse gas concentrations
   the upwelling trends are significant and appear in all members of the
   ensemble.},

Abstract = {Between 2010 and 2014, almost 3000 MW were installed in wind power
   plants in Romania. The development was generated by important incentives
   promoted by the Government. In this way, Romania reached the target of
   renewable energy assumed for 2020. However, there is still a lot of
   potential to continue the development of wind power plants in order to
   reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, as Romania still
   has large areas with potential for wind power plants projects, this
   paper studies the technical and economic opportunities for the
   development of such wind power plants on the Black Sea. Based on the
   obtained results, this paper proposes a series of measures that could
   lead to a viable offshore wind power plant project.},

Journal = {AQUATIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Our understanding of how ecosystems function has changed from an
   equilibria-based view to one that recognizes the dynamic, fluctuating,
   nonlinear nature of aquatic systems. This current understanding requires
   that we manage systems for resilience. In this review, we examine how
   resilience has been defined, measured and applied in aquatic systems,
   and more broadly, in the socioecological systems in which they are
   embedded. Our review reveals the importance of managing stressors
   adversely impacting aquatic system resilience, as well as understanding
   the environmental and climatic cycles and changes impacting aquatic
   resources. Aquatic resilience may be enhanced by maintaining and
   enhancing habitat connectivity as well as functional redundancy and
   physical and biological diversity. Resilience in aquatic socioecological
   system may be enhanced by understanding and fostering linkages between
   the social and ecological subsystems, promoting equity among
   stakeholders, and understanding how the system is impacted by factors
   within and outside the area of immediate interest. Management for
   resilience requires implementation of adaptive and preferably
   collaborative management. Implementation of adaptive management for
   resilience will require an effective monitoring framework to detect key
   changes in the coupled socioecological system. Research is needed to (1)
   develop sensitive indicators and monitoring designs, (2) disentangle
   complex multi-scalar interactions and feedbacks, and (3) generalize
   lessons learned across aquatic ecosystems and apply them in new
   contexts.},

Abstract = {The need for sustainable and resilient long-term strategies for coastal
   restoration and development projects is largely the result of pressures
   brought by changing climate conditions and growing human populations
   along coastal boundaries. As anthropogenic impacts along our coasts
   increase, the demand for sustainable, nature-based solutions (NbS) will
   grow commensurately. Trusted approaches are needed for successful
   implementation of NbS, especially in regions hardest hit by
   environmental changes. Nearshore strategies for new construction and
   protection of existing coastal infrastructure are shifting rapidly from
   hardened approaches to more ecologically aligned techniques that work
   with natural forces and enhance natural habitat. This paper highlights
   the benefits of living shorelines composed of ecotypic native plants,
   wave attenuation structures for coastal protection, and managed retreat
   to restore coastal environments while supporting and maintaining natural
   habitats. We review several NbS and present two case studies to
   illustrate the value of incorporating nature-based approaches to
   vulnerable coastal environments and highlight the importance of
   maximizing synergies and understanding trade-offs in their long-term
   use. (C) 2021 SETAC},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have estimated the burden of coronary heart
   disease (CHD) mortality from ambient regional particulate matter <= 2.5
   mu m (PM2.5). The burden of near-roadway air pollution (NRAP) generally
   has not been examined, despite evidence of a causal link with CHD.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated the CHD burden from NRAP and compared it with
   the PM2.5 burden in the California South Coast Air Basin for 2008 and
   under a compact urban growth greenhouse gas reduction scenario for 2035.
   METHODS: We estimated the population attributable fraction and number of
   CHD events attributable to residential traffic density, proximity to a
   major road, elemental carbon (EC), and PM2.5 compared with the expected
   disease burden if the population were exposed to background levels of
   air pollution.
   RESULTS: In 2008, an estimated 1,300 CHD deaths (6.8\% of the total)
   were attributable to traffic density, 430 deaths (2.4\%) to residential
   proximity to a major road, and 690 (3.7\%) to EC. There were 1,900
   deaths (10.4\%) attributable to PM2.5. Although reduced exposures in
   2035 should result in smaller fractions of CHD attributable to traffic
   density, EC, and PM2.5, the numbers of estimated deaths attributable to
   each of these exposures are anticipated to increase to 2,500, 900, and
   2,900, respectively, due to population aging. A similar pattern of
   increasing NRAP-attributable CHD hospitalizations was estimated to occur
   between 2008 and 2035.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a large burden of preventable CHD
   mortality is attributable to NRAP and is likely to increase even with
   decreasing exposure by 2035 due to vulnerability of an aging population.
   Greenhouse gas reduction strategies developed to mitigate climate change
   offer unexploited opportunities for air pollution health co-benefits.},

   is no study conducted to estimate precipitation variability using these
   parameters. In this study, we investigated the influence of
   precipitation variability by considering the effect of the middle
   atmosphere on lower atmospheres over UBNB in Ethiopia. Most of the data
   sets used in this study are derived from the European Centre for
   Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), in situ measurements and the
   Global monitoring division of National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration. The results indicate that the correlation between ECMWF
   and in situ precipitation and temperature data is 0.82 and 0.32,
   respectively. The maximum ozone concentration is found during the summer
   season (6.2 x 10(-3) kg m(-2)). In this season, precipitation and cloud
   cover has positive correlations and both are negative correlations with
   temperature and incident solar radiation. The observed positive trend in
   temperature is associated with the enhancement of greenhouse gases.
   Cloud cover and ozone is quite useful for reduced incident solar
   radiation. Ozone is increased with temperature for all seasons except
   winter. Gravity wave dispersion affects the spatial distributions of
   temperature. Finally, we conclude that precipitation is directly
   influenced by temperature and incident solar radiation and indirectly
   affected by gravity waves, ozone concentration, and greenhouse gases. To
   draw a better conclusion, further study is needed with water vapor
   nuclei on precipitation variability in addition to middle atmospheric
   parameters.},

Title = {Carbon intensity of global existing and future hydropower reservoirs},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As the largest renewable electricity source, hydropower represents an
   alternative to fossil fuels to achieve a low carbon future. However,
   increasing evidence suggests that hydropower reservoirs are an important
   source of biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), albeit with large
   uncertainties. Combining spatially resolved assessments of GHG fluxes
   and hydroelectric capacity databases, we assessed that global GHG
   emissions from reservoirs is 0.38 Pg CO2 eq.yr(-1), accounting for 1.0\%
   of global anthropogenic emissions. The median carbon intensity for
   hydropower is -63.0 kg CO(2)eq. MWh-1, which is lower than that for
   fossil fuels, but higher than that for other renewable energy sources.
   High carbon intensity is mostly linked to shallow (water storage depth <
   20 m) and eutrophic reservoirs. Furthermore, we found that the reservoir
   carbon intensity (CI) value would be markedly increased to 131.5 kg
   CO2eq. MWh(-1) when considering the dams under construction and
   planning. A low-carbon future will benefit from optimal dam planning and
   management measures, i.e., applying sludge removal treatments, thereby
   reducing the proportion of shallow reservoirs and anthropogenic
   pollution.},

Abstract = {Global warming and its related phenomena such as iceberg melting and sea
   level rising, is the result of human's penchant to industrial living
   which leads to increase of greenhouse gas emission. Increase of
   greenhouse gas inside the atmosphere gets result in Greenhouse effect
   phenomenon. This problem has received increasing attention from scholars
   and industries in recent years under name of green. Controlling or
   decreasing of Green House Gas emissions is possible by green programs
   and technologies in future. These programs are considered as an
   effective solution of global warming prevention. The main reason of
   greenhouse gas emissions in urban environment is unnecessary
   deceleration and acceleration of moving vehicles as well as drivers'
   risky actions such as reverse moves, fast speed zigzag moves. Therefore,
   a traffic management system is needed for providing smooth trips for
   drivers. By a periodic central abnormal and normal vehicles clustering,
   at each moment we can suggest less risk roads to vehicles for reaching
   to their destination with less risk. In addition potential hazards can
   be avoided. In this paper, we propose a model to calculate mobile
   vehicles risk by monitoring them and calculate the shortest path with
   minimum risk based on updated collected data in each moment. This model
   can use in both case of general and emergency vehicle.},

Title = {Effects of transient Phragmites australis removal on brackish marsh
   greenhouse gas fluxes},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {51-59},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Phragmites australis is a common invasive reed of North American coastal
   marshes, and efforts to control or eradicate it often are included in
   coastal marsh restoration efforts. While much research has tested
   impacts of P. australis removal on plant and faunal communities, less is
   known about biogeochemical responses to P. australis removal. Since
   coastal marshes are valued for their robust carbon sequestration,
   understanding the effect of P. australis removal on marsh carbon cycling
   dynamics is important. Temporary P. australis aboveground biomass
   clearing conducted as part of a restoration effort provided an
   opportunity to evaluate changes in fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs)
   carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during P. australis removal and
   recovery. In Experiment 1 (2014 growing season), GHG fluxes were
   compared between a P. australis stand cleared mechanically and recovered
   within months of initial removal and an uncleared stand in the same
   marsh system. CO2 uptake increased dramatically in the cleared stand as
   P. australis regrew, but CH4 emissions remained unchanged, demonstrating
   that P. australis did not directly contribute to CH4 emission. In
   Experiment 2 (2015 manipulations), to test mechanisms of P. australis'
   impact on GHG fluxes, fluxes (light and dark) were compared between
   unimpacted P. australis plots, cut P. australis plots with litter, and
   cleared P. australis plots without litter. P. australis cutting
   (independent of litter removal) resulted in increased CO2 and CH4
   emissions. Recovery of P. australis directly drove the rapid recovery of
   CO2 uptake, and did not increase (and possibly attenuated) CH4
   emissions. Results of this study suggest that at this site, P. australis
   removal, in the absence of native vegetation recovery, may exacerbate
   GHG emission of coastal marshes in the short term, and that longer-term
   impacts warrant investigation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Sustainable transport by use of alternative marine and aviation fuels-A
   well-to-tank analysis to assess interactions with Singapore's energy
   system},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Sustainable economic development and renewable energy carriers are
   challenges facing hub cities that will influence their future role in
   trade and transport. The objective of this paper is to discuss the
   interactions between alternative transport fuels for international
   applications and Singapore's energy system as a central hub of global
   transport.
   The process chains for the supply of conventional fuels, liquefied
   natural gas, biofuels, and liquid hydrogen in Singapore are analysed by
   applying a well-to-tank analysis, following which the energy demand and
   the associated greenhouse gas emissions are calculated. A sensitivity
   analysis is performed to assess the individual impacts of various
   processes.
   A comparison of process chains for the supply of fuels for marine and
   aviation purposes shows that conventional energy carriers and liquefied
   natural gas achieve higher energy efficiencies than biofuels and liquid
   hydrogen. Alternative fuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions by varying
   degrees depending on the fuel type. An analysis of interactions with
   Singapore's energy system identifies emerging opportunities and
   challenges for the city-state's economic system associated with future
   development of international transport. Although alternative fuels offer
   the possibility of diversifying Singapore's energy supply, creating new
   business opportunities, and increasing Singapore's impact on fighting
   climate change, limited resource potentials and higher energy prices set
   new challenges to secure Singapore's role as an international trade and
   transport hub. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Lifecycle Environmental Impact Assessment of an Overtopping Wave Energy
   Converter Embedded in Breakwater Systems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Overtopping breakwater systems are among the most promising technologies
   for exploiting wave energy to generate electricity. They consist in
   water reservoirs, embedded in piers, placed on top of ramps, higher than
   sea-level. Pushed by wave energy, seawater fills up the reservoirs and
   produces electricity by flowing back down through low headhydro
   turbines. Different overtopping breakwater systems have been tested
   worldwide in recent years. This study focuses on the Overtopping
   BReakwater for Energy Conversion (OBREC) system that has been
   implemented and tested in the harbor of Naples (Italy). The Life Cycle
   Assessment of a single replicable module of OBREC has been performed for
   analyzing potential environmental impacts, in terms of Greenhouse Gas
   Emissions, considering construction, installation, maintenance, and the
   operational phases. The Carbon Footprint (i.e., mass of CO(2)eq) to
   build wave energy converters integrated in breakwater systems has been
   estimated, more specifically the ``environmental investment{''} (i.e.,
   the share of Carbon Footprint due to the integration of wave energy
   converter) needed to generate renewable electricity has been assessed.
   The Carbon Intensity of Electricity (i.e., the ratio between the CO(2)eq
   emitted and the electricity produced) has been then assessed in order to
   demonstrate the profitability and the opportunity to foster innovation
   in the field of blue energy. Considering the impact for implementing an
   operational OBREC module (Carbon Footprint = 1.08 t CO(2)eq;
   Environmental Investment = 0.48 t CO(2)eq) and the electricity
   production (12.6 MWh/year per module), environmental benefits (avoided
   emissions) would compensate environmental costs (i.e., Carbon Footprint;
   Environmental Investment) those provided within a range of 25 and 13
   months respectively.},

Abstract = {Climate change will alter the distribution of tuna, impacting the
   economies of Pacific Small Island Developing States. This study finds
   that greater greenhouse gas emissions will worsen these impacts.
   Climate-driven redistribution of tuna threatens to disrupt the economies
   of Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and sustainable
   management of the world's largest tuna fishery. Here we show that by
   2050, under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), the
   total biomass of three tuna species in the waters of ten Pacific SIDS
   could decline by an average of 13\% (range = -5\% to -20\%) due to a
   greater proportion of fish occurring in the high seas. The potential
   implications for Pacific Island economies in 2050 include an average
   decline in purse-seine catch of 20\% (range = -10\% to -30\%), an
   average annual loss in regional tuna-fishing access fees of US\$90
   million (range = -US\$40 million to -US\$140 million) and reductions in
   government revenue of up to 13\% (range = -8\% to -17\%) for individual
   Pacific SIDS. Redistribution of tuna under a lower-emissions scenario
   (RCP 4.5) is projected to reduce the purse-seine catch from the waters
   of Pacific SIDS by an average of only 3\% (range = -12\% to +9\%),
   indicating that even greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, in
   line with the Paris Agreement, would provide a pathway to sustainability
   for tuna-dependent Pacific Island economies. An additional pathway
   involves Pacific SIDS negotiating within the regional fisheries
   management organization to maintain the present-day benefits they
   receive from tuna, regardless of the effects of climate change on the
   distribution of the fish.},

Abstract = {Mangroves are increasingly recognized for their role in supporting
   adaptation to climate change and variability. However, knowledge about
   how climate change and variability affect mangrove ecosystem services
   (MES) and their role in supporting coastal communities to adaption is
   limited in Tanzania. We used participatory rural appraisal methods and
   field observations to explore local communities' perceptions of climate
   change and variability, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies
   in the mangroves of the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania. Decrease in rainfall,
   increased temperatures, coastal flooding, and the incidence of sea level
   rise were identified as key variables associated with a changing climate
   in the delta. Perceived climatic stresses included damaged fish breeding
   sites, altered climate regulation and a decrease in coastal protection
   and flood control. Decline in crop, fish and honey production were
   perceived as the main impacts on community livelihoods, although there
   were significant differences across occupational groups. Dependence on
   MES in times of shocks, such as when agriculture production fails,
   switching of occupation, crop diversification, fishing in deep waters
   and migration to other areas provided potential adaptation options.
   Although the reported perceptions related to climate change or
   variability are not explicit, they both have negative consequences to
   mangrove dependent communities' livelihoods.},

Abstract = {Biochar amendment has complex impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, crop
   production and economic benefit. However, few studies have
   comprehensively investigated the effects of biochar amendment in coastal
   saline rice fields. Thus, a biochar amendment field experiment was
   established in a coastal saline rice field in China to estimate the CH4
   and N2O emissions, global warming potential (GWP), greenhouse gas
   intensity (GHGI), and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) of the
   biochar amendment during the rice growing season in 2017. There were six
   treatments (N0B0, N0B1, N0B2, N1B0, N1B1, N1B2) with different N
   fertilizer levels of 0 and 300 kg N ha(-1) and biochar rates of 0, 20,
   and 40 t ha(-1). The results showed that the application of N fertilizer
   increased N2O emissions and rice yield by 128.3\% (p<0.001) and 44.4\%
   (p<0.001), respectively, while decreased the GHGI by 20.5\% (p<0.01);
   additionally, there were no significant effects on the CH4 emissions and
   GWP compared with the treatments without N fertilizer. Although biochar
   amendment significantly increased the N2O emissions and rice yield by
   13.7-38.1\% and 31.5-34.9\%, respectively, biochar amendment had no
   significant effects on CH4 emissions, GWP, and GHGI relative to the
   treatments without biochar amendment. From an economic perspective, N
   fertilizer significantly increased the NEEB by 135.5\%, relative to the
   treatments without N fertilizer. Due to the high price of biochar and
   the large quantity applied, biochar amendment significantly reduced the
   NEEB by 99.8-229.3\% compared with the treatments without biochar
   amendment. Considering the different characters between field-aged
   biochar and fresh biochar. Thus, long-term observations are needed to
   evaluate the environmental and economic profits affected by biochar and
   N fertilizer.},

Abstract = {This research examines the economic impact of climate change adaptation
   measures on the housing markets of two representative coastal cities in
   the United States located along the Atlantic Ocean. The results shed
   light on how adaptation measures and investments influence housing
   values and local real estate markets with respect to their place-based
   and local forms of implementation. Numerous quantitative approaches,
   with the use of geospatial data, panel-data hedonic regressions, and
   difference-in-differences analyses, are used to examine changes in
   property values associated with climate adaptation measures and the
   dynamics of risk perception. The results also signal how risk perception
   and hurricane characteristics are reflected in housing markets, thereby
   shedding light on the effects of anticipatory and reactive adaptation
   strategies on property values in these coastal communities.
   Collectively, the study suggests which adaptation strategies and
   characteristics can contribute to maximizing both community resilience
   and economic benefits against the weather extremes caused by climate

Title = {The role of aerosol in altering North Atlantic atmospheric circulation
   in winter and its impact on air quality},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1725-1743},
Abstract = {Numerical model scenarios of future climate depict a global increase in
   temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, primarily driven by
   increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Aerosol particles also
   play an important role by altering the Earth's radiation budget and
   consequently surface temperature. Here, we use the general circulation
   aerosol model ECHAM5-HAM, coupled to a mixed layer ocean model, to
   investigate the impacts of future air pollution mitigation strategies in
   Europe on winter atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. We
   analyse the extreme case of a maximum feasible end-of-pipe reduction of
   aerosols in the near future (2030), in combination with increasing GHG
   concentrations. Our results show a more positive North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) mean state by 2030, together with a significant
   eastward shift of the southern centre of action of sea-level pressure
   (SLP). Moreover, we show a significantly increased blocking frequency
   over the western Mediterranean.
   By separating the impacts of aerosols and GHGs, our study suggests that
   future aerosol abatement may be the primary driver of both the eastward
   shift in the southern SLP centre of action and the increased blocking
   frequency over the western Mediterranean. These concomitant
   modifications of the atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Atlantic
   sector lead to more stagnant weather conditions that favour air
   pollutant accumulation, especially in the western Mediterranean sector.
   Changes in atmospheric circulation should therefore be included in
   future air pollution mitigation assessments. The indicator-based
   evaluation of atmospheric circulation changes presented in this work
   will allow an objective first-order assessment of the role of changes in
   wintertime circulation on future air quality in other climate model
   simulations.},

Title = {Assessing the role of deltaic flood plain wetlands on regulating methane
   and carbon balance},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {808},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Present study deals with the role of wetland for regulating greenhouse
   gases (GHG) particularly methane (CH4) emission and carbon (C)
   sequestration in mature Ganges deltaic environment. The annual total
   amount of emission and sequestration in wetlands of varying types was
   estimated along with the seasonal variation. Result showed that the
   streams were the highest emitter of CH4 followed by ox-bow lakes in all
   the seasons whereas the bheries (embanked pisciculture arresting tidal
   water) consistently exhibited the lowest average emission. The average
   sequestration of C was the highest in ox-bow lakes followed by marshes
   and mudflats. The average emission in monsoon season was 43\% and 78\%
   higher than the average emission of pre and post-monsoon seasons
   respectively. The yearly total emission was 8.01 x 10(3) ton and yearly
   total sequestration was estimated 908.98 x 10(3) ton. From the
   perspective of GHG regulation, the wetlands were found to yearly uptake
   four times higher carbon dioxide (CO2) than the CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e)
   of emitted CH4. After offsetting the fixation cost of emitted CH4, the
   yearly surplus sequestrated C in the wetlands of the entire region was
   worthy of 68.46 million US dollar (USD). So, wetland plays positive role
   for reducing greenhouse gas effect and associated temperature rise which
   is considered to be serious issue. Such result has made a good agreement
   on the debated issue of wetland CH4 emission and C sequestration and
   will encourage restoring wetland for even mediating GHG issue.},

Abstract = {Purpose of Review Dynamic manifestations of climate change, i.e. those
   related to circulation, are less well understood than are thermodynamic,
   or temperature-related aspects. However, this knowledge gap is
   narrowing. We review recent progress in understanding the causes of
   observed changes in polar tropospheric and stratospheric circulation,
   and in interpreting climate model projections of their future changes.
   Recent Findings Trends in the annular modes reflect the influences of
   multiple drivers. In the Northern Hemisphere, there appears to be a
   ``tug-of-war{''} between the opposing effects of Arctic near-surface
   warming and tropical upper tropospheric warming, two predominant
   features of the atmospheric response to increasing greenhouse gases.
   Future trends in the Southern Hemisphere largely depend on the competing
   effects of stratospheric ozone recovery and increasing greenhouse gases.
   Summary Human influence on the Antarctic circulation is detectable in
   the strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex and the poleward
   shift of the tropospheric westerly winds. Observed Arctic circulation
   changes cannot be confidently separated from internal atmospheric
   variability.},

Title = {Climate and air-quality benefits of a realistic phase-out of fossil
   fuels},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {573},
Number = {7774},
Pages = {408+},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {The combustion of fossil fuels produces emissions of the long-lived
   greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and of short-lived pollutants, including
   sulfur dioxide, that contribute to the formation of atmospheric
   aerosols(1). Atmospheric aerosols can cool the climate, masking some of
   the warming effect that results from the emission of greenhouse
   gases(1). However, aerosol particulates are highly toxic when inhaled,
   leading to millions of premature deaths per year(2,3). The phasing out
   of unabated fossil-fuel combustion will therefore provide health
   benefits, but will also reduce the extent to which the warming induced
   by greenhouse gases is masked by aerosols. Because aerosol levels
   respond much more rapidly to changes in emissions relative to carbon
   dioxide, large near-term increases in the magnitude and rate of climate
   warming are predicted in many idealized studies that typically assume an
   instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic or fossil-fuel-related
   emissions(1,4-9). Here we show that more realistic modelling scenarios
   do not produce a substantial near-term increase in either the magnitude
   or the rate of warming, and in fact can lead to a decrease in warming
   rates within two decades of the start of the fossil-fuel phase-out.
   Accounting for the time required to transform power generation, industry
   and transportation leads to gradually increasing and largely offsetting
   climate impacts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, with the rate of
   warming further slowed by reductions in fossil-methane emissions. Our
   results indicate that even the most aggressive plausible transition to a
   clean-energy society provides benefits for climate change mitigation and
   air quality at essentially all decadal to centennial timescales.},

Abstract = {Improving the robustness of maritime emission inventories is important
   to ensure we fully understand the point of embarkment for transformation
   pathways of the sector toward the 1.5 and 2 degrees C targets. A
   bottom-up assessment of emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols from
   the maritime sector is presented, accounting for the emissions from fuel
   production and processing, resulting in a complete ``well-to-wake{''}
   geospatial inventory. This high-resolution inventory is developed
   through the use of the state-of-the-art data-driven MariTEAM model,
   which combines ship technical specifications, ship location data, and
   historical weather data. The CO2 emissions for 2017 amount to 943
   million tonnes, which is 11\% lower than the fourth International
   Maritime Organization's greenhouse gas study for the same year, while
   larger discrepancies have been found across ship segments. If fuel
   production is accounted for when developing shipping inventories, total
   CO2 emissions reported could increase by 11\%. In addition to fuel
   production, effects of weather and heavy traffic regions were found to
   significantly impact emissions at global and regional levels. The global
   annual efficiency for different fuels and ship segments in approximated
   operational conditions were also investigated, indicating the need for
   more holistic metrics than current ones when seeking appropriate
   solutions aiming at reducing emissions.},

Volume = {34},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Geo-engineering approaches to modern climate stabilization, irrelative
   to the Kyoto Protocol measures, are under consideration. Conditionally,
   these approaches are subdivided into two groups: purposive changes in
   the Earth radiation balance to compensate the greenhouse gas effect and
   removal of the excessive amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
   The first group includes such methods as injection of sulfate and other
   reflecting aerosols into the stratosphere, creation of orbital
   reflectors or reflectors at the Lagrange point, an increase in
   cloudiness over the World Ocean, and a change in the Earth surface
   albedo. Increased carbon dioxide uptake by forests, ocean, and
   artificial absorbers are considered within the second group. The methods
   considered were subject to a comparative analysis using the following
   criteria: possible fast realization, the ability to counteract the
   doubling of greenhouse gases, availability of natural analogs, impact on
   geophysical systems within natural variations, the absence of
   unacceptable ecological implications, possibility, if necessary, to
   immediately halt the action. The comparison showed that the use of
   stratospheric sulfate aerosols can be the most effective. It is
   emphasized that all geo-engineering directions can be realized
   simultaneously with the measures stipulated by the Kyoto Protocol.},

Title = {Climate change and their impacts in the Balearic Islands: a guide for
   policy design in Mediterranean regions},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding the local effects of global warming-derived impacts is
   important to island systems due to their fragile environmental
   conditions. This is especially true when it comes to Mediterranean
   insular regions as they are climate change (CC) hotspots where
   adaptation and mitigation policy design is an urgent matter. Looking at
   2030 as a time horizon for climate action and focusing on the Balearic
   Islands, this paper reviews the physical changes projected for the
   coming decades as a result of CC and analyses their impacts on regional
   environmental, economic and social variables. Mitigation and adaptation
   measures are also proposed based on the identified priority impacts. The
   fact the Balearics are a top world holiday destination allows the
   analysis to serve as a guide to other Mediterranean islands with
   tourism-based economies facing similar CC scenarios. Results show the
   projected rise of temperature and sea level; the reduction of the
   average precipitation and increase in evapotranspiration, the droughts
   and the increase in ocean acidification and deoxygenation are the main
   threats faced by the Balearics, this putting their economy at risk due
   to the high tourism's vulnerability to CC. Mitigation and adaptation
   action on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, water resources, energy,
   infrastructure and urban planning, human health, economy, law and
   education is recommended. Sustainable mobility and waste managing are
   also viewed as important fields for mitigation action. Conclusions show
   that diversifying the current socioeconomic model is needed to increase
   the community and territory resilience.},

Title = {Estimating greenhouse gas emissions from open-cut coal mining:
   application to the Sydney Basin},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {453-462},
Abstract = {A new site-specific (Tier 3) method has been developed to determine
   greenhouse gas emissions from open coal mining. The Tier 3 method
   presented here is based on extensive measurement of gas emissions from
   open-cut coal mines and the physics of gas desorption from coal. It was
   adopted by Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting in 2009
   and since 2012 formed the scientific basis for the Australian Government
   guidelines on calculating greenhouse gas emissions from open cut mines.
   The main strength of this method is its site-specific nature and
   accuracy, as well as its ability to be integrated with routine coal
   exploration programs. New concepts were produced for the model: a coal
   mine is regarded as a `gas reservoir,' with coal seam gas being emitted
   from a `gas release zone' that consists of sedimentary geological units
   (emission layers) above and below the base of the mine. The primary data
   required for the method are the in situ gas content and gas composition
   of the coal and carbonaceous rocks contained within the gas-release
   zone. These data are obtained through direct measurement of gas
   desorption from bore cores. To reduce gas drilling, a mine lease is
   compartmentalised into `gas zones' of similar gas content and reservoir
   properties. The outputs of the method are emission density (the
   potential volume of gas emitted from mining site per unit area of the
   ground surface) and emission factor (the gas volume emitted per tonne of
   raw coal extracted). Owing to spatial variability and errors of
   measurement, the estimate of emissions is associated with uncertainty. A
   simple method of calculating uncertainty of emissions is presented in
   this work.},

Title = {Estimating the aboveground biomass and carbon stocks of tall shrubs in a
   prerestoration degraded salt marsh},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Wetlands play a vital role in Earth's carbon cycle and provide important
   ecosystem services. Their ability to perform their roles can be
   compromised by human activities that destroy or impair their
   functioning. The restoration of degraded wetlands may allow carbon cycle
   functioning, as well as other services, to be recovered. Predicting the
   potential outcomes from any restoration project requires upfront
   consideration, including via modeling possible changes in carbon stocks.
   In this study, we quantified the carbon stocks in tall shrub vegetation
   proliferating in a degraded salt marsh that is currently the subject of
   an extensive restoration project. We produced allometric models to
   estimate biomass and carbon stocks for three tall shrub species, which,
   along with other freshwater and upland species in the area, will die
   with continued restoration. Therefore, estimating the potential for
   carbon losses in biomass is important. We also developed a means of
   estimating carbon stocks in other nontree plants in the estuary area.
   Useful equations for estimating the biomass of tall shrubs are limited
   in general and lacking for degraded systems. Our study adds to the
   literature on carbon stocks in shrub species and fills a data gap for
   degraded ecosystems. It also contributes to the broader carbon
   feasibility study of the aforementioned restoration project that was
   designed to predict the overall net impact of the project on greenhouse
   gas emissions in the ecosystem.},

Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {242-282},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Researchers and policy makers increasingly recognize the need to adapt
   to future changes in climate, given that past emissions of greenhouse
   gases have already committed the world to some level of climate change.
   However, the current understanding of the costs and benefits of
   adaptation measures is still fairly rudimentary, and far from
   comprehensive. An assessment is presented of the current state of
   knowledge on the magnitude of adaptation costs in the United States.
   While incomplete, the studies suggest that adaptation cost could be as
   high as tens or hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the middle
   of this century. Key studies are identified in each sector, and the cost
   estimates and approaches to cost estimation are surveyed. Methodological
   issues are highlighted in interpreting, comparing, and aggregating
   adaptation cost estimates. Policy recommendations are made along with
   appropriate steps to make future adaptation cost studies more comparable
   within and across sectors and more accessible and relevant to policy and
   decision makers.Policy relevanceDesigning and implementing climate
   change adaptation policy requires good information about the
   effectiveness and cost of available adaptive options. The current state
   of knowledge on adaptation costs in the United States is assessed and
   significant gaps in the literature are highlighted - particularly in
   terms of sectoral and geographic coverage - as well as inconsistencies
   in methodologies and assumptions that hamper comparison across studies.
   Critical steps are identified that can be taken to make adaptation cost
   studies more accessible and useful to decision makers. The findings and
   recommendations are relevant to adaptation cost studies globally, not
   just in the United States.},

Abstract = {This paper is an attempt to explore the indigenous coping strategies of
   cyclone-affected coastal people, especially in southwestern part of
   Bangladesh. This study has been conducted by using qualitative methods,
   i.e., case study, key informants interviews and focus group discussion
   were adopted to get the vivid and comprehensive panorama of coping
   strategies of cyclone-affected coastal people. The paper examines that
   coastal people envisaged with frequent and severe natural hazards
   throughout the years which severely affect their everyday life. The
   findings indicate that in order to cope with the hazards, coastal people
   change their housing structure, search new jobs, migrate elsewhere, rear
   alternative livestock, borrow money, take relief and so on. The findings
   also indicate that local people can perceive and predict about the
   imminent hazards by observing different indicators and take initiative
   for disaster prevention, mitigation and adaptation from their existing
   traditional knowledge and practices. There has not been conducted much
   empirical research on indigenous coping strategies of coastal people in
   natural hazards, so policy maker can get a comprehensive view about this
   context and implement it to national policy for comprehensive disaster
   management and adaptation.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-62},

Abstract = {The success of climate change strategies depends on how well mitigation
   and adaptation measures are implemented. It is especially important to
   implement effective mitigation and adaptation measures in coastal
   territories because they will be more directly affected by some of the
   possible effects of climate change. This study assessed and compared how
   Singapore, Miami-Dade and San Francisco - three coastal territories -
   implement climate change strategies in their construction industries.
   Case study method - in which primary and secondary information was
   collected and analyzed - was used. It was found that these three
   territories have a few similarities; for example, Singapore and San
   Francisco mandate green building requirements, whereas Singapore and
   Miami-Dade do not explicitly consider adaptation measures in their
   building codes. It was also noted that although mitigation has entered
   mainstream policy-making, adaptation still lags behind. Consequently,
   this study has proposed a few lessons; for example, policy-makers in
   Singapore and Miami-Dade should complement existing measures with
   platforms to engage the public on disaster management. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {Within a seaport terminal, the main sources of emissions include (1)
   building use and maintenance, (2) ocean-going vessels and harbour
   crafts, (3) cargo handling equipment and (4) heavy-duty vehicles (HDV)
   used for the transportation of the containers (which considered to be
   one of the most polluting elements of port operations). The main
   objective of this work was the development of a mathematical model for
   the quantification of Greenhouse Gas emissions produced by HDV during
   container transport in ports. Several models and tools have been
   developed for this purpose; however most of them utilize an
   over-simplified fuel and energy consumption-based approach. Firstly, a
   critical review of emissions calculations models was performed, and
   following the results of this analysis COPERT was chosen to be used as a
   basis for modeling the fleet in port operation. The next step was to
   analyse in depth COPERT's methodology and equations in order to identify
   potential limitations. The following step was to evaluate and address
   those limitations by introducing new elements and factors (e.g.
   emissions from stop-and-go traffic, idling, emissions increase due to
   air conditioning operation etc.). The final step was the modification of
   COPERT's equation and the development of the improved model.},

Abstract = {Coastal forested wetlands provide important ecosystem services such as
   carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, and flood protection, but they
   are also important sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Human
   appropriation of surface water and extensive ditching and draining of
   coastal plain landscapes are interacting with rising sea levels to
   increase the frequency and magnitude of saltwater incursion into
   formerly freshwater coastal wetlands. Both hydrologic change and
   saltwater incursion are expected to alter carbon and nutrient cycling in
   coastal forested wetlands. We performed a full factorial experiment in
   which we exposed intact soil cores from a coastal forested wetland to
   experimental marine salt treatments and two hydrologic treatments. We
   measured the resulting treatment effects on the emissions of carbon
   dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) over 112days.
   Salinity effects were compared across four treatments to isolate the
   effects of increases in ionic strength from the impact of adding a
   terminal electron acceptor (SO42-). We compared control treatments (DI
   addition), to artificial saltwater (ASW, target salinity of 5 parts per
   thousand) and to two treatments that added sulfate alone (SO42-, at the
   concentration found in 5 ppt saltwater) and saltwater with the sulfate
   removed (ASW-SO42-, with the 5 ppt target salinity maintained by adding
   additional NaCl). We found that all salt treatments suppressed CO2
   production, in both drought and flooded treatments. Contrary to our
   expectations, CH4 fluxes from our flooded cores increased between 300
   and 1200\% relative to controls in the ASW and ASW-SO42- treatments
   respectively. In the drought treatments, we saw virtually no CH4 release
   from any core, while artificial seawater with sulfate increased N2O
   fluxes by 160\% above DI control. In contrast, salt and sulfate
   decreased N2O fluxes by 72\% in our flooded treatments. Our results
   indicate that salinization of forested wetlands of the coastal plain may
   have important climate feedbacks resulting from enhanced greenhouse gas
   emissions and that the magnitude and direction of these emissions are
   contingent upon wetland hydrology.},

Abstract = {As a significant greenhouse gas, CO2 plays an important role in not only
   the formation of, but also in changes to, the Earth's climate. A series
   of remote-sensing detectors have been launched into space to aid the
   understanding of sources and sinks of CO2. Although measurements from
   AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder), SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging
   Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography), and GOSAT
   (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) have been frequently used to
   retrieve atmospheric CO2 concentrations, there are no comprehensive
   comparison analyses between satellite data and ground data. In this
   article, the characteristics of the current common observing platforms
   and their product data are compared and analysed. Correlation
   coefficient, RMSD, and bias are used to evaluate the CO2 retrieved from
   satellite data. The results reveal that: SCIAMACHY has limitations in
   detecting CO2 over the ocean; GOSAT has the poorest coverage on a global
   scale but has a better capability to detect CO2 over the sea than
   SCIAMACHY; and AIRS can reflect the distribution and changes of CO2 very
   well. The differences in coverage and accuracy indicate the necessity to
   produce consistent products with improved spatial and temporal features
   and indicate a future development trend for instruments including higher
   spectral resolution, higher spatial resolution, wider coverage, shorter
   revisit periods, and higher signal to noise ratios.},

Abstract = {The global trading of perishable goods is possible through the
   application of product refrigeration and atmospheric control during
   transportation. A mean energy consumption rate of 2.7 kW/TEU was assumed
   in this study, but was found to have potential variations of around +/-
   60\%. New Zealand's maritime trade was considered as a case study for
   the year 2007 to place the effect of refrigerated transport in context.
   For individual refrigerated containers, approximately 19\% of the energy
   use related to its journey is used for refrigeration purposes. In 2007,
   approximately 18\% and 61\% of New Zealand's imported and exported food
   products by mass, respectively, required some form of refrigeration
   during transportation. Maintaining the refrigerated state of imports and
   exports to and from New Zealand during maritime transportation consumed
   approximately 280 GWh of electricity. Assuming all this electricity was
   generated onboard vessels using auxiliary engines, approximately 61 kt
   of fuel was consumed and 190 kt of CO2 produced. Refrigeration is of
   particular importance to the many greenhouse gas or carbon footprinting
   studies conducted around the world. Implications are discussed in the
   context of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of apples from NZ
   to the UK and long-term storage of UK apples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Land-use/land-cover change (LULCC) often results in degradation of
   natural wetlands and affects the dynamics of greenhouse gases (GHGs).
   However, the magnitude of changes in GHG emissions from wetlands
   undergoing various LULCC types remains unclear. We conducted a global
   meta-analysis with a database of 209 sites to examine the effects of
   LULCC types of constructed wetlands (CWs), croplands (CLs), aquaculture
   ponds (APs), drained wetlands (DWs), and pastures (PASs) on the
   variability in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the natural coastal
   wetlands, riparian wetlands, and peatlands. Our results showed that the
   natural wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2 and net sources of
   CH4 and N2O, exhibiting the capacity to mitigate greenhouse effects due
   to negative comprehensive global warming potentials (GWPs; -0.9 to -8.7
   t CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1)). Relative to the natural wetlands, all LULCC
   types (except CWs from coastal wetlands) decreased the net CO2 uptake by
   69.7\%-456.6\%, due to a higher increase in ecosystem respiration
   relative to slight changes in gross primary production. The CWs and APs
   significantly increased the CH4 emissions compared to those of the
   coastal wetlands. All LULCC types associated with the riparian wetlands
   significantly decreased the CH4 emissions. When the peatlands were
   converted to the PASs, the CH4 emissions significantly increased. The
   CLs, as well as DWs from peatlands, significantly increased the N2O
   emissions in the natural wetlands. As a result, all LULCC types (except
   PASs from riparian wetlands) led to remarkably higher GWPs by
   65.4\%-2,948.8\%, compared to those of the natural wetlands. The
   variability in GHG fluxes with LULCC was mainly sensitive to changes in
   soil water content, water table, salinity, soil nitrogen content, soil
   pH, and bulk density. This study highlights the significant role of
   LULCC in increasing comprehensive GHG emissions from global natural
   wetlands, and our results are useful for improving future models and
   manipulative experiments.},

Abstract = {Surface carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions exhibit a high degree of spatial
   heterogeneity in the young boreal Eastmain-1 hydroelectric reservoir,
   located in northern Quebec, Canada. Estimates of the individual
   components of net CO2 production within the reservoir (benthic
   respiration, water column respiration, and primary production)
   furthermore provide a link between the heterogeneity in surface CO2
   emissions and the flooded landscapes below. Specifically, the preflood
   carbon stock and soil-sediment respiration rates of flooded landscapes
   were found to influence benthic CO2 production, the rate of decline of
   hypolimnetic dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the estimated rate at
   which flooded landscapes release DOC, further influencing water column
   respiration rates. Estimates of the individual components of net CO2
   production in Eastmain-1 are supported by a positive relationship (t
   test, r(2) = 0.64, P < 0.01) between measured surface CO2 emissions
   (mean +/- SE = 1540 +/- 145.4 mg C.m(-2).day(-1)) and independently
   derived estimates of total net CO2 production (mean +/- SE = 1230 +/-
   162.4 mg C.m(-2).day(-1)). Our findings emphasize the utility of
   fundamental landscape characterization prior to construction in

Abstract = {Dealing with the local consequences of climate change and an accelerated

   The following article focusses on results of a discourse analysis of the

   part of the interdisciplinary research project KRIM we analyse both
   natural and social adaption options to extreme incidents (formulated as
   climate scenarios for the year 2050). Along with a summary of the
   discourse analysis, special attention is given to our methodological
   approach. Different aspects of the political-administrative risk
   assessment (the possibility of dike failure, the role of climate change
   research for coastal protection, the importance of discoursive and
   institutional boundary work) are brought up and wrapped to the
   methodological issues of our discourse analysis. The core thesis here is
   that the uncertainties of climate impact research get interpreted and
   absorbed within safety-discourses that draw on local know-how as well as
   on historical growing competences in coastal protection.},

Abstract = {The efforts made to reduce the causes and mitigate the effects of global
   climate change continue to be critical in coastal areas. Many adaptation
   strategies implemented in coastal areas remain inadequate or
   ineffective. Using primarily events and interventions carried out along
   the Portuguese Atlantic coast, this work aims to show the paradigm shift
   that has occurred in Portugal since the last century (the 1990s) within
   the scope of the National Coastal Zone Management Strategy, taking into
   account the new guidelines for the implementation of coastal defence
   works. In this context, this paper also aims to assist coastal
   communities in carrying out operational coastal management by presenting
   and discussing management tools and primary options that should be
   considered in any adaptation programme that is to be implemented. Both
   nonstructural and structural measures are considered. Action plans,
   warning systems, emergency plans, and evacuation plans belong to the
   first category. Education and training are also considered, because they
   play a key role in the sustainability of coastal areas, especially in
   the coming generations. Structural measures are adaptation options that
   are designed to increase the safety of people and reduce risks. They are
   discussed and grouped into categories that include accommodation,
   protection, and retreat. Recent cases of successful accommodation and
   protection measures implemented along the Portuguese coast are also
   presented and discussed.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic and associated government lockdowns
   dramatically altered human activity, providing a window into how changes
   in individual behavior, enacted en masse, impact atmospheric
   composition. The resulting reductions in anthropogenic activity
   represent an unprecedented event that yields a glimpse into a future
   where emissions to the atmosphere are reduced. Furthermore, the abrupt
   reduction in emissions during the lockdown periods led to clearly
   observable changes in atmospheric composition, which provide direct
   insight into feedbacks between the Earth system and human activity.
   While air pollutants and greenhouse gases share many common
   anthropogenic sources, there is a sharp difference in the response of
   their atmospheric concentrations to COVID-19 emissions changes, due in
   large part to their different lifetimes. Here, we discuss several key
   takeaways from modeling and observational studies. First, despite
   dramatic declines in mobility and associated vehicular emissions, the
   atmospheric growth rates of greenhouse gases were not slowed, in part
   due to decreased ocean uptake of CO2 and a likely increase in CH4
   lifetime from reduced NOx emissions. Second, the response of O3 to
   decreased NOx emissions showed significant spatial and temporal
   variability, due to differing chemical regimes around the world.
   Finally, the overall response of atmospheric composition to emissions
   changes is heavily modulated by factors},

Title = {Characteristics of permafrost degradation in Northeast China and its

Abstract = {Latitudinal permafrost in Northern Northeast (NNE) China is located in
   the southern margin of the Eurasian continent, and is very sensitive to
   climatic and environmental change. Numerical simulations indicate that
   air temperature in the permafrost regions of Northeast China has been on
   the rise since the 1950s, and will keep rising in the 21{''} century,
   leading to extensive degradation of permafrost. Permafrost degradation
   in NNE China has its own characteristics, such as northward shifts in
   the shape of a ``W{''} for the permafrost southern boundary (SLP),
   discontinuous permafrost degradation into islandlike frozen soil, and
   gradually disappearing island permafrost. Permafrost degradation leads
   to deterioration of the ecological environment in cold regions. As a
   result, the belt of larch forests dominated by Larix gmelinii has
   shifted northwards and wetland areas with symbiotic relationships with
   permafrost have decreased significantly. With rapid retreat and thinning
   of permafrost and vegetation change, the CO2 and CH4 flux increases with
   mean air temperature from continuous to sporadic permafrost areas as a
   result of activity of methanogen enhancement, positively feeding back to
   climate warming. This paper reviews the features of permafrost
   degradation, the effects of permafrost degradation on wetland and forest
   ecosystem structure and function, and greenhouse gas emissions on
   latitudinal permafrost in NNE China. We also put forward critical
   questions about the aforementioned effects, including: (1) establish
   long-term permafrost observation systems to evaluate the distribution of
   permafrost and SLP change, in order to study the feedback of permafrost
   to climate change; (2) carry out research about the effects of
   permafrost degradation on the wetland ecosystem and the response of
   Xing'an larch to global change, and predict ecosystem dynamics in
   permafrost degradation based on long-term field observation; (3) focus
   intensively on the dynamics of greenhouse gas flux in permafrost
   degradation of Northeast China and the feedback of greenhouse gas
   emissions to climate change; (4) quantitative studies on the permafrost
   carbon feedback and vegetation carbon feedback due to permafrost change
   to climate multi-impact and estimate the balance of C in permafrost
   regions in the future.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change and variability has recently become a
   subject of increasing importance in climate change research with an
   objective to reduce the vulnerability of climate sensitive people. The
   present study was designed to identify and assess the adaptation
   strategies followed by the climate sensitive livestock rearers of
   coastal Odisha and West Bengal. Livestock rearers (480) were selected
   from 4 coastal districts of Odisha and West Bengal. The study revealed
   that 17 adaptation strategies were followed by the livestock rearer. To
   trace the relative importance among the adaptation strategies, an
   exclusively climate change adaptation index was developed. It was
   observed that change in micro-climate in cattle shed/grazing area/stall
   was the most preferred adaptation strategy followed by providing the
   frequent clean and fresh drinking water and additional
   washing/sprinkling of cattle and buffaloes. Livestocks are very much
   susceptible to heat stress. Therefore, most of the livestock rearers
   followed heat alleviating adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Current power systems on remote islands use diesel generators (DG) that
   have high operational and maintenance costs, and emit excessive amounts
   of carbon dioxide. In this respect, power systems based on renewable
   energy are currently gaining research attention, with the aim of
   improving the economic performance and reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, as the output of renewable energy fluctuates and
   varies depending on weather conditions, a battery energy storage system
   (BESS) and DG are required to stabilize the renewable energy output.
   Then the capacity balances of renewable energy, BESS and DG and these
   operation methods are main issues. In this paper, several output control
   methods were proposed for DG and the appropriate generators capacity
   were evaluated. The effectiveness of the methods was then verified by
   conducting economic and environmental evaluations. This study conducted
   a numerical simulation using real data, measured in a power system on an
   existing island in Japan.},

Title = {Mitigation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agricultural Fields through
   Bioresource Management},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Efficient bioresource management can alter soil biochemistry and soil
   physical properties, leading to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   from agricultural fields. The objective of this study was to evaluate
   the role of organic amendments including biodigestate (BD), biochar
   (BC), and their combinations with inorganic fertilizer (IF) in
   increasing carbon sequestration potential and mitigation of GHG
   emissions from potato (Solanum tuberosum) fields. Six soil amendments
   including BD, BC, IF, and their combinations BDIF and BCIF, and control
   (C) were replicated four times under a completely randomized block
   design during the 2021 growing season of potatoes in Prince Edward
   Island, Canada. An LI-COR gas analyzer was used to monitor emissions of
   carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from
   treatment plots. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results depicted higher
   soil moisture-holding capacities in plots at relatively lower elevations
   and comparatively lesser volumetric moisture content in plots at higher
   elevations. Soil moisture was also impacted by soil temperature and
   rainfall events. There was a significant effect of events of data
   collection, i.e., the length of the growing season (p-value <= 0.05) on
   soil surface temperature, leading to increased GHG emissions during the
   summer months. ANOVA results also revealed that BD, BC, and BCIF
   significantly (p-value <= 0.05) sequestered more soil organic carbon
   than other treatments. The six experimental treatments and twelve data
   collection events had significant effects (p-value <= 0.05) on the
   emission of CO2. However, the BD plots had the least emissions of CO2
   followed by BC plots, and the emissions increased with an increase in
   atmospheric/soil temperature. Results concluded that organic fertilizers
   and their combinations with inorganic fertilizers help to reduce the
   emissions from the agricultural soils and enhance environmental
   sustainability.},

Title = {Spatial Variability of Annual Estimates of Methane Emissions in a
   Phragmites Australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. Dominated Restored Coastal
   Brackish Fen},

Abstract = {Methane is a major greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25
   times higher than carbon dioxide over a 100 year time horizon.
   Determining annual emission estimates, usually specified for different
   vegetation types under particular land use, requires the use of chamber
   measurements. These emission estimates may be strongly biased towards
   the lower or upper end by the spatial arrangement of measurement spots
   in the ecosystem. Here, we analyze the spatial variability of annual
   methane emission estimates based on non-steady state closed chamber
   measurements in pure and mixed stands of Phragmites australis (Cav.)
   Trin ex Steud. in a restored coastal brackish fen. Annual methane
   emission estimates per measurement location vary largely between 46 and
   1,329 kg ha(-1) a(-1) CH4 but they do not differ significantly between
   pure and mixed stands of P. australis. Mantel tests show a significant
   correlation of distances between spots and the variation in methane
   emission estimates (p < 0.05). Spatial correlation of water levels and
   annual methane emission estimates is not significant. Empirical
   variograms suggest that variance in annual methane emission estimates is
   not increasing with increasing spatial distance. However, spots that
   share larger distances may differ considerably in their annual methane
   emission estimates. At the same time, spots that share smaller
   distances-though these exceed the distances common to many closed
   chamber measurement setups-may differ less in their annual methane
   emission estimates. Thus, a huge part of the natural variation in annual
   methane emissions in a particular ecosystem or vegetation type may be
   missed when using the typical clustered arrangement of measurement
   locations in closed chamber studies. Therefore, we suggest that
   measurement locations should cover a wide spatial extent to improve the
   reliability of annual emission estimates per vegetation type and
   ecosystem, and that the number of measurement locations appropriate
   should be determined by pre-studies whenever possible.},

Title = {Annual carbon sequestration and loss rates under altered hydrology and

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {21},
Pages = {6370-6384},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Peatlands drained for agriculture or forestry are susceptible to the
   rapid release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through enhanced microbial
   decomposition and increased frequency of deep peat fires. We present
   evidence that rewetting drained subtropical wooded peatlands (STWPs)
   along the southeastern USA coast, primarily pocosin bogs, could prevent
   significant carbon (C) losses. To quantify GHG emissions and storage
   from drained and rewetted pocosin we used eddy covariance techniques,
   the first such estimates that have been applied to this major bog type,
   on a private drained (PD) site supplemented by static chamber
   measurements at PD and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge. Net
   ecosystem exchange measurements showed that the loss was 21.2 Mg CO2
   ha(-1) year(-1) (1 Mg = 10(6) g) in the drained pocosin. Under a
   rewetted scenario, where the annual mean water table depth (WTD)
   decreased from 60 to 30 cm, the C loss was projected to fall to 2 Mg CO2
   ha(-1) year(-1), a 94\% reduction. If the WTD was 20 cm, the peatlands
   became a net carbon sink (-3.3 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). Hence, net C
   reductions could reach 24.5 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), and when scaled up
   to the 4000 ha PD site nearly 100,000 Mg CO2 year(-1) of creditable C
   could be amassed. We conservatively estimate among the 0.75 million ha
   of southeastern STWPs, between 450 and 770 km(2) could be rewet,
   reducing annual GHG emissions by 0.96-1.6 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) of CO2,
   through suppressed microbial decomposition and 1.7-2.8 Tg via fire
   prevention, respectively. Despite covering <0.01\% of US land area,
   rewetting drained pocosin can potentially provide 2.4\% of the annual
   CO2 nationwide reduction target of 0.18 Pg (1 Pg = 10(15) g). Suggesting
   pocosin restoration can contribute disproportionately to the US goal of
   achieving net-zero emission by 2050.},

   Water-resource managers worldwide are considering the potential role of

   efficient at removing nutrients from through-flowing water. However,
   recent studies have highlighted disadvantages of such use of wetlands,

Title = {Mitigating the carbon footprint and improving productivity of ruminant
   livestock agriculture using a red seaweed},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {259},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Ruminants are responsible for a large proportion of agricultural
   greenhouse gas emissions in the form of methane. This can be managed. It
   is a global initiative to increase productivity of the livestock sector
   to meet a growing population, but with emphasis on decreasing enteric
   methane to achieve emissions targets. We investigated the marine red
   macroalga (seaweed) Asparagopsis taxiformis as a feed ingredient to
   fundamentally eliminate enteric methane in beef cattle fed a high grain
   diet and provide evidence of improved livestock production performance.
   Asparagopsis was included in the feed of Brahman-Angus cross steers at
   0.00\%, 0.05\%, 0.10\%, and 0.20\% of feed organic matter. Emissions
   were monitored in respiration chambers fortnightly over 90 d of
   treatment, steers were weighed weekly prior to feeding, feed intake
   monitored daily, rumen fluid samples collected in conjunction with
   respiration chambers for assessment of rumen function, feces were
   collected for bromoform residue analysis, and meat, organ, and fat were
   collected post slaughter for residue analysis and sensory evaluation.
   Steers receiving 0.10\% and 0.20\% Asparagopsis demonstrated decreased
   methane up to 40\% and 98\%, and demonstrated weight gain improvements
   of 53\% and 42\%, respectively. There was no negative effect on daily
   feed intake, feed conversion efficiencies, or rumen function, and no
   residues or changes in meat eating quality were detected. Commercial
   production of Asparagopsis could create new economies, and with low
   inclusion rates of this seaweed in ruminant diets the industry has the
   potential to revolutionize management of greenhouse gas emissions across
   the ruminant livestock sector with complementary benefits to the
   environment, and economy of the wider agriculture sector. (C) 2020

Title = {Beyond coastal protection: A robust approach to enhance environmental
   and social outcomes of coastal adaptation},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {217},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Hard coastal protective infrastructure, such as breakwaters, are a
   common adaptation strategy to protect assets, increase safety and
   improve navigation by reducing erosion and flood risks along coastlines
   globally. However, protective structures can have pervasive impacts on
   use patterns, aesthetics and associated ecosystems, threatening
   ecosystem goods and services upon which humans depend. Guided by a
   recent Australian state Government strategy that aims to plan for ``a
   healthy coast and sea managed for the greatest wellbeing of the
   community, now and into the future{''}, we present a decision-making
   support tool for practitioners to help achieve more sustainable
   solutions to coastal adaptation into the future. Sustainable coastal
   adaptation needs to consider the environmental and socio-economic
   consequences of hard protective infrastructure, as well as the increased
   vulnerability due to rising sea levels. To demonstrate our arguments, we
   introduce three different coastal scenarios. We also discuss
   alternatives to coastal protection and make scenario-specific
   recommendations to enhance environmental and socio-economic outcomes of
   coastal adaptation. In general, the implementation of hard protective
   infrastructure should probably be a last resort after retreat and soft
   approaches have been ruled out as viable options. Where protective
   infrastructure is the current best option, environmental and
   socioeconomic outcomes can be enhanced using eco-engineering and
   multi-use features. In the long term, however, retreat from some coastal
   areas may be necessary and existing infrastructure might be removed or
   abandoned.},

Title = {Algal capture of carbon dioxide; biomass generation as a tool for
   greenhouse gas mitigation with reference to New Zealand energy strategy

Abstract = {The use of algae to capture carbon dioxide as a method for greenhouse
   gas mitigation is discussed. A small fraction of the sunlight energy
   that bathes Earth is captured by photosynthesis and drives most living
   systems. Life on Earth is carbon-based and the energy is used to fix
   atmospheric carbon dioxide into biological material (biomass), indeed
   fossil fuels that we consume today are a legacy of mostly algal
   photosynthesis. Algae can be thought of as marine and freshwater plants
   that have higher photosynthetic efficiencies than terrestrial plants and
   are more efficient capturing carbon (Box I). They have other favourable
   characteristics for this purpose. In the context of New Zealand energy
   strategy and policy I discuss progress in growing algae and seaweeds
   with emphasis on their application for exhaust flue carbon recycling for
   possible generation of useful biomass. I also introduce schemes
   utilising wild oceanic algae for carbon dioxide sequestration and the
   merits and possible adverse effects of using this approach. This paper
   is designed as an approachable review of the science and technology for
   policy makers and a summary of the New Zealand policy environment for
   those wishing to deploy biological carbon sequestration. (C) 2009

Title = {Evaluating Economic Reasons for China's Stance on Ship-Based Greenhouse
   Gas Reduction Negotiations},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2010},
Number = {2166},
Pages = {1-9},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping are an increasing
   concern of those interested in mitigating global climate change.
   Countries have not reached a consensus on snip-based greenhouse gas
   reduction strategies and on the responsibilities each country should
   take. In this paper, the economic reasons for China's insistence that
   the regulatory regime of the International Maritime Organization
   specifically address the Kyoto axiom of ``common but differentiated
   responsibility{''} is evaluated, and fundamental equations relating
   power, speed, energy consumption, and cost to evaluate the impact of
   emission reduction on a selected set of routes and vessel data are
   applied. The policy options that are under discussion regarding
   ship-based carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and China's viewpoint are
   reviewed, and economic justifications for China's stance are discussed.
   Estimates indicate that ships flying the Chinese flag accounted for
   3.4\% of the approximately 35 million metric tons of CO2 emitted by
   container ships calling at U.S. ports in 2005, and ships carrying
   Chinese exports accounted for 17\%. Further estimates suggest that China
   will pay approximately \$238 to \$298 million more for container ship
   services and international trade with the United States if all vessels
   are required to reduce ship-based CO2 emissions. The direct cost is
   equivalent to about 0.20\% of the total value of goods carried by
   container ships to the United States from China, or Sin \$11 increase
   per ton of cargo. For some low-value goods, this is about an 8\%
   increase in terms of price per ton, decreasing the already thin profit
   margins of Chinese exporters. These results, discussed in the context of
   policy-based actions, may limit or affect the choice of policy
   instruments.},

Title = {REDUCED RISK OF NORTH AMERICAN COLD EXTREMES DUE TO CONTINUED ARCTIC SEA
   ICE LOSS},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {96},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In early January 2014, an Arctic air outbreak brought extreme cold and
   heavy snowfall to central and eastern North America, causing widespread
   disruption and monetary losses. The media extensively reported the cold
   snap, including debate on whether human-induced climate change was
   partly responsible. Related to this, one particular hypothesis garnered
   considerable attention: that rapid Arctic sea ice loss may be increasing
   the risk of cold extremes in the midlatitudes. Here we use large
   ensembles of model simulations to explore how the risk of North American
   daily cold extremes is anticipated to change in the future, in response
   to increases in greenhouse gases and the component of that response
   solely due to Arctic sea ice loss. Specifically, we examine the changing
   probability of daily cold extremes as (un)common as the 7 January 2014
   event. Projected increases in greenhouse gases decrease the likelihood
   of North American cold extremes in the future. Days as cold or colder
   than 7 January 2014 are still projected to occur in the mid-twenty-first
   century (2030-49), albeit less frequently than in the late twentieth
   century (1980-99). However, such events will cease to occur by the late
   twenty-first century (2080-99), assuming greenhouse gas emissions
   continue unabated. Continued Arctic sea ice loss is a major driver of
   decreasednot increasedNorth America cold extremes. Projected Arctic sea
   ice loss alone reduces the odds of such an event by one-quarter to
   one-third by the mid-twenty-first century, and to zero (or near zero) by
   the late twenty-first century.},

Title = {Incorporating climate change adaptation into marine protected area
   planning},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Pages = {3251-3267},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly impacting marine protected areas (MPAs)
   and MPA networks, yet adaptation strategies are rarely incorporated into
   MPA design and management plans according to the primary scientific
   literature. Here we review the state of knowledge for adapting existing
   and future MPAs to climate change and synthesize case studies (n = 27)
   of how marine conservation planning can respond to shifting
   environmental conditions. First, we derive a generalized conservation
   planning framework based on five published frameworks that incorporate
   climate change adaptation to inform MPA design. We then summarize
   examples from the scientific literature to assess how conservation goals
   were defined, vulnerability assessments performed and adaptation
   strategies incorporated into the design and management of existing or
   new MPAs. Our analysis revealed that 82\% of real-world examples of
   climate change adaptation in MPA planning derive from tropical reefs,
   highlighting the need for research in other ecosystems and habitat
   types. We found contrasting recommendations for adaptation strategies at
   the planning stage, either focusing only on climate refugia, or aiming
   for representative protection of areas encompassing the full range of
   expected climate change impacts. Recommendations for MPA management were
   more unified and focused on adaptative management approaches. Lastly, we
   evaluate common barriers to adopting climate change adaptation
   strategies based on reviewing studies which conducted interviews with
   MPA managers and other conservation practitioners. This highlights a
   lack of scientific studies evaluating different adaptation strategies
   and shortcomings in current governance structures as two major barriers,
   and we discuss how these could be overcome. Our review provides a
   comprehensive synthesis of planning frameworks, case studies, adaptation
   strategies and management actions which can inform a more coordinated
   global effort to adapt existing and future MPA networks to continued
   climate change.},

Title = {Identifying and prioritising adaptation options for a coastal freshwater
   supply and demand system under climatic and non-climatic changes},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Coastal freshwater supply and demand systems are expected to be
   significantly affected by changes to both climatic and non-climatic
   drivers over coming decades. Adapting to these changes to secure
   adequate freshwater to meet the rising demands of socio-economic
   development has become a critical task for decision-makers. Whilst a
   range of adaptation options may be available, the complexity and
   interconnectedness of water resource systems make it challenging to
   identify which options are likely to be most feasible and effective.
   Here, we present a Bayesian decision network (BDN) that was co-developed
   with local experts to identify appropriate adaptation options for
   freshwater management under both current and likely future conditions in
   the Da Do Basin of coastal Vietnam. Potential adaptation options were
   prioritised according to cost-effectiveness based on relative costs
   incurred and relative utilities delivered across a range of future
   scenarios. The BDN model indicated that cost-effectiveness of adaptation
   options varied between future scenarios. Constructing pumping stations
   was the most cost-effective option under climate change scenarios,
   whilst a higher water price was the most cost-effective option under
   non-climatic changes. Under combined climatic and non-climatic changes,
   constructing pumping stations in combination with increasing water
   prices provided the most cost-effective option. The model affords an
   opportunity for decision-makers in the Da Do Basin to prioritise and
   evaluate appropriate and feasible adaptation actions under different
   scenarios with respect to multiple drivers.},

Abstract = {Owing to rising levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and oceans,
   climate change poses significant environmental, economic, and social

   fermentation using carbon-fixing microorganisms offers an economically
   viable and scalable solution with unique feedstock and product
   flexibility that has been commercialized recently. We review the state
   of the art of gas fermentation and discuss opportunities to accelerate
   future development and rollout. We discuss the current commercial
   process for conversion of waste gases to ethanol, including the
   underlying biology, challenges in process scale-up, and progress on
   genetic tool development and metabolic engineering to expand the product

Abstract = {This paper proposes a makeshift approach to carbon accounting in
   Egyptian towns, which takes into account the limited resources of local
   municipalities and the widespread lack of available data. Egypt is
   highly vulnerable to climate change. Escalating temperatures, water
   scarcity, and rising sea levels threaten all parts of society. Cities
   absorb a growing portion of the increasing population and are especially
   exposed to the precarious effects of global warming. Consequently, there
   is an emergent need for mitigation and adaptation measures in urban
   areas, which presuppose an adequate accounting of the local greenhouse
   gas emissions. This paper suggest a series of six steps that can be
   followed by municipal decision makers to estimate their emissions by
   collecting existing information on site and utilizing systematic
   approximations to make up for missing statistics. (C) 2016 The Authors

Abstract = {This study investigates the relationships between emission reduction,
   long-term orientation, green strategy, and green innovation among
   maritime vessel-owning firms of various sizes in the Norwegian maritime
   sector. A change from the utilization of fossil fuels and move toward
   more sustainable sources of energy demand substantial financial
   investments and behavioral changes but are fundamental to preventing
   further climate change. This study examines the greening of the
   Norwegian fleet through a structural equation model based upon 246
   survey responses. Although our model does not show a significant direct
   relationship between long-term orientation and emission reductions, we
   do find that long-term orientation is indirectly related to emission
   reductions because of its relationships with green strategy and green
   innovation. Moreover, as mediators, green innovation and green strategy
   share direct associations with firms' reductions of greenhouse gases and
   environmentally harmful emissions. Implications for practitioners and
   policy makers are proposed.},

Title = {A life cycle assessment comparison of materials for a tidal stream
   turbine blade},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {309},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Electricity generated from tidal streams via underwater turbines has
   significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil-fuel derived
   electricity. However, tidal stream turbine blades are conventionally
   manufactured from non-recyclable reinforced polymer composite materials.
   Tidal stream capacity is forecast to be over 1GW by 2030, which using
   current methods will ultimately produce around 6000 tonnes of
   non-recyclable blade waste. This waste is currently disposed of in
   landfill or incinerated, both of which have greenhouse gas and human
   health impacts. To address a growing waste management problem, this
   high-level study considers for the first time a range of conventional
   and bio-based materials, manufacturing methods, and end-of-life
   treatments to determine the blade materials and designs likely to have
   low environmental impact. A finite element model is used to develop
   material cases and Life Cycle Assessment is used to study the impacts of
   each over a `cradle to dock, dock to grave' scope. The impact of
   material choices on cost and modifications to the wider turbine are
   considered. Compared to a glass fibre composite turbine blade, steel
   blades are around 2.5 times heavier, and incur additional environmental
   impact due to upgrades required to the wider turbine. Carbon fibre
   composite blades weigh less than glass fibre, but cause greenhouse 80\%
   greater gas emissions, and human and ecosystem health risks, so are also
   not recommended. The best environmental performance of the cases
   considered was a flax fibre composite. This material offers greenhouse
   gas emissions around 50\% lower than glass fibre materials when
   manufactured using conventional epoxy resin, and around 40\% lower when
   manufactured using recyclable epoxy resin, which also enables the reuse
   of the fibre and may further reduce environmental impact. Initial
   results suggest that the cost of these materials are similar to or lower
   than conventional composite materials.},

Title = {Temporal variations of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration
   and stock from a tidal constructed mangrove wetland},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {149},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study used a self-developed a NDIR monitoring system to
   continuously monitor GHG emissions from a tidal constructed mangrove
   wetland at three typical habitats (mudflat, mangrove, and water surface)
   in four seasons. The NDIR monitoring system is able to explore the
   diurnal and seasonal variation of GHG emissions from the tidal
   constructed mangrove wetland and to estimate more precisely for the GHG
   emission based carbon budget of the wetland. The continuous monitoring
   technique is feasible and valuable for assessing the temporal variation
   of GHG uptake/emission to/from the wetland. Daytime CO2 emissions were
   always lower than those at night-time due to photosynthesis process,
   while an opposite trend was observed for CH4 and N2O emissions. Seasonal
   variation of GHGs showed that the highest GHG emissions was observed in
   summer, and followed by fall, spring, and winter. For three typical
   habitats, mangrove emitted more amounts of GHGs than mudflat and water
   surface.},

   mudflat},

Volume = {95},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1960-1971},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Environmental pulses, or sudden, marked changes to the conditions within
   an ecosystem, can be important drivers of resource availability in many
   systems. In this study, we investigated the effect of tidal pulsing on
   the fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful greenhouse gas, from a
   marine intertidal mudflat on the north shore of Massachusetts, USA. We
   found these tidal flat sediments to be a sink of N2O at low tide with an
   average uptake rate of -6.7 +/- 2 mu mol.m(-2).h(-1). Further, this N2O
   sink increased the longer sediments were tidally exposed. These field
   measurements, in conjunction with laboratory nutrient additions,
   revealed that this flux appears to be driven primarily by sediment
   denitrification. Additionally, N2O uptake was most responsive to
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen with phosphorus (DIN+DIP) addition,
   suggesting that the N2O consumption process may be P limited.
   Furthermore, nutrient addition experiments suggest that dissimilatory
   nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) releases N2O at the highest levels
   of nitrate fertilization. Our findings indicate that tidal flats are
   important sinks of N2O, potentially capable of offsetting the release of
   this potent greenhouse gas by other, nearby ecosystems.},

Title = {Impacts of prescribed burning on soil greenhouse gas fluxes in a
   suburban native forest of south-eastern Queensland, Australia},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Pages = {6279-6290},
Abstract = {Prescribed burning is a forest management practice that is widely used
   in Australia to reduce the risk of damaging wildfires. Prescribed
   burning can affect both carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in the
   forest and thereby influence the soil-atmosphere exchange of major
   greenhouse gases, i.e. carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous
   oxide (N2O). To quantify the impact of a prescribed burning (conducted
   on 27 May 2014) on greenhouse gas exchange and the potential controlling
   mechanisms, we carried out a series of field measurements before (August
   2013) and after (August 2014 and November 2014) the fire. Gas exchange
   rates were determined in four replicate plots which were burned during
   the combustion and in another four adjacent unburned plots located in
   green islands, using a set of static chambers. Surface soil properties
   including temperature, pH, moisture, soil C and N pools were also
   determined either by in situ measurement or by analysing surface 10 cm
   soil samples. All of the chamber measurements indicated a net sink of
   atmospheric CH4, with mean CH4 uptake ranging from 1.15 to 1.99 mg m(-2)
   d(-1). Prescribed burning significantly enhanced CH4 uptake as indicated
   by the significant higher CH4 uptake rates in the burned plots measured
   in August 2014. In the following 3 months, the CH4 uptake rate was
   recovered to the pre-burning level. Mean CO2 emission from the forest
   soils ranged from 2721.76 to 7113.49 mg m(-2) d(-1). The effect of
   prescribed burning on CO2 emission was limited within the first 3
   months, as no significant difference was observed between the burned and
   the adjacent unburned plots in both August and November 2014. The CO2
   emissions showed more seasonal variations, rather than the effects of
   prescribed burning. The N2O emission in the plots was quite low, and no
   significant impact of prescribed burning was observed. The changes in
   understory plants and litter layers, surface soil temperature, C and N
   substrate availability and microbial activities, following the
   prescribed burning, were the factors that controlled the greenhouse gas
   exchanges. Our results suggested that the low-intensity prescribed
   burning would decrease soil CO2 emission and increase CH4 uptake, but
   this effect would be present within a relatively short period. Only
   slight changes in the surface soil properties during the combustion and
   very limited impacts of prescribed burning on the mineral soils
   supported the rapid recovery of the greenhouse gas exchange rates.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Of the several critical challenges present in environmental microbiology
   today, one is the assessment of the contribution of microorganisms in
   the carbon cycle in the Earth-climate system. Karstic subterranean
   ecosystems have been overlooked until recently. Covering up to 25\% of
   the land surface and acting as a rapid CH4 sink and alternately as a CO2
   source or sink, karstic subterranean ecosystems play a decisive role in
   the carbon cycle in terms of their contribution to the global balance of
   greenhouse gases. Recent data indicate that microbiota must play a
   significant ecological role in the biogeochemical processes that control
   the composition of the subterranean atmosphere, as well as in the
   availability of nutrients for the ecosystem. Nevertheless, there are
   still essential gaps in our knowledge concerning the budgets of
   greenhouse gases at the ecosystem scale and the possible feedback
   mechanisms between environmental-microclimatic conditions and the rates
   and type of activity of microbial communities in subterranean
   ecosystems. Another challenge is searching for bioactive compounds
   (antibiotics) used for treating human diseases. At present, there is a
   global health emergency and a strong need for novel biomolecules. In
   recent decades, great research efforts have been made to extract
   antibiotics from marine organisms. More recently, caves have been
   receiving considerable attention in search of novel antibiotics. Cave
   methanotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria are producers of bioactive
   compounds and may be potential sources of metabolites with
   antibacterial, antifungal or anticancer activities of interest in
   pharmacological and medical research, as well as enzymes with a further
   biotechnological use. Here we also show that bacteria isolated from
   mines, a still unexplored niche for scientists in search of novel
   compounds, can be a source of novel secondary metabolites.},

Title = {Identifying the trade-offs between climate change mitigation and
   adaptation in urban land use planning: An empirical study in a coastal
   city},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {133},
Number = {B},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cities play a significant role in climate change mitigation and
   adaptation. Urban land planning shapes the urban form and is considered
   to be an effective approach for climate change mitigation and
   adaptation. Yet, there is little knowledge about what urban forms can
   reduce both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate stresses while
   considering trade-offs between them. Here, we investigate the role of
   urban land use in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. In
   particular, we assess quantitatively the competition between strategies
   for mitigation and adaptation and identify potential win-win solutions
   in land use responses. Using a coastal city as a case study, we find
   that the land use strategies for unilateral mitigation or adaptation can
   cause contradicting consequences with respect to the reductions in GHG
   emissions and climate stresses, i.e. reductions in GHGs could increase
   climate stresses or vice versa. Poorly integrated strategies potentially
   may compromise international efforts to meet the Climate Action in the
   Sustainable Development Goals. Properly integrated mitigation and
   adaptation strategies, or climate-sensitive land use planning, however,
   can lead to win-win outcomes and eventually achieve co-benefits. Yet,
   any co-benefits will gradually diminish if there is a delay in
   climate-sensitive land use planning, implying growing GHGs and
   intensified climate stresses. Our analysis indicates that integrating
   climate change mitigation and adaptation in urban land use needs to be
   enacted as soon as possible: any delays in implementation reduce the
   window to act to maximize the co-benefits.},

Abstract = {Increasingly countries are seeking to reduce emission of greenhouse
   gases from the agricultural industries, and livestock production in
   particular, as part of their climate change management. While many
   reviews update progress in mitigation research, a quantitative
   assessment of the efficacy and performance-consequences of nutritional
   strategies to mitigate enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants
   has been lacking. A meta-analysis was conducted based on 108 refereed
   papers from recent animal studies (2000-2020) to report effects on CH4
   production, CH4 yield and CH4 emission intensity from 8 dietary
   interventions. The interventions (oils, microalgae, nitrate, ionophores,
   protozoal control, phytochemicals, essential oils and
   3-nitrooxypropanol). Of these, macroalgae and 3-nitrooxypropanol showed
   greatest efficacy in reducing CH4 yield (g CH4/kg of dry matter intake)
   at the doses trialled. The confidence intervals derived for the
   mitigation efficacies could be applied to estimate the potential to
   reduce national livestock emissions through the implementation of these
   dietary interventions. (c) 2021 Chinese Association of Animal Science

Title = {Comment on Geoengineering with seagrasses: is credit due where credit is

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In their recent review, `Geoengineering with seagrasses: is credit due
   where credit is given?,' Johannessen and Macdonald (2016) invoke the
   prospect of carbon offset-credit over-allocation by the Verified Carbon
   Standard as a pretense for their concerns about published seagrass
   carbon burial rate and global stock estimates. Johannessen and Macdonald
   (2016) suggest that projects seeking offset-credits under the Verified
   Carbon Standard methodology VM0033: Methodology for Tidal Wetland and
   Seagrass Restoration will overestimate long-term (100 yr) sediment
   organic carbon (SOC) storage because issues affecting carbon burial
   rates bias storage estimates. These issues warrant serious consideration
   by the seagrass research community; however, VM0033 does not refer to
   seagrass SOC `burial rates' or `storage.' Projects seeking credits under
   VM0033 must document greenhouse gas emission reductions over time,
   relative to a baseline scenario, in order to receive credits. Projects
   must also monitor changes in carbon pools, including SOC, to confirm
   that observed benefits are maintained over time. However, VM0033 allows
   projects to conservatively underestimate project benefits by citing
   default values for specific accounting parameters, including CO2
   emissions reductions. We therefore acknowledge that carbon crediting
   methodologies such as VM0033 are sensitive to the quality of the
   seagrass literature, particularly when permitted default factors are
   based in part on seagrass burial rates. Literature-derived values should
   be evaluated based on the concerns raised by Johannessen and Macdonald
   (2016), but these issues should not lead to credit over-allocation in
   practice, provided VM0033 is rigorously followed. These issues may,
   however, affect the feasibility of particular seagrass offset projects.},

Abstract = {Shore nourishment is considered an effective soft coastal protection
   measure for sandy shorelines. However, sand demand and costs are high,
   especially as nourishment has to be repeated regularly due to ongoing
   erosion. Seagrass meadows are able to trap and stabilise sediment by
   reducing bed shear stress. Moreover, they reduce flow velocity and wave
   energy in regions beyond their boundaries. Especially small species may
   not provide these ecosystem services sufficiently to protect shorelines
   from erosion, but they may stabilise beach profiles enough to increase
   nourishment intervals. This review discusses the potential benefits of
   integrating ecosystem services provided by seagrass meadows, both
   existing and newly planted, in nourishment plans, and also addresses
   potential limitations such as unsuitable hydrodynamic conditions and
   seasonality. Finally, it highlights knowledge gaps that should be
   addressed by interdisciplinary research to improve nourishment plans and
   use seagrass ecosystem services to their full potential.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on a specific environmental evaluation method - Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) and it estimates biofuel greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and compares to fossil fuels. It is mainly evaluated by the
   mean Global Warming impact indicator, expressed in grams of CO2
   equivalent per MJ of energy (gCO(2)eq.MJ(-1)). Biofuels are highly
   relevant renewable energy options on a global scale. Comparing with
   fossil fuels, biofuels in some cases can be carbon neutral or even
   carbon negative and play an important role in the reduction of GHG
   emissions. A number of LCA have shown that first generation biofuels
   provide a little to no benefit for GHG reductions compared to fossil
   fuels, particularly when indirect effects are considered. LCAs of second
   and third generation biofuels exhibit great variability and uncertainty
   but are intended to achieve greater GHG reductions. Highly possible
   Arctic Ocean ice meltdown in the late summer as soon as in September
   2015 and accelerated methane hydrate destabilization in the Arctic Ocean
   seabed via ocean warming could cause abrupt climate change in the
   following decade. Mitigation of climate change requires to use only
   biofuels with the global warming impact indicator close to 0
   gCO(2)eq.MJ(-1) (Carbon Neutral) or - gCO(2)eq.MJ(-1) (Carbon Negative).},

Abstract = {Coastal communities are among the most vulnerable to climate risks.
   Despite the negligence of climate policy at the federal level in the
   United States, subnational governments have taken action to adapt to
   climate change impacts. Using national-level data on subnational
   government climate activities, this research examines three aspects of
   coastal community adaptation actions. First, it examines whether there
   are differences in climate adaptation activity between coastal and
   non-coastal communities. It then tests the relative importance of
   political partisanship, population, perception of climate risk, and
   awareness of state-level climate planning effort. Lastly, it examines
   the impact of participation within climate policy networks on the
   likelihood of a subnational government taking a climate adaptation
   action. Three types of network partners are examined: those focused on
   sea-level rise and coastal communities, climate change mitigation, and
   general environmental organizations. Concern about severe storms,
   awareness of state plans, and having a network partner focused either on
   climate mitigation or the environment were found to be statistically
   significant indicators of climate adaptation action. The paper discusses
   the importance of understanding the localized context of adaptation
   within nested governance structures, and how informal policy networks
   can facilitate learning and innovation across coastal communities.},

   and Operational Profiles Influence Energy Demand and Greenhouse Gas
   Emissions},
Journal = {ENERGIES},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A ``Well-to-Propeller{''} Life Cycle Assessment of maritime transport
   was performed with a European geographical focus. Four typical types of
   vessels with specific operational profiles were assessed: a container
   vessel and a tanker (both with 2-stroke engines), a passenger
   roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Pax) and a cruise vessel (both with 4-stroke
   engines). All main engines were dual fuel operated with Heavy Fuel Oil
   (HFO) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Alternative onshore and offshore
   fuel supply chains were considered. Primary energy use and greenhouse
   gas emissions were assessed. Raw material extraction was found to be the
   most impactful life cycle stage (similar to 90\% of total energy use).
   Regarding greenhouse gases, liquefaction was the key issue. When
   transitioning from HFO to LNG, the systems were mainly influenced by a
   reduction in cargo capacity due to bunkering requirements and methane
   slip, which depends on the fuel supply chain (onshore has 64\% more slip
   than offshore) and the engine type (4-stroke engines have 20\% more slip
   than 2-stroke engines). The combination of alternative fuel supply
   chains and specific operational profiles allowed for a complete system
   assessment. The results demonstrated that multiple opposing drivers
   affect the environmental performance of maritime transport, a useful
   insight towards establishing emission abatement strategies.},

Title = {Hydrological, geochemical and land use drivers of greenhouse gas
   dynamics in eleven sub-tropical streams},
Journal = {AQUATIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freshwater streams are poorly
   quantified in sub-tropical climates, especially in the southern
   hemisphere where land use is rapidly changing. Here, we examined the
   distribution, potential drivers, and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2),
   nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) from eleven Australian freshwater
   streams with varying catchment land uses yet similar hydrology,
   geomorphology, and climate. These sub-tropical streams were a source of
   CO2 (74 +/- 39 mmol m(-2) day(-1)), CH4 (0.04 +/- 0.06 mmol m(-2)
   day(-1)), and N2O (4.01 +/- 5.98 mu mol m(-2) day(-1)) to the
   atmosphere. CO2 accounted for similar to 97\% of all CO2-equivalent
   emissions with CH4 (similar to 1.5\%) and N2O (similar to 1.5\%) playing
   a minor role. Episodic rainfall events drove changes in stream GHG due
   to the release of soil NOx (nitrate + nitrite) and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC). Groundwater discharge as traced by radon (Rn-222, a
   natural groundwater tracer) was not an apparent source of CO2 and CH4,
   but was a source of N2O in both agricultural and forest catchments. Land
   use played a subtle role on greenhouse gas dynamics. CO2 and CH4
   increased with catchment forest cover during the wet period, while N2O
   and CH4 increased with agricultural catchment area during the dry
   period. Overall, this study showed how DOC and NOx land use, and
   rainfall events interact to drive spatial and temporal dynamics of GHG
   emissions in sub-tropical streams using multiple linear regression
   modelling. Increasing intensive agricultural land use will likely
   decrease regional CO2 and CH4 emissions, but increase N2O.},

Title = {Evaluating the Effectiveness of Climate Change Adaptations in the
   World's Largest Mangrove Ecosystem},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal river delta and the
   largest uninterrupted mangrove ecosystem. A complex socio-ecological
   setting, coupled with disproportionately high climate-change exposure
   and severe ecological and social vulnerabilities, has turned it into a
   climate hotspot requiring well-designed adaptation interventions. We
   have used the fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM)-based approach to elicit and
   integrate stakeholders' perceptions regarding current climate forcing,
   consequent impacts, and efficacy of the existing adaptation measures. We
   have also undertaken climate modelling to ascertain long-term future
   trends of climate forcing. FCM-based simulations reveal that while
   existing adaptation practices provide resilience to an extent, they are
   grossly inadequate in the context of providing future resilience. Even
   well-planned adaptations may not be entirely transformative in such a
   fragile ecosystem. It was through FCM-based simulations that we realised
   that a coastal river delta in a developing nation merits special
   attention for climate-resilient adaptation planning and execution.
   Measures that are likely to enhance adaptive capabilities of the local
   communities include those involving gender-responsive and adaptive
   governance, human resource capacity building, commitments of global
   communities for adaptation financing, education and awareness
   programmes, and embedding indigenous and local knowledge into decision
   making.},

Abstract = {Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for addressing
   the impacts of climate change, yet are often considered separately. This
   paper examines the literature for evidence of the interactions of
   adaptation and mitigation measures across the agriculture, biodiversity,
   coasts, forests, urban and water sectors, focusing on Europe. It found
   that often adaptation and mitigation synergies and conflicts were not
   explicitly mentioned within a sector, let alone between sectors. Most
   measures, however, were found to have an effect on another sector,
   resulting in neutral, positive (synergies) or negative (conflicts)
   interactions within and between sectors. Many positive cross-sectoral
   interactions involved biodiversity or water and thus these could
   represent good starting places for the implementation of integrated,
   cross-sectoral strategies. Previous studies suggest that adaptation and
   mitigation are undertaken on different time and geographical scales;
   this study found many local scale measures which could facilitate
   integration between both adaptation and mitigation. It is important that
   cross-sectoral interaction of adaptation and mitigation measures are
   explicitly recognised if they are to be mainstreamed into policy, so
   that positive outcomes are enhanced and unintended consequences avoided.},

Abstract = {Temperature records indicate that the global annual mean surface air
   temperature (referred to as the global temperature) has risen by
   0.5-degrees-C since 1840. According to recent general circulation model
   calculations, by the year 2020 the global mean temperature will have
   risen to 1.3 to 2.5-degrees-C above the preindustrial (1840) mean. By
   the year 2070, the range of temperature increase will be 2.4 to
   5.1-degrees-C, and sea level will have risen 33 to 75 cm. Measurements
   from Antarctic ice cores show temperature swings of 4 to 5-degrees-C
   between ice ages and interglacial periods. Fossil fuel-based energy use
   through power generation and transportation is viewed as the major cause
   of the very recent and projected future temperature rise. Recent
   arguments of scientists and policy makers have increasingly focused on
   the exact scope of global-scale changes and consequences of the globally
   rising energy appetite. The question of global warming has become the
   most important scientific issue.},

Abstract = {The municipality of Gandiol, in northern Senegal, is affected by
   human-caused coastal erosion whose impact is compounded by climate
   change. In a region where the main activities are fishing, farming, and
   livestock production, coastal flooding has led to the salinization of
   the Senegal River and has contaminated local land and groundwater,
   destroying the homes and livelihoods of local populations. Faced with
   this environmental degradation, migration has become a component of the
   inhabitants' adaptation strategy. After presenting the specific
   environmental and migration context of Gandiol, this article presents a
   typology of migration's impacts on climate change adaptation strategies.
   Migrant remittances are used in several ways (to diversify income
   sources, to optimize investments, or to protect against future risks)
   and provide a means for women to develop their economic activity.},

Abstract = {Accurate estimations of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in tropical
   montane rainforests are critical for assessing the role of tropical
   forests in influencing global climate change. This research aimed to
   determine the diurnal variation in soil GHG fluxes and understand the
   effects of forest canopy gaps on GHG fluxes, and their major controlling
   factors. The diurnal fluxes of soil carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide
   (N2O) and methane (CH4) inside and outside three forest canopy gaps in a
   tropical montane rainforest were measured with a closed static chamber
   system in June 2015. The main results are as follows. (1) There was an
   obvious single-peak daily variation of soil GHG fluxes. (2) The averaged
   soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes of the whole day were closest to the daily
   average emission fluxes at 9:00 and 12:00 for CO2, 6:00 and 9:00 for
   N2O, and 9:00 and 12:00 for CH4, respectively. (3) Soil CO2 and N2O
   emissions (positive values) and CH4 uptake (negative values) were higher
   inside gaps than outside. (4) There were stronger exponential
   relationships between soil CO2 and N2O emissions and temperature inside
   gaps than outside, and there was a stronger quadratic relationship
   between CH4 uptake and temperature outside gaps than inside. However,
   significant relationships between soil CO2 (or CH4) and soil moisture
   only occurred inside gaps (P < 0.01). There were clear diurnal
   variations and significant effects of gaps on soil CO2, N2O and CH4
   fluxes. Our study indicated that understanding the different diurnal
   variations of soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes inside and outside canopy
   gaps could improve the accurate evaluation of soil GHG fluxes in
   tropical montane rainforests under a changing climate.},

Title = {Poor recovery of fungal denitrification limits nitrogen removal capacity
   in a constructed Gulf Coast marsh},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Widespread degradation and destruction of coastal wetlands over the last
   century have spurred on the practice of creating salt marshes to
   mitigate losses of wetland area and ecosystem function. Constructed
   marshes can quickly recover plant biomass, but biogeochemical functions,
   such as nitrogen removal capacity through denitrification, can take
   decades to centuries to recover. One potential mechanism for this
   uncoupling of structural and functional recovery is that an impaired
   microbial community subsequently impedes the nitrogen removal capacity
   of constructed marshes. While both bacteria and fungi can contribute to
   nitrogen removal via denitrification, little is known about fungal
   denitrification in wetlands, even though it has the potential to
   contribute to climate change via the production of the greenhouse gas
   nitrous oxide. Here, we measured fungal and bacterial denitrification
   potential rates and fungal biomass in sediments collected from a
   33-year-old constructed marsh and a reference natural marsh to assess
   both a) the relative contribution of each group to total nitrogen
   removal and b) whether fungal biomass accrual is a driver of functional
   recovery in salt marshes. To assess the relative contributions of fungi
   and bacteria to denitrification, we added selective inhibitors
   (antifungal, antibacterial, or both) to sediments from each marsh and
   measured potential fungal and bacterial denitrification rates. We also
   measured sediment ergosterol concentrations seasonally as a proxy for
   fungal biomass. In the absence of inhibitors, denitrification potential
   rates in the constructed marsh were three times lower than in natural
   marsh sediment. Further, denitrification rates in the constructed marsh
   remained similarly low regardless of increasing inhibitor concentration,
   whereas denitrification rates in the natural marsh declined with
   increasing inhibitor concentration. When either inhibitor was added
   alone, denitrification was stimulated in the natural marsh, but was
   suppressed in the constructed marsh, suggesting an apparent competitive
   release, where the reduction of either bacterial or fungal competition
   for substrate thereby allowed the remaining competitor greater access to
   the substrate, in the natural marsh. We observed that compared to the
   constructed marsh, fungi in the natural marsh contributed similar to
   30\% more (50\% vs. 21\%) to denitrification, and that fungal biomass
   was generally higher. Collectively, these data suggest that 3 decades
   post construction, denitrification rates and the contribution of fungal
   denitrification to total denitrification are lower in the constructed
   marsh than the natural marsh. These data also suggest that fungal
   biomass may limit the recovery of nitrogen removal in constructed
   marshes and that fungal denitrification can be an important pathway of N
   removal in salt marsh ecosystems.},

Title = {Opportunities for solar water desalination worldwide: Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {67-80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Water desalination is increasingly becoming a competitive solution for
   providing drinking-water in many countries around the world. The
   desalination of saline water has been recognized as one of the most
   sustainable and new water resource alternative. It plays a crucial role
   in the socio-economic development for many communities and industrial
   sectors. Currently there are more than 14,000 desalination plants in
   operation worldwide producing several billion gallons of water per day.
   Fifty-seven percent are in the Middle East and Gulf region where large
   scale conventional heat and power plants are installed. However, since
   they are operated using fossil fuels, they are becoming expensive to
   operate and the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions they produce are
   increasingly recognized as harmful to the environment. Moreover, such
   plants are not economically viable in remote areas, even in coastal
   regions where sea-water is abundant. Many areas often experience a
   shortage of fossil fuels and inadequate and unreliable electricity
   supply. The integration of renewable energy resources in desalination
   and water purification is becoming more viable as costs of conventional
   systems increase, commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are
   implemented and targets for exploiting renewable energy are set. Thus,
   solar energy could provide a sustainable alternative to drive the
   desalination plants, especially in countries which lie on the solar belt
   such as Africa, the Middle East, India, and China. This paper explores
   the challenges and opportunities of solar water desalination worldwide.
   It presents an extensive review of water desalination and solar
   desalination technologies that have been developed in recent years and
   the state-of-the-art for most important efforts in the field of
   desalination by using solar energy, including the economic and
   environmental aspects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A form of energy is called ``renewable energy{''} when it is available
   free and has no greenhouse gas emissions. Sun, waves, winds, tides and
   biomass are sources of renewable energy. Nowadays, a major importance is
   given to renewable energy sources in order to reduce the dependence on
   fossil fuels that will one day be depleted. The exploit of many
   renewable energy sources such as sun and wind power have progressed to a
   relatively high level. However, sea waves are an important source of
   renewable energy that is not yet developed in Lebanon. For this purpose,
   in this paper, a wave roller energy harvesting system has been designed
   and manufactured. The aim of this work is to determine the drag
   coefficient and to perform a stress analysis on this wave roller device:
   a system that harvests the sea wave energy to produce electricity. This
   study will present the numerical results obtained using high fidelity
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Also, a stress analysis
   study showed that the designed roller resists against the external
   forces predicted in the CFD study. The designed device is manufactured
   and tested on the Lebanese coast.},

Abstract = {World fossil fuel reserves, historical and current rates of consumption
   are reviewed and estimates of indigenous lives in geographical regions

   depleted by the year 2050. This would be accompanied by a substantial
   rise in global mean temperature. The effects of various protocols for
   the reductions of emissions are examined It is concluded that there is
   no alternative than to cease the production and release into the
   atmosphere of the more damaging man-made greenhouse gases as soon as is
   practicably possible and to seek a sustained reduction in the rates of
   combustion of fossil fuels world-wide via energy management and

Title = {Dominant role of greenhouse-gas forcing in the recovery of Sahel
   rainfall},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {8},
Pages = {757-U173},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sahelian summer rainfall, controlled by the West African monsoon,
   exhibited large-amplitude multidecadal variability during the twentieth
   century. Particularly important was the severe drought of the 1970s and
   1980s, which had widespread impacts(1-6). Research into the causes of
   this drought has identified anthropogenic aerosol forcing(3,4,7) and
   changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs; refs 1,2,6,8-11) as the most
   important drivers. Since the 1980s, there has been some recovery of
   Sahel rainfall amounts(2-6,11-14), although not to the pre-drought
   levels of the 1940s and 1950s. Here we report on experiments with the
   atmospheric component of a state-of-the-art global climate model to
   identify the causes of this recovery. Our results suggest that the
   direct influence of higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
   was the main cause, with an additional role for changes in anthropogenic
   aerosol precursor emissions. We find that recent changes in SSTs,
   although substantial, did not have a significant impact on the recovery.
   The simulated response to anthropogenic greenhouse-gas and aerosol
   forcing is consistent with a multivariate fingerprint of the observed
   recovery, raising confidence in our findings. Although robust
   predictions are not yet possible, our results suggest that the recent
   recovery in Sahel rainfall amounts is most likely to be sustained or
   amplified in the near term.},

Abstract = {Facing the increasingly adverse impacts of climate change, many coastal
   cities in developing and least-developed countries have shaped their
   climate adaptation plan. This study aims to unpack the state-of-the-art
   municipal adaptation planning in developing countries. The paper seeks
   to understand the types of vulnerability and explore planned adaptation
   options through a content analysis of adaptation planning documents in
   45 selected coastal cities in developing countries. The result shows the
   complexity of vulnerabilities that are not only climate change impacts,
   but more importantly, the socio-economic sensitivity, the insufficient
   infrastructure system, and limited adaptive capacity. Adaptation
   responses, correspondingly, address primarily current vulnerabilities
   rather than future climate change impacts. Local climate change
   adaptation in developing countries, therefore, cannot separate from
   socio-economic development and capacity enhancement. A coordination
   mechanism for inter-policy is necessary to manage the trade-offs between
   multiple priorities.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the concept of adaptation within the shoreline
   management framework in England and Wales. In the future it may not be
   sustainable to continue to defend all the locations on the coast that
   presently benefit from defences. Adaptation can help deliver more
   sustainable shoreline management solutions that better manage the risks
   to the social, economic and environmental function of the coast.
   Planning for adaptation will require preparing coastal communities for
   future change and will involve building in flexibility rather than
   closing off future solutions. A number of case studies are presented
   which exemplify different aspects of adaptation. The paper demonstrates
   how future reviews of Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) could promote
   more adaptive measures linked to the Coastal Change Management Areas
   that will feature in the next revision of land use plans. The future
   challenges to delivering more adaptive solutions are considered by
   looking at where adaptation may be needed, what more adaptive approaches
   may look like, and what the barriers to implementation are. One critical
   area is the greater engagement of local communities and the paper shows
   how the recent Coastal Pathfinder projects are tackling this issue. The
   lessons learned from these projects will be invaluable in rolling out
   adaptive solutions to other areas in the future. Such solutions can be
   progressed within the policies laid down in the current SMPs but should
   be updated in future SMP reviews as new information and knowledge
   becomes available.},

Abstract = {This paper demonstrates the impact of an endemic fossorial animal,
   plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae), on soil properties and N2O flux at
   the Zoige Wetland. Pika burrow and control sites without disturbance by
   pika were selected to measure the soil water content, bulk density, soil
   organic matter (SOM), NH4-N content and NO3-N content in August 2012.
   N2O fluxes were measured with static opaque chambers at these sites in
   June and August 2012. Pika burrowing altered soil aeration by
   transferring deeper soil to the surface and by constructing underground
   burrows, which significantly increased bulk density, and reduced soil
   water content, SOM and NH4-N content at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil depth.
   N2O flux had a significant correlation with bulk density, SOM and NH4-N
   content. Pika burrowing significantly influenced N2O flux by increasing
   N2O flux at the control site from near zero to 0.063 +/- 0.011 mg m(-2)
   h(-1). Our findings described how pika burrowing influences the soil
   traits and significantly increases the principal greenhouse gas N2O
   emission. As plateau pika was commonly considered as a pest, our
   findings give a novel clue to effectively manage populations of plateau
   pika on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from the perspective of greenhouse gas
   emission.},

Title = {Adaptive management in context of MPAs: Challenges and opportunities for
   implementation},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Worldwide, MPA practitioners are increasing adopting evidence-based
   management over anecdote and intuition. One of the most commonly
   promoted approaches is to monitor the status and trends of performance
   indicators and modify management when the status of an indicator is
   inconsistent with a target. But the challenge with indicator-based
   approaches is interpretation in the absence of an experimental (true or
   quasi) design. A more structured approach with greater inferential
   strength because the implicit adoption of experimental elements into the
   sampling design is the adaptive management approach promoted by Walters
   (1986). Another difference between adaptive management and
   indicator-based approaches is that the latter leads to reactive
   management interventions rather than evaluating alternative management
   options even in the absence of management failure. Unfortunately,
   adaptive management can be challenging to adopt in a scientifically
   rigorous way for at least two reasons. First, the cost to undertake
   large-scale experimental manipulations can be substantial. Second,
   stakeholders, such as commercial fishers or traditional villagers, may
   be unwilling to modify their livelihoods for experimental purposes even
   if learnings may result in more sustainable and cost-effective use of
   resources. As argued convincingly by one proponent of evidence-based
   management, adaptive management may still be applied efficiently to
   routine management activities. Routine management activities inside MPAs
   can include enforcement, raising environmental awareness amongst
   visitors, guiding visitors, installing vessel moorings and developing
   snorkel trails or nature trails through sensitive coastal vegetation.
   Applying adaptive management to these activities could lead to more
   scientifically sound and efficient management outcomes.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Constructed wetlands (CW), while providing multiple ecosystem services,
   bring significant changes in greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions to the
   atmosphere. To systematically analyze the source-flow-sink of three GHGs
   (CO2, CH4 and N2O), the Huoshaogou multi-stage free water surface CW in
   Qinghai Province, China was chosen as the research area. The static
   chamber-gas chromatography method was utilized to detect GHGs flux of
   the 6year old CW. Ecological network analysis (ENA) was utilized to
   demonstrate the carbon-related source-flow-sink of the CW. By comparing
   the results of the wetland site with a reference site, we found that:
   (1) The average GHG emission flux (2018 and 2019) in the wetland area,
   with an average of 212.27 mg/m(2)center dot h (CO2), 8.84 mg/m(2)center
   dot h (CH4), and 197.4 mu g/m(2)center dot h (N2O), is about 5.8 times
   the average flux in the reference site; (2) Wetland plants' contribution
   to GHGs emissions was reduced by 12\% when compared with the reference
   site; (3) The increasing linkages and inter-flow intensity led to more
   homogeneous emission distribution of GHGs; (4) The pelagic food chain
   became dominant over the benthic food chain in photoplankton-related
   carbon flows, resulting in more GHG emission from the bottom of the CW.},

   described. A brief description of the Norwegian R\&D activities with
   respect to CO2-removal and deposition is given. Several scenarios where
   CO2-free energy in the form of electricity or hydrogen is supplied to
   continental Europe or UK are discussed. It is concluded that CO2-removal
   and -deposition is a less expensive solution than the large scale
   application of renewable energy sources (other than hydropower) and
   probably also fusion energy. R\&D in the area of CO2-removal and
   -deposition is especially suited to international cooperation and burden

Abstract = {The global atmosphere is a chemically complex and dynamic system,
   interacting both internally, mostly within the troposphere and
   stratosphere, and with the oceans, land, and living organisms. Its
   composition is changing today, and has also changed markedly over the
   last 400,000 yr. Current understanding of this complex system resulting
   from recent observations, theory, and laboratory and modeling studies is
   reviewed. Also, results are presented from the Integrated Global System
   Model (IGSM). This is a coupled model of economic development,
   atmospheric chemistry, climate dynamics and ecosystem processes that
   explores possible future changes in atmospheric composition and climate.
   The results of an uncertainty analysis involving hundreds of runs of the
   IGSM imply that, without specific mitigation policies, the global
   average surface temperature may rise between 1.0 and 4.9degreesC from
   1990 to 2100 (95\% confidence limits). Polar temperatures, absent
   policy, are projected to rise from about 1 to 12degreesC (95\% limits)
   with obvious great risks for high latitude ecosystems and ice sheets at
   the high end of this range. Analysis of the Kyoto Protocol, and a more
   stringent climate mitigation policy, shows the difficulties in
   accounting simply for the effects of other greenhouse gases relative to
   carbon dioxide. Also, the greatest effect of these policies is to lower
   the probability of extreme changes as opposed to lowering the medians.},

Title = {Phenological mismatch in coastal western Alaska may increase summer
   season greenhouse gas uptake},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {High latitude ecosystems are prone to phenological mismatches due to
   climate change-driven advances in the growing season and changing
   arrival times of migratory herbivores. These changes have the potential
   to alter biogeochemical cycling and contribute to feedbacks on climate
   change by altering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of carbon dioxide
   (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) through large regions of
   the Arctic. Yet the effects of phenological mismatches on gas fluxes are
   currently unexplored. We used a three-year field experiment that altered
   the start of the growing season and timing of grazing to investigate how
   phenological mismatch affects GHG exchange. We found early grazing
   increased mean GHG emission to the atmosphere despite lower CH4
   emissions due to grazing-induced changes in vegetation structure that
   increased uptake of CO2. In contrast, late grazing reduced GHG emissions
   because greater plant productivity led to an increase in CO2 uptake that
   overcame the increase in CH4 emission. Timing of grazing was an
   important control on both CO2 and CH4 emissions, and net GHG exchange
   was the result of opposing fluxes of CO2 and CH4. N2O played a
   negligible role in GHG flux. Advancing the growing season had a smaller
   effect on GHG emissions than changes to timing of grazing in this study.
   Our results suggest that a phenological mismatch that delays timing of
   grazing relative to the growing season, a change which is already
   developing along in western coastal Alaska, will reduce GHG emissions to
   the atmosphere through increased CO2 uptake despite greater CH4
   emissions.},

Title = {Ratepayer Perspectives on Mid- to Large-Scale Solar Development on Long
   Island, NY: Lessons for Reducing Siting Conflict through Supported
   Development Types},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The state of New York has ambitious mandates for reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions and increasing renewable energy generation. Solar energy will
   play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the
   electric energy sector. Concerns over solar installations' impacts to
   host communities and the environment have led to growing conflicts over
   solar energy siting on Long Island, in other parts of New York, and
   throughout the US. Understanding community members' perspectives is
   critical for reducing conflict. Solar energy can be deployed more
   quickly and at lower cost if projects are structured to address the
   concerns and meet the needs of the community. This paper presents the
   results of a survey of residential utility ratepayers that examined
   their perceptions, preferences, and priorities concerning mid- to
   large-scale solar development on Long Island (250 kW and larger). The
   survey asked respondents to consider specific installation types,
   financial models, and other aspects of solar development. Results
   indicate that respondents were overwhelmingly supportive of mid- to
   large-scale solar development in their communities. The most highly
   supported development types were solar systems on rooftops and solar
   systems that are co-located with other land uses (mixed use) at a
   particular site, such as parking canopies, landfills, or integration
   with agriculture. The most highly supported financial models included
   privately funded projects by local developers and community solar
   projects. The largest concern about solar development expressed by
   respondents did not involve tree removal or visibility (as initially
   hypothesized to be the most significant considerations) but rather the
   fairness of the distribution of economic benefits associated with solar
   development. This paper provides concrete insight into particular models
   of solar development that may invoke less conflict and more community
   support.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather events brought about by climate change have caused
   devastating impacts on communities in many parts of the world; affecting
   people's lives and infrastructure in an unprecedented manner. Extreme
   weather events are the most prominent risk facing humanity and 2017 was
   the most costly hurricane season on record. As extreme weather events
   increase in both intensity and frequency it is critical that preemptive
   solutions to mitigate disasters are found. Nowhere is this more true
   than in the Philippines where 62\% of the country's population lives in
   coastal zones. The scale of devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013
   revealed a high degree of vulnerability among coastal and small island
   communities in a region regularly hit by tropical cyclones. The
   situation is expected to worsen with more frequent extreme events
   compounded by sea level rise. Conservation International (CI) in
   collaboration with Bechtel Corporation's Building Resilient Communities
   Program is piloting a new approach for coastal protection at two sites
   in the province of Iloilo, Philippines. The project integrates
   ecological solutions with engineering structures, providing green-gray
   infrastructure to alleviate the impact of extreme weather events. By
   blending green and gray techniques the environment becomes more
   adaptable and resilient than either technique applied alone. The concept
   designs, planned for implementation in 2019, use civil engineering
   techniques to establish and support the rehabilitation of mangrove
   communities. The long-term benefits of rehabilitating coastal mangrove
   forests in the region will mitigate climate change impacts and support
   community adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Fisheries in Sub-Saharan Africa are vulnerable to the effects of climate
   change, which include changes in mean temperature, increasing rainfall
   variability and the occurrence of extreme weather events. This article
   reviews evidence on the magnitude of climate change and the nature of
   its impacts on both inland and marine fisheries. In addition, the review
   also focuses on the impacts of climate change on fishery-dependent
   communities and finally highlights climate change adaptation strategies
   adopted by fishers. A systematic approach was employed to search and
   select relevant published literature used in this review paper. The
   reviewed literature indicated the challenge of declining fish catches in
   several fishing communities, which was associated with climate change
   and variability. Changes in mean temperature, rainfall quantities and
   patterns, sea-level changes, water salinity, and lake levels affect fish
   productivity. Fishers in sub-Saharan Africa adopt different strategies
   to sustain their livelihoods and food security, which are being
   threatened by climate change. Adaptation strategies employed by fishers
   to cope with the impacts of climate change include, changing fishing
   gear, migration, targeting new species, and increasing fishing grounds
   and time spent fishing. To promote socio-ecological adaptation and
   fisheries sustainability, it is crucial to understand the impacts of
   climate change at a local level, which would inform policy and fisheries
   management practices.},

Title = {Impacts of land management practices on blue carbon stocks and
   greenhouse gas fluxes in coastal ecosystems-A meta-analysis},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1354-1366},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Global recognition of climate change and its predicted consequences has
   created the need for practical management strategies for increasing the
   ability of natural ecosystems to capture and store atmospheric carbon.
   Mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, referred to as blue
   carbon ecosystems (BCEs), are hotspots of atmospheric CO2 storage due to
   their capacity to sequester carbon at a far higher rate than terrestrial
   forests. Despite increased effort to understand the mechanisms
   underpinning blue carbon fluxes, there has been little synthesis of how
   management activities influence carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   fluxes in BCEs. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of 111 studies
   that measured how carbon stocks and GHG fluxes in BCEs respond to
   various coastal management strategies. Research effort has focused
   mainly on restoration approaches, which resulted in significant
   increases in blue carbon after 4 years compared to degraded sites, and
   the potential to reach parity with natural sites after 7-17 years.
   Lesser studied management alternatives, such as sediment manipulation
   and altered hydrology, showed only increases in biomass and weaker
   responses for soil carbon stocks and sequestration. The response of GHG
   emissions to management was complex, with managed sites emitting less
   than natural reference sites but emitting more compared to degraded
   sites. Individual GHGs also differed in their responses to management.
   To date, blue carbon management studies are underrepresented in the
   southern hemisphere and are usually limited in duration (61\% of studies
   <3 years duration). Our meta-analysis describes the current state of
   blue carbon management from the available data and highlights
   recommendations for prioritizing conservation management, extending
   monitoring time frames of BCE carbon stocks, improving our understanding
   of GHG fluxes in open coastal systems and redistributing management and
   research effort into understudied, high-risk areas.},

Title = {Resilience and coastal governance: knowledge and navigation between
   stability and transformation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Several intergovernmental agreements highlight the need for resilience
   in the face of environmental and societal challenges. Coastal systems
   are particularly complex and susceptible to global climate change, and
   building human resilience to future changes is of high priority. While
   the concept of resilience has historically been associated with
   stability to perturbations, the notion of transformation within the
   social-ecological resilience (SER) approach has recently gained
   importance in ecosystem management. In order to operationalize
   resilience in the context of coastal governance in a changing climate, a
   better understanding of the concept is required. This paper provides an
   overview of different approaches to resilience, including stability and
   transformation, in order to understand resilience as a concept in a
   coastal governance context. Subsequently, we propose five steps and
   three types of knowledge (system, target, transformative) with which to
   embed SER in coastal governance. In addition, we consider scale and
   system boundaries; identify (un)desirable system characteristics and the
   role of normative goals and common visions in resilience management.
   Finally, we highlight the central role that local actors and information
   services play in fostering a two-way exchange between science and
   society and tailoring solutions for establishing or enhancing SER to the
   needs of local actors. We conclude that the navigation between stability
   and transformation within the concept of resilience is central to
   finding sustainable future pathways in the face of climate change.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2020},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Estimating the range at which an acoustic receiver can detect greenhouse
   gas (e.g., CO2) leakage from the sub-seabed is essential for determining
   whether passive acoustic techniques can be an effective environmental
   monitoring tool above marine carbon storage sites. Here we report
   results from a shallow water experiment completed offshore the island of
   Panarea, Sicily, at a natural CO2 vent site, where the ability of
   passive acoustics to detect and quantify gas flux was determined at
   different distances. Cross-correlation methods determined the time of
   arrival for different travel paths which were confirmed by acoustic
   modelling. We develop an approach to quantify vent bubble size and gas
   flux. Inversion of the acoustic data was completed using the modelled
   impulse response to provide equivalent propagation ranges rather than
   physical ranges. The results show that our approach is capable of
   detecting a CO2 bubble plume with a gas flux rate of 2.3 L/min at ranges
   of up to 8 m, and determining gas flux and bubble size accurately at
   ranges of up to 4 m in shallow water, where the bubble sound pressure is
   10 dB above that of the ambient noise.},

   Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {South Korea is the ninth biggest energy consumer and the seventh biggest
   carbon dioxide emitter in global energy consumption since 2016.
   Accordingly, the Korean government currently faces a two-fold
   significant challenge to improve energy security and reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions. One of the most promising solutions to achieve the goals
   of sustainable development, energy security, and environmental
   protection is intensifying the role of renewable energy in electricity
   production. To this end, the Korean government plans to increase
   investments in the green energy field, where solar and wind energy will
   soon play a decisive role toward meeting energy demands and achieving a
   climate-friendly environment. In this context, this study discusses the
   future of solar and wind energy in South Korea in four key aspects: (i)
   opportunities and potential achievement of the vision of government;
   (ii) potential daily energy output across different geographical areas;
   (iii) current status and prospects; and (iv) challenges and potential
   solutions.},

Abstract = {As we move toward a carbon neutral society we look to develop integrated
   best solutions to eliminate harmful emissions and provide sustainable
   energy solutions. Due to the wide range of power and propulsion demand
   in all maritime segments it is difficult to find one common solution.
   However, a best section and wide range of offered solutions including
   multi-lateral cooperation of these expert companies is a key element.
   Electric Propulsion Systems are proven robust and provide benefits such
   as load profile flexibility, elimination of torque transients,
   redundancy, and improved fuel efficiency through sophisticated power
   management systems. Today fuel flexibility includes the use of carbon
   neutral fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia due to the fact that these
   fuels are not comprised of greenhouse gasses. Also there is an infinite
   amount of hydrogen and it can be isolated using renewable energy. The
   electro-chemical process of a hydrogen powered fuel cell produces
   electricity and water vapor. The hydrogen supplied to the fuel cell
   could also be reformed from other fuels. A diesel engine running on
   ammonia produces zero greenhouse gasses. Advances in hybrid electric
   propulsion systems provides a platform for renewable harvesting energy
   sources. A DC bus can provided a hybrid platform for a multitude of DC
   energy sources to include renewables. These energy sources are an
   ever-changing landscape and include fuel cells, diesel and turbo
   generators, batteries, supercapacitors, wind turbines, solar panels,
   thermal recovery systems, and hydro-turbines to name a few. These
   combined technologies have made possible zero emission / carbon neutral,
   efficient, quiet and autonomous power solutions in the megawatt range
   for application in all segments of the marine industry to include
   Super-Yachts.},

Abstract = {The potential of generating electricity from marine tidal currents is
   enormous. Tidal energy is a renewable source that has an additional
   value in a future energy market with regard to other renewable energy
   sources thanks to its high predictability. Moreover, tidal energy
   technologies are characterized by CO2 emission-free power, thus enabling
   energy security and contributing to economic growth and job creation in
   coastal and remote areas. Substantial progress is currently,being made
   by the European Union as regards the reduction of greenhouse gas
   emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency, in order to fulfil
   the target of an installed capacity of 3.6 GW of ocean energy by 2020,
   and to achieve a future installed capacity of 188 GW of ocean energy in
   2050. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current status
   of tidal energy conversion technologies and describes the costs incurred
   in the development of tidal energy projects so as to study their
   economic viability. The study also identifies the principal current
   risks and the role of each of the stakeholders involved in the
   successful development of tidal energy projects. Finally, future
   challenges in tidal technologies that will influence the increase in
   their current potential are briefly presented along with the current
   developments of our research group in the field of tidal energy
   converters design.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses a significant threat to humanity by intensifying
   multiple hazards. South Pacific Island countries (SPICs) are affected
   and face a dire challenge to survival. Sea level rise is reducing the
   already limited land for human and animal habitation. Tropical cyclones
   and droughts are having devastating effects on the lives of humans and
   animals. Tropical cyclone Winston, for example, destroyed infrastructure
   for humans and animals in some parts of Fiji, and infectious diseases
   are spreading to regions where they are not commonly seen following
   cyclones and floods. Likewise, climate change is making droughts worse.
   Droughts are destroying crops and pasturelands and making freshwater
   unavailable for human and animal populations in the Solomon Islands and
   Tuvalu. There is an urgent need to ascertain the best approaches to
   tackle the events, which are already happening. Short-term changes can
   be managed at local levels through public awareness campaigns,
   understanding the weather patterns to prepare for disasters, reclaiming
   land, improving livestock breeds, introducing zoos and wildlife
   sanctuaries and inventing economically feasible technologies to harvest
   water. Long-term solutions depend on the implementation of international
   agreements, international aid and collective effort.},

Abstract = {Developing and implementing effective adaptation policies for freshwater
   and estuarine systems in Australia will be a significant challenge in a
   rapidly changing climate. The broad aims of climate change adaptation
   policies are to reduce vulnerability and increase the adaptive capacity
   and resilience of ecosystems to climate change impacts. There are a
   range of adaptation policy options relevant to aquatic systems, and many
   of these measures can be `mainstreamed' or incorporated into existing
   conservation and resource management frameworks. This article evaluates
   adaptation policy options and the constraints on policy implementation
   for freshwater and estuarine ecosystems in the coastal floodplains of
   tropical Queensland. Many of these aquatic systems are in a degraded
   condition and are vulnerable to the compounded impacts of climate change
   and other stressors. The analysis suggests that statutory planning
   schemes, water resource planning and protected area frameworks provide
   limited scope to address the more severe threats to these systems from
   rising sea levels, extreme cyclones, floods and droughts. In many
   locations, the effectiveness of adaptation policies is constrained by
   existing land uses and competing demands from communities and industry
   sectors. To prevent further widespread loss of habitat may require the
   development and implementation of new policies that prioritise
   adaptation management for freshwater and estuarine ecosystems.},

Title = {High greenhouse gas emissions mitigation benefits from mangrove
   rehabilitation in Sulawesi, Indonesia},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mangroves have generated considerable interest in forest carbon
   discourse given their disproportionately high carbon storage and
   sequestration potential compared to terrestrial habitats. Capitalising
   on this potential, however, remains largely unrealised due in part to an
   incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits
   provided, particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture
   ponds are converted back to mangroves. Here we address such
   uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential
   from rehabilitating mangroves in Tiwoho, North Sulawesi (Indonesia).
   Estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove
   forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed, with results
   contrasted against published data on established mangroves and
   terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the Verified Carbon
   Standard. Additionally, net emissions removals and reductions from
   Tiwoho is scaled-up to the national level in order to estimate the
   contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change
   mitigation. We also monetarise potential returns generated to date and
   frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs. Our
   data indicates that, on average, Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites could
   potentially mitigate upwards of -27.6 +/- 1.7 Mg CO2-e per hectare per
   year. This is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry
   carbon projects and, assuming a voluntary carbon market price of USD
   \$8.1 per Mg CO2-e per hectare for afforestation/reforestation projects,
   equates to recuperation of 76.2\% of initial project implementation
   costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 7.6\%. This
   return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector
   investors. Scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and
   reduction potential from rehabilitating the similar to 600, 000 hectares
   of disused ponds in Indonesia may offset upwards of -16.56 +/- 1.02
   million Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. Additionally, mitigation benefits
   from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects
   if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high
   rates of re-growth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic
   algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon. These
   findings strengthen the evidence base needed for public and private
   sector support for mangrove rehabilitation within the forest carbon
   sector.},

Title = {Blue hydrogen must be done properly},
Journal = {ENERGY SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3220-3236},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Future energy scenarios include both green and blue hydrogen, as both
   are needed to scale up decarbonized energy supply. A transition to
   renewable energy is predicted over time, but the urgency we are facing
   cannot be met by renewable energy alone. For blue hydrogen production,
   the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are primarily affected by
   emissions from natural gas production, processing, and transport (CO2
   and methane), as well as process efficiency and carbon capture ratio.
   Few complete and updated analyses are available that cover the entire
   blue hydrogen value chain with the best available technology for process
   facilities, as well as the proper design, operation, and maintenance of
   all relevant systems and infrastructure. This paper analyses the GHG
   intensity of blue hydrogen, using recent data as well as input from
   technology providers on state-of-the-art gas reforming technologies.
   Data are primarily based on natural gas production and transport in the
   North Sea Basin, with gas export from the Norwegian continental shelf to
   continental Europe or the United Kingdom, and with blue hydrogen
   production either in Norway or near pipeline landfall in the European
   Union or United Kingdom. Some data related to potential blue hydrogen
   production in the US Appalachian region are also given. The data show
   that the properly designed and operated value chains for blue hydrogen
   supply, with minimal emissions from natural gas supply and high carbon
   capture in hydrogen production, will give a major reduction in GHG
   emissions from energy end-use. GHG footprint for end-users based on blue
   hydrogen will typically be 80\%-90\% lower than for direct supply and
   use of natural gas.},

Abstract = {Low-lying, densely populated coastal areas worldwide are under threat,
   requiring coastal managers to develop new strategies to cope with land
   subsidence, sea-level rise and the increasing risk of
   storm-surge-induced floods. Traditional engineering approaches
   optimizing for safety are often suboptimal with respect to other
   functions and are neither resilient nor sustainable. Densely populated
   deltas in particular need more resilient solutions that are robust,
   sustainable, adaptable, multifunctional and yet economically feasible.
   Innovative concepts such as `Building with Nature' provide a basis for
   coastal protection strategies that are able to follow gradual changes in
   climate and other environmental conditions, while maintaining flood
   safety, ecological values and socio-economic functions. This paper
   presents a conceptual framework for Building with Nature that is used to
   evaluate coastal protection strategies, based on a case study of the
   Holland coast in the Netherlands. The added value and the limitations of
   these strategies are discussed.},

Title = {Variability in greenhouse gas footprints of the global wind farm fleet},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {While technological characteristics largely determine the greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions during the construction of a wind farm and
   meteorological circumstances the actual electricity production, a
   thorough analysis to quantify the GHG footprint variability (in g
   CO(2)eq/kWh electricity produced) between wind farms is still lacking at
   the global scale. Here, we quantified the GHG footprint of 26,821 wind
   farms located across the globe, combining turbine-specific technological
   parameters, life-cycle inventory data, and location- and
   temporal-specific meteorological information. These wind farms represent
   79\% of the 651 global wind (GW) capacity installed in 2019. Our results
   indicate a median GHG footprint for global wind electricity of 10 g
   CO(2)eq/kWh, ranging from 4 to 56 g CO(2)eq/kWh (2.5th and 97.5th
   percentiles). Differences in the GHG footprint of wind farms are mainly
   explained by spatial variability in wind speed, followed by whether the
   wind farm is located onshore or offshore, the turbine diameter, and the
   number of turbines in a wind farm. We also provided a metamodel based on
   these four predictors for users to be able to easily obtain a first
   indication of GHG footprints of new wind farms considered. Our results
   can be used to compare the GHG footprint of wind farms to one another
   and to other sources of electricity in a location-specific manner.},

Title = {Contribution of natural and drained wetland systems to carbon stocks,
   CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes: an Australian perspective},
Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {377-388},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) flux from wetland systems, both in their natural
   state and following drainage, has not been well accounted for in the
   carbon accounting process. We review GHG production from both natural
   and drained wetlands, and estimate the likely GHG emissions from these
   systems in Australia. Only a small number of studies have quantified GHG
   emissions from undisturbed Australian wetland environments.
   Consequently, in order to estimate GHG flux for Australia, it was
   necessary to collate data collected overseas from similar climatic
   zones. Using this approach, it appears that undisturbed, vegetated
   wetlands in Australia are likely to be net GHG sinks, with the greatest
   rates of sequestration occurring in mangrove ecosystems (-2669 g
   CO2-e/m(2).year) where biomass production is high but CH4 emissions are
   limited by salinity. The uncertainty surrounding these values is high,
   however, due to (a) the low number of measurements from Australia, (b)
   the low number of measurements for CO2 flux, and (c) the low number of
   studies where all GHGs have been measured concurrently. It was estimated
   that the drainage of melaleuca and mangrove forest wetlands in Australia
   would turn them from carbon sinks into carbon sources, and that in the
   first 50 years since drainage, this has increased global warming
   potential by 1149 Tg CO2-e or 23 Tg CO2-e/year. This is significant
   given that GHG emissions due to land-use change in 2007 totalled 77.1 Tg
   CO2-e. However, data surrounding the area of wetlands drained, carbon
   stocks in drained wetlands, and the effect of drainage on CH4 and N2O
   flux are limited, making the uncertainty surrounding these estimates
   high. Further study is clearly required if Australia wishes to
   accurately incorporate wetland systems into national carbon and
   greenhouse gas accounting budgets.},

Title = {Adaptation pathways to cope with salinization in south-west coastal
   region of Bangladesh},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Salinization in coastal regions of Bangladesh challenges sustainable
   development of different sectors like agriculture, forestry, fisheries,
   livestock, and health. Particularly its southwest region largely faces
   increased salinity risks because of its geographical location and
   environmental settings. This study analyzes the causes of salinity
   increase, their cascading impacts on different coastal systems, and
   their livelihood implications, and assesses potential coping measures
   through innovative adaptation pathways for the most affected coastal
   systems. These pathways integrate bottom-up and top-down perceptions in
   adaptation planning through a driver-pressure-state-impact-response
   framework, multicriteria analysis, and adaptation turning point
   approaches. We surveyed 200 households and interviewed 20 key
   informants. We observed that household-level respondents' perceptions
   are more closely related to socioeconomic aspects than to the
   biophysical environmental aspects and focus on issue-based action.
   However, the key informants focus more on the biophysical changes and
   the large-scale measures. The developed framework shows that salinity
   increase is an interconnected process of
   climatic-social-ecological-economic systems in the coastal environment.
   It also shows that responses already taken, i.e., polders and shrimp
   farming, to cope with salinization have later become pressures, i.e.,
   riverbed siltation, waterlogging, and intensive salinization, on the
   systems. In total, we identified six interconnected causes of salinity
   increase and 24 potential measures to address them. Also we
   distinguished three coastal systems, i.e., crop-agriculture, drinking
   water sources, and the Sundarbans mangrove, most affected by salinity
   increase. Finally we proposed 16 adaptation pathways for these coastal
   systems based on the multicriteria analysis and adaptation turning
   points of the potential measures.},

Abstract = {Climactic changes, especially global warming, are potentially the
   largest global threat to human health and the source of the greatest
   number of cases of disease. If current emissions and land use trends
   continue unchecked, future generations will face more serious
   conditions, including injury, disease, and death related to natural
   disasters and heat waves, higher rates of climate-related infections,
   widespread malnutrition, and more allergy and air pollution-related
   morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the relationship between
   global climate changes and human health and provides some suggestions
   for improvement. According to the Fourth Assessment Report by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in 2007,
   global warming is caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The most
   important GHG is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is released by the burning
   of fossil fuels and, to a lesser extent, by land use practices, followed
   by nitrous oxide and methane. IPCC predicts that global temperatures
   will rise 1.8 degrees C-4.0 degrees C by 2099. According to the report,
   we can expect a significant rise in sea levels, massive species
   extinctions, changes in storm and drought cycles, altered ocean
   circulation, and redistribution of vegetation after crossing the
   ``tipping point{''} of global warming. Human health will be adversely
   affected by the accelerating climate change. This review stimulates
   health care providers to provide quality care to susceptible individuals
   confronting new threats from climactic changes, as well as to work
   toward a mitigation of the drivers of climate change at the individual,
   community, and policy levels as part of a long-term commitment to
   protecting public health.},

Abstract = {Many but not all energy and environmental issues are believed to be
   consequences of the huge consumption of carbon-based fuels by humanity.
   This study found that the thermal energy released in 2006 by the
   complete combustion may be up to 4.84 x 10(20) joules. This thermal
   energy contributes about 14\% of the total thermal energy forcing in the
   atmosphere and ocean. Not only greenhouse gases but also the thermal
   energy released by fossil fuel burning needs to be considered in climate
   change studies. Solar energy is a promising clean energy source for
   solving the issues in energy shortage. We have studied solar energy
   resources at the Earth's surface and propose eight areas for potential
   solar power plants. The proposed sites are located in deserts in
   Southwest Asia, China, Australia, Southern South America, United States
   and Mexico. We calculate that 10\% (assuming a conversion efficiency of
   10\%) of the solar energy resource over the eight sites is 18 times
   larger than current global energy consumption. If we could construct a
   solar energy network as an international cooperative project or store
   daily solar energy for use at night time, these eight sites could supply
   24-hour electric power every day for the whole world. A more realistic
   approach to generate electricity at night and during cloudy days would
   be to store solar heat energy for use on demand.},

Title = {Changes in soil carbon sequestration and soil respiration following
   afforestation on paddy fields in north subtropical China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {240-252},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aims
   Although many studies have reported net gains of soil organic carbon
   (SOC) after afforestation on croplands, this is uncertain for Chinese
   paddy rice croplands. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of
   afforestation of paddy rice croplands on SOC sequestration and soil
   respiration (R-s). Such knowledge would improve our understanding of the
   effectiveness of various land use options on greenhouse gas mitigation
   in China.
   Methods
   The investigation was conducted on the Chongming Island, north
   subtropical China. Field sites were reclaimed from coastal salt marshes
   in the 1960s, and soils were homogeneous with simple land use histories.
   SOC stocks and R-s levels were monitored over one year in a paddy rice
   cropland, an evergreen and a deciduous broad-leaved plantation
   established on previous paddy fields and a reference fallow land site
   never cultivated. Laboratory incubation of soil under fast-changing
   temperatures was used to compare the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of
   SOC decomposition across land uses.
   Important Findings
   After 15-20 years of afforestation on paddy fields, SOC concentration
   only slightly increased at the depth of 0-5 cm but decreased in deeper
   layers, which resulted in a net loss of SOC stock in the top 40 cm.
   Seasonal increase of SOC was observed during the rice-growing period in
   croplands but not in afforested soils, suggesting a stronger SOC
   sequestration by paddy rice cropping. However, SOC sequestered under
   cropping was more labile, as indicated by its higher contents of
   dissolved organic carbon and microbial biomass. Also, paddy soils had
   higher annual R-s than afforested soils; R-s abruptly increased after
   paddy fields were drained and plowed and remained distinctively high
   throughout the dry farming period. Laboratory incubation revealed that
   paddy soils had a much higher Q(10) of SOC decomposition than afforested
   soils.. Given that temperature was the primary controller of R-s in this
   region, it was concluded that despite the stronger SOC sequestration by
   paddy rice cropping, its SOC was less stable than in afforested systems
   and might be more easily released into the atmosphere under global
   warming.},

Abstract = {Global climate change (GCC) is expected to lead to massive loss of
   global biodiversity in the alpine regions of mountain ranges. Studies on
   the potential effects of GCC on low mountain areas remain sparse,
   however, despite the high conservation value of these areas as
   biodiversity refugia. We chose a species distribution modeling approach
   to assess potential GCC impacts on the future distributions of montane
   freshwater invertebrates under two different greenhouse gas scenarios
   and three averaged general circulation models. For this, ensemble models
   consisting of six algorithms {[}generalized linear model (GLM),
   generalized boosted model (GBM), generalized additive model (GAM),
   classification tree analysis (CTA), artificial neural networks (ANN),
   and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)] were applied to
   project areas of 23 cold-stenothermic aquatic insects from montane
   regions of Central Europe. We found an average loss of 70-80\% of the
   potential distribution for the study species until 2080, depending on
   the underlying Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario.
   Species distribution ranges below 1000 m above sea level were found to
   decrease by up to similar to 96\% according to the severest greenhouse
   gas emission scenario. While the Alps remain the single main refugium
   under the A2a greenhouse gas emission scenario, the more moderate
   climate scenario B2a shows fragmented potential persistence of montane
   insects in some low mountain ranges. The results show that montane
   freshwater assemblages in low mountain ranges are particularly
   threatened by ongoing GCC. As vertical dispersal is limited by
   elevational restriction, low mountain ranges may act as summit traps
   under GCC. We thus propose that GCC will lead to the extinction of
   several species and unique genetic lineages of postglacial relict
   species, resulting in a significant decline in Central European fauna.},

Abstract = {The need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have major
   effects on energy transmission. CO2 from fossil fuels may need to be
   captured and transported to long term stores, for example deep saline
   aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields. This may affect the optimum
   location of energy conversion plants such as power stations. Also, novel
   energy carriers such as hydrogen may become more attractive.
   On behalf of the IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme, Woodhill Engineering
   Consultants, in collaboration with Mott MacDonald, have developed a
   model for initial assessment of the costs and performance of energy
   transmission and CO2 capture. The model covers the distribution of
   energy in various forms such as natural gas, hydrogen, methanol,
   distillate oil, and electricity, and the capture and gathering Of CO2
   using onshore and offshore pipeline transmission. Sensitivities can be
   assessed for a wide range of factors, such as the output of power
   stations, fuel supply flowrate, pipeline diameter, operating pressure,
   terrain and country. Cost estimation is based on industry standard
   techniques. The model also includes simple algorithms for the costs and
   performances of energy conversion plants, such as power stations and
   hydrogen plants, and for underground injection Of CO2.
   This paper contains a description of the model and includes several
   examples of predicted costs and performance of energy distribution and
   CO2 capture and transmission.},

Abstract = {Global climate change related to anthropogenic CO2 emissions is one of
   the most significant challenges for the future of human life on Earth.
   There are many potential options for reducing or even eliminating
   atmospheric CO2 emissions including underground sequestration, carbon
   mineralization and ocean storage. One of the most promising materials
   for carbon mineralization is Mg(OH)(2) which is highly reactive and
   capable of forming stable carbonates. Here we show a novel low-carbon
   method of producing Mg(OH)(2), from globally abundant olivine-rich
   silicate rocks. A combination of acid digestion and electrolysis of
   olivine were used to produce Mg(OH)(2) in a fully recoverable system.
   The use of Mg(OH)(2) from olivine provides a viable pathway for
   significant industrial scale reductions in global anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas emissions. Magnesium hydroxide is a sustainable material
   for CO2 sequestration, according to an acid digestion and electrolysis
   method using olivine-rich silicate rocks in a fully recoverable system.},

   mitigation actions could contribute 12\% of the emissions reductions
   required by 2030 to keep warming to less than 1.5 oC but, because
   substantial warming is already locked in, extensive adaptation action is
   also needed. Here, as part of the Future Seas project, we use a
   ``foresighting/hindcasting{''} technique to describe two scenarios for
   2030 in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation for
   ocean systems. The ``business-as-usual{''} future is expected if current
   trends continue, while an alternative future could be realised if
   society were to effectively use available data and knowledge to push as
   far as possible towards achieving the UN SDGs. We identify three drivers
   that differentiate between these alternative futures: (i) appetite for
   climate action, (ii) handling extreme events, and (iii) climate
   interventions. Actions that could navigate towards the optimistic,
   sustainable and technically achievable future include: proactive
   creation and enhancement of economic incentives for mitigation and
   adaptation; supporting the proliferation of local initiatives to spur a
   global transformation; enhancing proactive coastal adaptation
   management; investing in research to support adaptation to emerging
   risks; deploying marine-based renewable energy; deploying marine-based
   negative emissions technologies; developing and assessing solar
   radiation management approaches; and deploying appropriate solar
   radiation management approaches to help safeguard critical ecosystems.},

Title = {Life cycle GHG evaluation of organic rice production in northern

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is one of the serious international
   environmental issues that can lead to severe damages such as climate
   change, sea level rise, emerging disease and many other impacts. Rice
   cultivation is associated with emissions of potent GHGs such as methane
   and nitrous oxide. Thai rice has been massively exported worldwide
   however the markets are becoming more competitive than ever since the
   green market has been hugely promoted. In order to maintain the same
   level or enhance of competitiveness, Thai rice needs to be considered
   for environmentally conscious products to meet the international
   environmental standards. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the
   greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of rice production in
   order to identify the major emission sources and possible reduction
   strategies.
   In this research, the rice variety considered is Khao Dawk Mali 105
   (KDML 105) cultivated by organic practices. The data sources were
   Don-Chiang Organic Agricultural Cooperative (DCOAC), Mae-teang district,
   Chiang Mai province, Thailand and the Office of Agricultural Economics
   (OAE) of Thailand with onsite records and interviews of farmers in 2013.
   The GHG emissions were calculated from cradle to -farm by using the Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and the 2006 IPCC Guideline for National
   Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The functional unit is defined as 1 kg of
   paddy rice at farm gate. Results showed that the total GHG emissions of
   organic rice production were 0.58 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice. The
   major source of GHG emission was from the field emissions accounting for
   0.48 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice, about 83\% of total, followed by
   land preparation, harvesting and other stages (planting, cultivation and
   transport of raw materials) were 9, 5 and 3\% of total, respectively.
   The comparative results clearly showed that the GHG emissions of organic
   paddy rice were considerably lower than conventional rice production due
   to the advantages of using organic fertilisers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {16},
Pages = {4751-4764},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Recent warm temperatures driven by climate change have caused mass coral
   bleaching and mortality across the world, prompting managers,
   policymakers, and conservation practitioners to embrace restoration as a
   strategy to sustain coral reefs. Despite a proliferation of new coral
   reef restoration efforts globally and increasing scientific recognition
   and research on interventions aimed at supporting reef resilience to
   climate impacts, few restoration programs are currently incorporating
   climate change and resilience in project design. As climate change will
   continue to degrade coral reefs for decades to come, guidance is needed
   to support managers and restoration practitioners to conduct restoration
   that promotes resilience through enhanced coral reef recovery,
   resistance, and adaptation. Here, we address this critical
   implementation gap by providing recommendations that integrate
   resilience principles into restoration design and practice, including
   for project planning and design, coral selection, site selection, and
   broader ecosystem context. We also discuss future opportunities to
   improve restoration methods to support enhanced outcomes for coral reefs
   in response to climate change. As coral reefs are one of the most
   vulnerable ecosystems to climate change, interventions that enhance reef
   resilience will help to ensure restoration efforts have a greater chance
   of success in a warming world. They are also more likely to provide
   essential contributions to global targets to protect natural
   biodiversity and the human communities that rely on reefs.},

Title = {Experimental Proof of a Solar-Powered Heat Pump System for Soil Thermal
   Stabilization},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We suggested earlier a new sustainable method for permafrost thermal
   stabilization that combines passive screening of solar radiation and
   precipitation with active solar-powered cooling of the near-surface soil
   layer thus preventing heat penetration in depth. Feasibility of this
   method has been shown by calculations, but needed experimental proof. In
   this article, we are presenting the results of soil temperature
   measurements obtained at the experimental implementation of this method
   outside of the permafrost area which actually meant higher thermal loads
   than in permafrost area. We have shown that near-surface soil layer is
   kept frozen during the whole summer, even at air temperatures exceeding
   +30 degrees C. Therefore, the method has been experimentally proven to
   be capable of sustaining soil frozen. In addition to usual building and
   structures' thermal stabilization, the method could be used to prevent
   the development of thermokarst, gas emission craters, and landslides;
   greenhouse gases, chemical, and biological pollution from the upper
   thawing layers, at least in the area of human activities; protection
   against coastal erosion, and permafrost restoration after wildfires.
   Using commercially widely-available components, the technology can be
   scaled up for virtually any size objects.},

Abstract = {Implementation of adaptation actions to protect biodiversity is limited
   by uncertainty about the future. One reason for this is the fear of
   making the wrong decisions caused by the myriad future scenarios
   presented to decision-makers. We propose an adaptive management (AM)
   method for optimally managing a population under uncertain and changing
   habitat conditions. Our approach incorporates multiple future scenarios
   and continually learns the best management strategy from observations,
   even as conditions change. We demonstrate the performance of our AM
   approach by applying it to the spatial management of migratory shorebird
   habitats on the East Asian-Australasian flyway, predicted to be severely
   impacted by future sea-level rise. By accounting for non-stationary
   dynamics, our solution protects 25 000 more birds per year than the
   current best stationary approach. Our approach can be applied to many
   ecological systems that require efficient adaptation strategies for an
   uncertain future.},

Title = {Carbonation of alkaline paper mill waste to reduce CO2 greenhouse gas
   emissions into the atmosphere},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {23},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {The global warming of Earth's near-surface, air and oceans in recent
   decades is a direct consequence of anthropogenic emission of greenhouse
   gases into the atmosphere such as CO2, CH4, N2O and CFCs. The CO2
   emissions contribute approximately 60\% to this climate change. This
   study investigates experimentally the aqueous carbonation mechanisms of
   an alkaline paper mill waste containing about 55 wt\% portlandite
   (Ca(OH)(2)) as a possible mineralogical CO2 sequestration process. The
   overall carbonation reaction includes the following steps: (I) Ca
   release from portlandite dissolution, (2) CO2 dissolution in water and
   (3) CaCO3 precipitation. This CO2 sequestration mechanism was supported
   by geochemical modelling of final solutions using PHREEQC software, and
   observations by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction of
   final reaction products. According to the experimental protocol, the
   system proposed Would favour the total capture of approx. 218 kg Of CO2
   into stable calcite/ton of paper waste, independently of initial CO2
   pressure. The final product from the carbonation process is a calcite
   (ca. 100wt\%)-water dispersion. Indeed, the total captured CO2
   mineralized as calcite could be Stored in degraded soils or even used
   for diverse industrial applications. This result demonstrates the
   possibility of using the alkaline liquid-solid waste for CO2 mitigation
   and reduction of greenhouse effect gases into the atmosphere. (c) 2008

Title = {On the influence of building design, occupants and heat waves on comfort
   and greenhouse gas emissions in naturally ventilated offices. A study
   based on the EN 15251 adaptive thermal comfort model in Athens, Greece},

Abstract = {According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the buildings
   sector has the largest mitigation potential for CO2 emissions.
   Especially in office buildings, where internal heat loads and a
   relatively high occupant density occur at the same time with solar heat
   gains, overheating has become a common problem. In Europe the adaptive
   thermal comfort model according to EN 15251 provides a method to
   evaluate thermal comfort in naturally ventilated buildings. However,
   especially in the context of the climate change and the occurrence of
   heat waves within the last decade, the question arises, how thermal
   comfort can be maintained without additional cooling, especially in warm
   climates. In this paper a parametric study for a typical cellular
   naturally ventilated office room has been conducted, using the building
   simulation software EnergyPlus. It is based on the Mediterranean climate
   of Athens, Greece. Adaptive thermal comfort is evaluated according to EN
   15251. Variations refer to different building design priorities, and
   they consider the variability of occupant behaviour and internal heat
   loads by using an ideal and worst case scenario. The influence of heat
   waves is considered by comparing measured temperatures for an average
   and an exceptionally hot year within the last decade. Since the use of
   building controls for shading affects thermal as well as visual comfort,
   daylighting and view are evaluated as well. Conclusions are drawn
   regarding the influence and interaction of building design, occupants
   and heat waves on comfort and greenhouse gas emissions in naturally
   ventilated offices, and related optimisation potential.},

Volume = {101},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events due to climate change and growing economic and
   development activities along coastlines have resulted in increased risks
   from natural and human-induced disasters-affecting the safety and
   livelihoods of coastal communities. Assessing community resilience to
   disasters is, therefore, an essential step toward mitigating their
   current and future risks. This study provides a systematic review of
   coastal community resilience frameworks for disaster risk management,
   covering their content, structure, and assessment. Sixty-four critical
   resilience criteria under four dimensions are identified by analyzing
   the convergence and divergence of the consideration of assessment
   indicators in the reviewed frameworks. Existing frameworks focus mostly
   on `governance and institutions,' `infrastructure,' and `society and the
   economy.' Despite significant risks, the impacts on the environment and
   potential risks of climate change are not prioritized. Only 22\% of the
   frameworks consider future risks, rendering the remainder inadequate for
   assessing projected risks from climate change. None of the frameworks
   consulted the full spectrum of stakeholders (public, government, and
   experts) during the development process, which compromised their
   applicability, acceptability, and effectiveness. 56\% of the frameworks
   considered a single hazard type. Community resilience is inherently
   multi-dimensional. Therefore, the interrelationships between multiple
   hazards should be adequately addressed in future frameworks.},

Title = {Glacial greenhouse-gas fluctuations controlled by ocean circulation

Pages = {373-376},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Earth's climate and the concentrations of the atmospheric greenhouse
   gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) varied strongly on
   millennial timescales during past glacial periods. Large and rapid
   warming events in Greenland and the North Atlantic were followed by more
   gradual cooling, and are highly correlated with fluctuations of N2O as
   recorded in ice cores. Antarctic temperature variations, on the other
   hand, were smaller and more gradual, showed warming during the Greenland
   cold phase and cooling while the North Atlantic was warm, and were
   highly correlated with fluctuations in CO2. Abrupt changes in the
   Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) have often been
   invoked to explain the physical characteristics of these Dansgaard -
   Oeschger climate oscillations(1-3), but the mechanisms for the
   greenhouse- gas variations and their linkage to the AMOC have remained
   unclear(4-8). Here we present simulations with a coupled model of
   glacial climate and biogeochemical cycles, forced only with changes in
   the AMOC. The model simultaneously reproduces characteristic features of
   the Dansgaard - Oeschger temperature, as well as CO2 and N2O
   fluctuations. Despite significant changes in the land carbon inventory,
   CO2 variations on millennial timescales are dominated by slow changes in
   the deep ocean inventory of biologically sequestered carbon and are
   correlated with Antarctic temperature and Southern Ocean stratification.
   In contrast, N2O co-varies more rapidly with Greenland temperatures
   owing to fast adjustments of the thermocline oxygen budget. These
   results suggest that ocean circulation changes were the primary
   mechanism that drove glacial CO2 and N2O fluctuations on millennial
   timescales.},

Abstract = {Ship-source greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase by up to 250\%
   by 2050 from their 2012 levels, owing to increasing global freight
   volumes. Binding international legal agreements to regulate GHGs,
   however, are lacking as technical solutions remain expensive, and
   crucial industrial support is absent. In 2003, the International
   Maritime Organization adopted Resolution A.963 (23) to regulate shipping
   CO2 emissions via technical, operational, and market-based routes.
   However, progress has been slow and uncertain; there is no concrete
   emission reduction target or definitive action plan. Yet, a full-fledged
   roadmap may not even emerge until 2023. In this policy analysis, we
   revisit the progress of technical, operational, and market-based routes
   and the associated controversies. We argue that 1) a performance-based
   index, though good-intentioned, has loopholes affecting meaningful CO2
   emission reductions driven by technical advancements; 2) using slow
   steaming to cut energy consumption stands out among all operational
   solutions thanks to its immediate and obvious results, but with the
   already slow speed in practice, this single source has limited emission
   reduction potential; 3) without a technology-savvy shipping industry, a
   market-based approach is essentially needed to address the environmental
   impact. To give shipping a 50:50 chance for contributing fairly and
   proportionately to keep global warming below 2 degrees C, deep emission
   reductions should occur soon.},

   (CH4) into the atmosphere, is a major source of global warming. As such
   a large emphasis has been placed on developing methods of measuring the
   amount of gas escaping from natural seep sites, particularly in the
   marine environment. Fortunately, gaseous bubbles crossing the seabed
   interface into the water column are relatively easily detected and
   quantified by passive acoustics. Here we design an active acoustic model
   to determine the frequency dependent changes in sound speed and
   attenuation in the water column due to gaseous CO2. Our approach is to
   formulate a numerical model simulating the propagation of sound energy
   at different frequencies through a mixed media incorporating a gas
   bubble plume with detection on a hydrophone.},

Abstract = {In this study an attempt was made to estimate how man's activity can
   affect global phenomena. The emission Of CO(2) and other greenhouse
   gases generated by man's activity was considered. The amount of these
   gases was compared with natural resources resulting from air composition
   and solubility of these gases in sea water. Natural resources of CO(2)
   in the atmosphere and water were estimated using mathematical relations
   proposed by the authors. Quantities of radiation energy reaching the
   earth surface were also compared with the energy produced by man on
   Earth. Solar energy supplied to our planet was estimated using NASA data
   published in the esteemed scientific journals. Taking the example of two
   selected problems it was found that man's activity as compared with
   natural resources, is by several orders of magnitude smaller and cannot
   have a significant effect in a global scale. Nature forces, Sun activity
   and natural long-term cycles instigate global changes. Nevertheless,
   man's activity has an important meaning on both time and space scale.
   The authors quote examples of man's activity destructive for the natural
   environment, which in a long-term period have undoubtedly significant
   impact on local climate and negative phenomena observed on a local
   scale. One can mention the excess flue gas emissions, devastation of
   green areas, regulation of natural reservoirs and watercourses.},

   carried out for ocean energy. This study analyses ocean energy devices,
   including all technologies currently being proposed, in order to gain a
   better understanding of their environmental impacts and explore how they
   can contribute to a more sustainable energy supply.
   The study followed the methodology of life cycle assessment including
   all life cycle steps from cradle to grave. The various types of device
   were assessed, on the basis of a functional unit of 1 kWh of electricity
   delivered to the grid. The impact categories investigated were based on
   the ILCD recommendations. The life cycle models were set up using
   detailed technical information on the components and structure of around
   180 ocean energy devices from an in-house database.
   The design of ocean energy devices still varies considerably, and their
   weight ranges from 190 to 1270 t, depending on device type.
   Environmental impacts are closely linked to material inputs and are
   caused mainly by mooring and foundations and structural components,
   while impacts from assembly, installation and use are insignificant for
   all device types. Total greenhouse gas emissions of ocean energy devices
   range from about 15 to 105 g CO2-eq. kWh(-1). Average global warming
   potential for all device types is 53 +/- 29 g CO2-eq. kWh(-1). The
   results of this study are comparable with those of other studies and
   confirm that the environmental impacts of ocean energy devices are
   comparable with those of other renewable technologies and can contribute
   to a more sustainable energy supply.
   Ocean energy devices are still at an early stage of development compared
   with other renewable energy technologies. Their environmental impacts
   can be further reduced by technology improvements already being pursued
   by developers (e.g. increased efficiency and reliability). Future life
   cycle assessment studies should assess whole ocean energy arrays or
   ocean energy farms.},

Title = {Enhancing Social Resilience of the Coastal Fishing Communities: A Case
   Study of Hilsa (Tenualosa Ilisha H.) Fishery in Bangladesh},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Social resilience is an essential aspect of sustainability in
   environmental management, especially in poor resource-dependent
   communities. To better understand the dynamics of social resilience, we
   have conducted a primarily qualitative study of communities dependent on
   hilsa fishing in two coastal villages in southern Bangladesh. This study
   applies concepts of social-ecological system (SES), social resilience
   and co-management in outlining our qualitative data and framing its
   interpretation. Our findings show that while the establishment of hilsa
   sanctuary areas has enhanced the previously low ecological
   sustainability of local small-scale fishing, the management of this
   program has challenged the social resilience of hilsa fishers by
   creating new inequalities in the distribution of power and privilege, in
   terms of the ways in which seasonal fishing bans are enforced and
   compensation for income loss during the ban periods is distributed.
   Based on our findings, we suggest specific measures for strengthening
   social resilience at the local level, including building community
   networks, developing community infrastructures, updating existing rules
   and regulations, providing alternative means of generating income for
   fishers during the crisis periods (e.g. natural disasters and fishing
   ban periods) and more active sharing of responsibility between
   stakeholders and government for management of the hilsa fishery. These
   findings are also applicable to understanding the issues beyond rules
   and regulations that co-management arrangements need to address in order
   to be successful and to enhancing the function of co-management
   arrangements in improving social resilience within resource-dependent
   communities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Aerosol cooling reduces tropical cyclone (TC) potential intensity (PI)
   more strongly, by about a factor of 2 per degree of sea surface
   temperature change, than greenhouse gas warming increases it. This study
   analyzes single-forcing and historical experiments from phase 5 of the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, aiming to understand the physical
   mechanisms behind this difference. Calculations are done for the
   tropical oceans of each hemisphere during the relevant TC seasons,
   emphasizing multimodel means. PI theory is used to interpret the
   difference in the PI response to aerosol and greenhouse gas forcings in
   terms of three factors. The net surface turbulent heat flux (sum of the
   latent and sensible heat fluxes) explains half of the difference,
   thermodynamic efficiency explains at most a small fraction, and surface
   wind speed does not explain the remainder, perhaps because of the use of
   monthly mean data. Changes in turbulent surface heat fluxes are
   interpreted as responses to surface radiative flux changes in the
   context of the energy balance of the ocean mixed layer. Radiative
   kernels are used to estimate what fractions of the surface radiative
   flux changes are feedbacks due to temperature and water vapor changes.
   The greater effect of aerosol forcing occurs because shortwave forcing
   has a greater direct, temperature-independent component at the surface
   than does longwave forcing, for a forcing amplitude that provokes the
   same SST change. This conclusion recalls prior work on the response of
   precipitation to radiative forcing, and the similarities and differences
   between precipitation and potential intensity in this regard are
   discussed.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Investigation of Near-Surface CO2 and Its Affecting
   Factors Over Asia},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {In this work, we extracted the near-surface CO2 concentration from the
   Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CarbonTracker model datasets for a
   temporal period of eight years from 2010 to 2017 to study the
   spatiotemporal distribution of near-surface CO2 and the factors
   affecting it over five regions of Asia, including Central Asia, East
   Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia. The near-surface CO2
   datasets from both satellite and model were first validated against the
   ground-based CO2 observations obtained from the World Data Center for
   Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) stations located in Asia to confirm their
   applicability, and the results showed a good agreement between the
   datasets with significant correlations. The results from the time-series
   analyses showed a gradual increase in the near-surface CO2 with
   significant monthly and seasonal variations over all the regions. To
   study the factors affecting the spatial distribution of near-surface
   CO2, we investigated the relationship of near-surface CO2 with the
   anthropogenic CO2 emissions, terrestrial ecosystem, and winds. The
   results showed that, over Asia, the anthropogenic CO2 emissions and
   winds primarily controlled the spatial distribution of near-surface CO2.
   However, in the areas where anthropogenic emissions were lower, the
   terrestrial ecosystem and winds affected the near-surface CO2
   distribution. To study the factors controlling the temporal distribution
   of near-surface CO2, the relationship of near-surface CO2 with
   vegetation, precipitation, and relative humidity was investigated. The
   results showed an inverse relationship between near-surface CO2 and
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, and
   relative humidity over monsoon-influenced regions, i.e., East Asia,
   South Asia, and Southeast Asia. However, a positive relation of
   near-surface CO2 was observed with precipitation and relative humidity
   over arid and semiarid regions, i.e., Central Asia and West Asia. The
   results were also verified by determining the correlations among these
   variables.},

Abstract = {Pacific Islanders who live on atolls are among the first people who have
   begun to be seriously impacted by the effects of global climate change.
   These are the people whose entire landscape is typically no higher than
   one meter above sea level. Extreme environmental changes are nothing new
   to these communities. Over many generations these atoll cultures have
   survived major, unpredictable and locally devastating changes that are
   of the same magnitude as those expected from climate changes. An
   examination of traditional ecological knowledge of Marshall Islanders at
   Rongelap atoll serves to illustrate some of the coping strategies that
   have enabled these people to be resilient in the past and in the current
   environmental crisis. Interviews revealed that these atoll dwellers
   actively manage the resources that are most likely to be impacted by
   climate change. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Scientists have advocated for local interventions, such as creating
   marine protected areas and implementing fishery restrictions, as ways to
   mitigate local stressors to limit the effects of climate change on
   reef-building corals. However, in a literature review, we find little
   empirical support for the notion of managed resilience. We outline some
   reasons for why marine protected areas and the protection of herbivorous
   fish (especially parrotfish) have had little effect on coral resilience.
   One key explanation is that the impacts of local stressors (e.g.,
   pollution and fishing) are often swamped by the much greater effect of
   ocean warming on corals. Another is the sheer complexity (including
   numerous context dependencies) of the five cascading links assumed by
   the managed-resilience hypothesis. If reefs cannot be saved by local
   actions alone, then it is time to face reef degradation head-on, by
   directly addressing anthropogenic climate change-the root cause of
   global coral decline.},

Abstract = {Adaptation is an important approach for protecting human health,
   ecosystems, and economic systems from the risks posed by climate
   variability and change, and for exploiting beneficial opportunities
   provided by a changing climate. This paper presents 9 fundamental
   principles that should be considered when designing adaptation policy,
   for example, a sound understanding of the potential regional effects of
   climate on human and ecological systems is required to target
   appropriate investments in adaptive responses. The distribution of
   potential impacts across different populations and the mechanisms by
   which these impacts occur are also key to effective adaptation measures.
   Options for coping with climatic changes must be considered in the
   context of multiple stressors. Further, adaptation is likely to exhibit
   varying levels of effectiveness as demonstrated by current efforts to
   deal with climate variability. Potential adverse side effects of
   adaptive strategies must also be accounted for to avoid solutions that
   are worse than the problem. These issues and others are presented in
   this paper, with examples from various impacts studies to illustrate key
   points.},

Abstract = {Due to the challenges of an increasing planetary temperature and limited
   natural resources, quantifying anthropogenic pressure on the natural
   environment is of increasingly great importance. Although
   ``foot-print{''} has been widely discussed for describing certain
   anthropogenic impacts on the environment, com-prehensive analyses of
   multiple environmental footprints are seldom conducted. Hence, this
   study tries to evaluate consumption-based footprints covering water,
   greenhouse gasses, and pollutants by using the environmentally extended
   input-output table. Taking Japan as an example, six water sources,
   including potable water, non-potable water, underground water, green
   water, reclaimed water, and seawater, are thoroughly analyzed to
   determine the water footprint from production to consumption. In
   addition, the greenhouse gas footprint and pollutant footprint are also
   analyzed separately. The comprehensive insights from consumption-based
   accounting provide another picture of environmental burdens, which will
   ben-efit future consumption-based measurements. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

   highlights the need for adaptive (coastal) planning and management in
   the face of changing and uncertain future conditions. Finally, it points
   out research needs and challenges regarding adaptation in port cities,
   namely the need for localized risk assessments, the need to reduce
   adaptation deficits, the need to mainstream adaptation into spatial
   planning, the need for advanced studies on adaptation measures, the need
   for integrated efforts, the need for adaptive planning approaches for
   dealing with changing risks over time, under uncertainty in highly

Title = {Human-Induced Rainfall Reduction in Drought-Prone Northern Central Asia},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {The reduction of summer rainfall since the 1950s has resulted in severe
   drought and the degradation of vegetation over northern Central Asia
   (NCA). However, whether the decline trend of summer rainfall is
   anthropogenic or natural remains unknown. Here, we show evidences that
   the drying trend is dominated by anthropogenic change of the subtropical
   westerly jet (SWJ; referring exclusively to the active center located
   over Central Asia). Using 10 global climate models participating in the
   Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) under
   different forcings, we find that the observed changes in the SWJ are
   attributable to the combined contributions of greenhouse gases and
   anthropogenic aerosols. Enhanced emissions of greenhouse gases favor an
   equatorial shift of the SWJ, while increased Asian pollution and reduced
   European aerosol emissions weaken the SWJ. Both of these factors
   strengthen the descending motion and decrease the precipitation over
   NCA.
   Plain Language Summary
   The northern Central Asia (NCA) is facing a crisis of water resources
   shortage. And the reduction of summer rainfall since the 1950s has
   resulted in severe drought and the degradation of vegetation over there.
   Understanding why precipitation changes in this droughtprone region is
   of vital importance for the agriculture, ecosystems and economies
   therein. Based on 10 state-of-art climate coupled models forced by
   natural (including solar activity and volcanic aerosols) and/ or
   external forcings (including greenhouse gases and anthropogenic
   aerosols), we show evidence that the drying trend is dominated by
   anthropogenic change of the atmospheric circulation evinced in the
   southward shift and weakening of the subtropical westerly jet (SWJ).
   Enhanced emissions of greenhouse gases favor an equatorial shift of the
   SWJ, while increased Asian pollution and reduced European aerosol
   emissions weaken the SWJ. Our results highlight the impacts of human
   activities on the fragile Central Asian ecosystem, not only directly,
   e.g., the construction of dams, diversion of waterways and wasting of
   water, but also indirectly by influencing the local hydrological cycle.},

Title = {Global hotspots for coastal ecosystem-based adaptation},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Helping the world's coastal communities adapt to climate change impacts
   requires evaluating the vulnerability of coastal communities and
   assessing adaptation options. This includes understanding the potential
   for `natural' infrastructure (ecosystems and the biodiversity that
   underpins them) to reduce communities' vulnerability, alongside more
   traditional `hard' infrastructure approaches. Here we present a
   spatially explicit global evaluation of the vulnerability of
   coastal-dwelling human populations to key climate change exposures and
   explore the potential for coastal ecosystems to help people adapt to
   climate change (ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)). We find that
   mangroves and coral reefs are particularly well situated to help people
   cope with current weather extremes, a function that will only increase
   in importance as people adapt to climate change now and in coming
   decades. We find that around 30.9 million people living within 2km of
   the coast are highly vulnerable to tropical storms and sea-level rise
   (SLR). Mangroves and coral reefs overlap these threats to at least 5.3
   and 3.4 million people, respectively, with substantial potential to
   dissipate storm surges and improve resilience against SLR effects.
   Significant co-benefits from mangroves also accrue, with 896 million
   metric tons of carbon stored in their soils and above- and below-ground
   biomass. Our framework offers a tool for prioritizing `hotspots' of
   coastal EbA potential for further, national and local analyses to
   quantify risk reduction and, thereby, guide investment in coastal
   ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change. In doing so, it
   underscores the global role that conserving and restoring ecosystems can
   play in protecting human lives and livelihoods, as well as biodiversity,
   in the face of climate change.},

Abstract = {Climate change is being experienced particularly intensely in the
   Arctic. Arctic average temperature has risen at almost twice the rate as

   present additional evidence of strong Arctic warming. These changes in
   the Arctic provide an early indication of the environmental and societal
   significance of global consequences. The Arctic also provides important
   natural resources to the rest of the world (such as oil, gas, and fish)
   that will be affected by climate change, and the melting of Arctic
   glaciers is one of the factors contributing to sea level rise around the
   globe. An acceleration of these climatic trends is projected to occur
   during this century, due to ongoing increases in concentrations of
   greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. These Arctic changes will,
   in turn, impact the planet as a whole.},

   In India, the Gulf of Khambhat can produce 5000 MW of power. As the

Abstract = {Wetlands impact global warming by regulating the atmospheric exchange of
   greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
   and nitrous oxide (N2O). We investigated GHG emissions in the Great
   Lakes coastal wetlands across various hydrologic, temperature, and
   nitrogen (N) inflow regimes using a process-based simulation model. We
   found the emission of CH4, N2O, and sequestration of C (i.e., negative
   net ecosystem exchange, NEE) in our simulations were all positively
   related to water residence time and N inflow, primarily due to greater
   plant productivity and N uptake, which facilitated greater C and N
   cycling rates in the model. Water level scenarios also had an effect on
   GHG exchanges by moderating the transitions between aerobic and
   anaerobic conditions. Temperature effects on GHGs were minimal compared
   with other factors. The net sustained-flux global warming potential
   (SGWP; i.e., sum SGWP of CH4, N2O, and NEE) of wetlands on 20-year and
   100-year time horizons were both primarily driven by CH4 emissions and
   strongly controlled by the tradeoffs between CH4 emission and CO2
   sequestration, with a negligible amount of simulated N2O emissions.
   Future research could include model enhancements to provide increased
   process-level details on the aerobic-anaerobic transitions or the direct
   effects of plants on mediating GHG exchanges. Field studies addressing
   the interaction of N inflows and water residence time at appropriately
   large scales are needed to test the complex interactions revealed by our
   modeling study. Our results highlight the previously under-appreciated
   role of nitrogen and water residence time in modulating SGWP in coastal
   wetlands.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from a seminatural, extensively sheep-grazed
   drained moorland and intensively sheep-grazed fertilised grassland in
   South East (SE) Scotland were compared over 4 yr (2007-2010). Nitrous
   oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured by static chambers,
   respiration from soil plus ground vegetation by a flow-through chamber,
   and the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) by
   eddy-covariance. All GHG fluxes displayed high temporal and interannual
   variability. Temperature, radiation, water table height and
   precipitation could explain a significant percentage of seasonal and
   interannual variations. Greenhouse gas fluxes were dominated by the net
   ecosystem exchange of CO2 at both sites. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2
   and respiration was much larger on the productive fertilised grassland
   (-1567 and 7157 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) than on the
   seminatural moorland (-267 and 2554 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1),
   respectively). Large ruminant CH4 (147 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1)) and soil
   N2O (384 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1)) losses from the grazed grassland
   counteracted the CO2 uptake by 34 \%, whereas the small N2O (0.8
   gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1)) and CH4 (7 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1)) emissions from
   the moorland only impacted the NEE flux by 3 \%. The 4-yr average GHG
   budget for the grazed grassland was -1034 gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1) and -260
   gCO(2eq) m(-2) yr(-1) for the moorland.},

Title = {Large increase in diffusive greenhouse gas fluxes from subtropical
   shallow aquaculture ponds during the passage of typhoons},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {583},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tropical cyclones are extreme perturbations that can affect the
   biogeochemical cycles in tropical and temperate coastal ecosystems. Yet,
   whether typhoon events would affect the magnitude of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions from shallow aquaculture ponds in the subtropical
   coastal regions is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated
   and compared the diffusive fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the
   mariculture ponds at a subtropical estuary in southeast China before,
   during, and after the passage of three typhoons. Our results indicate
   that the average diffusive CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes during typhoon
   passage were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed
   during both the pre-typhoon and post-typhoon periods. We estimated
   conservatively that the estuarine aquaculture ponds emitted GHGs at a
   rate of about 3145 mg CO2-eq m(-2) h(-1) into the atmosphere during the
   passage of typhoons, which was substantially higher than the average
   emission rates of 30.8 and 35.2 mg CO2-eq m(-2) h(-1) observed during
   the pre- and post-typhoon periods, respectively. Our findings
   demonstrated that the typhoon passage period can be a hot moment of GHG
   emissions from aquaculture ponds in the subtropical estuaries, and
   highlight the importance of capturing short-term disturbance events such
   as typhoons to accurately assess the annual GHG balance and hence the
   climatic impacts on these shallow water ecosystems.},

Title = {Assessing California Wintertime Precipitation Responses to Various
   Climate Drivers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Understanding how drivers of climate change affect precipitation remains
   an important area of research. Although several robust precipitation
   responses have been identified under continued increases in greenhouse
   gases (GHGs), considerable uncertainty remains. This is particularly the
   case at regional scales, including the West Coast of the United States
   and California. Here, we exploit idealized, single forcing simulations
   from the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project
   (PDRMIP) to address how climate drivers impact California wintertime
   precipitation. Consistent with recent work, GHGs including carbon
   dioxide and methane, as well as solar forcing, yield a robust increase
   in California wintertime precipitation. We also find robust California
   precipitation responses to aerosols but with opposite responses for
   sulfate versus black carbon aerosol. Sulfate aerosol increases
   California wintertime precipitation, whereas black carbon reduces it.
   Moreover, California precipitation is more sensitive to aerosols,
   particularly regional emissions from Europe and Asia, than to GHGs.
   These precipitation responses are consistent with shifts in the jet
   stream and altered moisture fluxes. Although the idealized nature of
   PDRMIP simulations precludes a formal attribution, our results suggest
   that aerosols can perturb precipitation and fresh water resources along
   the West Coast of the United States.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change constitutes a main challenge for the Wadden
   Sea. Accelerated sea level rise, increasing temperatures and changing
   wind climate may strongly alter present structures and functions of the
   ecosystem with negative consequences both for nature conservation and
   for coastal risk management. Being aware of these challenges,
   Schleswig-Holstein State Government decided to establish an integrated
   climate change adaptation strategy for the Schleswig-Holstein sector of
   the Wadden Sea. The strategy was adopted in June 2015. It aims at the
   long-term maintenance of present functions and structures as well as the
   integrity of the Wadden Sea ecosystem in a changing climate. The
   strategy was prepared by a project group consisting of representatives
   from State authorities as well as from nature conservation organisations
   and local institutions. First outcome of the strategy is that extra
   adaptation measures will not be necessary in the coming decades.
   However, pending on the future rate of sea level rise, shoreline erosion
   and sediment deficits in the Wadden Sea will increase and sooner or
   later drowning of tidal flats and terrestrial habitats like beaches,
   primary dunes and salt marshes will start. At the time when management
   measures to counteract the negative developments become expedient from a
   nature conservation viewpoint as well as for coastal risk management,
   adequate actions with minimized ecological interferences are possible.
   It is assumed that balancing the sediment deficits as the main
   adaptation measure may be implemented most efficiently by concentrating
   sediment suppletion at locations where natural forces organize
   redistribution in the Wadden Sea. Local technical coastal risk
   management measures like the strengthening of sea defences will,
   nevertheless, remain necessary as well.},

Title = {Trace metal requirements for microbial enzymes involved in the
   production and consumption of methane and nitrous oxide},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Fluxes of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere are heavily influenced by
   microbiological activity. Microbial enzymes involved in the production
   and consumption of greenhouse gases often contain metal cofactors. While
   extensive research has examined the influence of Fe bioavailability on
   microbial CO2 cycling, fewer studies have explored metal requirements
   for microbial production and consumption of the second- and third-most
   abundant greenhouse gases, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Here
   we review the current state of biochemical, physiological, and
   environmental research on transition metal requirements for microbial
   CH4 and N2O cycling. Methanogenic archaea require large amounts of Fe,
   Ni, and Co (and some Mo/W and Zn). Low bioavailability of Fe, Ni, and Co
   limits methanogenesis in pure and mixed cultures and environmental
   studies. Anaerobic methane oxidation by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea
   (AN ME) likely occurs via reverse methanogenesis since ANME possess most
   of the enzymes in the methanogenic pathway. Aerobic CH4 oxidation uses
   Cu or Fe for the first step depending on Cu availability, and additional
   Fe, Cu, and Mo for later steps. N2O production via classical anaerobic
   denitrification is primarily Fe-based, whereas aerobic pathways
   (nitrifier denitrification and archaeal ammonia oxidation) require Cu in
   addition to, or possibly in place of, Fe. Genes encoding the
   Cu-containing N2O reductase, the only known enzyme capable of microbial
   N2O conversion to N-2, have only been found in classical denitrifiers.
   Accumulation of N2O due to low Cu has been observed in pure cultures and
   a lake ecosystem, but not in marine systems. Future research is needed
   on metalloenzymes involved in the production of N2O by enrichment
   cultures of ammonia oxidizing archaea, biological mechanisms for
   scavenging scarce metals, and possible links between metal
   bioavailability and greenhouse gas fluxes in anaerobic environments
   where metals may be limiting due to sulfide-metal scavenging.},

Abstract = {Caribbean small island communities are particularly vulnerable to the
   impacts of climate change. While climate policy is often formulated at
   the national level, climate impacts are first felt in local communities.
   This research note, which is part of a larger research project on
   climate change adaptation in Caribbean coastal communities, reviews the
   recent literature on human system adaptations to climate change at the
   local level in the Caribbean. It seeks to answer two questions: (1) How
   are human systems at the local level adapting to climate change in the
   Caribbean? (2) What challenges exist for local-level climate adaptations
   in human systems that seek to protect vulnerable communities in the
   Caribbean? The studies reviewed highlight the importance of considering
   the vulnerability of sub-populations, protecting their livelihoods, and
   pursuing institutional cooperation at the local and national levels. In
   interrogating whether the recommendations for community adaptations in
   the literature are transferrable to other geographies, this note further
   emphasizes that understanding the challenges that communities face in
   protecting human systems against climate change can help policy-makers
   develop more effective adaptation strategies that centre climate
   justice.},

Abstract = {Recent reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperatures and climate
   forcing over the past 1000 years allow the warming of the 20th century
   to be placed within a historical context and various mechanisms of
   climate change to be tested. Comparisons of observations with
   simulations from an energy balance climate model indicate that as much
   as 41 to 64\% of preanthropogenic (pre-1850) decadal-scale temperature
   variations was due to changes in solar irradiance and volcanism. Removal
   of the forced response from reconstructed temperature time series yields
   residuals that show similar variability to those of control runs of
   coupled models, thereby lending support to the models' value as
   estimates of low-frequency variability in the climate system. Removal of
   all forcing except greenhouse gases from the similar to 1000-year time
   series results in a residual with a very large late-20th-century warming
   that closely agrees with the response predicted from greenhouse gas
   forcing. The combination of a unique level of temperature increase in
   the late 20th century and improved constraints on the role of natural
   variability provides further evidence that the greenhouse effect has
   already established itself above the level of natural variability in the
   climate system. A 21st-century global warming projection far exceeds the
   natural variability of the past 1000 years and is greater than the best
   estimate of global temperature change for the last interglacial.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, international climate policy has increasingly focused
   on limiting temperature rise, as opposed to achieving
   greenhouse-gas-concentration-related objectives. The agreements reached
   at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change conference
   in Cancun in 2010 recognize that countries should take urgent action to
   limit the increase in global average temperature to less than 2 degrees
   C relative to pre-industrial levels(1). If this is to be achieved,
   policymakers need robust information about the amounts of future
   greenhouse-gas emissions that are consistent with such temperature
   limits. This, in turn, requires an understanding of both the technical
   and economic implications of reducing emissions and the processes that
   link emissions to temperature. Here we consider both of these aspects by
   reanalysing a large set of published emission scenarios from integrated
   assessment models in a risk-based climate modelling framework. We find
   that in the set of scenarios with a `likely' (greater than 66\%) chance
   of staying below 2 degrees C, emissions peak between 2010 and 2020 and
   fall to a median level of 44 Gt of CO2 equivalent in 2020 (compared with
   estimated median emissions across the scenario set of 48 Gt of CO2
   equivalent in 2010). Our analysis confirms that if the mechanisms needed
   to enable an early peak in global emissions followed by steep reductions
   are not put in place, there is a significant risk that the 2 degrees C
   target will not be achieved.},

Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The potential of biochar for mitigating climatic impacts of coastal
   saline bioenergy production is not well established. A full accounting
   of net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) and greenhouse gas intensity
   (GHGI) affected by biochar amendment combined with or without nitrogen
   (N) fertilizer application was examined in an annual coastal reclaimed
   Jerusalem artichoke bioenergy cropping system. The net ecosystem
   exchange of CO2 (NEE) was determined by the difference between soil
   heterotrophic respiration (R-H) and net primary production (NPP) using
   static chamber method. Biochar amendment raised the seasonal R-H but
   without suppressing the NPP during the Jerusalem artichoke cropping
   season. Soil CH4 emissions were 72\% and 80\% lower in the biochar
   amended than unamended plots when combined with N fertilizer application
   during the Jerusalem artichoke cropping and non-cropping seasons,
   respectively. The biochar-induced soil N2O mitigation efficiency was
   weakened by N fertilizer input over the annual cycle. Annual NGHGB and
   GHGI were negative for all the field treatments and were significantly
   lower in biochar amended than in unamended soils, suggesting that
   Jerusalem artichoke cropping system served as a net sink of GHGs due to
   net ecosystem CO2 and biochar-induced C sequestration exceeding
   CO2-equivalents released as CH4 and N2O emissions. On average, biochar
   amendment significantly enhanced GHGs sink capacity by resulting in
   almost 4-5 folds decrease in annual NGHGB or GHGI when combined with N
   fertilizer application or not. Therefore, higher biomass gain as
   potential alternative source of biofuels but lower climatic impacts of
   bioenergy production would be reconciled by biochar use in southeast
   coastal China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an essential technology for reducing
   global CO2 emissions in the context of continued fossil fuel use in the
   power sector. To evaluate the emission reduction potential of any
   low-carbon generation technology it is necessary to consider emissions
   over the entire lifetime of the plant. This work examines the lifecycle
   greenhouse gas emissions of a 500 MWe pulverised coal-fired power plant
   with post-combustion Calcium Looping (CaL) and off-shore geological
   storage. CaL uses solid CO2-sorbent derived from abundant and non-toxic
   limestone (CaCO3) and is currently being piloted at the 1-2 MWth scale
   in Europe (Spain and Germany). This technology promises to be very
   competitive with the more mature chemical absorption processes, with the
   potential to reduce the efficiency and cost penalties of CO2 capture. We
   demonstrate that the emission intensity of a coal-fired power plant with
   CaL is at least comparable with one using MEA-solvent technology (i.e.,
   similar to 229 gCO(2)e/kWh vs. 225 gCO(2)e/kWh). However, there is
   significant potential for additional emissions reduction when
   considering the recarbonation of exhausted sorbent in landfill.
   Furthermore, a coal-fired power plant with CaL could be carbon-neutral -
   or even achieve a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. That is, if
   the exhausted sorbent is used in the cement industry substituting the
   input of fresh-limestone; or if the exhausted sorbent is disposed in the
   ocean forming bicarbonate.},

Title = {Net Zero: Science, Origins, and Implications},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {849-887},
Abstract = {This review explains the science behind the drive for global net zero
   emissions and why this is needed to halt the ongoing rise in global
   temperatures. We document how the concept of net zero carbon dioxide
   (CO2) emissions emerged from an earlier focus on stabilization of
   atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Using simple conceptual
   models of the coupled climatecarbon cycle system, we explain why
   approximately net zero CO2 emissions and declining net energy imbalance
   due to other climate drivers are required to halt global warming on
   multidecadal timescales, introducing important concepts, including the
   rate of adjustment to constant forcing and the rate of adjustment to
   zero emissions. The concept of net zero was taken up through the 5th
   Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and
   the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
   Structured Expert Dialogue, culminating in Article 4 of the 2015 Paris
   Agreement. Increasing numbers of net zero targets have since been
   adopted by countries, cities, corporations, and investors. The degree to
   which any entity can claim to have achieved net zero while continuing to
   rely on distinct removals to compensate for ongoing emissions is at the
   heart of current debates over carbon markets and offsetting both inside
   and outside theUNFCCC. We argue that whatmatters here is not the
   precisemakeup of a basket of emissions and removals at any given point
   in time, but the sustainability of a net zero strategy as a whole and
   its implications for global temperature over multidecadal timescales.
   Durable, climate-neutral net zero strategies require like-for-like
   balancing of anthropogenic greenhouse gas sources and sinks in terms of
   both origin (biogenic versus geological) and gas lifetime.},

Title = {Intense methane ebullition from urban inland waters and its significant
   contribution to greenhouse gas emissions},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {189},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The evasions of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from inland
   waters represent substantial fluxes of greenhouse gases into the
   atmosphere, offsetting a large part of the continental carbon sink.
   However, the CH4 and CO2 emissions from urban inland waters are less
   constrained. In particular, ebullitive CH4 emissions from these waters
   are poorly understood. Here, we measured the concentrations and fluxes
   of CH4 and CO2 in rivers and lakes in the megacity of Beijing, China,
   between 2018 and 2019. The CH4 concentration ranged from 0.08 to 70.2
   umol L-1 with an average of 2.5 +/- 5.9 umol L-1. The average CH4
   ebullition was 11.3 +/- 30.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and was approximately 6
   times higher than the global average. The average total CH4 flux (14.2
   +/- 35.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was 3 times higher than the global average,
   with ebullition accounting for 80\% of the flux. The high surface water
   CH4 concentrations and ebullitive fluxes were caused by high sediment
   organic carbon/dissolved organic carbon contents, high aquatic primary
   productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters. The
   CH4 emissions accounted for 20\% of CO2 emissions in terms of the carbon
   release and were 1.7 times higher in terms of CO2 equivalent emissions
   from Beijing inland waters. Furthermore, the CH4 ebullition and its
   contribution to the total carbon gas emissions increased exponentially
   with the water temperature, suggesting a positive feedback probably
   occurs between the greenhouse gas emissions from urban inland waters and
   climate warming. This study confirms the major role of CH4 ebullition
   from urban inland waters in the global carbon budget under the rapid
   progress of global urbanization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Rural households in South Asia's coastal deltas face numerous livelihood
   challenges, including risks posed by climatic variability and extreme
   weather events. This study examines major climate risks, farmers'
   adaptation strategies, and the factors affecting the choice of those
   strategies using data collected from 630 households in southwestern
   coastal Bangladesh. Farmers identified cyclones, excessive rain and
   flooding, and salinity as direct climate risks. Increased crop
   diseases/pests and livestock diseases were perceived as indirect risks
   resulting from climatic variability. Farmers used multiple adaptation
   strategies against those risks such as modifications in farm management,
   use of savings and borrowing funds from family and neighbors, and
   periodically reducing household food consumption. Off-farm employment
   and seeking assistance from governmental as well as non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) were also common adaptation strategies. The results
   show that male-headed households are more likely to change farming
   practices and reduce consumption compared with female-headed households
   that conversely tended to take assistance from NGOs as an adaptation
   strategy. Ownership of land and livestock, as well as farmers' prior
   exposure to climate change and educational training, also had a
   significant effect on the choice of adaptation strategy. Therefore,
   development interventions and policies that aimed at improving resource
   endowment and training to farmers on climatic risks and their adaptation
   strategies can help minimize the impact of climatic risks.},

Title = {The role of hydrogen in a greenhouse gas-neutral energy supply system in
   Germany},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {270},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Hydrogen is widely considered to play a pivotal role in successfully
   transforming the German energy system, but the German government's
   current ``National Hydrogen Strategy{''} does not specify how hydrogen
   utilization, production, storage or distribution will be implemented.
   Addressing key uncertainties for the German energy system's path to
   greenhouse gas-neutrality, this paper examines hydrogen in different
   scenarios. This analysis aims to support the concretization of the
   German hydrogen strategy. Applying a European energy supply model with
   strong interactions between the conversion sector and the hydrogen
   system, the analysis focuses on the requirements for geological hydrogen
   storages and their utilization over the course of a year, the
   positioning of electrolyzers within Germany, and the contributions of
   hydrogen transport networks to balancing supply and demand. Regarding
   seasonal hydrogen storages, the results show that hydrogen storage
   facilities in the range of 42 TWhH2 to 104 TWhH2 are beneficial to shift
   high electricity generation volumes from onshore wind in spring and fall
   to winter periods with lower renewable supply and increased electricity
   and heat demands. In 2050, the scenario results show electrolyzer
   capacities between 41 GWel and 75 GWel in Germany. Electrolyzer sites
   were found to follow the low-cost renewable energy potential and are
   concentrated on the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts with their high wind
   yields. With respect to a hydrogen transport infrastructure, there were
   two robust findings: One, a domestic German hydrogen transport network
   connecting electrolytic hydrogen production sites in northern Germany
   with hydrogen demand hubs in western and southern Germany is
   economically efficient. Two, connecting Germany to a European hydrogen
   transport network with interconnection capacities between 18 GWH2 and 58
   GWH2 is cost-efficient to meet Germany's substantial hydrogen demand.},

Abstract = {As climate change intensifies, there is increasing interest in
   developing models that reduce uncertainties in projections of global
   climate and refine these projections to finer spatial scales. Forecasts
   of climate impacts on ecosystems are far more challenging and their
   uncertainties even larger because of a limited understanding of physical
   controls on biological systems. Management and conservation plans that
   explicitly account for changing climate are rare and even those
   generally rely on retrospective analyses rather than future scenarios of
   climatic conditions and associated responses of specific ecosystems.
   Using past biophysical relationships as a guide to predicting the
   impacts of future climate change assumes that the observed relationships
   will remain constant. However, this assumption involves a long chain of
   uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions, climate sensitivity
   to changes in greenhouse gases, and the ecological consequences of
   climate change. These uncertainties in forecasting biological responses
   to changing climate highlight the need for resource management and
   conservation policies that are robust to unknowns and responsive to
   change. We Suggest how policy might develop despite substantial
   uncertainties about the future state of salmon ecosystems.},

Title = {Sediment Disturbance Negatively Impacts Methanogen Abundance but Has
   Variable Effects on Total Methane Emissions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Methane emissions from aquatic ecosystems are increasingly recognized as
   substantial, yet variable, contributions to global greenhouse gas
   emissions. This is in part due to the challenge of modeling biologic
   parameters that affect methane emissions from a wide range of sediments.
   For example, the impacts of fish bioturbation on methane emissions in
   the literature have been shown to result in a gradient of reduced to
   enhanced emissions from sediments. However, it is likely that variation
   in experimental fish density, and consequently the frequency of
   bioturbation by fish, impacts this outcome. To explore how the frequency
   of disturbance impacts the levels of methane emissions in our previous
   work we quantified greenhouse gas emissions in sediment microcosms
   treated with various frequencies of mechanical disturbance, analogous to
   different levels of activity in benthic feeding fish. Greenhouse gas
   emissions were largely driven by methane ebullition and were highest for
   the intermediate disturbance frequency (disturbance every 7 days). The
   lowest emissions were for the highest frequency treatment (3 days). This
   work investigated the corresponding impacts of disturbance treatments on
   the microbial communities associated with producing methane. In terms of
   total microbial community structure, no statistical difference was
   observed in the total community structure of any disturbance treatment
   (0, 3, 7, and 14 days) or sediment depth (1 and 3 cm) measured. Looking
   specifically at methanogenic Archaea however, a shift toward greater
   relative abundance of a putatively oxygen-tolerant methanogenic
   phylotype (ca. Methanothrix paradoxum) was observed for the highest
   frequency treatments and at depths impacted by disturbance (1 cm).
   Notably, quantitative analysis of ca. Methanothrix paradoxum
   demonstrated no change in abundance, suggesting disturbance negatively
   and preferentially impacted other methanogen populations, likely through
   oxygen exposure. This was further supported by a linear decrease in
   quantitative abundance of methanogens (assessed by qPCR of the mcrA
   gene), with increased disturbance frequency in bioturbated sediments (1
   cm) as opposed to those below the zone of bioturbation (3 cm). However,
   total methane emissions were not simply a function of methanogen
   populations and were likely impacted by the residence time of methane in
   the lower frequency disturbance treatments. Low frequency mechanical
   disruption results in lower methane ebullition compared to higher
   frequency treatments, which in turn resulted in reduced overall methane
   release, likely through enhanced methanotrophic activities, though this
   could not be identified in this work. Overall, this work contributes to
   understanding how animal behavior may impact variation in greenhouse gas
   emissions and provides insight into how frequency of disturbance may
   impact emissions.},

Abstract = {Despite its enormous cost, large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS)
   is considered a viable strategy for significantly reducing CO2 emissions
   associated with coal-based electrical power generation and other
   industrial sources of CO2 {[}Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

   Szulczewski ML, et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109: 5185-5189]. We
   argue here that there is a high probability that earthquakes will be
   triggered by injection of large volumes of CO2 into the brittle rocks
   commonly found in continental interiors. Because even small-to
   moderate-sized earthquakes threaten the seal integrity of CO2
   repositories, in this context, large-scale CCS is a risky, and likely
   unsuccessful, strategy for significantly reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions.},

Title = {Climate Change Hotspots Identification in China through the CMIP5 Global
   Climate Model Ensemble},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {China is one of the countries vulnerable to adverse climate changes. The
   potential climate change hotspots in China throughout the 21st century
   are identified in this study by using a multimodel, multiscenario
   climate model ensemble that includes Phase Five of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) atmosphere-ocean general circulation
   models. Both high (RCP8.5) and low (RCP4.5) greenhouse gas emission
   trajectories are tested, and both the mean and extreme seasonal
   temperature and precipitation are considered in identifying regional
   climate change hotspots. Tarim basin and Tibetan Plateau in West China
   are identified as persistent regional climate change hotspots in both
   the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The aggregate impacts of climate change
   increase throughout the 21st century and are more significant in RCP8.5
   than in RCP4.5. Extreme hot event and mean temperature are two climate
   variables that greatly contribute to the hotspots calculation in all
   regions. The contribution of other climate variables exhibits a notable
   subregional variability. South China is identified as another hotspot
   based on the change of extreme dry event, especially in SON and DJF,
   which indicates that such event will frequently occur in the future. Our
   results can contribute to the designing of national and cross-national
   adaptation and mitigation policies.},

Title = {Assessing Uncertainties of Well-To-Tank Greenhouse Gas Emissions from
   Hydrogen Supply Chains},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier in the clean energy systems
   currently being developed. However, its effectiveness in mitigating
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions requires conducting a lifecycle analysis
   of the process by which hydrogen is produced and supplied. This study
   focuses on the hydrogen for the transport sector, in particular
   renewable hydrogen that is produced from wind-or solar PV-powered
   electrolysis. A life cycle inventory analysis is conducted to evaluate
   theWell-to-Tank (WtT) GHG emissions from various renewable hydrogen
   supply chains. The stages of the supply chains include hydrogen being
   produced overseas, converted into a transportable hydrogen carrier
   (liquid hydrogen or methylcyclohexane), imported to Japan by sea,
   distributed to hydrogen filling stations, restored from the hydrogen
   carrier to hydrogen and filled into fuel cell vehicles. For comparison,
   an analysis is also carried out with hydrogen produced by steam
   reforming of natural gas. Foreground data related to the hydrogen supply
   chains are collected by literature surveys and the Japanese life cycle
   inventory database is used as the background data. The analysis results
   indicate that some of renewable hydrogen supply chains using liquid
   hydrogen exhibited significantly lower WtT GHG emissions than those of a
   supply chain of hydrogen produced by reforming of natural gas. A
   significant piece of the work is to consider the impacts of variations
   in the energy and material inputs by performing a probabilistic
   uncertainty analysis. This suggests that the production of renewable
   hydrogen, its liquefaction, the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane and
   the compression of hydrogen at the filling station are the GHG-intensive
   stages in the target supply chains.},

Abstract = {Human-induced changes to global climate have become increasingly
   difficult to ignore in recent years. As the frequency and severity of
   extreme weather events increases, the impacts on both natural and human
   systems are becoming difficult to manage with the current policies. In
   Canada, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change is the
   Arctic, where temperatures are rising at a rate two to three times that
   of the global average. Warmer seasonal temperatures have led to melting
   permafrost and increased variability in sea ice conditions, which has
   contributed to a rise in coastal erosion. The ongoing resilience of
   Arctic communities will depend heavily on their ability to implement
   successful long-term adaptation policies. The development and
   implementation of any action on climate change adaptation should involve
   collaboration with local stakeholders in order to reflect the views and
   experience of those living in the Arctic.},

Title = {Mechanisms of Forced Tropical Meridional Energy Flux Change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1725-1742},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Anthropogenically forced changes to the mean and spatial pattern of sea
   surface temperatures (SSTs) alter tropical atmospheric meridional energy
   transport throughout the seasonal cycle in total, its partitioning
   between the Hadley cells and eddies and, for the Hadley cells, the
   relative roles of the mass flux and the gross moist stability (GMS). The
   authors investigate this behavior using an atmospheric general
   circulation model forced with SST anomalies caused by either historical
   greenhouse gas or aerosol forcing, dividing the SST anomalies into two
   components: the tropical mean SST anomaly applied uniformly and the full
   SST anomalies minus the tropical mean.
   For greenhouse gases, the polar-amplified SST spatial pattern partially
   negates enhanced eddy pole-ward energy transport driven by mean warming.
   Both SST components weaken winter Hadley cell circulation and alter GMS.
   The Northern Hemisphere focused aerosol cooling induces northward energy
   flux anomalies in the deep tropics, which manifest partially via
   strengthened northern and weakened southern Hadley cell overturning.
   Aerosol-induced GMS changes also contribute to the northward energy
   fluxes. A simple thermodynamic scaling qualitatively captures these
   changes, although it performs less well for the greenhouse gas
   simulations. The scaling provides an explanation for the tight
   correlation demonstrated in previous studies between shifts in the
   intertropical convergence zone and cross-equatorial energy fluxes.},

Title = {Managing tourism emissions through optimizing the tourism demand mix:
   Concept and analysis},
Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {81},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbon mitigation strategies are an urgent and overdue tourism industry
   imperative. The tourism response to climate action has been to engage
   businesses in technology adoption, and to encourage more sustainable
   visitor behaviour. These strategies however are insufficient to mitigate
   the soaring carbon footprint of tourism. Building upon the concepts of
   optimization and eco-efficiency, we put forward a novel carbon
   mitigation approach, which seeks to pro-actively determine, foster, and
   develop a long-term tourist market portfolio. This can be achieved
   through intervening and reconfiguring the demand mix with the
   fundamental aim of promoting low carbon travel markets. The concept and
   the analytical framework that quantitatively inform optimization of the
   desired market mix are presented. Combining the ``de-growth{''} and
   ``optimization{''} strategies, it is demonstrated that in the case study
   of Taiwan, great potential exists to reduce emissions and sustain
   economic yields. The implications for tourism destination managers and
   wider industry stakeholders are discussed.},

Abstract = {As a contribution to the 2019 World Water Day, the Accademia Nazionale
   dei Lincei promoted a symposium on ``Coastal protection and
   management{''}. A selection of the papers presented at the meeting have
   been assembled as a Topical Collection. Costal zones are densely
   populated due to their morphological, climate, economic and recreational
   opportunities, but are exposed to the adverse effects of the sea action,
   in the recent decades worsened by growing human impact and sea level
   rise. Both erosion and accretion change the shoreline and the coastal
   zones, with the first prevailing today. Different estimates have been
   produced of beach erosion at a global or national level. In Italy more
   than 40\% of the low coasts are presently eroding, despite decades of
   expensive beach defence works. In addition, high coastal infrastructures
   and settlements recently became more frequently exposed to storm surges.
   The papers collection deals with (a) monitoring studies of natural and
   man-induced shoreline changes, (b) hard and soft shore protections
   projects, (c) littoral hazards as tsunami, extreme high waters and storm
   surges, (d) protection of cultural heritage threatened by sea. General
   considerations on the challenge posed by the sea-level rise and possible
   solutions, i.e. defence, adaptation or managed retreat, are briefly
   summarized.},

Title = {New cool concrete for building envelopes and urban paving: Optics-energy
   and thermal assessment in dynamic conditions},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is an acknowledged effect that causes higher
   temperatures in urban areas compared to the surrounding rural areas.
   Such urban overheating directly increases buildings' energy demand for
   cooling, to reach thermal comfort conditions in the indoor areas. This
   phenomenon increases energy consumption and, consequently, greenhouse
   gas emissions in the cooling season. Moreover, it seriously threatens
   citizens' environmental comfort in urban areas. In this context, the use
   of cool (high solar reflectance and thermal emittance) materials has
   been widely acknowledged as a promising passive UHI mitigation solution.
   However, the application of such cool materials does not comply with the
   environmental preservation of cultural heritage sites, for architectural
   reasons. In fact, historical districts, which constitute a large part of
   European building stock, are often characterized by non-cool, dark
   colored materials. Therefore, the most common, light-colored cool
   solutions cannot be applied, since regulations on such protected areas
   are strict. Indeed, the above-mentioned regulations do not allow the
   modification of visible parts of the building. In this paper, innovative
   concrete elements with infrared-reflective (IR) pigments are presented
   to be used as i) urban paving, ii) building facade elements, and iii)
   retrofit strategies for walls and pavements in historical buildings.
   Both in-lab and in-field characterization of the samples are carried out
   with dynamically varying thermal and radiative forcing. Results indicate
   that prototypes with IR pigments have higher solar reflectance, up to
   +15.8\% compared to standard concrete prototypes and +12.5\% with
   respect to same color prototypes without high infrared reflective
   pigments. Moreover, they are able to maintain surface temperatures that
   are up to -10.6 degrees C lower with respect to non-IR samples. These
   results confirm that the presented composite material represents a good
   solution for passive cooling at building and inter-building scale. (C)

Abstract = {Low-lying, densely populated coastal areas worldwide are under threat,
   requiring coastal managers to develop new strategies to cope with land
   subsidence, sea-level rise and the increasing risk of
   storm-surge-induced floods. Traditional engineering approaches
   optimizing for safety are often suboptimal with respect to other
   functions and are neither resilient nor sustainable. Densely populated
   deltas in particular need more resilient solutions that are robust,
   sustainable, adaptable, multifunctional and yet economically feasible.
   Innovative concepts such as `Building with Nature' provide a basis for
   coastal protection strategies that are able to follow gradual changes in
   climate and other environmental conditions, while maintaining flood
   safety, ecological values and socio-economic functions. This paper
   presents a conceptual framework for Building with Nature that is used to
   evaluate coastal protection strategies, based on a case study of the
   Holland coast in the Netherlands. The added value and the limitations of
   these strategies are discussed.},

Abstract = {Ocean-driven ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is asignificant
   contributor to sea-level rise. Recent ocean variability in theAmundsen
   Sea is controlled by near-surface winds. We combine
   palaeoclimatereconstructions and climate model simulations to understand
   past and futureinfluences on Amundsen Sea winds from anthropogenic
   forcing and internalclimate variability. The reconstructions show strong
   historical wind trends.External forcing from greenhouse gases and
   stratospheric ozone depletiondrove zonally uniform westerly wind trends
   centred over the deep SouthernOcean. Internally generated trends
   resemble a South Pacific Rossby wavetrain and were highly influential
   over the Amundsen Sea continental shelf.There was strong interannual and
   interdecadal variability over the AmundsenSea, with periods of
   anticyclonic wind anomalies in the 1940s and 1990s,when rapid ice-sheet
   loss was initiated. Similar anticyclonic anomaliesprobably occurred
   prior to the 20th century but without causing the presentice loss. This
   suggests that ice loss may have been triggered naturally inthe 1940s but
   failed to recover subsequently due to the increasingimportance of
   anthropogenic forcing from greenhouse gases (since the 1960s)and ozone
   depletion (since the 1980s). Future projections also featurestrong wind
   trends. Emissions mitigation influences wind trends over thedeep
   Southern Ocean but has less influence on winds over the Amundsen
   Seashelf, where internal variability creates a large and
   irreducibleuncertainty. This suggests that strong emissions mitigation
   is needed tominimise ice loss this century but that the uncontrollable
   future influenceof internal climate variability could be equally
   important.},

Abstract = {Seasonality and crab activity affects the nutrients and physicochemical
   parameters in mangrove soils, thus, affecting the emissions of
   greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O). Climate change may
   intensify rainfall and/or enhance droughts, affecting mangroves and
   associated biota. Crabs are natural soil bioturbators responsible for
   soil aeration and turnover. We evaluated the effect of Ucides cordatus
   crab on N2O emissions from mangrove soils under a semiarid climate in
   Northeastern Brazil. Soil and gas samples were collected over the rainy
   and dry seasons in crab-naturally-bioturbated and crab-exclusion
   mangrove plots. We measured the soil's pH, redox potential, and the
   total contents of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. We found higher N2O
   emissions in the crab-exclusion sites compared to the bioturbated sites,
   as well as higher N2O emissions in the rainy season compared to the dry
   season. The fluxes of N2O (mu g m(-2) h(-1)) were 47.3 +/- 9.7 and 8.9
   +/- 0.5 for the crab-exclusion sites, and 36.5 +/- 7.8 and 4.5 +/- 2.1
   for the bioturbated sites (wet and dry seasons, respectively). The soil
   turning over by macrofauna led to lower N2O fluxes in natural
   crab-bioturbated areas, and seasonality was the environmental factor
   that contributed the most to the changes in N2O emissions. Broadly,
   anthropic activities and seasonality influence nitrogen fate, N2O
   emissions, and ecological services in coastal ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Conversion of wetlands by drainage for agriculture or other
   anthropogenic activities could have a negative or positive feedback to
   global warming (GWF). We suggest that a major predictor of the GWF is
   salinity of the wetland soil (a proxy for available sulfate), a factor
   often ignored in other studies. We assess the radiative balance of two
   northern salt marshes with average soil salinities > 20 ppt, but with
   high (macro-) and low (micro-) tidal amplitudes. The flux of greenhouse
   gases from soils at the end of the growing season averaged 485 +/- 253
   mg m(-2) h(-1), 13 +/- 30 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and 19 +/- 58 mu g m(-2)
   h(-1) in the microtidal marsh and 398 +/- 201 mg m(-2) h(-1), 2 +/- 26
   mu g m(-2) h(-1), and 35 +/- 77 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the macrotidal marsh
   for CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively. High rates of C sequestration mean
   that loss of these marshes would have a radiative balance of
   -981CO(2-)eq. m(-2) yr(-1) in the microtidal and
   -567CO(2-)eq.m(-2)yr(-1) in the macrotidal marsh.},

Title = {Practicing Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change: Lessons from Integrated
   Coastal Management},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-335},
Abstract = {The challenges faced in adapting to climate change present themselves
   with increasing urgency. Nowhere will these challenges be greater than
   in the developing world where often weak institutions and governance
   systems struggle to deal with mounting pressures from population growth,
   inadequate infrastructure, and diminishing or already depleted natural
   resources. This article synthesizes the many global climate change and
   other anthropogenic threats to coastal ecosystems and draws on lessons
   and good practices from global experience in integrated coastal
   management (ICM) that can be transferred to coastal adaptation to these
   challenges. The case is made that the process and best practices of ICM
   are not radically changed by applying a climate lens. For the most part,
   the good practices of planning and implementation coastal management
   measures apply equally to climate change as they do to other coastal
   issues. However, there are some new and important considerations that
   enter into planning and decision-making with respect to climate change.
   These considerations include the need for an even greater emphasis on
   nature-based coastal protection strategies and measures, more pronounced
   issues of uncertainty in decision-making, the need for a longer planning
   horizon, and the importance of including in the decision-making equation
   opportunities to mitigate the sources of climate change with adaptation
   measures.},

Abstract = {Climate change and sea level rise present significant risks to coastal
   governments' fiscal and service solvency. Current lack of focus on
   climate change by the U.S. federal and some state governments pressures
   coastal governments to develop tractable solutions to manage localized
   risks. This research integrates adaptive governance and capital planning
   literatures to develop an adaptive risk management framework. Heeding
   the call for research of coastal county actions to plan for and respond
   to climate change, we conduct content analysis of planning documents,
   financial reports, meeting minutes, media reports, and other
   documentation of all coastal counties in Florida to quantify government
   efforts to address climate change. Risk management practices are
   hierarchically categorized by focus area, risk type, and tactic and
   placed within the adaptive risk management process framework. A
   well-functioning adaptive risk management process can redefine vague
   climate change risks into knowable, tractable problems to address.},

Title = {Carbon sequestration is not inhibited by livestock grazing in Danish
   salt marshes},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {S19-S35},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change has created a need for solutions that can counteract
   greenhouse gas emissions. One is the expansion and maintenance of
   natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal
   and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled ``blue carbon ecosystems{''}
   including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage
   potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international
   attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the
   blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration
   rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and
   evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase
   biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates.
   The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes
   were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not
   lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation
   rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated
   significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites.
   Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration
   rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3),
   4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the
   latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for
   the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of
   grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall
   C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas
   emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon
   management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change
   mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {A complex controversy emerged when the grey seal population in the
   Baltic Sea recovered after decades of stagnation. The seals now cause
   substantial economic losses to coastal fisheries. The paper analyses the
   attempts taken in Finland to mitigate the problems of fishermen. The
   mitigation attempts include the hunting of seals, fishing technology
   development, economic compensations and more comprehensive management
   approaches. These measures are discussed in light of the long-term
   sustainability and adaptability of a coastal fishery. This question is
   important with respect to further discussions on the possibility of the
   coastal fishery's co-existence with seals and sheds light on more
   general goals for the adaptability in the management of
   social-ecological systems. The paper concludes that the more
   comprehensive measures taken have acknowledged the need to enhance the
   fishery's adaptability, but the managerial approach they represent falls
   short of the requirements for successful adaptive management, especially
   in terms of embedding the management into specific coastal contexts. (C)

Abstract = {During the 20th century, the mean temperature of the air at the ground

   temperatures occurred after 1980. These were significantly warmer than
   those of the last millennium. Simultaneously, rain and drought, cold and
   heat wave frequencies have changed, mountain glaciers retreated and the
   sea-level increased by similar to10 cm. This warming was at least in
   part induced by human activities and will continue during the next
   decades. Its amplitude will depend on the rate of greenhouse gas and
   sulphate aerosols emissions, i.e. on energetic scenarios. Pending
   scientific uncertainties include cloud variations and interactions

Abstract = {The main objective of the CONSCIENCE project was to develop and test
   concepts, guidelines and tools for the sustainable management of erosion
   along the European coastline, based on the best available scientific
   knowledge and on existing practical experience. Four concepts are
   potentially capable of providing the nexus between scientific knowledge
   and management: coastal resilience, coastal sediment cell, favourable
   sediment status and strategic sediment reservoir. The project has tested
   the use of these concepts and found that they are useful, provided that
   they are positioned and linked within a logical structure that we shall
   call the CONSCIENCE ``Frame of Reference{''}, defined in time and space
   and supported through data and monitoring. Practical experience in six
   coastal sites in Europe has shown that the use of this Frame of
   Reference together with these concepts can make management objectives
   explicit and transparent. It can therefore support the design of an
   appropriate, resilience based coastal erosion management practice. (C)

Title = {Preparing for Sea-Level Rise through Adaptive Managed Retreat of a New
   Zealand Stormwater and Wastewater Network},
Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise increasingly affects low-lying and exposed coastal
   communities due to climate change. These communities rely upon the
   delivery of stormwater and wastewater services which are often
   co-located underground in coastal areas. Due to sea-level rise and
   associated compounding climate-related hazards, managing these networks
   will progressively challenge local governments as climate change
   advances. Thus, responsible agencies must reconcile maintaining Levels
   of Service as the impacts of climate change worsen over the coming
   decades and beyond. A critical question is whether such networks can
   continue to be adapted/protected over time to retain Levels of Service,
   or whether eventual retreat may be the only viable adaptation option? If
   so, at what performance threshold? In this paper, we explore these
   questions for stormwater and wastewater, using a dynamic adaptive
   pathway planning (DAPP) approach designed to address thresholds and
   increasing risk over time. Involving key local stakeholders, we here use
   DAPP to identify thresholds for stormwater and wastewater services and
   retreat options, and for developing a comprehensive and area-specific
   retreat strategy comprising pathway portfolios, retreat phases,
   potential land use changes, and for exploring pathway conflicts and
   synergies. The result is a prototype for an area near Wellington, New
   Zealand, where a managed retreat of water infrastructure is being
   considered at some future juncture. Dynamic adaptive strategies for
   managed retreats can help to reduce future disruption from coastal
   flooding, signal land use changes early, inform maintenance, and allow
   for gradual budget adjustments by the agencies that can manage
   expenditure over time. We present this stepwise process in a pathway
   form that can be communicated spatially and visually, thereby making a
   retreat a more manageable, sequenced, adaptation option for water
   agencies, and the communities they serve.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies for climate change impacts on water quality: a
   systematic review of the literature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Abstract = {Climate change will impact water bodies and create significant
   challenges for natural resource managers. Despite the increasing impacts
   of climate change on water quality, the development and implementation
   of long-term strategic adaptation measures are seldom governmental
   priorities. So far, research has mainly tended to focus on the
   availability and volume of water rather than the quality. Comparatively
   fewer studies have considered adaptation strategies that deal with the
   uncertainties of the impacts of climate change on the quality of water
   bodies. This paper reports the results of a systematic review of
   literature on adaptation options and the barriers and drivers that can
   exert a positive or negative influence on their implementation. Findings
   suggest that there has been and continues to be a cautious approach to a
   growing concern for a natural resource of utmost necessity. Most of the
   strategies mentioned in the literature use coping or incremental
   approaches. However, adaptation strategies offering low levels of
   resilience for addressing water quality may not be up to the challenge
   of significant future climate changes.},

Title = {Methane adsorption on coals with different coal rank under elevated
   temperature and pressure},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {254},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Increasing methane recovery rates from coal mines reduces greenhouse gas
   emissions and benefits mining safety. In recent years, raising the
   temperature of coal seams has been recognized as a potential method of
   improving methane recovery. However, the effect of elevated temperature
   (especially higher than 80 degrees C) on methane adsorption on coals is
   rarely studied. In this study, we investigated the effects of elevated
   temperature and pressure on methane adsorption on different types
   (ranking) of coal, and their thermal stability. We found that for all
   six coal samples measured, maximum methane adsorption capacities sharply
   decrease with increasing temperature, showing a linear relationship
   (r(2) = 0.705-0.975), and that coals began to pyrolyze at 267-500
   degrees C depending on the coal type. We defined the
   temperature-dependent decrease in methane adsorption of coal as its
   thermal desorption capacity, and found that coal types with higher fixed
   carbon content have a larger magnitude thermal desorption capacity.
   These results indicate that raising the coal seam temperature while
   capturing methane is a promising method for obtaining higher coalbed
   methane recovery rates, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving
   mining safety.},

Title = {Retrieval and validation of carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor for
   the Canary Islands IR-laser occultation experiment},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {3315-3336},
Abstract = {The first ground-based experiment to prove the concept of a novel
   space-based observation technique for microwave and infrared-laser
   occultation between low-Earthorbit satellites was performed in the
   Canary Islands between La Palma and Tenerife. For two nights from 21 to
   22 July 2011 the experiment delivered the infrared-laser differential
   transmission principle for the measurement of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in
   the free atmosphere. Such global and long-term stable measurements of
   GHGs, accompanied also by measurements of thermodynamic parameters and
   line-of-sight wind in a self-calibrating way, have become very important
   for climate change monitoring. The experiment delivered promising
   initial data for demonstrating the new observation concept by retrieving
   volume mixing ratios of GHGs along a similar to 144 km signal path at
   altitudes of similar to 2.4 km. Here, we present a detailed analysis of
   the measurements, following a recent publication that introduced the
   experiment's technical setup and first results for an example retrieval
   of CO2. We present the observational and validation data sets, the
   latter simultaneously measured at the transmitter and receiver sites;
   the measurement data handling; and the differential transmission
   retrieval procedure. We also determine the individual and combined
   uncertainties influencing the results and present the retrieval results
   for (CO2)-C-12, (CO2)-C-13, (COO)-O-18, H2O and CH4. The new method is
   found to have a reliable basis for monitoring of greenhouse gases such
   as CO2, CH4, and H2O in the free atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Mangroves of the semiarid Caatinga region of northeastern Brazil are
   being rapidly converted to shrimp pond aquaculture. To determine
   ecosystem carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from this
   widespread land use, we measured carbon stocks of eight mangrove forests
   and three shrimp ponds in the Acarau and Jaguaribe watersheds in Ceara
   state, Brazil. The shrimp ponds were paired with adjacent intact
   mangroves to ascertain carbon losses and potential emissions from land
   conversion. The mean total ecosystem carbon stock of mangroves in this
   semiarid tropical landscape was 413 +/- 94 Mg C/ha. There were highly
   significant differences in the ecosystem carbon stocks between the two
   sampled estuaries suggesting caution when extrapolating carbon stock
   across different estuaries even in the same landscape. Conversion of
   mangroves to shrimp ponds resulted in losses of 58\%-82\% of the
   ecosystem carbon stocks. The mean potential emissions arising from
   mangrove conversion to shrimp ponds was 1,390 Mg CO(2)e/ha. Carbon
   losses were largely from soils which accounted for 81\% of the total
   emission. Losses from soils >100cm in depth accounted for 33\% of the
   total ecosystem carbon loss. Soil carbon losses from shrimp pond
   conversion are equivalent to about 182years of soil carbon accumulation.
   Losses from mangrove conversion are about 10-fold greater than emissions
   from conversion of upland tropical dry forest in the Brazilian Caatinga
   underscoring the potential value for their inclusion in climate change
   mitigation activities.},

Abstract = {Local values and knowledge can be important components in creating
   robust climate change adaptation strategies for marginalized
   communities. Incorporating local values into the climate change planning
   process in a structured way and effectively using local knowledge not
   only improves the identification of priority actions for climate change
   adaptation, but also supports successful implementation. Much of climate
   change adaptation planning in recent years identifies actions derived
   from expert-driven vulnerability assessments and adaptation actions. Yet
   the values of each community influence how climate change impacts are
   perceived, and what adaptation actions are locally acceptable and will
   have local buy-in for implementation. Thus, it is important that
   planning incorporates local values if the goal is successful adaptation
   to climate change. This paper provides one approach for addressing this
   through a participatory, values-based process for climate change
   adaptation planning. The approach is contextualized through a case study
   of the Gitga'at Nation, located in northern coastal British Columbia,
   Canada, where key values were found to be culturally important food
   sources, culture, environmental resources, self-sufficiency, health,
   infrastructure to enable us to live well, and Gitga'at pride and
   cooperation. These values were used throughout the planning process to
   contextualize climate change impacts on Gitga'at members' way of life
   and to develop and evaluate adaptation actions. It is hoped that this
   case study provides further proof of the utility of values-based
   planning in the context of adaptation planning for marginalized
   communities.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing concern over global warming, as well as
   environmental pollution and protection issues. Resource recycling helps
   the effective reduction of greenhouse gases and environmental pollution,
   and improves the quality of life for many people. This paper proposes a
   deep-learning object detection system for resource recycling. The
   resource recycling of the objects including paper cups, plastic bottles,
   and aluminum cans was conducted by artificial intelligence. Single shot
   multibox detector (SSD) and faster region-based convolutional neural
   network (Faster R-CNN) models were utilized for the training of the
   deep-learning object detection. With regard to data set images and
   training time, the accuracy, training steps, and loss function of the
   SSD and Faster R-CNN models were studied. The accuracy and loss
   characteristics of the deep-learning object detection system for
   resource recycling were demonstrated. The system exhibits good potential
   for the applications of resource recycling and environmental protection.},

Title = {Emission Characteristics of Greenhouse Gases and Their Correlation with

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from natural sources have received a
   considerable attention for the past decade due to their considerable
   effects on global warming and climate change. Of many natural GHG
   sources, wetland plays a crucial role in modulating the atmospheric
   GHGs. This study aims to continuously monitor the emission/uptake of
   GHGs from an estuarine mangroves in summer August at Southeastern China
   (23 degrees 5345.32N, 117 degrees 2407.61E). A self-designed open
   dynamic floating chamber was applied to collect air samples for
   continuously measuring GHG concentration in-situ with a non-dispersive
   infrared (NDIR) monitor. Diurnal emission of GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O)
   from the mangroves, the mudflats, and the river water was characterized
   by considering tidal and solar radiation effects. This study also
   investigated the seasonal variation of GHG emission and estimated their
   overall CO2 equivalent (CO2-e). The GHG emission was further correlated
   with water quality to identify which water quality parameters dominated
   GHG emission in the estuarine mangroves. A positive correlation was
   found between CO2 emission and water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO),
   and total phosphorus (TP) in water. The emission of CH4 positively
   correlated with TP, DO, and NH4-N. The emission of N2O was significantly
   positively correlated with DO, TP, and total nitrogen (TN) in water.
   This study revealed that N2O was the dominant contributor to the global
   warming effect in the subtropical estuarine mangroves while compared to
   CO2 and CH4.},

Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization regulations on the reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from ships require efficient dealing
   with this complex techno-economic and highly political problem through
   joint efforts of all major stakeholders from the shipbuilding industry
   and ship operations.
   The key problems of any research in the field of renewable energy,
   including power generation, storage, transformation and distribution,
   and the issues associated with limited power generation for specific
   loads, are the same issues that are experienced in the implementation of
   electric distribution technologies onboard ships.
   This paper analyses the effects of efficient shipping using the solar
   panel system and batteries to ensure continuous power supply, regardless
   of the weather conditions. The logistics chain of this control
   architecture is modelled by Colored Petri Nets. The economic analysis
   examines the annual costs of fuel consumption, the initial capital cost,

Title = {Evolution of water vapor concentrations and stratospheric age of air in

Abstract = {Stratospheric water vapor concentrations and age of air are investigated
   in an ensemble of coupled chemistry- climate model simulations covering
   the period from 1960 to 2005. Observed greenhouse gas concentrations,
   halogen concentrations, aerosol amounts, and sea surface temperatures
   are all specified in the model as time-varying fields. The results are
   compared with two experiments (time-slice runs) with constant forcings
   for the years 1960 and 2000, in which the sea surface temperatures are
   set to the same climatological values, aerosol concentrations are fixed
   at background levels, while greenhouse gas and halogen concentrations
   are set to the values for the relevant years.
   The time-slice runs indicate an increase in stratospheric water vapor
   from 1960 to 2000 due primarily to methane oxidation. The age of air is
   found to be significantly less in the year 2000 run than the 1960 run.
   The transient runs from 1960 to 2005 indicate broadly similar results:
   an increase in water vapor and a decrease in age of air. However, the
   results do not change gradually. The age of air decreases significantly
   only after about 1975, corresponding to the period of ozone reduction.
   The age of air is related to tropical upwelling, which determines the
   transport of methane into the stratosphere. Oxidation of increased
   methane from enhanced tropical upwelling results in higher water vapor
   amounts. In the model simulations, the rate of increase of stratospheric
   water vapor during the period of enhanced upwelling is up to twice the
   long-term mean. The concentration of stratospheric water vapor also
   increases following volcanic eruptions during the simulations.},

Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas and ozone depleting
   substance, but its natural sources, especially marine emissions, are
   poorly constrained. Localized high concentrations have been observed in
   the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the tropical Pacific but the impacts
   of El Nino cycles on this key source region are unknown. Here we show
   atmospheric monitoring station measurements in Samoa combined with
   atmospheric back-trajectories provide novel information on N2O
   variability across the South Pacific. Remarkable elevations in Samoan
   concentrations are obtained in air parcels that pass over the OMZ. The
   data further reveal that average concentrations of these OMZ air parcels
   are augmented during La Nina and decrease sharply during El Nino. The
   observed natural spatial heterogeneities and temporal dynamics in marine
   N2O emissions can confound attempts to develop future projections of
   this climatically active gas as low oxygen zones are predicted to expand
   and El Nino cycles change.},

Abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the
   state of knowledge of mangrove Vulnerability and responses to predicted
   climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available
   evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise
   may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface
   elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer
   term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising
   sea-level will have the greatest impact oil mangroves experiencing net
   lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward
   migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at
   high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainly over other
   climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed
   on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to
   effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are
   needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation.
   Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve
   resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt
   to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of
   activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the
   mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors oil
   mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in
   systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include
   mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation,
   replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options. (C) 2008

Title = {Methane and carbon dioxide emissions from cultivated and native mangrove
   species in Dongzhai Harbor, Hainan},

Abstract = {The strength of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from
   different mangrove species are not well understood, and the roles that
   pneumatophores and litter play are especially unclear. For a complete
   seasonal cycle, we measured CH4 and CO2 fluxes from a cultivated
   mangrove species (Sonneratia apetala) and three typical native mangrove
   species: Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal and Kandelia obovata. Our
   results demonstrated that The CO2 emission rates of the four mangrove
   communities and the mudflat showed seasonal changes, and the emission
   rate was higher in summer than in winter. The CO2 fluxes were
   significantly higher in the soils of cultivated compared to native
   mangroves (P < 0.05) but there was no similar trend for CH4 fluxes.
   Pneumatophores in different mangrove species played different roles in
   CH4 and CO2 fluxes from soils. Pneumatophores in the B. sexangula and K.
   obovata communities significantly decreased CH4 emission (P < 0.05), but
   those in the C. tagal and S. apetala communities did not significantly
   affect it. The S. apetala with bamboo-like pneumatophores had
   significantly greater CO2 emission rate than the other three mangrove
   communities (P < 0.05). Pneumatophores in the S. apetala community
   significantly decreased CO2 emission (P < 0.05), but those in the other
   three communities had no significant effect. Litter had a significant
   effect on CH4 emission from mangrove soils, but not on CO2. Soil
   moisture content affected the CH4 emission rate; and temperature and
   other factors jointly affected the CO2 emission rate.},

Title = {A Review of Economic Incentives to Promote Decarbonization Alternatives
   in Maritime and Inland Waterway Transport Modes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Public policies and economic incentives are widely used as a strategy to
   stimulate the use of green technologies and low-emission practices in
   the waterborne transport sector. Since the Paris Agreement, countries
   have been encouraged to implement more strategies to reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions and to build resilience against climate change impacts in
   developing countries. This article presents a literature review on
   policies, regulations, and programs that represent economic incentives
   to promote alternatives to decarbonize maritime and inland waterway
   transport in sixteen countries, including Colombia. More than one
   hundred thirty sources of information were reviewed, including official
   portals of governments, port authorities and organizations, and
   scientific articles; therefore, the incentives found were grouped into
   three categories: project financing, differentiated port tariffs, and
   incentives to cover onshore power service fees. As a result of this
   review, it was found that differentiated port tariffs were the most
   common type of incentive. Finally, the specific case of Colombia was
   analyzed, which provides a deeper perspective of current policies and
   measures aimed at encouraging the decarbonization of waterborne
   transport and compares them with the international panorama.},

Abstract = {The National 12th Five-Year-Plan for Social and Economic Development
   (2011-2015) (national development policy) in China requires knowledge of
   ecological complexity to better guide policy development for adaptation

   human-environment interactions supplements climate change related
   policies in supporting sustainability through adaptation and mitigation.
   Based on a review of the climate change contents of the National 10th

   of climate changes that have affected China's environmental
   sustainability now and offers policy viewpoints for the in-preparing
   12th Five-Year Plan, with five core areas for the implementation of
   climate change policy: (A) development of the transition to a low carbon
   economy, (B) prevention and treatment of urban environmental negative
   effects caused by climate change, (C) adaptation to sea level rises in
   coastal zones, (D) maintaining the resilience of natural ecosystems

   changing climate},

Volume = {100},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coral reef restoration is gaining considerable momentum globally in
   response to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts on coral
   reefs. In Australia, as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation
   Program (RRAP), a range of unconventional interventions are currently
   being investigated to help the Great Barrier Reef resist, repair and
   recover from climate change. Many of these interventions are based on
   innovative approaches, such as assisted evolution. The regulatory
   environment is likely to be critical in determining the feasibility and
   viability of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It
   influences what, where and how to restore, who should be responsible
   for, engaged in, and benefit from restoration. This study explores the
   regulatory implications of proposed restoration and adaptation
   interventions in the context of the Great Barrier Reef. This includes
   mapping the existing regulatory and governance landscape, establishing
   an approach to account for regulatory requirements of restoration and
   adaptation interventions, and examining regulatory issues associated
   with their development and deployment. The study also scopes
   administrative capacity; i.e., the capacity of regulators in terms of
   resources and skills required to assess novel risks and impacts of reef
   restoration and adaptation interventions. It provides important insights
   that may prove useful for other jurisdictions, where ecosystem
   restoration and adaptation has become an imperative under a
   fast-changing climate.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise due to anthropogenic climate change is projected not only
   to exacerbate extreme events such as cyclones and storms but also to
   cause more frequent chronic flooding occurring at high tides under calm
   weather conditions. Chronic flooding occasionally takes place today in
   the low-lying areas of the Petit Cul-de-sac marin (Guadeloupe, West
   Indies, French Antilles). This area includes critical industrial and
   harbor and major economic infrastructures for the islands. As sea level
   rises, concerns are growing regarding the possibility of repeated
   chronic flooding events, which would alter the operations at these
   critical coastal infrastructures without appropriate adaptation. Here,
   we use information on past and future sea levels, vertical ground
   motion, and tides to assess times of emergence of chronic flooding in
   the Petit Cul-de-sac marin. For RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration
   Pathway 8.5; i.e., continued growth of greenhouse gas emissions), the
   number of flood days is projected to increase rapidly after the
   emergence of the process so that coastal sites will be flooded 180 d a
   year within 2 decades of the onset of chronic flooding. For coastal
   locations with the lowest altitude, we show that the reconstructed
   number of floods is consistent with observations known from a previous
   survey. Vertical ground motions are a key source of uncertainty in our
   projections. Yet, our satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar
   results show that the local variability in this subsidence is smaller
   than the uncertainties in the technique, which we estimate to be between
   1 (standard deviation of measurements) and 5 mm/yr (upper theoretical
   bound). Despite these uncertainties, our results imply that adaptation
   pathways considering a rapid increase in recurrent chronic flooding are
   required for the critical port and industrial and commercial center of
   Guadeloupe. Similar processes are expected to take place in many
   low-elevation coastal zones worldwide, including on other tropical
   islands. The method used in this study can be applied to other
   locations, provided tide gauge records and local knowledge of vertical
   ground motions are available. We argue that identifying times of
   emergence of chronic flooding events is urgently needed in most
   low-lying coastal areas, because adaptation requires decades to be
   implemented, whereas chronic flooding hazards can worsen drastically
   within years of the first event being observed.},

Title = {Post-combustion carbon capture for tank to propeller via process
   modeling and simulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CO2 UTILIZATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has issued a long-term
   sustainable strategy to gradually phase out the major ship-related
   sources of greenhouse gas emissions. While the post-combustion carbon
   capture has been well investigated for onshore plants, the maritime
   carbon capture system is still in an early stage due to its unique
   characteristics and design limitations. Aiming at providing a holistic
   way to find the most efficient and sustainable PCC solution for an LNG
   tanker, this work proposed a system of the tank to propeller
   post-combustion carbon capture which integrates ship engine process
   modeling with chemical absorption/desorption process modeling
   techniques. A rate-based aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) process model
   was developed and validated, then scaled up and modified to capture CO2
   from the flue gas. To increase the carbon capture efficiency and
   decrease the energy penalty, this work provided detailed steps for
   process model development covering innovative absorber/stripper design
   under variation of solvents, packed type, and liquid to gas ratio. This
   work also included a thorough sustainability evaluation based on
   emission reduction efficiency, energy penalty, and carbon cyclic
   capacity among two single aqueous amines, MEA and diisopropanolamine
   (DIPA), and one blended amine with a promoter, methyldiethanolamine
   (MDEA) with piperazine (PZ). Although DIPA presented a better
   performance on energy requirement for solvent regeneration, the blended
   amine was the optimal solvent to meet the requirement of the IMO carbon
   abatement strategy. Compared to the seven molality MEA, the MDEA-PZ
   option could capture more than 57 \% CO2 while around 25 \% specific
   reboiler duty can be saved.},

Abstract = {In recent years the Electrical Utilities has been confronted with
   several challenges which include amongst others the widespread use of
   distributed energy resources and a public increase in environmental
   issues. By optimizing the location of switching devices on the
   electrical distribution system, an improvement in energy not supplied
   and in the availability of the distributed energy resources can be
   obtained thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This work proposes the
   Memetic evolutionary algorithm for the multiobjective optimal placement
   of the switching devices. A trade-off between the investment in
   equipment cost (EC), energy not supplied (ENS) and greenhouse gas
   emissions (GGER) is analyzed, in order to choose the optimal placement
   of switching devices in distribution electrical networks. The proposed
   method was tested with a Portuguese real distribution network. The
   obtained results are presented and discussed.},

Title = {Managed retreat for climate change adaptation in coastal megacities: A
   comparison of policy and practice in Manila and Vancouver},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {253},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {`Managed retreat' is gaining considerable attention as part of
   megacities' climate change adaptation and resilience enhancement
   toolkits, and as a policy option for disaster risk reduction in coastal
   regions. The overarching objective of managed retreat is to reduce the
   exposure of people and assets to flooding, storm surges and sea level
   rise by retreating from these threats in a planned fashion. Managed
   retreat is one of four main options covered in the TARA'
   (protect/accommodate/retreat/avoid) framework explained in this paper,
   which can be used to enhance resilience in coastal megacities. In this
   paper, qualitative research methods were used to collect primary data on
   the feasibility of using managed retreat for two case study coastal
   megacities: Manila, Philippines, and Vancouver, Canada. Both case
   studies review the risk context of each city, local climate change
   adaptation/disaster risk reduction (CCA/DRR) policies linked to managed
   retreat, examples of managed retreat practice, and barriers to managed
   retreat identified through primary or secondary data analysis.
   Comparisons between the two cases are then carried out, and similarities
   and differences are highlighted. The paper concludes by suggesting
   possible means by which barriers to managed retreat might be overcome.},

Title = {Simulations of frequency, intensity and tracks of cyclonic disturbances
   in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea},
Journal = {MAUSAM},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-174},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The paper presents the results of simulation experiments conducted for
   the assessment of likely changes in the cyclogenesis pattern in the Bay
   of Bengal (BOB) and the Arabian Sea (AS) resulting from global climate
   change. Two experiments were performed, namely the `control' (CTL)
   experiment in which the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere
   was fixed as per 1990 levels and the `greenhouse gas' (GHG) experiment
   in which an annual compound increase of 1\% from 1990 onwards was
   introduced. CTL and GHG experiments of 20 years length were performed
   for the period 2041-2060. The model used is the regional climate model
   Had RM2 of the Hadley Centre of Climate Prediction and Research, U.K.
   The results have brought out some significant changes in the
   cyclogenesis pattern in the North Indian Ocean (BOB and AS). The most
   significant likely change is the increase in the frequency of
   post-monsoon storms in the Bay of Bengal. The experiments show an
   increase of about 50\% in the post-monsoonal cyclogenesis by 2041-2060
   as a result of increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the
   atmosphere. The frequency of monsoon depressions / storms in the BOB is
   likely to decrease considerably during June-August. Due to varying
   impacts in different seasons, the annual frequency of cyclonic
   disturbances may change marginally in the BOB. In the Arabian Sea,
   however the model has simulated a significant reduction in the frequency
   which may be halved by the period 2041-2060.
   The results show intensification of storms during May-June and
   September-November. The monsoon depressions during July-August are
   likely to become less intense.
   In GHG experiment most of the post-monsoon storms have a tendency to
   strike north Andhra-Orissa coasts whereas in CTL experiment the storms
   strike coast from Tamilnadu to south Orissa. Thus, the focus of
   post-monsoon storms in the BOB is likely to shift northwards from
   Tamilnadu-Andhra Pradesh coast to north Andhra Pradesh-south Orissa
   coast. Another important simulated change in storm tracks is that more
   number of pre-monsoon storms in the BOB may have a tendency to recurve
   north or northeastwards by 2041-2060.},

Title = {A Delphi method to classify wave energy resource for the 21st century:
   Application to the NW Iberian Peninsula},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {235},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Wave energy is poised to thrive as a renewable energy provider. Present
   and future wave energy resource for the northwest Iberian Peninsula
   coast is classified by means of a dynamical downscaling performed with
   the SWAN model of WAVEWATCH III simulations driven by historical wind
   data and future wind under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emission scenario.
   The wave energy resource classification was per -formed applying a
   Delphi method to seven indices, related to wave resource, stability,
   risk and instal-lation and maintenance costs (mean wave power energy,
   temporal and monthly variability, downtime, risk, water depth and
   distance to the coast). In general, conditions for the exploitation of
   wave energy will worsen by the end of the century due to the decrease in
   wave energy's mean value and an increase in energy variability.
   Furthermore, the risk factor will also worsen due to the increase in the
   frequency of extreme ocean waves. Despite this, the wave energy resource
   will be classified as excellent along the west coast of the Iberian
   Peninsula and as good along the Bay of Biscay's coast by the end of the
   century. Only in the northwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula, the wave
   resource will be classified as outstanding. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Understanding Preferences for Coastal Climate Change Adaptation: A
   Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Lack of public support for coastal adaptation can present significant
   barriers for implementation. In response, policy makers and academics
   are seeking strategies to build public support for coastal adaptation,
   which requires a deeper understanding of peoples' preferences for
   coastal adaptation and what motives those preferences. Here, we conduct
   a systematic literature review to understand preferences for coastal
   adaptation options and the factors influencing these preferences. Ninety
   peer-reviewed publications meet the inclusion criteria. The findings
   revealed that hard protection options were often the most frequently
   preferred, likely due to a desire to maintain current shoreline, for the
   protection of recreational spaces and private property, and a perceived
   effectiveness of hard protection options. Soft protection, including
   nature-based approaches, accommodation, and no action were the next most
   preferred options. Finally, retreat options were the least preferred,
   often due to strong place attachment. We identify twenty-eight factors
   that could influence preferences, with risk perception, place
   attachment, and financial considerations occurring most frequently in
   the literature. In the conclusion, we outline the most significant
   research gaps identified from our analysis and discuss the implication
   for adaptation research and practice.},

Title = {Reclamation-induced tidal restriction increases dissolved carbon and
   greenhouse gases diffusive fluxes in salt marsh creeks},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {773},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Intertidal creeks play an important role in transporting nutrients
   between coastal ecosystems and ocean. Reclamation is a predominant
   anthropogenic disturbance in coastal regions; however, the influence of
   reclamation on carbon and nitrogen species and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   fluxes in creek remains unclear. In a subtropical salt marsh of eastern
   China, the seasonal patterns of dissolved carbon (DOC, DIC, CO2, and
   CH4) and inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N, NO2--N, and NO3--N and N2O)
   species, and the diffusive fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, were compared
   between the natural tidal creeks and the reclaimed creeks. Due to
   notably changed hydrological and biological conditions in the reclaimed
   creeks, concentrations of all dissolved carbon species, NH4+-N and
   NO2--N increased significantly by 60.2-288.2\%, while NO3--N and N2O
   decreased slightly, compared to the natural tidal creeks. DIC and NO3--N
   were the primary components of the total dissolved carbon and inorganic
   nitrogen in both creek types; however, their proportions decreased as a
   result of elevated DOC, CO2, CH4, NH4+-N, and NO2--N following
   reclamation. Significantly higher global warming potential (0.58 +/-
   0.15 g CO2-eq m(-2) d(-1)) was found in the reclaimed creeks, making
   them hotspot of greenhouse effects, compared to the natural tidal
   creeks. Our results indicated that changes in flow velocity, salinity,
   Chlorophyll a, and pH were themain factors controlling the dissolved
   carbon and nitrogen and consequent GHG emissions, due to reclamation.
   This study is helpful in understanding of carbon and nitrogen
   sink-source shifts resulting from land use changes in coastal wetlands.

Abstract = {China is increasing its use of non-conventionalwater sources - seawater
   desalination, surface water transfer and wastewater reuse - to meet
   demand. Getting and treating water from these sources generally requires
   more energy than is needed for local freshwater sources. This increases
   the cost and greenhouse gas emissions associated with water supply. It
   also leads us to the question: are alternativewater sources necessary
   and, if so, which source should be preferred? Here we argue that
   reclaiming and reusing wastewater is often the least energy-intensive
   alternative source for water-scarce areas of China, particularly when
   energy present in wastewater is recovered during the process. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Adaptive learning about nature, based on observations and continual
   rethinking, dates back to Native Americans in what we call Traditional
   Ecological Knowledge. Fast forward to 1950+, when Eugene, Howard, and
   William Odum promoted sound science and its use in managing
   ecosystems-called adaptive management (AM). What began as an instinctive
   way of thinking and deciding how to obtain resources using accumulated
   information became a structured, science-based process that improves
   over time, given continual critiques of projects, clarification of
   definitions, and analyses of outcomes. The basic need is still to
   sustain ecosystem services despite uncertainties, such as climate
   change. I report recent innovations in the AM of estuaries and coasts
   that can add knowledge and improve future efforts. Innovations include
   new guidelines and approaches to confront uncertainty, engage
   stakeholders, improve governance, prioritize actions, centralize the
   role of science, and manage holistically. AM has been effective along
   the coast of Denmark and in several estuaries, and it is evolving
   elsewhere. In The Netherlands, Spain, California, and Oregon, large
   field experiments are generating ``learning while restoring{''}
   (adaptive restoration, AR). AM and AR can help managers of coastal
   ecosystems and watersheds mitigate the impacts of rising sea levels, sea
   storms, and human disturbances. Science-based decision-making will
   become more nimble and protection/restoration more effective as
   innovations and model approaches are tailored to individual estuaries
   and coasts.},

Title = {Comparison of 20th century and pre-industrial climate over South America
   in regional model simulations},
Journal = {CLIMATE OF THE PAST},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1599-1620},
Abstract = {In this study, we assess how the anthropogenically induced increase in
   greenhouse gas concentrations affects the climate of central and
   southern South America. We utilise two regional climate simulations for
   present day (PD) and pre-industrial (PI) times. These simulations are
   compared to historical reconstructions in order to investigate the
   driving processes responsible for climatic changes between the different
   periods. The regional climate model is validated against observations
   for both re-analysis data and GCM-driven regional simulations for the
   second half of the 20th century. Model biases are also taken into
   account for the interpretation of the model results. The added value of
   the regional simulation over global-scale modelling relates to a better
   representation of hydrological processes that are particularly evident
   in the proximity of the Andes Mountains.
   Climatic differences between the simulated PD minus PI period agree
   qualitatively well with proxy-based temperature reconstructions, albeit
   the regional model overestimates the amplitude of the temperature
   increase. For precipitation the most important changes between the PD
   and PI simulation relate to a dipole pattern along the Andes Mountains
   with increased precipitation over the southern parts and reduced
   precipitation over the central parts. Here only a few regions show
   robust similarity with studies based on empirical evidence. However,
   from a dynamical point-of-view, atmospheric circulation changes related
   to an increase in high-latitude zonal wind speed simulated by the
   regional climate model are consistent with numerical modelling studies
   addressing changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Our results
   indicate that besides the direct effect of greenhouse gas changes,
   large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation and sea surface
   temperatures also exert an influence on temperature and precipitation
   changes in southern South America. These combined changes in turn affect
   the relationship between climate and atmospheric circulation between PD
   and PI times and should be considered for the statistical reconstruction
   of climate indices calibrated within present-day climate data.},

   Performance and Cross-Linking Consequences},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and associated targets focus on
   a wide range of global issues and can be useful in coastal challenges
   such as climate change and green economic growth. The aim of this study
   is to tailor the SDGs, as a universally recognized policy framework, to
   assess the sustainability performance for coastal flood protection
   management to enhance climate-resilient and adaptable coastal
   development. To operationalize this aim, the SDG Sustainability Impact
   Score (SDG-SIS) framework was developed. Based on system functionalities
   for the land-sea interface, 38 SDGs were identified in the SDG-SIS
   framework. Given the availability of public numeric data, only 12 SDG
   targets are connected with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The
   SDG-SIS framework was applied to two different sets of cases, including
   five coastline and five sand nourishment cases. This study shows that
   the geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the two sets of
   cases should be considered in the selection of system functionalities as
   well as the consideration of SDG targets. Moreover, cross-linking
   cumulative consequences of SIS do not directly indicate the level of
   sustainability, but the individual SDG target data are essential to
   reveal the underlying details. This stresses the importance of
   prioritizing SDGs to serve as leverage for policymakers to optimize the
   climate resilience and adaptation of coastal management. The SDG-SIS
   framework enables the support of coastal policy by addressing long-term
   measures and providing a sustainable vision for future implementation.},

Title = {Effective coastal adaptation needs accurate hazard assessment: a case
   study in Port Resolution, Tanna Island Vanuatu},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Developing countries face risks from coastal hazards that are being
   amplified by climate change. The selection of effective adaptation
   interventions to manage these risks requires a sufficiently accurate
   assessment of the coastal hazard at a given location. Yet challenges
   remain in terms of understanding local coastal risks given the
   coarseness of global wave models and the paucity of locally scaled data
   in most developing countries, including Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS) like Vanuatu. This paper aims to examine the differences in
   hazard assessment and adaptation option selections arising from analyses
   using globally versus locally scaled data on coastal processes. As a
   case study, we focused on an eroding cliff face in Port Resolution on
   Tanna Island, Vanuatu, which is of concern to the local community and
   government authorities. The coastal process modeling revealed that the
   global wave data generated unrealistically high predictions of wave
   height within Port Resolution Bay. Expensive engineering adaptations
   designed to provide coastal protection were therefore likely to fail in
   preventing ongoing cliff erosion. In this case, the best adaptation
   solution involves changing land use to revegetate and help stabilize the
   cliff top. Our case study highlights the importance of accurate hazard
   assessment, especially in data-poor regions where the extrapolation of
   global datasets and models in the absence of local data can result in
   poor adaptation decision-making. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary
   approach applied here can be applied in other data-poor regions to
   strengthen analyses exploring the benefits of local adaptation
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Preserving (and managing) mountain ecosystems is fundamental because
   they continuously provide environmental functions, goods and services to
   the global community and for their heritage of biodiversity, traditions
   and culture.
   In Italy, 54\% of the total area is classified as mountainous, with 12
   million inhabitants in 4200 municipalities. More than 44\% of the
   mountainous area is characterised by woodlands, while only 2.3\% is
   urbanized. Because of their geomorphology, many Italian regions present
   industrially developed coastal areas together with mountain areas whose
   socio-economic reality is atypical for several reasons: the low level of
   population density and the propensity of the young people to leave and
   look for a job elsewhere, the natural difficulties in communication and
   transportation, limited industrial settlements, and many others.
   However, at the same time, the mountain lands still keep environmental
   heritage worthy of preservation.
   This paper presents the results of a greenhouse gas accounting
   experience at the local level for a mountain zone, according to the
   Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
   The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that one of the most important
   services provided by a mountain ecosystem is its function as a sink for
   CO2 equivalent emitted by anthropic activity.
   The results of the analysis are also compared with the data processed
   for cities and industrialized regions. The resulting information could
   also be useful for a better territorial administrative and economic
   planning which is founded on a deeper knowledge of the local ecosystems
   and their properties.},

Abstract = {We studied concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and
   nitrous oxide (N2O) in the eutrophic Temmesjoki River and Estuary in the
   Liminganlahti Bay in 2003-2004 and evaluated the atmospheric fluxes of
   the gases based on measured concentrations, wind speeds and water
   current velocities. The Temmesjoki River was a source of CO2, CH4 and
   N2O to the atmosphere, whereas the Liminganlahti Bay was a minor source
   of CH4 and a minor source or a sink of CO2 and N2O. The results show
   that the fluxes of greenhouse gases in river ecosystems are highly
   related to the land use in its catchment areas. The most upstream river
   site, surrounded by forests and drained peatlands, released significant
   amounts of CO2 and CH4, with average fluxes of 5,400 mg CO2-C m(-2)
   d(-1) and 66 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1), and concentrations of 210 mu M and
   345 nM, respectively, but N2O concentrations, at an average of 17 nM,
   were close to the atmospheric equilibrium concentration. The downstream
   river sites surrounded by agricultural soils released significant
   amounts of N2O (with an average emission of 650 mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)
   and concentration of 22 nM), whereas the CO2 and CH4 concentrations were
   low compared to the upstream site (55 mu M and 350 nM). In boreal
   regions, rivers are partly ice-covered in wintertime (approximately 5
   months). A large part of the gases, i.e. 58\% of CO2, 55\% of CH4 and
   36\% of N2O emissions, were found to be released during wintertime from
   unfrozen parts of the river.},

Title = {Goose Feces Effects on Subarctic Soil Nitrogen Availability and
   Greenhouse Gas Fluxes},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Abstract = {Vertebrate herbivore excrement is thought to influence nutrient cycling,
   plant nutrition, and growth; however, its importance is rarely isolated
   from other aspects of herbivory, such as trampling and leaf removal,
   leaving questions about the extent to which herbivore effects are due to
   feces. We hypothesized that as a source of additional nutrients, feces
   would directly increase soil N concentrations and N2O emission,
   alleviate plant, and microbial nutrient limitations, resulting in
   increased plant growth and foliar quality, and increase CH4 emissions.
   We tested these hypotheses using a field experiment in coastal western
   Alaska, USA, where we manipulated goose feces such that naturally grazed
   areas received three treatments: feces removal, ambient amounts of
   feces, or double ambient amounts of feces. Doubling feces marginally
   increased NH4+-N in soil water, whereas both doubled feces and feces
   removal significantly increased NO3--N; N2O flux was also higher in
   removal plots. Feces removal marginally reduced root biomass and
   significantly reduced productivity (that is, GPP) in the second year,
   measured as greater CO2 emissions. Doubling feces marginally increased
   foliar chemical quality by increasing \%N and decreasing C:N. Treatments
   did not influence CH4 flux. In short, feces removal created sites poorer
   in nutrients, with reduced root growth, graminoid nutrient uptake, and
   productivity. While goose feces alone did not create dramatic changes in
   nutrient cycling in western Alaska, they do appear to be an important
   source of nutrients for grazed areas and to contribute to greenhouse gas
   exchange as their removal increased emissions of CO2 and N2O to the
   atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Amory Lovins' distinction between `soft' and `hard' paths of energy
   technologies is applied, mutatis mutandis, to humanity's efforts to
   adapt to climate change. It is argued that hard adaptive measures
   involve capital-intensive, large, complex, inflexible technology and
   infrastructure, whereas soft adaptive measures prioritize natural
   capital, community control, simplicity and appropriateness. The
   prevalence of these two types of adaptation pathways is illustrated
   through two case studies from the Maldives: The Safer Island Development
   Program and the Integrating Climate Change Risks Program. Policymakers
   must be aware that hard and soft adaptation measures may trade off with
   each other, and give both paths due consideration.},

Abstract = {The paper presents some results of greenhouse gases in situ measurements
   in 2015-2017 summertime from a high Arctic Belyy Island (Russia). The
   atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased by 3.1 ppm per year, which
   is 1.5 times higher than the mean annual global rate during last 10
   years. However, the absolute CO2 levels were significantly less than the
   global background, which exceeded 400 ppm in 2015. The CH4 content had
   not changed, but in summer periods tundra ecosystem of the island was
   shown to remain a local net CH4 source in comparison to marine
   ecosystem. Possible mechanisms of forming mean diurnal cycles of CO2 and
   CH4 concentration are discussed. The temperature dependences of the
   measured parameters are established, indicating a significant
   sensitivity of carbon balance in the arctic tundra to the air
   temperature variability.},

Abstract = {Opening of Southern Ocean gateways may have had a controlling influence
   oil the evolution of global climate. The largest step in the history of
   Cenozoic climate, from an Eocene ``Greenhouse{''} toward the modern
   glaciated state, is correlated with opening of a deep water connection
   between the Southern Indian and Southern Pacific Oceans. This Study
   synthesizes results from previous work, assesses the possibility that
   ocean heat transport was Much greater than modern during the globally
   warm Eocene, and explores the sensitivity of polar climate to large
   changes in ocean heat transport. The magnitudes of these sensitivities
   are compared with those Clue to greenhouse gas concentration changes. We
   find that ocean heat transport was unlikely to have been sufficiently
   greater than modern during the Eocene to explain the change in the
   climate. Specifically, in order to have significantly affected Antarctic
   climate, ocean heat transport changes Would have had to change by all
   order of magnitude-much greater than the largest change produced in our
   simulations. In coupled climate model simulations, changes in CO2
   concentrations(from 1120 to 560 ppm) Supported by proxy records, lead to
   significant Antarctic responses in the absence of ocean heat transport
   changes. The results show that Antarctic Snow accumulation is primarily
   controlled by change., ill summer temperature, not precipitation, and
   that snow did not remain oil Antarctica during summer months in Eocene
   even at low greenhouse gas concentrations. Greenhouse gas concentration
   changes and Subsequent processes such as ice albedo and weathering
   feedbacks, were more likely to have been the primary Cause of Antarctic
   glaciation than ocean heat transport changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {We modeled the coastal protection and blue carbon ecosystem services

   Models, with the goal of supporting the Regional Coastal Biodiversity
   Project of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, in
   determining potential priority mangrove areas for conservation and
   restoration. To quantify the relative coastal protection that mangroves
   provide, we combined maps of different aspects of vulnerability,
   including ecological, physical, and social data. We also estimated
   carbon stocks, net sequestration, and the economic value of carbon
   sequestration as a service in 2050 and 2100. We then developed a
   combined index of coastal protection and carbon sequestration services
   to highlight potential priority conservation and restoration areas for
   mangroves. We found that in Guatemala the coastal protection service was
   provided in greater quantity in the province of Moyuta, while in El
   Salvador this service was the highest in the provinces of San Francisco
   Menendez, Jujutla and Acajutla, which also had the greatest total carbon
   stock. In the Paz River Basin, we estimate there are approximately 1,741
   hectares of mangroves that provide the highest coastal protection and
   carbon sequestration services. Furthermore, we identified 318.9 hectares
   across both countries where mangroves could potentially be restored.},

Title = {Assessment of Wave Energy in the South China Sea Based on GIS Technology},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {China is now the world's largest user of coal and also has the highest
   greenhouse gas emissions associated with the mining and use of coal.
   Under today's enormous pressures of the growing shortage of conventional
   energy sources and the need for emission reductions, the search for
   clean energy is the most effective strategy to address the energy crisis
   and global warming. This study utilized satellite remote sensing
   technology, geographic information system (GIS) technology, and
   simulated wave data for the South China Sea. The characteristic features
   of the wave energy were obtained by analysis through the wave resource
   assessment formula and the results were stored in a GIS database.
   Software for the evaluation of wave energy in the South China Sea was
   written. The results should provide accurate, efficient references for
   wave energy researchers and decision-makers. Based on a 24year WW3 model
   simulation wave data and GIS technology, this study presented the
   characteristic of the wave energy in the SCS; results demonstrated that
   the SCS has the feasibility and viability for wave energy farming.},

Title = {A Communication-Less Multimode Control Approach for Adaptive Power
   Sharing in Ship-Based Seaport Microgrid},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector
   together with the continued depletion of fossil fuels in general has
   encouraged an increase in the use of energy storage systems and
   renewable energy sources at seaports and also on short route yachts and
   ferries. At present, most seaports, particularly smaller ones, are not
   provided with cold-ironing facilities-shore-based power facilities,
   which provide electric power to ships from the national grid. Because of
   the lack of cold-ironing facilities at most ports, auxiliary diesel
   engines and diesel generators on ships must be kept operating and online
   while at berth to supply auxiliary loads of ship. To address these
   requirements, one possible solution would be to provide cold-ironing
   facilities at all ports. However, in many circumstances, this is not
   cost-efficient as a port might be far from the national grid. To
   overcome these limitations, a seaport microgrid can be formed through
   the integration of multiple shipboard microgrids (SMGs) with
   decentralized control together with a charging infrastructure that is
   located on-shore. This integration of multiple SMGs and port-based
   charging stations is termed a ship-based seaport microgrid. Typically,
   power is shared among different microgrids using data communication
   techniques, which adds to the cost and the complexity of the overall
   system. This article proposes a communication-less approach based on
   multimode, decentralized droop control that enables power sharing among
   several SMGs in both charging and discharging modes based on the state
   of charge of battery banks-electric power is either supplied or
   consumed. The proposed approach would be potentially useful for future
   autonomous ships and also for islands where port electrification is
   either not technically feasible or an economically viable solution. A
   simulation and hardware-in-the-loop results are provided to verify the
   control robustness of the proposed control strategy.},

Title = {Seasonal variation of early diagenesis and greenhouse gas production in
   coastal sediments of Cadiz Bay: Influence of anthropogenic activities},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {200},
Pages = {99-115},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gas production in coastal sediments is closely associated
   with the early diagenesis processes of organic matter and nutrients.
   Discharges from anthropogenic activities, particularly agriculture, fish
   farming and waste-water treatment plants supply large amounts of organic
   matter and inorganic nutrients that affect mineralization processes.
   Three coastal systems of Cadiz Bay (SW Spain) (Guadalete River, Rio San
   Pedro Creek and Sancti Petri Channel) were chosen to determine the
   seasonal variation of organic matter mineralization. Two sampling
   stations were selected in each system; one in the outer part, close to
   the bay, and another more inland, close to a discharge point of effluent
   related to anthropogenic activities. Seasonal variation revealed that
   metabolic reactions were driven by the annual change of temperature in
   the outer station of the systems. In contrast, these reactions depended
   on the amount of organic matter reaching the sediments in the outermost
   part of the systems, which was higher during winter. Oxygen is consumed
   in the first 0.5 cm indicating that suboxic and anoxic processes, such
   as denitrification, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are important
   in these sediments. Sulfate reduction seems to account for most of the
   mineralization of organic matter at the marine stations, while
   methanogenesis is the main pathway at the sole freshwater station of
   this study, located inside the estuary of the Guadalete River, because
   of the lack of sulfate as electron acceptor. Results point to
   denitrification being the principal process of N2O formation. Diffusive
   fluxes varied between 2.6 and 160 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for dissolved
   inorganic carbon (DIC); 0.9 and 164.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for TA; 0.8 and
   17.4 mol m(-2) d(-1) for N2O; and 0.1 mu mol and 13.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)
   for CH4, indicating that these sediments act as a source of greenhouse
   gases to the water column. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Operationalizing resilience for adaptive coral reef management under
   global environmental change},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-61},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cumulative pressures from global climate and ocean change combined with
   multiple regional and local-scale stressors pose fundamental challenges
   to coral reef managers worldwide. Understanding how cumulative stressors
   affect coral reef vulnerability is critical for successful reef
   conservation now and in the future. In this review, we present the case
   that strategically managing for increased ecological resilience
   (capacity for stress resistance and recovery) can reduce coral reef
   vulnerability (risk of net decline) up to a point. Specifically, we
   propose an operational framework for identifying effective management
   levers to enhance resilience and support management decisions that
   reduce reef vulnerability. Building on a system understanding of
   biological and ecological processes that drive resilience of coral reefs
   in different environmental and socio-economic settings, we present an
   Adaptive Resilience-Based management (ARBM) framework and suggest a set
   of guidelines for how and where resilience can be enhanced via
   management interventions. We argue that press-type stressors (pollution,
   sedimentation, overfishing, ocean warming and acidification) are key
   threats to coral reef resilience by affecting processes underpinning
   resistance and recovery, while pulse-type (acute) stressors (e.g.
   storms, bleaching events, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks) increase
   the demand for resilience. We apply the framework to a set of example
   problems for Caribbean and Indo-Pacific reefs. A combined strategy of
   active risk reduction and resilience support is needed, informed by key
   management objectives, knowledge of reef ecosystem processes and
   consideration of environmental and social drivers. As climate change and
   ocean acidification erode the resilience and increase the vulnerability
   of coral reefs globally, successful adaptive management of coral reefs
   will become increasingly difficult. Given limited resources,
   on-the-ground solutions are likely to focus increasingly on actions that
   support resilience at finer spatial scales, and that are tightly linked
   to ecosystem goods and services.},

Abstract = {The pond turtle Emys trinacris is an endangered endemic species of
   Sicily showing a fragmented distribution throughout the main island. In
   this study, we applied ``Ensemble Niche Modelling{''}, combining more
   classical statistical techniques as Generalized Linear Models and
   Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines with machine-learning
   approaches as Boosted Regression Trees and Maxent, to model the
   potential distribution of the species under current and future climatic
   conditions. Moreover, a ``gap analysis{''} performed on both the
   species' presence sites and the predictions from the Ensemble Models is
   proposed to integrate outputs from these models, in order to assess the
   conservation status of this threatened species in the context of
   biodiversity management. For this aim, four ``Representative
   Concentration Pathways{''}, corresponding to different greenhouse gases
   emissions trajectories were considered to project the obtained models to
   both 2050 and 2070. Areas lost, gained or remaining stable for the
   target species in the projected models were calculated. E. trinacris'
   potential distribution resulted to be significantly dependent upon
   precipitation-linked variables, mainly precipitation of wettest and
   coldest quarter. Future negative effects for the conservation of this
   species, because of more unstable precipitation patterns and extreme
   meteorological events, emerged from our analyses. Further, the sites
   currently inhabited by E. trinacris are, for more than a half, out of
   the Protected Areas network, highlighting an inadequate management of
   the species by the authorities responsible for its protection. Our
   results, therefore, suggest that in the next future the Sicilian pond
   turtle will need the utmost attention by the scientific community to
   avoid the imminent risk of extinction. Finally, the gap analysis
   performed in GIS environment resulted to be a very informative
   post-modeling technique, potentially applicable to the management of
   species at risk and to Protected Areas' planning in many contexts.},

Abstract = {Tidal mangrove wetlands are a source of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide
   (N2O); but considering the high productivity of mangroves, they
   represent a significant sink for carbon dioxide (CO2). An exotic plant
   Spartina alterniflora has invaded east China over the last few decades,
   threatening these coastal mangrove ecosystems. However, the atmospheric
   gas fluxes in mangroves are poorly characterized and the impact of
   biological invasion on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in the wetland
   remains unclear. In this study, the temporal and spatial dynamics of key
   GHG fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) at an unvegetated mudflat, cordgrass (S.
   alterniflora), and mangrove (Kandelia obovata) sites along an estuary of
   the Jiulong River in Southeast China were investigated over a 2-year
   period. The CO2 and CH4 fluxes demonstrated a seasonal and
   vegetation-dependent variation while N2O fluxes showed no such dependent
   pattern. Air temperature was the main factor influencing CO2 and CH4
   fluxes. Cumulative global warming potential (GWP) ranked in the order of
   mangrove > cordgrass > mudflat and summer > spring > autumn > winter.
   Moreover, CH4 accounted for the largest proportion (68 \%) of GWP,
   indicating its dominant contribution to the warming potential in
   mangroves. Notwithstanding the lack of information on plant coverage,
   cordgrass invasion exhibited a minor influence on GHG emissions. These
   findings support the notion that mangrove forests are net accumulation
   sites for GHGs. As vegetation showed considerable effects on fluxes,
   more information about the significance of vegetation type with a
   special emphasis on the effects of invasive plants is crucial.},

Abstract = {Context. Island landscapes and component biodiversity provide invaluable
   services. However, these are threatened by climate change. There is
   currently no framework for assessing and mitigating such threats on
   islands. Aims. Based on an existing adaptation standard, we aimed to
   propose a systematic approach for planning the adaptation of islands
   based on a risk management process. Methods. For each risk, we
   investigated a range of adaptation approaches that can be considered and
   selected by conservation practitioners in designing conservation
   interventions. Key results. For each risk identified, a range of
   adaptation measures can be selected: do nothing; maintain and enhance
   habitat, intensive species management, and preserve populations
   (including through ex situ conservation); or exploit the natural
   characteristics of islands to conserve biodiversity. Conclusions. This
   approach provides a decision-making matrix of risks/drivers vs
   adaptation measures to assist in the design of conservation
   interventions, which can be applied to Australian islands on a priority
   basis.},

Title = {Land development in an urban megalopolis: A holistic environmental
   assessment of housing on Chongming Eco-island, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {312},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, the Chinese government has promoted Chongming
   Eco-Island as an example of sustainable urbanization and a means to
   mitigate the growth of residential districts within the Shanghai
   megalopolis. With the immense urbanization pressure of a growing city,
   we ask ``what is an appropriate type and scale of housing for land
   development on Chongming?{''} This study uses the method of emergy (with
   an ``m{''}) synthesis to prepare a holistic assessment of the housing on
   Chongming, accounting for all renewable, non-renewable and imported
   resources used as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during
   building's life cycle stages. To overcome the lack of unit emergy values
   (UEVs) of building materials used on Chongming, this study first
   developed a method to derive accurate UEVs of local materials from a
   regional life cycle inventory (LCI) database. With Chongming Eco-Island
   as a case study, four typical residential housing types (farmhouse,
   single-family house, slab housing, high-rise apartment) were classified
   according to site density, the structure and floor area ratio (FAR) of
   buildings. Results indicate that slab housing with FAR as 3.1
   contributes most to the total emergy and GHG emissions per building
   area, while it proves to have the highest environmental performance when
   taking into account the residential density. In this respect, high-rise
   apartments are not the optimum options for the overall sustainability of
   Chongming Eco-Island.},

Abstract = {Landscape variability influences soil properties that influence soil
   respiration and subsequent trace gas emissions. Scarcity of data on
   greenhouse gas emissions as influenced by landscape variability and
   agroecosystem management in southeastern United States necessitates
   study. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of landscape
   variability and agroecosystem management on methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
   (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on. a Coastal Plain catena
   (Typic, Oxyaquic, and Aquic Paleudults) in Alabama. Soil management
   strategies included (i) conventional tillage (CT), (ii) conservation
   tillage (CsT), (iii) CT with dairy manure (CTM), and 4) CsT with dairy
   manure (CsTM) on a corn (Zea mays L.)-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   rotation. Each soil management treatment was replicated on summit,
   sideslope, and the drainageway landscape position. Gas measurements were
   conducted using a closed chamber method. The drainageway emitted 46,
   251, 59, and 185 mg CH4-C ha(-1) h(-1) from CT, CTM, CsT, and CsTM
   treatments, respectively The summit position had fluxes of -59 and -90
   mg CH4-C ha(-1) h(-1) on CT and CsT treatments, respectively. Averaged
   across seasons, CT and CsT N2O fluxes were similar (547 and 437 mg N2O-N
   ha(-1) h(-1), respectively) in the drainageway landscape position.
   Winter 2005 CO2 emission from CsT treatments (averaged across landscape
   positions) was 1304 g CO-C compared with 227 g ha(-1) h(-1) CO2-C from
   CT treatments.},

Title = {Non-native mangroves support carbon storage, sediment carbon burial, and

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests play an important role in climate change adaptation and
   mitigation by maintaining coastline elevations relative to sea level
   rise, protecting coastal infrastructure from storm damage, and storing
   substantial quantities of carbon (C) in live and detrital pools.
   Determining the efficacy of mangroves in achieving climate goals can be
   complicated by difficulty in quantifying C inputs (i.e., differentiating
   newer inputs from younger trees from older residual C pools), and
   mitigation assessments rarely consider potential offsets to CO2 storage
   by methane (CH4) production in mangrove sediments. The establishment of
   non-native Rhizophora mangle along Hawaiian coastlines over the last
   century offers an opportunity to examine the role mangroves play in
   climate mitigation and adaptation both globally and locally as novel
   ecosystems. We quantified total ecosystem C storage, sedimentation,
   accretion, sediment organic C burial and CH4 emissions from similar to
   70 year old R. mangle stands and adjacent uninvaded mudflats. Ecosystem
   C stocks of mangrove stands exceeded mudflats by 434 +/- 33 Mg C/ha, and
   mangrove establishment increased average coastal accretion by 460\%.
   Sediment organic C burial increased 10-fold (to 4.5 Mg C ha(-1)
   year(-1)), double the global mean for old growth mangrove forests,
   suggesting that C accumulation from younger trees may occur faster than
   previously thought, with implications for mangrove restoration.
   Simulations indicate that increased CH4 emissions from sediments offset
   ecosystem CO2 storage by only 2\%-4\%, equivalent to 30-60 Mg CO2-eq/ha
   over mangrove lifetime (100 year sustained global warming potential).
   Results highlight the importance of mangroves as novel systems that can
   rapidly accumulate C, have a net positive atmospheric greenhouse gas
   removal effect, and support shoreline accretion rates that outpace
   current sea level rise. Sequestration potential of novel mangrove
   forests should be taken into account when considering their removal or
   management, especially in the context of climate mitigation goals.},

Abstract = {This article explores the drivers, benefits, and challenges to climate
   change adaptation in Bangladesh. It specifically investigates the
   ``Community Based Adaptation to Climate Change through Coastal
   Afforestation Program,{''} a 5-year \$5 million adaptation scheme being
   funded and implemented in part by the Government of Bangladesh, United
   Nations Development Program, and Global Environment Facility. The
   article explores how the CBACC-CA builds various types of adaptive
   capacity in Bangladesh and the extent its design and implementation
   offers lessons for other adaptation programs around the world. The first
   part of the study begins by describing its research methods consisting
   of research interviews, site visits, and a literature review. It then
   summarizes six primary sectors vulnerable to climate change in
   Bangladesh: water resources and coastal zones, infrastructure and human
   settlements, agriculture and food security, forestry and biodiversity,
   fisheries, and human health. The article next describes the genesis and
   background behind the CBACC-CA, with an emphasis on components that
   promote capacity development, demonstration projects, risk reduction,
   and knowledge management. The article concludes that technology by
   itself is only a partial component of successful adaptation efforts, and
   that multiple and integrated adaptation measures that cut across sectors
   and social, institutional, and infrastructural dimensions are needed to
   truly build resilience and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Cyprus's electricity generation is highly reliant on imported fossil
   fuels. The ultimate goals are to reduce this dependency, to use
   renewable energies to supply demand and to satisfy the environmental
   need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
   Cyprus has a climate which is characterized by hot dry summers and mild
   winters. Most of the island enjoys many hours of sunshine and high
   levels of illumination. This has given birth to the widespread use of
   solar water heaters, but as yet, there has been little development of
   domestic electricity generation using photovoltaic, PV, panels.
   Considering the vast solar resource, the desire for more sustainable
   electricity generation from solar technologies is unquestionable.
   Initiatives are being introduced by the Cyprus goverments to encourage
   the development of renewable energy sources. These include grants to
   install PV systems and feed in tariffs.
   This paper examines the financial implications of investing in domestic
   PV.},

Title = {Microbial Greenhouse Gas Dynamics Associated With Warming Coastal
   Permafrost, Western Canadian Arctic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Permafrost sediments contain one of the largest reservoirs of organic
   carbon on Earth that is relatively stable when it remains frozen. As air
   temperatures increase, the shallow permafrost thaws which allows this
   organic matter to be converted into potent greenhouse gases such as
   methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) through microbial processes.
   Along the Beaufort Sea coast in the vicinity of the Tuktoyaktuk
   Peninsula, Northwest Territories, Canada, warming air temperatures are
   causing the active layer above permafrost to deepen, and a number of
   active periglacial processes are causing rapid erosion of previously
   frozen permafrost. In this paper, we consider the biogeochemical
   consequences of these processes on the permafrost sediments found at
   Tuktoyaktuk Island. Our goals were to document the in situ carbon
   characteristics which can support microbial activity, and then consider
   rates of such activity if the permafrost material were to warm even
   further. Samples were collected from a 12 m permafrost core positioned
   on the top of the island adjacent to an eroding coastal bluff. Downcore
   CH4, total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentrations and stable carbon isotopes revealed variable in situ CH4
   concentrations down core with a sub-surface peak just below the current
   active layer. The highest DOC concentrations were observed in the active
   layer. Controlled incubations of sediment from various depths were
   carried out from several depths anaerobically under thawed (5 degrees C
   and 15 degrees C) and under frozen (-20 degrees C and -5 degrees C)
   conditions. These incubations resulted in gross production rates of CH4
   and CO2 that increased upon thawing, as expected, but also showed
   appreciable production rates under frozen conditions. This dataset
   presents the potential for sediments below the active layer to produce
   potent greenhouse gases, even under frozen conditions, which could be an
   important atmospheric source in the actively eroding coastal zone even
   prior to thawing.},

Abstract = {The world demand for energy has grown significantly over the years and,
   therefore, imposes new challenges regarding the consumption and
   generation of electricity. In addition, the agreement negotiated by 195
   countries in Paris during COP21 reinforces sustainable development from
   the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to contain global warming as
   of 2020. Renewable energy sources are essential for reducing dependence
   on fossil fuels, motivating countries, including Brazil, to seek
   measures to boost the use of green energies. In this scenario, wind
   energy stands out as one of the most promising ways to aggregate energy
   matrix requirements and environmental constraints. Within this prospect,
   the present study is presented, aiming to raise the most relevant topics
   about the development of offshore wind farms, in particular their
   economic and financial feasibility, which is evaluated through the
   construction of a cash flow and through the determination of viability
   indicators for a case study. The results obtained are presented and
   discussed in order to show a competitiveness analysis of offshore wind
   energy when compared with same nature projects worldwide and with other
   sources present in the Brazilian energy matrix.},

Title = {Goods Movement Life Cycle Assessment for Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {317-328},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The formation of effective policies to reduce emissions from goods
   movement should consider local and remote life cycle effects as well as
   barriers for mode shifting. Using uni- and multimodal freight movements
   by truck, rail, and ocean-going vessel (OGV) associated with California,
   a life cycle assessment (LCA) is developed to estimate the local and
   remote emissions that occur from freight activity inside and associated
   with the state. Long-run average per tonne-kilometer results show that
   OGVs emit the fewest emissions, followed by rail, then trucks, and that
   the inclusion of life cycle processes can increase impacts by up to 32\%
   for energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 4,200\% for
   conventional air pollutants. Efforts to reduce emissions through mode
   shifting should recognize that infrastructure and market configurations
   may be inimical to mode substitution. A uni- and multimodal shipping
   emissions assessment is developed for intrastate and
   California-associated freight movements to illustrate the life cycle
   impacts of typical trips for certain types of goods. When targeting GHG
   reductions in California, it should be recognized that heavy-duty trucks
   are responsible for 99\% of intrastate goods movement emissions. An
   assessment of future freight truck technology improvements is performed
   to estimate the effectiveness of strategies to meet 2050 GHG reduction
   goals. Whereas aggressive improvements in fuel economy coupled with
   alternative vehicles and fuels can significantly reduce GHG emissions,
   to meet 2050 goals will likely require zero carbon emission vehicle
   technology. The value of using LCA in GHG reduction policy for
   transportation systems is explored.},

Abstract = {Reducing CO2 emissions is a key goal of the strategy for a low-carbon
   economy and for the choice of greenhouse gas emission mitigation path.
   An effective forecasting method can represent a useful tool for managing
   renewable energies in microgrids and mitigating carbon dioxide emission.
   In this study is evaluated the trend of CO2 emission in Iran, Canada and
   Italy and compared the CO2 emission from consumption of energy sources:
   Coal - Natural Gas - Petroleum and other refined hydrocarbons -
   Renewable Energies. Furthermore, a proposed intelligent method has been
   provided for CO2 emission forecasting based on Generalized Regression
   Neural Network and Grey Wolf Optimization. Furthermore, the proposed
   method has been used for renewable energies generation (Wind power and
   Solar power) forecasting in the microgrid of Favignana island (Italy).
   The obtained results confirm the higher accuracy of the proposed method
   in long-term CO2 emission forecasting and short-term renewable energies
   generation as compared with other several methods. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Title = {Sensitivity of sea ice to wind-stress and radiative forcing since 1500:
   a model study of the Little Ice Age and beyond},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {32},
Number = {6},
Pages = {817-831},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Three different reconstructed wind-stress fields which take into account
   variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation, one general circulation
   model wind-stress field, and three radiative forcings (volcanic
   activity, insolation changes and greenhouse gas changes) are used with
   the UVic Earth System Climate Model to simulate the surface air
   temperature, the sea-ice cover, and the Atlantic meridional overturning
   circulation (AMOC) since 1500, a period which includes the Little Ice
   Age (LIA). The simulated Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature,
   used for model validation, agrees well with several temperature
   reconstructions. The simulated sea-ice cover in each hemisphere responds
   quite differently to the forcings. In the Northern Hemisphere, the
   simulated sea-ice area and volume during the LIA are larger than the
   present-day area and volume. The wind-driven changes in sea-ice area are
   about twice as large as those due to thermodynamic (i.e., radiative)
   forcing. For the sea-ice volume, changes due to wind forcing and
   thermodynamics are of similar magnitude. Before 1850, the simulations
   suggest that volcanic activity was mainly responsible for the
   thermodynamically produced area and volume changes, while after 1900 the
   slow greenhouse gas increase was the main driver of the sea-ice changes.
   Changes in insolation have a small effect on the sea ice throughout the
   integration period. The export of the thicker sea ice during the LIA has
   no significant effect on the maximum strength of the AMOC. A more
   important process in altering the maximum strength of the AMOC and the
   sea-ice thickness is the wind-driven northward ocean heat transport. In
   the Southern Hemisphere, there are no visible long-term trends in the
   simulated sea-ice area or volume since 1500. The wind-driven changes are
   roughly four times larger than those due to radiative forcing. Prior to
   1800, all the radiative forcings could have contributed to the
   thermodynamically driven changes in area and volume. In the 1800s the
   volcanic forcing was dominant, and during the first part of the 1900s
   both the insolation changes and the greenhouse gas forcing are
   responsible for thermodynamically produced changes. Finally, in the
   latter part of the 1900s the greenhouse gas forcing is the dominant
   factor in determining the sea-ice changes in the Southern Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {The view seems common among economists that a large part of CO2
   emissions is very rapidly absorbed. Regressions using data for emissions
   and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 give erroneous conclusions if land
   use sources and `missing sinks' are excluded or underestimated, and if
   oceanic uptake is modelled as a simple exponential. The costs of CO2
   emissions may then be seriously underestimated, especially at low
   discount rates.},

Title = {Adaptive response of Dongzhaigang mangrove in China to future sea level
   rise},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests are valuable intertidal ecosystems that provide
   coastline protection, biodiversity maintenance, and carbon
   sequestration. However, their survival is under severe threat from
   rapidly rising sea levels. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
   changes in the area of the Dongzhaigang mangrove in China since the
   1950s and causes of these changes using literature and remote sensing
   data. The impact of historical and future sea level rise (SLR) on the
   mangroves was analyzed using remote sensing data and climate model data
   under the low, intermediate, and very high greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, and
   8.5). The area of the mangrove forests decreased from 3416 to 1711 hm(2)
   during 1956-1988 and remained constant at 1711 hm(2) after the 1990s,
   owing to anthropogenic disturbances such as reclamation and aquaculture
   before the 1980s and the protection of nature reserve establishment
   after the 1990s, respectively. Under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, SLR is expected
   to cause > 26\% of the mangroves to disappear by 2100, whereas under RCP
   2.6, only 17\% of the mangroves will likely be lost. Biological measures
   such as reestablishment of ponds as mangrove forests, afforestation, and
   biological embankment for sediment trapping in coastal wetlands are
   recommended to enhance the resilience of mangroves to SLR.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a simulation study of some of the socio-economic
   consequences of a rise in sea level on Dutch society.  A computer
   simulation model for the greenhouse problem has been developed, which
   tries to capture the climate change cause-effect relationship for a
   combination of greenhouse-gas emissions.  The impact of emissions of
   greenhouse gases on global temperature and sea-level rise can be
   calculated using the model.  Additionally, separate, independent modules
   have been implemented in order to quantify the socio-economic
   consequences for the Netherlands.  Four consistent sets of scenarios
   have been developed, based on differences in economic growth, energy
   use, international environmental measures, etc.  On the basis of these
   scenarios estimates are made of the costs of coastal defence and water
   management in the Netherlands as a result of adaptation to the impacts

Abstract = {A succession of environmental events over the last few years has led to
   a dramatically increased awareness of the issue of global climate change
   and to the conviction that global climate change is occurring. The
   anticipated global climate changes are new and unique in that they will
   have been generated by human activity and could result in large-scale
   disruptions in ecosystems altering the suitability for organisms
   currently occupying them. The goals of both conservation biology and
   agriculture of feeding an increasing world population and preserving
   species diversity may be seriously challenged when linked to climate
   change. Anticipated atmospheric changes in precipitation patterns,
   temperature, and greenhouse gases could have extreme effects on species
   and ecosystems. Human systems could also bc affected, especially those
   based on coastal wetlands or shared river basins. Agriculture will be
   profoundly affected, with local, regional, and global changes occurring.
   Species distribution is likely to be drastically altered as a
   consequence of global warming.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Utility-scale solar power plants are a rapidly growing component of the
   renewable energy sector. While most agree that solar power can decrease
   greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of photovoltaic (PV) systems on
   surface energy exchanges and near-surface meteorology are not well
   understood. This study presents data from two eddy covariance
   observational towers, placed within and adjacent to a utility-scale PV
   array in southern Arizona. The observational period (October 2017-July
   2018) includes the full range of annual temperature variation. Average
   daily maximum 1.5-m air temperature at the PV array was 1.3 degrees C
   warmer than the reference (i.e., non-PV) site, whereas no significant
   difference in 1.5-m nocturnal air temperature was observed. PV modules
   captured the majority of solar radiation and were the primary
   energetically active surface during the day. Despite the removal of
   energy by electricity production, the modules increased daytime net
   radiation Q{*} available for partitioning by reducing surface albedo.
   The PV modules shift surface energy balance partitioning away from
   upward longwave radiation and heat storage and toward sensible heat flux
   Q(H) because of their low emissivity, low heat capacity, and increased
   surface area and roughness, which facilitates more efficient Q(H) from
   the surface. The PV modules significantly reduce ground heat flux Q(G)
   storage and nocturnal release, as the soil beneath the modules is well
   shaded. Our work demonstrates the importance of targeted observational
   campaigns to inform process-based understanding associated with PV
   systems. It further establishes a basis for observationally based PV
   energy balance models that may be used to examine climatic effects due
   to large-scale deployment.},

Title = {Influence of the Water Source on the Carbon Footprint of Irrigated
   Agriculture: A Regional Study in South-Eastern Spain},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to combat climate change is a
   major global challenge. Although irrigated agriculture consumes
   considerable energy that generates GHG emissions, the biomass produced
   also represents an important CO2 sink, which can counterbalance the
   emissions. The source of the water supply considerably influences the
   irrigation energy consumption and, consequently, the resulting carbon
   footprint. This study evaluates the potential impact on the carbon
   footprint of partially and fully replacing the conventional supply from
   Tagus-Segura water transfer (TSWT) with desalinated seawater (DSW) in
   the irrigation districts of the Segura River basin (south-eastern
   Spain). The results provide evidence that the crop GHG emissions depend
   largely on the water source and, consequently, its carbon footprint. In
   this sense, in the hypothetical scenario of the TSWT being completely
   replaced with DSW, GHG emissions may increase by up to 50\% and the
   carbon balance could be reduced by 41\%. However, even in this
   unfavourable situation, irrigated agriculture in the study area could
   still act as a CO2 sink with a negative total and specific carbon
   balance of -707,276 t CO2/year and -8.10 t CO2/ha-year, respectively.
   This study provides significant policy implications for understanding
   the water-energy-food nexus in water-scarce regions.},

Abstract = {As climate change is widespread, rapid, and intensifying, as reported by
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, coastal areas are expected to
   witness a continued increase in sea level throughout the twenty-first
   century and the future. Further, the intensity and frequency of extreme
   events are expected to increase in the future. These alarming climate
   change trends deem immediate engineering intervention to protect the
   coastline around the world. Coastal defense structures are crucial
   components in protecting coastal communities and defense-related
   infrastructures. The existing coastal structures may not be functional
   to the desired level or become less functional in the future due to
   climate change and sea-level rise impacts, this might lead to an
   increase in the wave-induced loads and increased wave overtopping rates
   resulting in coastal flooding and inundation. Therefore, it is essential
   to develop methodologies to upgrade and reinforce the coastal
   structures, thereby making them climate-resilient. There are few efforts
   taken in the past in this direction, and the present study is aimed to
   deepen the understanding of the performance of various retrofitting
   structures in enhancing the resilience against increased wave action. In
   the present study, we focus on a review of various up-gradation
   approaches used by various researchers over a wide variety of coastal
   structures to tackle the climate change impacts and discuss their
   performance in enhancing coastal resilience. Also, we discussed a new
   methodology for finding the optimal solution among various alternative
   methods with an example. This study will help to understand the
   knowledge gap involved in the existing literature and determine the
   future research direction towards climate-resilient coastal structures.},

Abstract = {The current study makes use of life cycle assessment to evaluate the
   potential greenhouse gas (GHG) savings in coal electricity generation by
   5\% co-firing with sorghum pellets. The research models the utilization
   of 100 thousand hectares of under-utilized marginal land in Flores
   (Indonesia) for biomass sorghum cultivation. Based on equivalent energy
   content, 1.12 tons of pellets can substitute one ton of coal. The
   calculated fossil energy ratio of the pellets was 5.8, indicating that
   the production of pellets for fuel is energetically feasible. Based on a
   biomass yield of 48 ton/ha.yr, 4.8 million tons of pellets can be
   produced annually. In comparison with a coal system, the combustion of
   only pellets to generate 8,300 GWh of electricity can reduce global
   warming impacts by 7.9 million tons of CO2-eq, which is equivalent to an
   85\% reduction in GHG emissions. However, these results changed when
   reduced biomass yield of 24 ton/ha.yr, biomass loss, field emissions,
   and incomplete combustion were considered in the model. A sensitivity
   analysis of the above factors showed that the potential GHG savings
   could decrease from the initially projected 85\% to as low as 70\%.
   Overall, the production of sorghum pellets in Flores and their
   utilization for electricity generation can significantly reduce the
   reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to climate change mitigation.
   Some limitations to these conclusions were also discussed herein. The
   results of this scenario study can assist the Indonesian government in
   exploring the potential utilization of marginal land for bioenergy
   development, both in Indonesia and beyond. (C) 2020 BRTeam. All rights

Abstract = {In response to concerns about global warming, there is increasing
   interest in the potential for using renewable sources of energy to meet
   the world's energy needs. This paper reviews the present use of
   renewable energy in Australia and New Zealand and examines the potential
   resources available to meet the future energy needs of both countries.
   Resources considered include hydro, biomass, solar geothermal, wind
   tidal and wave energy.
   Consideration is given to a variety of factors which are likely to
   determine the extent to which renewable energy options are used. These
   factors include the availability and cost of non-renewable resources,
   advances in renewable and other energy technologies and the severity of
   environmental problems (greenhouse and non-greenhouse related).
   Two future scenarios for the use of renewable energy in Australia and
   New Zealand are considered. One scenario assumes a continuation of
   recent trends relating to microeconomic reform in the energy sector and
   the implementation of greenhouse-related response measures which incur
   no net cost to the economy. The other scenario assumes that a concerted
   international effort will be undertaken towards stabilisation of
   atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases.},

Abstract = {Majority of the power generation in India is carried out by conventional
   energy sources, coal and fossil fuels being the primary ones, which
   contribute heavily to greenhouse gas emission and global warming. The
   Indian power sector is witnessing a revolution as excitement grips the
   nation about harnessing electricity from various renewable energy
   sources. Electricity generation from renewable sources is increasingly
   recognized to play an important role for the achievement of a variety of
   primary and secondary energy policy goals, such as improved diversity
   and security of energy supply, reduction of local pollutant and global
   greenhouse gas emissions, regional and rural development, and
   exploitation of opportunities for fostering social cohesion, value
   addition and employment generation at the local and regional level. This
   focuses the solution of the energy crisis on judicious utilization of
   abundant the renewable energy resources, such as biomass, solar, wind,
   geothermal and ocean tidal energy. This paper reviews the renewable
   energy scenario of India as well as extrapolates the future developments
   keeping in view the consumption, production and supply of power.
   Research, development, production and demonstration have been carried
   out enthusiastically in India to find a feasible solution to the
   perennial problem of power shortage for the past three decades. India
   has obtained application of a variety of renewable energy technologies
   for use in different sectors too. There are ample opportunities with
   favorable geology and geography with huge customer base and widening gap
   between demand and supply. Technological advancement, suitable
   regulatory policies, tax rebates, efficiency improvement in consequence
   to R\&D efforts are the few pathways to energy and environment
   conservation and it will ensure that these large, clean resource bases
   are exploited as quickly and cost effectively as possible. This paper
   gives an overview of the potential renewable energy resources in Indian
   context while evaluating the present status, the energy demand of the
   country and forecast consumption and production, with the objective to
   evaluate and assess whether India can sustain its growth and its society
   with renewable resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of carbon footprint analysis as an extended
   environmental indicator in the wine sector},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {61-77},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Currently, carbon footprint (CF) analysis is gaining a role of primary
   interest within the extensive literature regarding wine sustainability
   issues. It envisages the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions that
   underpin the life-cycle of wine, from viticulture and vinification to
   wine bottling, distribution, consumption and waste end-of-life. This
   critical review pursues several methodological and conceptual issues
   behind wine carbon footprinting, such as calculation approaches,
   labeling and standardization purposes, combinations with other methods
   and theories, and CF trends in the wine sector. Most studies have only
   addressed specific methodological issues from an attributional
   life-cycle perspective, or have directly reported the CF profile of a
   given wine product. Future studies, however, will have to deal with
   increasingly complex market interactions linked to the entire life cycle
   of wine-making. A comprehensive discussion is presented concerning the
   benefits the CF indicator may provide both to producers and consumers
   and on the needs for reducing uncertainties and misinterpretations
   within a growing globalized wine market. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Carbon dioxide uptake overrides methane emission at the air-water
   interface of algae-shellfish mariculture ponds: Evidence from eddy
   covariance observations},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {815},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Mariculture ponds are widely distributed along the coastal regions and
   have been increasingly recognized as biogeochemical hotspots of
   air-water greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, but their source/sink dynamics
   and climate benefits have not been well understood. Due to strong
   temporal variations of GHG fluxes over mariculture ponds, previous
   studies based on short-term or discrete flux measurements have large
   uncertainty in assessing GHG budgets and their radiative effects. In
   this study, we examined the temporal variations of air-water GHG fluxes,
   net CO2 exchange (NEE) and net CH4 exchange (NME), and their
   environmental controls, based on one-year (2020) continuous eddy
   covariance (EC) measurements over algae-shellfish mariculture ponds
   (razor clam) in a subtropical estuary of Southeast China. The results
   showed that (a) annually the ponds acted as a strong CO2 sink of -227.7
   g CO2-C m(-2) and a weak CH4 source of 1.44 g CH4-C m(-2), and thus the
   NME-induced warming effect offset 25.9\% (12.1\%) of the NEE-induced
   cooling effect at a 20-year (100-year) time horizon using the metric of
   sustained-flux global warming potential; (b) two GHG fluxes showed
   different diurnal and seasonal variations but both had stronger
   source/sink capacity in summer and more fluctuating fluxes in winter;
   (c) temporal variations of NEE and NME tended to be more regulated by
   photosynthetically active radiation and tidal salinity, respectively,
   but both of them were affected by water temperature and area proportion
   of algae ponds within the EC footprint. This is the first study to
   disentangle temporal variations of air-water GHG fluxes over mariculture
   ponds based on simultaneous EC measurements of CO2 and CH(4 )fluxes.
   This study highlights the climate benefits of algae-shellfish
   mariculture ponds as biogeochemical hotspots by exerting a net radiative
   cooling effect dominated by the CO2 sink.},

Title = {Can policy perception influence social resilience to policy change?},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {216-227},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether policy perception can erode
   or enhance the ability of commercial fishers to be resilient to changes
   in fisheries policy. An understanding of the way that fishers perceive
   resource policies provides fisheries managers with the opportunity to
   refine policy design and delivery so as to better protect system
   resilience. Policy perception is assessed by asking commercial fishers
   how they perceive their level of involvement in the policy
   decision-making process and interpret equity, the likely socio-economic
   impacts, conservation effectiveness and the rate of implementation (of
   generic policies). Social resilience to policy change is examined by
   assessing a fisher's (i) perception of risk associated with change, (ii)
   ability to plan, learn and reorganise, (iii) ability to cope, and (iv)
   level of interest in change. One hundred commercial fishers in five
   coastal communities were quantitatively and qualitatively surveyed. A
   negative perception of policy was found to significantly and adversely
   influence the behaviour and emotional response of commercial fishers,
   which, as described here, influences their resilience. For policy
   perception to be positive and resilience to be enhanced, fishers need to
   be meaningfully involved in the decision-making process, change needs to
   be implemented at an appropriate rate, and effort is required to ensure
   that equity, anticipated impacts and conservation effectiveness are
   positively interpreted. This knowledge can assist in the development of
   fisheries management strategies aimed at maintaining and enhancing
   socio-ecological resilience. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by

Abstract = {Even though climate change involves much more than warming, it is the
   name given to a set of physical phenomena. It is a long-term change in
   weather patterns that characterises different regions of the world. The
   warming effect in the earth's atmosphere has dramatically increased
   through the influence of some heat-taping gases emitted by various human
   activities, especially fossil fuel burning. The more the input of such
   gases, the more will be the warming effect in the coming times. Global
   climate change is already visible in various parts of the larger
   ecosystems like forests, fisheries, biodiversity, and agriculture;
   however, it is now also influencing the supply of freshwater, human
   health, and well-being. This paper reviews climate change drivers, its
   global scenario, major global events, and assessing climate change
   impacts. The most daunting problem of economic and ecological risks,
   along with the threats to humanity, is also discussed. The paper further
   reviews the species' vulnerability to climate change and the heat waves
   and human migration vis-a-vis climate change. Climate change politics
   and coverage of climate change episodes in mass media is the special
   focus of this review that concludes with a few mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {Coastal areas are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and
   sea-level rise. These impacts will exacerbate the risks posed by the
   continuing environmental degradation confronting the coastal
   communities.
   Adopting a participatory research approach, the study examines the
   vulnerability of socioeconomic groups among the coastal population in
   Cavite City, Philippines, their current adaptation strategies and their
   adaptive capacity to cope with the impacts of climate variability and
   extremes and sea-level rise. Under a future scenario of a 1-m
   accelerated sea-level rise (ASLR), the study also looks into its
   potential effects on these urban coastal communities and ecosystems.
   In the context of poverty reduction and sustainable development, this
   study suggests a local framework for integrating adaptation strategies
   and actions into integrated coastal management (ICM) planning. It also
   recommends appropriate policy and institutional reform, capacity
   building and improved knowledge management towards increasing the
   resilience and adaptive capacity of these coastal communities to current
   and future climate risks. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   process to assess vulnerabilities to climate change and to manage
   adaptation responses: (3) an inter-temporal framework to assist
   decision-makers on when to adapt; (4) a risk and simulation approach to
   confront the uncertainties of the possible losses due to climate change
   and the net benefits of adaptation; (5) an explanation of how adaptive
   co-management can promote flexible adaptation responses and also
   strengthen adaptation capacity: and (6) a selection of possible

Abstract = {New rules and regulations in the maritime sector are under discussion to
   reduce GHG emissions. Decision-makers are keen to understand the effects
   of such policies, to choose the more cost-effective ways to reduce
   emissions from ships. In this paper, we propose two alternative
   frameworks, based on a global and integrated perspective, to assess the
   cost-effectiveness of the policies under discussion and, therefore, to
   contribute to this debate. We use two possible mitigation actions as
   examples: fuel tax adoption and speed reduction. We also present the
   most utilized partial equilibrium models (based on trade models) and
   general equilibrium models to evaluate economic and environmental
   effects of policies. We also indicate the necessary components to
   develop a specific general equilibrium model for environmental policy
   evaluation in the maritime sector. Finally, we compare the advantages
   and disadvantages of each approach and present ways to calculate the
   relevant indicators to support the decisions on the best policies to be
   implemented.},

Journal = {EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {231},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Erosion by landslides is a common phenomenon in mountain regions around
   the globe, affecting all climatic zones. Landslides facilitate bedrock
   weathering, pedogenesis and ecological succession, being key drivers of
   biodiversity. Landslide chronosequences have long been used for studies
   of vegetation succession in initial ecosystems, but they further offer
   ideal model systems for studies of soil development and microbial
   community succession. In this review we synthesize the state of
   knowledge on the role of landslides in ecosystems, their influence on
   element cycles and interactions with biota. Further, we discuss feedback
   mechanisms between global warming, landslide activity and greenhouse gas
   emissions. In the view of increasing anthropogenic influence and climate
   change, soils are becoming a critical resource. Due to their ubiquity,
   landslide chronosequences have the potential to provide critical
   insights into soil development under different climates and thereby
   contribute to future soil restoration efforts.},

Title = {Human adaptation strategies to abrupt climate change in Puerto Rico ca.

Journal = {HOLOCENE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {The connection between climatic change and social response is complex
   because change articulates a number of inter-related factors. Human
   decisions are filtered by social buffers - including social memory, risk
   perception, and cultural priorities - and the rate and scale of climate
   change is usually much larger than the scale of human decision-making.
   In this article, we provide information on climate change based on
   precisely dated speleothems with the response evident in archaeological
   sites that have radiocarbon date ranges within the same time frame. A
   stalagmite recovered from within the catchment area for aquifer recharge
   of the Pre-Arawak site of Angostura in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, shows
   that a significant wet period occurred between 3.9 and 3.1ka (primarily
   centered at 3.5ka). We investigate the effect that this increase in
   precipitation had on the earliest occupations on the island in the
   context of palaeoenvironmental, geoarchaeological, and archaeological
   records from Angostura, Maruca, and Paso del Indio. Our analysis
   suggests the presence of two different adaptation strategies: settlement
   relocation and microlandscape modification. Our study concludes that the
   social response to change cannot be seen as monolithic given that human
   behavior, even within the same period, addresses the needs of individual
   groups with different priorities. This multiplicity of responses can
   indeed enhance resilience as social support can continue through
   alliances and exchanges, strengthening social bonds that can help buffer
   catastrophes. The results can help shed light on the range of adaptation
   strategies to change encompassed within the manifestations of social
   resilience or vulnerability.},

Abstract = {After decades of profound challenges Cambodia has seen twenty years of
   stability and a flourishing tourism industry, however, it has also been
   identified as highly vulnerable to climate change thus putting the
   country's long-desired economic development at risk. Sustainable
   Development Goal 13 `Climate Action' is critical for the continued
   economic success of Cambodia's vulnerable coastal tourism sector, but
   little is known about the hotel sector's adaptation responses and the
   differences between key hotel characteristics such as star rating, size,
   ownership and length of operation. This article examines the adaptation
   actions by 50 Cambodian coastal hotels by distinguishing between five
   adaptation categories. Subsequently, the analysis is deepened through a
   comparative analysis of key hotel characteristics. Although adaptation
   measures varied considerably between hotels they were more comprehensive
   and numerous than expected. Furthermore, patterns emerged that saw large
   hotels apply high levels of adaptation while budget and Khmer-owned
   hotels reported limited adaptation measures.},

   Communities through a Participatory Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal rural communities worldwide face many challenges not only
   related to climate change but also extreme events, environmental
   degradation, population growth or aging, and conflict usage of the
   ecosystem. Historically, the economies of coastal communities have been
   based on the exploitation of natural resources, thus shaping its
   socioeconomic development. This has led to some limitations in the way
   these communities can now adapt to climate change. In Canada, coastal
   communities are increasingly dealing with climate change consequences.
   Sea level rise, coastal erosion, and increasing frequency in storm
   surges threaten the fragility of both natural and human systems. Various
   approaches have been used to try to reduce the vulnerability and improve
   adaptive capacity of communities. One approach, promoted by many
   organizations including the United Nations, is ecosystem-based
   adaptation. This approach is part of the series of nature-based
   solutions that help social-ecological systems become more resilient; by
   promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, this
   approach also relates to principles of community engagement and supports
   adaptive governance and social inclusion. This paper describes and
   analyzes these principles and considers strategies for ensuring
   community engagement. Combining ecosystem-based adaptation with a strong
   community engagement can enhance the long-term sustainability of the
   social-ecological system.},

Title = {Sustainable Land-Use Planning to Improve the Coastal Resilience of the
   Social-Ecological Landscape},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The dynamics of land-use transitions decrease the coastal resilience of
   the social-ecological landscape (SEL), particularly in light of the fact
   that it is necessary to analyze the causal relationship between the two
   systems because operations of the social system and the ecological
   system are correlated. The purpose of this study is to analyze the
   dynamics of the coastal SEL and create a sustainable land-use planning
   (SLUP) strategy to enhance coastal resilience. The selected study site
   was Shindu-ri, South Korea, where land-use transitions are increasing
   and coastal resilience is therefore decreasing. Systems thinking was
   used to analyze the study, which was performed in four steps. First, the
   issues affecting the coastal area in Shindu-ri were defined as coastal
   landscape management, the agricultural structure, and the tourism
   industry structure. Second, the main variables for each issue were
   defined, and causal relationships between the main variables were
   created. Third, a holistic causal loop diagram was built based on both
   dynamic thinking and causal thinking. Fourth, five land-uses, including
   those of the coastal forest, the coastal grassland, the coastal dune,
   the agricultural area, and developed sites, were selected as leverage
   points for developing SLUP strategies to increase coastal resilience.
   The results show that ``decrease in the size of the coastal forest{''},
   ``decrease in the size of the coastal dune{''}, and ``increase in the
   size of the coastal grasslands{''} were considered parts of a land-use
   plan to enhance the resilience of the Shindu-ri SEL. This study
   developed integrated coastal land-use planning strategies that may
   provide effective solutions for complex and dynamic issues in the
   coastal SEL. Additionally, the results may be utilized as basic data to
   build and implement coastal land-use planning strategies.},

Abstract = {In response to the increase in the global concentrations of greenhouse
   gases, the IEA Greenhouse Gas R \& D Programme is carrying out an
   assessment of greenhouse gas abatement technologies with particular
   reference to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel power generation
   systems. The work is supported internationally by 13 OECD countries as
   well as the Commission of European Communities and two sponsors RWE and
   DMT. The Programme has examined, on a consistent basis, the options
   available for capturing and disposing of the CO2 product from a range of
   gas and coal fired power generation plant types, each with an output of
   500MW(e). Systems under consideration include PF+FGD, IGCC, NGCC and a
   CO2/O-2 recycle scheme. CO2 capture technologies considered include
   chemical and physical absorption, solid adsorption, cryogenics, membrane
   separation and gas separation membranes. Carbon dioxide disposal options
   considered are; disposal in the oceans, in aquifers, in depleted gas
   reservoirs and terrestrial storage as a solid. In addition, a number of
   studies have evaluated the utilisation of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery
   and the manufacture of chemicals, including a detailed investigation of
   dimethy carbonate production. Comparison is also made with the
   alternative stance of compensatory forest plantations and substitution
   of fossil fuels with biomass. Emphasis has been placed on a requirement
   to determine the impact of the various technologies on the cost of
   electricity generation. This has been achieved by analysing the costs of
   specific schemes, on a common basis, and comparative results are
   presented for various CO2 abatement options. A number of studies have
   also been carried out to evaluate transport options and the
   environmental impact of these technology combinations for carbon dioxide
   disposal. The results indicate that by combining the most favourable
   technologies for CO2 capture and disposal to efficient power generation
   technology, electricity generation costs could be increased by around
   40\%. Alternative schemes have similar or even greater cost penalties.
   Analysis shows that the cost of CO2 capture dominates these added
   figures unless CO2 transport distances are very large. Carbon dioxide
   disposal is the area where further R \& D is urgently required to
   provide environmental impact data. A further series of studies have
   recently been completed to examine the implications of considering the
   full life cycle involved in the power generation process, incorporating
   carbon dioxide capture and disposal, starting from extracting the fuel
   to storing the CO2 product, over the natural life of power stations
   systems.},

Abstract = {Coastal areas are important residential, commercial and industrial
   areas; but coastal hazards can pose significant threats to these areas.
   Shoreline/coastal protection elements, both built structures such as
   breakwaters, seawalls and revetments, as well as natural features such
   as beaches, reefs and wetlands, are regular features of a coastal
   community and are important for community safety and development. These
   protection structures provide a range of resilience to coastal
   communities. During and after disasters, they help to minimize damages
   and support recovery; during non-disaster times, the values from
   shoreline elements shift from the narrow focus on protection. Most
   coastal communities have limited land and resources and few can dedicate
   scarce resources solely for protection. Values from shore protection can
   and should expand to include environmental, economic and social/cultural
   values. This paper discusses the key aspects of shoreline protection
   that influence effective community resilience and protection from
   disasters. This paper also presents ways that the economic,
   environmental and social/cultural values of shore protection can be
   evaluated and quantified. It presents the Coastal Community Hazard
   Protection Resilience (CCHPR) Index for evaluating the resilience
   capacity to coastal communities from various protection schemes and
   demonstrates the use of this Index for an urban beach in San Francisco,
   CA, USA.},

Title = {Carbon dioxide emission from drawdown areas of a Mediterranean reservoir},
Journal = {LIMNETICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-72},
Abstract = {Sediment beds from drawdown areas of reservoirs constitute a relevant
   hotspot for carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to the atmosphere. This CO2
   source is especially relevant in the case of Mediterranean reservoirs,
   where hydrological variability favors the exposure of large sediment
   areas to air. In spite of this, the role of dry sediments as CO2
   emitters has been typically neglected in lakes and reservoirs greenhouse
   gas emission assessments, and there is also a lack of research on the
   spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from drawdown sediments. In this study
   we contribute to this knowledge by combining drone-based
   aero-photogrammetry techniques with in situ infrarred gas analyzer
   measurements to assess the magnitude and spatial variability of CO2
   fluxes from the drawdown area of a Mediterranean reservoir (El Gergal,
   Southwestern Spain) during one dry season. Our results show that during
   survey dry sediments in El Gergal were a relevant net CO2 source to the
   atmosphere, with a mean emission of 0.36 +/- 0.38 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1). In
   addition, CO2 fluxes from El Gergal drawdown depict a marked spatial
   variability, with maximum values measured in areas influenced by river
   or intermittent streams discharges. Distance to the shore, sediment
   particle size, pH and temperature also have a significant effect on CO2
   emissions from the reservoir dry banks. The expected strengthening of
   droughts intensity and frequency in the Mediterranean region could
   enhance the role of exposed sediments from the drawdown of reservoirs as
   CO2 source to the atmosphere.},

Title = {The Effects of Green Roofs on Outdoor Thermal Comfort, Urban Heat Island

Abstract = {There is growing attention to the use of greenery in urban areas, in
   various forms and functions, as an instrument to reduce the impact of
   human activities on the urban environment. The aim of this study has
   been to investigate the use of green roofs as a strategy to reduce the
   urban heat island effect and to improve the thermal comfort of indoor
   and outdoor environments. The effects of the built-up environment, the
   presence of vegetation and green roofs, and the urban morphology of the
   city of Turin (Italy) have been assessed considering the land surface
   temperature distribution. This analysis has considered all the
   information recorded by the local weather stations and satellite images,
   and compares it with the geometrical and typological characteristics of
   the city in order to find correlations that confirm that greenery and
   vegetation improve the livability of an urban context. The results
   demonstrate that the land-surface temperature, and therefore the air
   temperature, tend to decrease as the green areas increase. This trend
   depends on the type of urban context. Based on the results of a
   green-roofs investigation of Turin, the existing and potential green
   roofs are respectively almost 300 (257,380 m(2)) and 15,450 (6,787,929
   m(2)). Based on potential assessment, a strategy of priority was
   established according to the characteristics of building, to the
   presence of empty spaces, and to the identification of critical areas,
   in which the thermal comfort conditions are poor with low vegetation.
   This approach can be useful to help stakeholders, urban planners, and
   policy makers to effectively mitigate the urban heat island (UHI),
   improve the livability of the city, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and gain thermal comfort conditions, and to identify policies
   and incentives to promote green roofs.},

   in Osaka Bay, Japan},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {169},
Number = {3-4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change poses significant challenges and impacts to coastal
   communities. In order to limit future coastal flood risk, adaptation is
   necessary. This study presents an integrated model to simulate storm
   surge inundation risk in Osaka Bay under climate change and provide a
   cost-benefit analysis of structure adaptation strategies to reduce risk.
   The results show that storm surge inundation risk will increase
   dramatically as combined impacts of sea level rise and intensified storm
   surges due to global warming. Without adaptation measures, the expected
   annual damage cost increases from 9.85 billion JPY to 69.17 billion JPY
   in Osaka Bay under the projected RCP8.5 scenario to 2100. We then
   explore the effectiveness of structural adaptation strategies. The
   results indicate that raising the height of existing dikes can reduce
   inundation risk effectively. The benefits and costs depend on the
   elevated height and the discount rate. Using cost-benefit analysis, we
   find that upgrading by 1 m the height of existing dikes is the most
   cost-effective strategy for Osaka Bay. The methodology developed in this
   paper provides a reference for Osaka Bay and other coastal regions when
   they make coastal flood risk management and adaptation strategies to
   respond to climate change.},

Title = {Effect of an Electric Vehicle Promotion Policy on China's Islands: A
   Case Study of Hainan Island},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Despite the abundant clean energy resources on islands, energy supply on
   the islands in many countries and regions still depends on high-voltage
   power grids in neighboring continents and high-cost fossil energy such
   as oil. In China, increasing demand for private gasoline vehicles calls
   for an abundant gasoline supply, which is harmful to the renewable
   energy transformation on Chinese islands. The promotion of electric
   vehicles (EVs) offers a potential solution. However, on large islands
   with large populations, insufficient electricity supply restricts
   residents' behavior, which has led to difficulties in promoting clean
   energy vehicles. To solve this problem, in 2019, the government
   formulated an 11-year plan to comprehensively promote clean energy
   vehicles from the energy supply side and user demand side to transform
   Hainan Island into a clean energy island. However, some predictions in
   the report are doubtful. As a result, this study takes Hainan Island in
   China as an example. Based on data on energy and EVs, the greenhouse gas
   emissions and electricity demand of the transportation industry in
   Hainan Island under policy and non-policy scenarios are calculated using
   a generation substitution accounting model. Based on the results, this
   study evaluates the expected effect of Hainan Province's 11-year plan to
   develop clean energy vehicles and compares the results with those in the
   report. Policy implications based on the results are also proposed. This
   study combines the island's energy structure with the application of EVs
   and expands the evaluation of government policies on the impact of
   large-scale energy transformation from the perspective of the energy
   supply chain. It also provides a reference for energy transformation on
   other large islands.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},

Abstract = {The tropospheric westerly jet is a key feature of Southern Hemisphere
   climate. In recent decades the jet strengthened in austral summer
   (December-February {[}DJF]) and moved poleward owing to the Antarctic
   ozone hole. Future jet trends will be influenced by recovery of the
   Antarctic ozone hole and greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. Here, we examine
   21st century projections of ozone, temperature and winds in the sixth
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models with (CHEM) and without
   (NOCHEM) interactive chemistry. NOCHEM models use an ozone data set that
   was produced with GHG forcings inconsistent with those used by CHEM
   models, leading to less ozone recovery in the Antarctic springtime lower
   stratosphere. This propagates to different stratospheric temperature
   projections and DJF westerly winds: NOCHEM models project a 78 +/- 52\%
   stronger increase in DJF westerly wind speeds than CHEM models under the
   high GHG emissions scenario SSP585. Our results show the importance of
   simulating stratospheric ozone accurately for Southern Hemisphere
   climate change projections.},

   Study Review},

Abstract = {Evidence-based information on household-level adaptation is an important
   element of integrated management of vulnerable coastal regions. A
   growing number of empirical studies deal with household-level adaptation
   at the coast in different regions. This article provides a systematic
   review of these studies. We analyze studies according to how households
   in different parts of the world are currently adapting, or how they are
   intending to adapt, and identify explanatory factors for adaptation
   behavior and intention. We find that households implement a broad range
   of adaptation measures and that adaptation behavior is explained by
   individual factors such as socioeconomic and cognitive variables,
   experience, and perceived responsibilities. Nonpersonal characteristics
   have also been used to explain adaptation behavior and intention but
   have not been extensively investigated. Few studies employ qualitative
   research methods and use inductive approaches as well as models stemming
   from behavioral economics. Our findings suggest that coastal risk
   management policies should communicate the efficacy of household-level
   adaptation, in addition to information about flood risk, in order to
   encourage coastal households in their adaptation activities. In this
   context, we discuss the role of resources and responsibility of
   households for their adaptation behavior. We describe the lessons learnt
   and formulate a research agenda on household-level adaptation to coastal
   flood risk. In practice, coastal risk management policies should further
   promote individually driven adaptation by integrating it in adaptation
   strategies and processes.},

   CHOICES},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {351-376},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We investigate an important scientific uncertainty facing climate-change
   policymakers, namely, the impact of potential abrupt climatic change. We
   examine sequential decision strategies for abating climate change where
   near-term policies are viewed as the first of a series of decisions
   which adapt over the years to improving scientific information. We
   compare two illustrative near-term (1992-2002) policies - moderate and
   aggressive emission reductions - followed by a subsequent long-term
   policy chosen to limit global-mean temperature change to a specified
   `climate target. We calculate the global-mean surface temperature change
   using a simple climate/ocean model and simple models of greenhouse-gas
   concentrations. We alter model parameters to examine the impact of
   abrupt changes in the sinks of carbon dioxide, the sources of methane,
   the circulation of the oceans, and the climate sensitivity, DELTAT2x.
   Although the abrupt changes increase the long-term costs of responding
   to climate change, they do not significantly affect the comparatively
   small cost difference between near-term strategies. Except for an abrupt
   increase in DELTAT2x, the investigated abrupt climate changes do not
   significantly alter the values of the climate target for which each
   near-term strategy is preferred. In contrast, innovations that reduce
   the cost of limiting greenhouse-gas emissions offer the potential for
   substantial abatement cost savings, regardless of which level of
   near-term abatement is selected.},

Title = {Potential solar energy use in the global petroleum sector},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {884-892},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {We examine the potential for solar energy in global oil operations,
   including both extraction and transport ({''}upstream{''}) and refining
   ({''}downstream{''}). Two open-source oil-sector GHG models are applied
   to a set of 83 representative global oil fields and 75 refinery crude
   oil streams (representing 25\% of global production). Results from these
   models are used to estimate per-barrel energy intensities (power, heat),
   which are scaled to generate country-level demand for heat and power.
   Multiple solar resource quality cutoff criteria are used to determine
   which regions may profitably use solar. Potential solar thermal capacity
   ranges from 19 to 44 GW(th) in upstream operations, and from 21 to 95
   GW(th) in downstream operations. Potential PV deployment ranges from 6
   to 11 GW(e) in upstream operations and 17-91 GW(e) in downstream
   operations. The ranges above are due to both per-bbl variation in energy
   intensity, as well as uncertainty in solar resource quality criteria.
   Potential solar deployment in upstream operations would displace a much
   smaller fraction of upstream energy use because a large fraction of
   global upstream energy use is are either offshore or in high latitude
   regions (e.g., Russia, Canada, Central Asia). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {According to the Carbon Trust of the United Kingdom, ``CHP for
   industrial, commercial and domestic applications has the potential to
   make a significant contribution to energy efficiency improvements and to
   reducing CO(2) emissions. It is a key technology needed to help meet the
   UK's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and begin the transition
   to a low carbon economy{''} (CTUK 2002). CHP has the potential to reduce
   a facility's CO(2) emissions provided there is good power and thermal
   load matching and a credible means to calculate these potential CO(2)
   emissions savings. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is the
   first mandatory, market-based effort in the United States to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions. Ten Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states will
   cap and then reduce CO(2) emissions from the power sector by 10\% by
   2018. Midwestern and West Coast states have created similar
   organizations and are expected to monetize carbon emissions. President
   Obama's intentions are for sweeping changes in how Americans use energy,
   and he has made it clear that the United States will participate in
   talks on the successor to the United Nations' Kyoto Protocol. The
   engineering community is increasingly called upon to calculate the
   carbon emissions impact of applying a CHP system at the design stage.
   This paper explores important data-set choices when comparing fuel use
   and CO(2), SO(2), and NO(x) emissions at the design stage for CHP
   systems with the electric grid in various locations throughout the
   United States.},

Title = {Hidden contribution of shrimp farming effluents to greenhouse gas
   emissions from mangrove soils},

Volume = {221},

Abstract = {In the present study, we evaluated CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes in mangrove
   soils that receive shrimp farming effluents. Soil and gas samples were
   collected from a mangrove that receives the discharge of shrimp pond
   effluents and another mangrove forest free of the effluent impacts. CO2
   and N2O emissions were significantly higher in the mangrove soil
   affected by the shrimp effluents (51.4 mg m(2) h(-1) and 90.9 g m(-2)
   h(-1), respectively) than in the mangrove soil free of the effluents
   (26.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 40.4 g m(-2) h(-1), respectively). No
   significant differences in CH4 emissions were observed between the two
   mangroves soils (mean values ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 mg m(-2) h(-1)).
   Suboxic conditions govern nitrification-denitrification and
   mineralization processes and control CO2 and N2O emissions from the
   soil; however, CH4 fluxes were not affected. The highest emissions from
   the impacted soil (93\% higher for CO2 and 125\% higher for N2O) were
   attributable to the high content of organic carbon, total nitrogen, and
   potentially mineralizable nitrogen, which reduce the role of the
   mangrove in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {Geoengineering Earth's radiation balance to mitigate climate change from

Abstract = {It has been suggested that climate change induced by anthropogenic CO2
   could be counteracted with geoengineering schemes designed to diminish
   the solar radiation incident on Earth's surface. Though the spatial and
   temporal pattern of radiative forcing from greenhouse gases differs from
   that of sunlight, it was shown in a recent study that these schemes
   would largely mitigate regional or seasonal climate change for a
   doubling of the atmospheric CO2 content. Here, we examine the ability of
   reduced solar luminosity to cancel the effects of quadrupling of CO2
   content. In agreement with our previous study, geoengineering schemes
   could markedly diminish regional and seasonal climate change. However,
   there are some residual climate changes: in the geoengineered 4 x CO2
   climate, a significant decrease in surface temperature and net water
   flux occurs in the tropics; warming in the high latitudes is not
   completely compensated; the cooling effect of greenhouse gases in the
   stratosphere persists and sea ice is not fully restored. However, these
   residual climate changes are much smaller than the change from
   quadrupling of CO2 without reducing solar input. Caution should be
   exercised in interpretation because these results are from a single
   model with a number of simplifying assumptions. There are also many
   technical, environmental and political reasons not to implement
   geoengineering schemes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Local Seal or Imported Meat? Sustainability Evaluation of Food Choices
   in Greenland, Based on Life Cycle Assessment},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Achieving a sustainable global food chain is becoming particularly acute
   as modern Western diets are adopted in a growing number of countries and
   cultures around the world. Understanding the consequences that this
   shift has on health and sustainability is important. This exploratory
   study is the first to apply the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology
   to analyze the sustainability implication of ongoing dietary shifts in
   Greenland, where locally hunted seal meat is increasingly being replaced
   by imported livestock products, primarily pig and poultry produced in
   Denmark. This dietary shift, indirectly driven by international trade
   bans such as the EU seal product ban, has sustainability implications.
   To inform and support more comprehensive analyses and policy
   discussions, this paper explores the sustainability of these parallel
   Greenlandic food supply chains. A quantitative comparison of the
   greenhouse gas emissions of Greenlandic hunted seal and Danish pig and
   poultry is complemented by a qualitative discussion of nutrition,
   cultural food preferences, animal welfare, and the use of land,
   pesticides and antibiotics. Although the variability in the life cycle
   inventory data collected from Greenlandic hunters was considerable,
   greenhouse gas emissions of seal meat were consistently lower than those
   of imported livestock products. Emissions of the latter are dominated by
   biogenic emissions from feed production and manure management, while
   these are absent for seal meat, whose emissions instead are dominated by
   fossil fuel use. The implications of these results for sustainable
   national food policies in a modern global context as well as important
   areas for additional research are discussed.},

Title = {Conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture ponds decreased N2O
   emission: Evidence from a multi-year field study},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {227},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Land reclamation is a major threat to the world's coastal wetlands, and
   it may influence the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in coastal
   regions. Conversion of coastal marshes into aquaculture ponds is common
   in the Asian Pacific region, but its impacts on the production and
   emission of nitrogen greenhouse gases remain poorly understood. In this
   study, we compared N2O emission from a brackish marsh and converted
   shrimp aquaculture ponds in the Shanyutan wetland, the Min River Estuary
   in Southeast China over a three-year period. We also measured sediment
   and porewater properties, relevant functional gene abundance, sediment
   N2O production potential and denitrification potential in the two
   habitats. Results indicated that the pond sediment had lower Nsubstrate
   availability, lower ammonia oxidation (AOA and comammox Nitrospira
   amoA), nitrite reduction (nirK and nirS) and nitrous oxide reduction
   (nosZ I and nosZ II) gene abundance and lower N2O production and
   denitrification potentials than in marsh sediments. Consequently, N2O
   emission fluxes from the aquaculture ponds (range 5.4-251.8 mu g m-2
   h-1) were significantly lower than those from the marsh (12.6-570.7 mu g
   m-2 h-1). Overall, our results show that conversion from marsh to shrimp
   aquaculture ponds in the Shanyutan wetland may have diminished nutrient
   input from the catchment, impacted the N-cycling microbial community and
   lowered N2O production capacity of the sediment, leading to lower N2O
   emissions. Better post-harvesting management of pond water and sediment
   may further mitigate N2O emissions caused by the aquaculture operation.},

Abstract = {The largest contributor to the planetary energy imbalance is well-mixed
   greenhouse gases (GHGs), which are partially offset by poorly mixed (and
   thus northern midlatitude dominated) anthropogenic aerosols (AAs). To
   isolate the effects of GHGs and AAs, we analyze data from the CMIP5
   historical (i.e., all natural and anthropogenic forcing) and single
   forcing (GHG-only and AA-only) experiments. Over the duration of the
   historical experiment (1861-2005) excess heat uptake at the top of the
   atmosphere and ocean surface occurs almost exclusively in the Southern
   Hemisphere, with AAs canceling the influence of GHGs in the Northern
   Hemisphere. This interhemispheric asymmetry in surface heat uptake is
   eliminated by a northward oceanic transport of excess heat, as there is
   little hemispheric difference in historical ocean heat storage after
   accounting for ocean volume. Data from the 1pctCO2 and RCP 8.5
   experiments suggests that the future storage of excess heat will be
   skewed toward the Northern Hemisphere oceans.
   Plain Language Summary Climate change is fundamentally an energy balance
   problem. Due to the influence of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the
   amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth is currently greater than the
   amount of energy radiated to space. This energy imbalance is partially
   offset by particulate matter released into the atmosphere from burning
   fossil fuels (anthropogenic aerosols, AAs), which is most concentrated
   in the northern midlatitudes. In this study, model simulations of the
   historical and future climate are compared to single forcing simulations
   that apply only GHG or AA emissions. We find that the historical uptake
   of excess heat is strongly skewed toward the Southern Hemisphere because
   AAs cancel the influence of GHGs in the Northern Hemisphere. The oceanic
   storage of that heat shows little difference between the hemispheres due
   to a strong northward transport of excess heat. In future, the models
   suggest excess heat storage will skew toward the Northern Hemisphere.},

Year = {2001},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {107-110},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Samples of vent gas and gas hydrate on the Gulf of Mexico slope were
   collected by research submersible (similar to 540 m water depth) and by
   piston coring (similar to 1060-1070 m water depth). Although gas hydrate
   that crops out is transiently unstable, the larger volume of structure
   II gas hydrate in the gulf is stable or increasing in volume because gas
   from the subsurface petroleum system is venting prolifically within the
   gas hydrate stability zone. Vent gas from gas hydrate shows no
   meaningful molecular evidence of gas hydrate decomposition. Gas hydrate
   fabrics, mainly vein fillings, are typical of ongoing crystallization.
   Once crystallized, most hydrocarbons are protected from bacteria within
   the crystal lattice of gas hydrate. A leaky petroleum system is proposed
   to be the main source of thermogenic greenhouse gases in the central
   gulf. Stable gas hydrate sequesters large volumes of greenhouse gases,
   suggesting that gas hydrate may not be a significant factor in models of
   climate change at present.},

Abstract = {Currently wind power is dominated by onshore wind farms. However, as the
   demand for power grows driven by security of energy supply issues,
   dwindling fossil fuel supplies and greenhouse gas emissions reduction
   targets, offshore wind power will develop rapidly because of the decline
   of viable onshore sites. The United Kingdom has a target of 21\%
   renewable electricity by 2020 and this is expected to come mostly from
   wind power. Britain is the most active internationally in terms of
   offshore wind farm development with almost 48GW in some stage of
   development. In addition the Scottish Government, the Northern Ireland
   Executive and the Government of Ireland undertook the ` Irish-Scottish
   Links on Energy Study' (ISLES), which examined the feasibility of
   creating an offshore interconnected transmission network and subsea
   electricity grid based on renewable energy sources off the coast of
   western Scotland and the Irish Sea. The aim of this paper is to provide
   an appraisal of offshore wind power development with a focus on the
   United Kingdom.},

Abstract = {Much of our understanding of Earth's past climate comes from the
   measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic
   foraminifera. Yet, long intervals in existing records lack the temporal
   resolution and age control needed to thoroughly categorize climate
   states of the Cenozoic era and to study their dynamics. Here, we present
   a new, highly resolved, astronomically dated, continuous composite of
   benthic foraminifer isotope records developed in our laboratories. Four
   climate states-Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, Icehouse-are identified
   on the basis of their distinctive response to astronomical forcing
   depending on greenhouse gas concentrations and polar ice sheet volume.
   Statistical analysis of the nonlinear behavior encoded in our record
   reveals the key role that polar ice volume plays in the predictability
   of Cenozoic climate dynamics.},

Abstract = {Open-cycle cooling water systems and their discharges `thermal
   wastewater outfalls' can be commonly used by seaside-located thermal
   power plants. Lower dilution performance having thermal wastewater
   outfalls may be one of the sources of greenhouse gas water vapour
   evaporation. Thermal wastewater jets of outfalls are positively buoyant,
   and they are commonly discharged from horizontally located nozzles on
   multi-port diffusers. In this study, impact point dilution increments of
   thermal wastewater singular jets (+10 degrees C heated) were
   investigated under the conditions of originally horizontally located,
   then downward inclined nozzle conditions using US Environmental
   Protection Agency-Visual Plumes model system for receiving water
   densities between 1,015-1,035 kg/m(3). Nozzle downward inclination
   angles of thermal discharges and impact point dilution increment ratios
   were found as in the range between for 12 degrees-13 degrees: 0.3 and
   1.2, for 13 degrees-15 degrees: 0.6 and 2.6, and for 14 degrees-20
   degrees: 1.5 and 6.3 for nozzle diameters of 0.1 m, 0.2 m, and 0.5 m,

Pages = {2449-2463},

Abstract = {Climate warming perturbs ecosystem carbon (C) cycling, causing both
   positive and negative feedbacks on greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, we
   began a tidal marsh field experiment in two vegetation communities to
   investigate the mechanisms by which whole-ecosystem warming alters C
   gain, via plant-driven sequestration in soils, and C loss, primarily via
   methane (CH4) emissions. Here, we report the results from the first 4
   years. As expected, warming of 5.1 degrees C more than doubled CH4
   emissions in both plant communities. We propose this was caused by a
   combination of four mechanisms: (i) a decrease in the proportion of CH4
   consumed by CH4 oxidation, (ii) more C substrates available for
   methanogenesis, (iii) reduced competition between methanogens and
   sulfate-reducing bacteria, and (iv) indirect effects of plant traits.
   Plots dominated by Spartina patens consistently emitted more CH4 than
   plots dominated by Schoenoplectus americanus, indicating key differences
   in the roles these common wetland plants play in affecting anaerobic
   soil biogeochemistry and suggesting that plant composition can modulate
   coastal wetland responses to climate change.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the occurrence of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and
   the role of groundwater as an indirect pathway of GHG emissions into
   surface waters in a gaining stretch of the Triffoy River agricultural
   catchment (Belgium). To this end, nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and
   carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, the stable isotopes of nitrate, and
   major ions were monitored in river and groundwater over 8months. Results
   indicated that groundwater was strongly oversaturated in N2O and CO2
   with respect to atmospheric equilibrium (50.1 vs. 0.55gL(-1) for N2O and
   14,569 vs. 400ppm for CO2), but only marginally for CH4 (0.45 vs.
   0.056gL(-1)), suggesting that groundwater can be a source of these GHGs
   to the atmosphere. Nitrification seemed to be the main process for the
   accumulation of N2O in groundwater. Oxic conditions prevailing in the
   aquifer were not prone for the accumulation of CH4. In fact, the
   emissions of CH4 from the river were one to two orders of magnitude
   higher than the inputs from groundwater, meaning that CH4 emissions from
   the river were due to CH4 in-situ production in riverbed or riparian
   zone sediments. For CO2 and N2O, average emissions from groundwater were
   1.5x10(5)kg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) and 207kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1),
   respectively. Groundwater is probably an important source of N2O and CO2
   in gaining streams but when the measures are scaled at catchment scale,
   these fluxes are probably relatively modest. Nevertheless, their
   quantification would better constrain nitrogen and carbon budgets in
   natural systems.},

   Variations in a Tropical Island},
Journal = {WATER},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Due to their vulnerability, understanding the impacts of global warming
   on rainfall is important for a tropical country and islands. This
   research aimed to assess the impact of global warming on rainfall in
   Madagascar, using the Mann-Kendall test, continuous wavelet transform,
   and polynomial regression. The result showed that the annual, seasonal
   maximum, and minimum temperature increased, while elevation amplified
   the increase of maximum temperature. Different trends in rainfall were
   found in the 22 regions of Madagascar but in general, the increasing
   trend in rainfall was prominent at a higher elevation than lower
   elevation. The annual rainfall decreased up to -5 mm per year for the
   regions located below 450 m of altitude while increased up to +5 mm per
   year above 500 m. We found that the wet becomes wetter with an important
   increase in rainfall in summer and the increase in temperature
   influenced the rainfall. The annual rainfall increased with temperature
   and elevation. However, if the increase in temperature was more than
   0.03 degrees C per year, the annual rainfall increased regardless of
   elevation. The knowledge of the elevation dependence of the impact of
   warming on rainfall is important for water resources management and
   climate change adaptation strategies, especially for island nations and
   African countries.},

Abstract = {Coastal areas provide important services and functions for social and
   economic activities. Damage due to sea level rise (SLR) is one of the
   serious problems anticipated and caused by climate change. In this
   study, we assess the global economic impact of inundation due to SLR by
   using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that incorporates
   detailed coastal damage information. The scenario analysis considers
   multiple general circulation models, socioeconomic assumptions, and
   stringency of climate change mitigation measures. We found that the
   global household consumption loss proportion will be 0.045\%, with a
   range of 0.027-0.066\%, in 2100. Socioeconomic assumptions cause a
   difference in the loss proportion of up to 0.035\% without greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions mitigation, the so-called baseline scenarios. The
   range of the loss proportion among GHG emission scenarios is smaller
   than the differences among the socioeconomic assumptions. We also
   observed large regional variations and, in particular, the consumption
   losses in low-income countries are, relatively speaking, larger than
   those in high-income countries. These results indicate that, even if we
   succeed in stabilizing the global mean temperature increase below 2
   degrees C, economic losses caused by SLR will inevitably happen to some
   extent, which may imply that keeping the global mean temperature
   increase below 1.5 degrees C would be worthwhile to consider.},

Title = {Impact of biomass burning on soil organic carbon and the release of
   carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in the coastal savanna ecosystem of
   Ghana},

Abstract = {The impact of escalating human activities on greenhouse gas emission,
   global warming, and changes in global climate patterns is almost
   certainly the most discussed issue in the first decade of the 21st
   century. Two-thirds of Africa's energy consumption consists of various
   forms of highly inefficient traditional biomass. In rural areas, low
   energy consumption is both a cause and consequence of poor development
   and also of the degradation of the natural environment. The burning of
   biomass or vegetation as a conventional land preparation method has a
   net negative impact on the soil organic carbon as well as on the
   environment through the oxidation of carbon into carbon dioxide, an
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas. This paper reports the findings of an
   experiment to investigate the impact of the heat due to burning on soil
   organic carbon at soil depths of 0-5 and 5-10 cm. It was observed that
   21\% decline in soil organic carbon resulted in the release of 1446 CO2
   kg ha(-1) into the atmosphere. This underscores the fact that burning of
   biomass as a land preparation method may not be sustainable when viewed
   against the backdrop that the African continent encompasses the most
   vulnerable regions and populations for current climate variability. This
   study is significant in that it is the first to shed light on the
   effects of burning on soil carbon in the coastal savanna ecosystem of
   Ghana and would potentially provide the impetus for further research.

   Review},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Solar energy, amongst all renewable energies, has attracted
   inexhaustible attention all over the world as a supplier of sustainable
   energy. The energy requirement of major seawater desalination processes
   such as multistage flash (MSF), multi-effect distillation (MED) and
   reverse osmosis (RO) are fulfilled by burning fossil fuels, which impact
   the environment significantly due to the emission of greenhouse gases.
   The integration of solar energy systems into seawater desalination
   processes is an attractive and alternative solution to fossil fuels.
   This study aims to (i) assess the progress of solar energy systems
   including concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV) to power
   both thermal and membrane seawater desalination processes including MSF,
   MED, and RO and (ii) evaluate the economic considerations and associated
   challenges with recommendations for further improvements. Thus, several
   studies on a different combination of seawater desalination processes of
   solar energy systems are reviewed and analysed concerning specific
   energy consumption and freshwater production cost. It is observed that
   although solar energy systems have the potential of reducing carbon
   footprint significantly, the cost of water production still favours the
   use of fossil fuels. Further research and development on solar energy
   systems are required to make their use in desalination economically
   viable. Alternatively, the carbon tax on the use of fossil fuels may
   persuade desalination industries to adopt renewable energy such as
   solar.},

   an alternative energy sources, which are environmentally benign, are
   comprehensively discussed and reviewed. Based on the literature,
   employing nanotechnology enhances the heat transfer rate in
   photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems and modifies PV structures, which
   can improve its performance, making fuel cells much cost-effective and
   improving the performance of biofuel industry through utilization of

Abstract = {In remote sites (north Canada, islands...); diesel generators are used
   to produce electricity. This method is relatively inefficient, very
   expensive and responsible for the emission of large amounts of
   greenhouse gases. The development and use of a wind-solar-diesel-battery
   hybrid system will eliminate the main barriers to the deployment of
   renewable energy in remote locations and decrease production costs. The
   originality of this system consist in optimizing its overall performance
   by designing an intelligent algorithm and optimized strategy for power
   flow management which meet the operational constraints and the user's
   requirement. The main objective of this study is to determine the most
   efficient operation strategy for the power supply of isolated sites.
   This strategy should be characterized by an ability to reduce the use of
   diesel generator and integrate optimally the renewable resources while
   providing a significant reduction in fuel consumption and the emission
   of greenhouse gases. In order to validate the proposed strategies under
   real conditions, measurements of real weather conditions and power
   consumption for the months of February and may 2013 are considered. Once
   the assessment and analysis of results are complete, optimization will
   be done on the best strategy found with varying the number and size of
   the diesel generators. Simulations results are highlighted showing the
   impact of this approach.},

Abstract = {Biomass is the first-ever fuel used by humankind and is also the fuel
   which was the mainstay of the global fuel economy till the middle of the
   18th century. Then fossil fuels took over because fossil fuels were not
   only more abundant and denser in their energy content, but also
   generated less pollution when burnt, in comparison to biomass. In recent
   years there is a resurgence of interest in biomass energy because
   biomass is perceived as a carbon-neutral source of energy unlike net
   carbon-emitting fossil fuels of which copious use has led to global
   warming and ocean acidification.
   The paper takes stock of the various sources of biomass and the possible
   ways in which it can be utilized for generating energy. It then examines
   the environmental impacts, including impact vis a vis greenhouse gas
   emissions. of different biomass energy generation-utilization options.

Title = {Leveraging the potential of nature to meet net zero greenhouse gas
   emissions in Washington State},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {The State of Washington, USA, has set a goal to reach net zero
   greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the year around which the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommended we must
   limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C above that of pre-industrial times
   or face catastrophic changes. We employed existing approaches to
   calculate the potential for a suite of Natural Climate Solution (NCS)
   pathways to reduce Washington's net emissions under three implementation
   scenarios: Limited, Moderate, and Ambitious. We found that NCS could
   reduce emissions between 4.3 and 8.8 MMT CO(2)e(yr-1) in thirty-one
   years, accounting for 4\% to 9\% of the State's net zero goal. These
   potential reductions largely rely on changing forest management
   practices on portions of private and public timber lands. We also mapped
   the distribution of each pathway's Ambitious potential emissions
   reductions by county, revealing spatial clustering of high potential
   reductions in three regions closely tied to major business sectors:
   private industrial forestry in southwestern coastal forests, cropland
   agriculture in the Columbia Basin, and urban and rural development in
   the Puget Trough. Overall, potential emissions reductions are provided
   largely by a single pathway, Extended Timber Harvest Rotations, which
   mostly clusters in southwestern counties. However, mapping distribution
   of each of the other pathways reveals wider distribution of each
   pathway's unique geographic relevance to support fair, just, and
   efficient deployment. Although the relative potential for a single
   pathway to contribute to statewide emissions reductions may be small,
   they could provide co-benefits to people, communities, economies, and
   nature for adaptation and resiliency across the state.},

Title = {Investigating flood resilience perceptions and supporting collective
   decision-making through fuzzy cognitive mapping},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {837},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Improving flood resilience of communities requires a holistic
   understanding of risks and resilience options as well as the preferences
   and priorities of different stakeholders. Innovations in risk and
   resilience assessment have helped communities to identify gaps in their
   flood risk management strategy but selecting and implementing resilience
   solutions remains a big challenge for many decision-makers. In addition
   to traditional appraisals and cost-benefit assessments this also calls
   for a participatory process in which various stakeholders are encouraged
   to adopt a system-level approach in identifying interventions that can
   maximise a range of benefits and co-benefits. In this study, we
   investigate how a combination of modelling and measurement methods can
   help decision-makers with their flood resilience strategies. We apply a
   participatory system thinking approach combining Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping
   (FCM) with a flood resilience measurement framework called Flood
   Resilience Measurement for Communities (FRMC). We first investigate
   stakeholders' biases on flood resilience interventions, and then lead
   them through a system thinking exercise using FCM and FRMC to elicit
   mental models representing important aspects of flood resilience and
   their interrelation. These are then aggregated, representing the
   collective perceptions and knowledge of stakeholders, and used to
   identify the most beneficial resilience actions in terms of direct and
   indirect impacts on flood resilience. We apply this approach to the case
   of Lowestoft, a coastal town in England exposed to significant flood
   risk. Developed in close collaboration with the local authorities, the
   ambition is to support decision-making on flood resilience
   interventions. We find that this combination of methods enables
   system-level thinking and inclusive decision-making about flood
   resilience which can ultimately encourage transformative decisions on
   prioritization of actions and investments.},

Title = {Modelling large-scale carbon dioxide injection into the Bunter Sandstone
   in the UK Southern North Sea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {220-233},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Bunter Sandstone in the UK sector of the Southern North Sea Basin is
   a reservoir rock that is typically 200 m or more thick and has variable
   but commonly fair to good porosity and permeability. East of the Dowsing
   Fault Zone it is folded into a number of large periclines as a result of
   post-depositional halokinesis in the underlying Zechstein salt. It is
   sealed by the overlying Haisborough Group and younger fine-grained
   strata and is underlain by the Bunter Shale and Zechstein Group. As such
   it appears to be an attractive target for industrial-scale CO2 storage.
   However, the very large masses of CO2 that would have to be injected and
   stored if CCS is to be an effective greenhouse gas mitigation option are
   likely to cause (a) significant pore fluid pressure rise and (b)
   displacement of formation brines from the reservoir. A series of
   reservoir flow simulations of large-scale CO2 injection was carried out
   to investigate these effects. A simple, 3D geocellular model of the
   Bunter Sandstone in the NE part of the UK sector of the Southern North
   Sea was constructed in the TOUGH2 reservoir simulator in which porosity
   and both horizontal and vertical permeability could be varied. The
   injection of CO2 at various rates into the model through a variable
   number of wells for 50 years was simulated and the model was then run
   forward for up to 3000 years to see how pore fluid pressures, brine
   displacement and CO2 distribution evolved. The simulations suggest that
   provided there is good connectivity within the reservoir, and 12
   optimally distributed injection locations are used, 15-20 million tonnes
   of CO2 per year could be stored in the modelled area without the
   reservoir pore pressure exceeding 75\% of the lithostatic pressure
   anywhere within the model. However, significant fluxes of the native
   pore fluid (saline brine) to the sea occurred at a point where the
   Bunter Sandstone crops out at the seabed. This suggests that the
   potential environmental impacts of brine displacement to the sea floor
   should be investigated. The injected CO2 fills only up to about 1\% of
   the total pore space within the model. This indicates that pore fluid
   pressure rise may be a greater constraint on CO2 storage capacity than
   physical containment within the storage reservoir. (C) 2012 Natural

Abstract = {We examined both long-term climate variability and anthropogenic
   contributions to current climate change for Xinjiang province of
   northwest China. Xinjiang encompasses several mountain ranges and
   inter-mountain basins and is comprised of a northern semiarid region and
   a more arid southern region. Climate over the last three centuries was
   reconstructed from tree rings and temperature series were calculated for
   the past 50 years using weather station data. Three major conclusions
   from these analyses are: (1) Although temperature varied considerably in
   Xinjiang over the last 200 years, it was non-directional until the last
   50 years when a substantial warming trend occurred; (2) The semiarid
   North Xinjiang was representative of the northern hemisphere climate,
   while the more arid South Xinjiang resembled the southern hemisphere
   climate, meanwhile, (3) The entire Xinjiang province captured the
   global-scale climate signal. We also compared human contributions to
   global change between North and South Xinjiang, including land
   cover/land use, population, and greenhouse gas production. For both
   regions, urban areas acted as heat islands; and large areas of grassland
   and forest were converted to barren land, especially in North Xinjiang.
   Additionally, North Xinjiang also showed larger increase in population
   and greenhouse gas emissions mainly associated with animal production
   than those in South Xinjiang. Although Xinjiang province is a
   geographically coupled mountain-basin system, the two regions have
   distinct climate patterns and anthropogenic activities related to land
   cover conversion and greenhouse gas production.},

   increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and/or
   sulfate aerosols using the data generated in a set of numerical
   experiments performed with a range of coupled atmosphere-ocean global
   climate models. Five of the 7 models considered in our validation
   exercise are found to have fair skill as regards their ability to
   simulate the broad features of present-day observed surface
   climatological features over the SIS in the Indian Ocean, the
   Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The
   transient experiments with these models, which include the time-varying
   future anthropogenic radiative forcings, have been used here to develop
   regional projections of future climate change. An area-averaged annual
   mean warming of ca 2degreesC or higher for the 2050s and ca 3degreesC or
   higher for the 2080s are projected for the SIS as a consequence of
   increases in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. In general,
   seasonal variations of the projected surface warming over the SIS are
   minimal. No significant change in diurnal temperature range is likely
   with an increase in surface temperatures. An increase in mean
   temperature would be accompanied by an increase in the frequency of
   extremely high temperatures. The aerosol forcing will only marginally
   reduce the surface warming. The models simulate only a marginal change
   (<10\%) in annual mean rainfall over most of the SIS, During the
   northern hemisphere summer, however, rainfall is projected to decline
   (except over Pacific Ocean islands). An increase in daily rainfall
   intensity leading to more heavy rainfall events is also projected. The
   projected changes in temperature and rainfall could disrupt the
   terrestrial and marine ecosystems in most SIS. An integrated study of
   vulnerability assessment for SIS based on a better understanding of the
   precise magnitude of increase in surface air temperature and associated
   sea level rise is warranted for developing appropriate adaptation
   strategies.},

Title = {The benefits of coastal adaptation through conservation of foreshore
   vegetation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Due to rising sea levels and projected socio-economic change, global
   coastal flood risk is expected to increase in the future. To reduce this
   increase in risk, one option is to reduce the probability or magnitude
   of the hazard through the implementation of structural, Nature-based or
   hybrid adaptation measures. Nature-based Solutions in coastal areas have
   the potential to reduce impacts of climate change and can provide a more
   sustainable and cost-effective alternative to structural measures. In
   this paper, we present the first global scale assessment of the benefits
   of conserving foreshore vegetation as a means of adaptation to future
   projections of change in coastal flood risk. In doing so, we extend the
   current knowledge on the economic feasibility of implementing global
   scale Nature-based Solutions. We show that globally foreshore vegetation
   can contribute to a large decrease in both absolute and relative flood
   risk (13\% of present-day and 8.5\% of future conditions in 2080 of
   global flood risk). Although this study gives a first proxy of the flood
   risk reduction benefits of conserving foreshore vegetation at the global
   scale, it shows promising results for including Nature-based and hybrid
   adaptation measures in coastal adaptation schemes.},

Title = {Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and land use:
   Lessons from West Coast states},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {343-366},
Abstract = {Planners and policymakers in the United States increasingly recognize
   climate change as a critical challenge. Because the transportation
   sector accounts for one-third of ail greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs)
   linked to climate change, some states-including California, Oregon, and
   Washington-have passed legislation to reduce GHGs from transportation.
   Much of the work to date has focused on modeling impacts and evaluating
   performance of different strategies. Instead, this paper focuses on
   policy adoption and implementation. This research relies on document
   analysis and stakeholder interviews to examine state efforts to reduce
   GHGs by examining goals, plans, actions, and results. While these states
   have ail established statutory goals to reduce GHGs, planning,
   implementation, and monitoring vary across states. California and Oregon
   rely on state- and metropolitan-level planning, while Washington relies
   on a state approach. California has enacted funding programs to
   implement strategies to achieve reductions and worked to reduce
   regulatory barriers to compact development. All states monitor levels of
   GHGs, but the impact of plans is often unexamined. Though West Coast
   states have taken initial steps to enact goals and require scenario
   plans, states must provide funding or regulatory relief while improving
   monitoring in order to achieve ambitious goals to reduce GHGs from
   transportation.},

Abstract = {Abrupt climate change, such as could occur with significant thermohaline
   circulation (THC) weakening, appears throughout the palaeoclimate record
   and in many model experiments. We examine potential responses of
   ecosystem structure and function to the combined influence of THC
   collapse and greenhouse gas increase in Central England using a broad
   range of temperature scenarios. We demonstrate that biological
   communities in the North Atlantic region could be heavily influenced by
   THC collapse, but that the pattern of ecosystem responses depends upon
   the seasonal pattern of temperature changes. Plausible THC collapse
   scenarios threaten the remnant habitat fragments, upon which much of
   England's remaining biodiversity depends, by causing shifts away from
   the currently dominant temperate broadleaf cold deciduous tree type.
   Furthermore, some ecosystem responses, particularly of energy
   partitioning between sensible and latent heat fluxes, constitute
   potentially substantial feedbacks to the local climate system. However,
   accurate assessment of biotic responses to THC collapse requires far
   better confidence of the resulting seasonal temperature cycle than
   climate models currently provide.},

Abstract = {A self-management approach and committee were established in Taichung
   Port to facilitate the control of the total quantity of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) and air pollutant emissions from various sources in the port
   district. This self-management approach was the first approved case by
   the Environmental Protection Bureau of Taichung City. The district has a
   land area of 37.93 km(2) and a sea area of 2035.75 km(2), and it is
   divided into various zones, namely heavy industry, export processing,
   and harbor zones according to the difference of based on differences in
   land use. The approach includes an inventory and actions to reduce
   carbon levels and air pollutants. The year 2014 was defined as the base
   year of emissions; however, some of the emission benchmark values were
   changed in 2015 or 2016 because more accurate inventory results became
   available during those years. A self-management committee comprising a
   general manager, departmental directors, and experts/scholars was formed
   in 2015. In the self-management approach, nine main reduction strategies
   and three actions to offset GHG and air pollutants were continually
   enforced. The results demonstrate that the environmental protection to
   facilitate the development of a green port is workable. Following the
   successful experience of Taichung Port, the self-management method was
   adopted in other industries and areas in Taichung City, a special

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of integrated assessment of climate change is to put
   available knowledge together in order to evaluate what has been learned,
   policy implications, and research needs. This paper summarizes insights
   gained from five years of integrated assessment activity at Carnegie
   Mellon. After an introduction, in Section 2 we ask: who are the climate
   decision makers? We conclude that they are a diffuse and often divergent
   group spread all over the world whose decisions are primarily driven by
   local non-climate considerations. Insights are illustrated with results
   from the ICAM-2 model. In Section 3 we ask: what is the climate problem?
   In addition to the conventional answer, we note that in a democracy the
   problem is whatever voters and their elected representatives think it
   is. Results from studies of public understanding are reported. Several
   other specific issues that define the problem, including the treatment
   of aerosols and alternative indices for comparing greenhouse gases, are
   discussed. In Section 4 we discuss studies of climate impacts, focusing
   on coastal zones, the terrestrial biosphere and human health. Particular
   attention is placed on the roles of adaptation, value change, and
   technological innovation. In Section 5 selected policy issues are
   discussed. We conclude by noting that equity has received too little
   attention in past work. We argue that many conventional tools for policy
   analysis are not adequate to deal with climate problems. Values that
   change, and mixed levels of uncertainty, pose particularly important
   challenges for the future.},

Abstract = {Managing and mitigating the global expansion of toxic cyanobacterial
   harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) is a major challenge facing researchers
   and water resource managers. Various approaches, including nutrient load
   reduction, artificial mixing and flushing, omnivorous fish removal,
   algaecide applications and sediment dredging, have been used to reduce
   bloom occurrences. However, managers now face the additional challenge
   of having to address the effects of climate change on watershed
   hydrological and nutrient load dynamics, water temperature, mixing
   regime and internal nutrient cycling. Rising temperatures and increasing
   frequencies and magnitudes of extreme weather events, including tropical
   cyclones, extratropical storms, floods and droughts, all promote
   CyanoHABs and affect the efficacy of ecosystem remediation measures.
   These climatic changes will likely require setting stricter nutrient
   (including both nitrogen and phosphorus) reduction targets for bloom
   control in affected waters. In addition, the efficacy of currently used
   methods to reduce CyanoHABs will need to be re-evaluated in light of the
   synergistic effects of climate change with nutrient enrichment.},

Abstract = {Climate change is already impacting fisheries with species moving across
   fishing areas, crossing institutional borders, and thus creating
   conflicts over fisheries management. In this scenario, scholars agree
   that adaptation to climate change requires that fisheries increase their
   social, institutional, and ecological resilience. The resilience or
   capacity of a fishery to be maintained without shifting to a different
   state (e.g., collapse) is at stake under climate change impacts and
   overexploitation. Despite this urgent need, applying the resilience
   concept in a spatially explicit and quantitative manner to inform policy
   remains unexplored. We take a resilience approach and operationalize the
   concept in industrial fisheries for two species that have been observed
   to significantly shift distribution in European waters: hake (Merluccius
   merluccius) and cod (Gadus morhua), in the context of the European Union
   institutional settings. With a set of resilience factors from the
   literature and by means of contemporary and historic data, we select
   indicators that are combined into an index that measures resilience on
   the ecologic, socioeconomic, and institutional dimensions of the
   fishery. We find that the resilience index varies among species and
   countries, with lower resilience levels in the socioeconomic dimension
   of the fisheries. We also see that resilience largely depends on the
   overexploitation status of the fishery. The results highlight the need
   to address social and institutional settings to enhance fisheries
   adaptation to climate change and allow to inform on climate resilient
   adaptation pathways for the fisheries.},

Title = {The substitution of marginal oil with biofuels},

Abstract = {Our report analyzes the substitution of marginal oil with biofuels. For
   that, we evaluate the effects that influence the substitution process in
   the short, mid and long term. We identify OPEC, resource nationalism,
   and geopolitical issues as important influence factors and arrive at the
   conclusion that in the short term biofuels will replace mainly OPEC oil
   but not the most expensive petroleum. In the medium and long term
   biofuels will replace the most expensive petroleum because OPEC
   production cuts are only possible on a temporary basis and in restricted
   quantities. Our comparison of the costs of the different fossil fuels
   with their greenhouse gas emissions shows that there is no direct
   correlation between the level of greenhouse gas emissions and production
   costs. However, we see strong evidence every time that the marginal oil
   gets more carbon-intensive and that biofuels will increasingly displace
   these carbon-intensive fossil fuels. That is shown especially in the
   increase of unconventional fossil fuels and new frontier oil (Amazon,
   deep-sea, etc.). The investments in these technologies are very
   price-sensitive, like the financial crisis 2008/2009 has showed. Further
   evidence brings the decline of the energy return on investment (EROI) of
   the oil production worldwide and the increase of the marginal oil costs
   from 25 to almost 100 dollars/barrel in the last 10years. We expect that
   the increase of the carbon intensity of marginal oil will further
   enlarge the climate effects of global petroleum production. Marginal oil
   as an indirect effect of the biofuel use should therefore get the same
   significance value as indirect land-use change (ILUC) in the current
   climate protection debate. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and

Title = {Identifying the Salinity Thresholds that Impact Greenhouse Gas
   Production in Subtropical Tidal Freshwater Marsh Soils},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {559-571},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Increasing salinity due to sea level rise is an important factor
   influencing biogeochemical processes in estuarine wetlands, with the
   potential to impact greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there is
   little consensus regarding what salinity thresholds will significantly
   alter the production of GHGs or the physiochemical properties of wetland
   soils. This study used a fine-scale salinity gradient to determine the
   impact of seawater concentration on the potential production of CH4, CO2
   and N2O and associated soil properties using bottle incubations of tidal
   freshwater marsh soils from the Min River estuary, SE China. Potential
   CH4 production was unaffected by salinities from 0 to 7.5 parts per
   thousand, but declined significantly at 10 parts per thousand and above.
   Potential CO2 production was stimulated at intermediate salinities (5 to
   7.5 parts per thousand), but inhibited by salinities >= 15 parts per
   thousand, while potential N2O production was unaffected by salinity. In
   contrast, soil dissolved organic carbon and NH4+-N generally increased
   with salinity. Overall, this research indicates salinities of similar to
   10-15\% represent an important tipping point for biogeochemical
   processes in wetlands. Above this threshold, carbon mineralization is
   reduced and may promote vertical soil accretion in brackish and salinity
   wetlands. Meanwhile, low-level saltwater intrusion may leave wetlands
   vulnerable to submergence due to accelerated soil organic carbon loss.},

Abstract = {This study examines greenhouse gas emissions for 2005-2015 from seawater
   desalination in Australia, using conventional energies. We developed a
   tailor-made multi-regional input-output-model. We complemented
   macroeconomic top-down data with plant-specific desalination data of the
   largest 20 desalination plants in Australia. The analysed capacity
   cumulates to 95\% of Australia's overall seawater desalination capacity.
   We considered the construction and the operation of desalination plants.
   We measure not only direct effects, but also indirect effects throughout
   the entire value chain. Our results show the following: We identify the
   state of Victoria with the highest emissions due to capital and
   operational expenditures (capex and opex). The contribution of the
   upstream value chain to total greenhouse gas emissions increases for
   capex and decreases for opex. For capex, the construction of intake and
   outfall is the driving factor for carbon emissions. For opex,
   electricity consumption is the decisive input factor. Both in
   construction and operation, we identify the critical role of the
   electricity sector for carbon emissions throughout the supply chain
   effects. The sector contributes 69\% during the zenith of the
   construction phase and 96\% during the operating phase to the entire
   emissions. We estimate the total emissions for 2015 at 1193 kt CO(2)e.},

Title = {Threatened protection: Sea level rise and coastal protected lands of the
   eastern United States},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {118-130},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Federal, state, and local governments in the United States, along with
   land trusts and other nonprofit organizations, have invested significant
   financial resources in protection of natural lands in coastal areas. As
   the climate changes, protected lands could provide increased resilience
   to coastal communities, yet climate change also poses a threat to the
   continued existence and healthy functioning of these ecosystems. The
   objectives of this research are to characterize the distribution and
   types of coastal protected lands in the eastern United States, estimate
   their exposure to sea level rise, evaluate the potential impact of this
   exposure on associated ecosystem services, and then discuss appropriate
   adaptation measures. For this, we construct an inventory of coastal
   protected lands in shoreline counties of US states along the Atlantic.
   We summarize their ownership and land cover and evaluate their exposure
   to a 3-foot (0.91 m) rise in sea level. We find substantial variation in
   the amount of lands protected in coastal shoreline counties, from a high
   of 34 percent in Florida to a low of 7 percent in Pennsylvania. Federal
   ownership is greatest in the South, whereas state ownership dominates in
   the Mid-Atlantic. Private groups own large shares of protected lands in
   Maine, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Maryland. Moving south, dominant
   land covers in protected areas shift from forests to wetlands. We find
   that one quarter of protected lands in shoreline counties will be
   affected by 3 feet of sea level rise, with substantial heterogeneity in
   exposure across states and greater impacts in southern states. Almost 50
   percent of federal lands and around 25 percent of state lands will be
   affected. While substantial proportions of estuarine wetlands and
   unconsolidated shore (beaches and dunes) are currently protected and
   provide key coastal ecosystem services, 95 and 91 percent of these
   protected systems, respectively, will be affected by 3 feet of sea level
   rise. We discuss the potential consequences and the associated
   reductions in ecosystem service provisioning from sea level rise in the
   context of current funding and adaptation planning for conservation. We
   find that some of the states facing the greatest challenges art those
   lacking plans and funding. The large heterogeneity in ownership, land
   covers, and funding across states suggests that adaptation policies for
   coastal protected lands will need to be tailored to the local context; a
   one-size fits-all approach is unlikely to be as effective. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {The heat transported northwards by the North Atlantic thermohaline
   circulation warms the climate of western Europe(1-3) previous model
   studies(4-6) have suggested that the circulation is sensitive to
   increases in atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations, but such models
   have been criticised for the use of unphysical `flux adjustments' (7-9)
   (artificial corrections that keep the model from drifting to unrealistic
   states), and for their inability to simulate deep-water formation both
   north and south of the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge, as seen in
   observations(10,11), Here we present simulations of today's thermohaline
   circulation using a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model
   without flux adjustments, These simulations compare well with the
   observed thermohaline circulation, including the formation of deep water
   on each side of the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge. The model responds
   to forcing with increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations by
   a collapse of the circulation and convection in the Labrador Sea, while
   the deep-water formation north of the ridge remains stable. These
   changes are similar in two simulations with different rates of increase
   of CO(2) concentrations. The effects of increasing atmospheric
   greenhouse-gas concentrations that we simulate are potentially
   observable, suggesting that it is possible to set up an oceanic
   monitoring system for the detection of anthropogenic influence on ocean
   circulation.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Coastal agriculture and livelihoods worldwide are highly vulnerable to
   changing climates, and Bangladesh is no exception due to its geophysical
   location. This paper examines rice farmers' vulnerability, adaptation
   strategies, and adaptation barriers to managing climate change impacts
   in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Survey data were collected from 220
   randomly selected rice farmers located across two coastal districts of
   Bangladesh. A multinomial logit model was applied to analyze
   determinants of adaptation strategies of rice farmers. The results
   reveal that flood is the main risk to vulnerability, followed by
   cyclones and storms surges and saline intrusion. The main adaptation
   strategies are cultivating flood and salinity tolerant rice varieties,
   direct seeding of rice, supplementary irrigation, cultivation of
   non-rice crops that have shorter growth duration, and rearing of
   livestock, poultry, and duck. The econometric analysis shows that
   factors such as household head's education, household income, farm size,
   access to information, and extension services significantly influence
   the choice of adaptation strategies of the rice farmers. We recommend to
   increase investment in research, training of farmers, and targeted
   extension services to disseminate climate-smart technologies and
   information for minimising vulnerability of the farmers.},

Title = {Restoring for the climate: a review of coastal wetland restoration
   research in the last 30 years},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Wetlands provide significant ecosystem services yet are ranked among
   some of the most imperiled habitats. To maximize prioritization of these
   habitats a better understanding of the full range of ecosystem functions
   is needed, starting with an examination of how coastal wetlands have
   been portrayed in restoration literature to date. This study consists of
   a literature review and the use of automated topic analyses aimed at (1)
   summarizing the current research related to coastal wetland restoration,
   (2) identifying the key fields of research, and (3) identifying research
   efforts connecting restoration and climate adaptation strategies (e.g.
   blue carbon). Of the 702 papers sourced for this analysis, most studies
   were conducted in North America and Europe. An increase in articles
   considering wetland restoration was found from 1985 to October 2020,
   with 40\% of the research published just in the last triennia
   (2018-2020). Topic division highlights the emergence of studies related
   to management under climate change (e.g. sea level rise, adaptive
   management) and to carbon sequestration as separate fields of research
   from classical ecological studies. This reveals the need to ensure that
   classical ecological research is not neglected by work relating to
   climate strategies, which depend upon an accurate understanding of
   ecological processes.},

Abstract = {The Arctic is experiencing rapid climate change in response to changes
   in greenhouse gases, aerosols, and other climate drivers. Emission
   changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and
   transport pathways of short-lived climate forcers, make it necessary to
   understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the
   Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, 10 global
   climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2,
   CH4, the solar constant, black carbon, and SO4). We show that the annual
   mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the
   global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between
   climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 ( an intermodel standard deviation of
   0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum
   amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal
   temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through
   similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except black carbon. For all
   drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change
   is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the
   Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce
   a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers,
   particularly compared to CO2.},

Title = {Rotational grazing and multispecies herbal leys increase productivity in
   temperate pastoral systems-A meta-analysis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {337},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with ruminant livestock
   production is important for climate change mitigation. Regenerative
   Agriculture (RA) practices are increasingly promoted to improve forage
   pro-duction and livestock performance in temperate livestock systems.
   These practices include i) rotational grazing (RG) of livestock around
   multiple subunits of pasture to achieve ungrazed periods of `rest', and
   ii) herbal leys (HL), where perennial forbs such as chicory, lucerne and
   trefoils are included as components in multi-species swards. While there
   are plausible mechanisms for adoption of these practices to improve
   agricultural productivity, quantitative syntheses of their impacts are
   required. Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta -analysis of the
   effects of RG and HL practices on herbage dry matter (DM) production,
   animal daily live -weight gain (DLWG), and sheep wool growth in
   temperate oceanic regions. We use quantitative predictors in our
   Bayesian hierarchical models to investigate the role of rest period and
   stocking density in RG systems, and specific plant traits and sward
   diversity in HL. We found that herbage DM increased by 0.31 t.ha(-1)
   over a growing season as the proportion of rest in an RG grazing system
   increased from 0 to 1. Stocking density significantly moderated the
   effect of rest period on sheep and cattle DLWG; at higher stocking
   densities, longer rest periods were required to maintain livestock
   growth rates. In HL studies, herbage DM yielded 1.63 t.ha(-1) more per
   metre of increased sward root depth and a sward entirely comprised of
   legumes yielded 2.20 t.ha(-1) more than when no legumes were present.
   Sheep DLWG increased by 3.50 g.day(-1) per unit increase in leaf
   nitrogen concentration (mg.g(-1)), but we could not determine an effect
   of leaf condensed tannin content on animal performance. Although there
   remain differences between the RG and HL study treatments meta-analysed
   here and RA in practice, our results provide empirical support for some
   of the mechanisms attributed to increased pasture and livestock
   productivity following adoption of selected RA grazing practices.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {This study compares Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) emissions as CO2 equivalent
   per one kilowatt-hour of two types of renewable power generation
   technologies (solar and wind) compared to other traditional power
   generation technologies through life cycle assessment methods. Related
   to Global Warming Potential (GWP), the produced quantities of GHGs of
   each generation method vary through the lifecycle. For wind and solar
   power, the release of GHGs reached between 70 and 98\% during
   manufacturing (including raw materials) and decommissioning. The
   recycling stage may play a crucial role in decreasing the impact of GHGs
   by up to 40\%. -Adopting emissions calculated by the Life Cycle Approach
   (LCA) with electrical generation from solar and wind ways allows a fair
   comparison per (CO2) eq/ KWh basis and factors affecting each LCA stage.
   For the two studied systems, wind power emits the least amount of (CO2)
   eq/ KWh, with average values of 13.91 and 12.7 g CO2eq/kWh for offshore
   and onshore farms, respectively. While photovoltaic has the highest
   contribution to GHGs emissions, with a mean value of 23.39 g for CdTe,
   it is followed by 33.14, 39.93, 43.84,49.33, 50.76 for a-Si, m-Si, CIGs,
   CIS and sc-Si g (CO2) eq/ KWh, respectively. Concentrated Solar Power
   (CSP) occupied the medium contribution of 35.6 g for the tower and 30.94
   g (CO2) eq/ KWh for the trough. Compared to fossil fuel-fired systems,
   the average (CO2) eq/ KWh is 936 g for coal-fired, 730 g for oil, and
   502 for gas-fired power systems. Replacing one kilowatt-hour of coal or
   oil-generated electricity with one kilowatt-hour of wind power can save
   up to 923 or 716 g (CO2) eq/ kWh.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2377-2382},

Abstract = {Recent research indicates that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dry
   aquatic sediments are a relevant process in the freshwater carbon cycle.
   However, fluxes are difficult to measure because of the often rocky
   substrate and the dynamic nature of the habitat. Here we tested the
   performance of different materials to seal a closed chamber to stony
   ground both in laboratory and field experiments. Using on-site material
   consistently resulted in elevated fluxes. The artefact was caused both
   by outgassing of the material and production of gas. The magnitude of
   the artefact was site dependent - the measured CO2 flux increased
   between 10 and 208 \%. Errors due to incomplete sealing proved to be
   more severe than errors due to non-inert sealing material.
   Pottery clay as sealing material provided a tight seal between the
   chamber and the ground and no production of gases was detected. With
   this approach it is possible to get reliable gas fluxes from
   hard-substrate sites without using a permanent collar. Our test
   experiments confirmed that CO2 fluxes from dry aquatic sediments are
   similar to CO2 fluxes from terrestrial soils.},

Abstract = {While it is well understood that thermal expansion dominates global mean
   steric sea level rise, climate models show large differences in spatial
   patterns. This study aims to decompose regional steric sea level rise in
   the North Atlantic into thermal and saline effects in a fully coupled
   model. In contrast to other studies we focus on the differences between
   two climate change scenarios and establish a link between the sea level
   changes and the differences in the response of the overturning
   circulation. While overturning is reduced in the phase of the greenhouse
   gas increase, differences between the scenarios are not significant
   until the stabilization in the 22nd century. The influence from
   thermosteric and halosteric contributions on the meridional density
   gradient is of the same size during the increase of greenhouse gas
   concentrations. The haline effect becomes prominent afterwards, reducing
   the meridional density gradient and preventing the overturning from
   recovery. Citation: Korper, J., T. Spangehl, U. Cubasch, and H. Huebener

Title = {Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Utility-Scale Wind Power},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {S136-S154},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A systematic review and harmonization of life cycle assessment (LCA)
   literature of utility-scale wind power systems was performed to
   determine the causes of and, where possible, reduce variability in
   estimates of life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Screening of
   approximately 240 LCAs of onshore and offshore systems yielded 72
   references meeting minimum thresholds for quality, transparency, and
   relevance. Of those, 49 references provided 126 estimates of life cycle
   GHG emissions. Published estimates ranged from 1.7 to 81 grams
   CO2-equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh), with median and
   interquartile range (IQR) both at 12 g CO2-eq/kWh. After adjusting the
   published estimates to use consistent gross system boundaries and values
   for several important system parameters, the total range was reduced by
   47\% to 3.0 to 45 g CO2-eq/kWh and the IQR was reduced by 14\% to 10 g
   CO2-eq/kWh, while the median remained relatively constant (11 g
   CO2-eq/kWh). Harmonization of capacity factor resulted in the largest
   reduction in variability in life cycle GHG emission estimates. This
   study concludes that the large number of previously published life cycle
   GHG emission estimates of wind power systems and their tight
   distribution suggest that new process-based LCAs of similar wind turbine
   technologies are unlikely to differ greatly. However, additional
   consequential LCAs would enhance the understanding of true life cycle
   GHG emissions of wind power (e.g., changes to other generators
   operations when wind electricity is added to the grid), although even
   those are unlikely to fundamentally change the comparison of wind to
   other electricity generation sources.},

Abstract = {To investigate mangroves of different land use types in Nansha county,
   China, we analyzed the corresponding N2O and CH4 emissions, water

   potential, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia nitrogen, and organic matter at
   five sites. The removal rates of NO2-, NO3-, and NH4+ in mangrove
   wetlands were 43.6\%, 41.2\%, and 65.0\%; however, CH4 and N2O emissions
   of mangrove affected by shrimp ponds are 2-3 times and 3-9 times more
   high than other wetlands. These results showed that, although mangrove
   wetlands can significantly reduce N, P, and other nutrient elements in
   shrimp pond wastewater, they can also significantly increase N2O and CH4
   emissions. This indicates that mangrove wetlands should be used with
   caution for the treatment of shrimp pond wastewater.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses profit, cost and emissions for slender bulk vessel
   designs. Traditionally bulk vessels have been designed to maximize cargo
   carrying ability at the lowest building cost and not on reducing energy
   consumption. The outcome has been shoebox shaped vessels with short bow
   sections and hence rather poor hydrodynamic performance even at calm sea
   and even worse in rough sea. High fuel costs and the mandatory energy
   efficiency design index, as well as increased environmental concerns
   have challenged this practice. The present paper provides an assessment
   of alternative bulk vessel with focus on hull slenderness, expressed by
   the length block coefficient for alternative fuel price and freight rate
   scenarios. Our results indicate that slender designs reduce emissions
   and increases the profit compared to the traditional full bodied
   designs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As society continues advancing into the future, more energy is required
   to supply the increasing population and energy demands. Unfortunately,
   traditional forms of energy production through the burning of
   carbon-based fuels are dumping harmful pollutants into the environment,
   resulting in detrimental, and possibly irreversible, effects on our
   planet. The burning of coal and fossil fuels provides energy at the
   least monetary cost for countries like the US, but the price being paid
   through their negative impact of our atmosphere is difficult to
   quantify. A rapid shift to clean, alternative energy sources is critical
   in order to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
   For alternative energy sources to replace traditional energy sources
   that produce greenhouse gases, they must be capable of providing energy
   at equal or greater rates and efficiencies, while still functioning at
   competitive prices. The main factors hindering the pursuit of
   alternative sources are their high initial costs and, for some,
   intermittency. The creation of electrical energy from natural sources
   like wind, water, and solar is very desirable since it produces no
   greenhouse gases and makes use of renewable sources-unlike fossil fuels.
   However, the planning and technology required to tap into these sources
   and transfer energy at the rate and consistency needed to supply our
   society comes at a higher price than traditional methods. These high
   costs are a result of the large-scale implementation of the
   state-of-the-art technologies behind the devices required for energy
   cultivation and delivery from these unorthodox sources.
   On the other hand, as fossil fuel sources become scarcer, the rising
   fuel costs drive overall costs up and make traditional methods less cost
   effective. The growing scarcity of fossil fuels and resulting pollutants
   stimulate the necessity to transition away from traditional energy
   production methods. Currently, the most common alternative energy
   technologies are solar photovoltaics (PVs), concentrated solar power
   (CSP), wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, tidal, wave, and nuclear.
   Because of government intervention in countries like the US and the
   absence of the need to restructure the electricity transmission system
   (due to the similarity in geographical requirements and consistency in
   power outputs for nuclear and traditional plants), nuclear energy is the
   most cost competitive energy technology that does not produce greenhouse
   gases. Through the proper use of nuclear fission electricity at high
   efficiencies could be produced without polluting our atmosphere.
   However, the initial capital required to erect nuclear plants dictates a
   higher cost over traditional methods. Therefore, the government is
   providing help with the high initial costs through loan guarantees, in
   order to stimulate the growth of low-emission energy production.
   This paper analyzes the proposal for the use of nuclear power as an
   intermediate step before an eventual transition to greater dependence on
   energy from wind, water, and solar (WWS) sources. Complete dependence on
   WWS cannot be achieved in the near future, within 20 years, because of
   the unavoidable variability of these sources and the required overhaul
   of the electricity transmission system. Therefore, we look to nuclear
   power in the time being to help provide predictable power as a means to
   reduce carbon emissions, while the other technologies are refined and
   gradually implemented in order to meet energy demand on a consistent
   basis.},

Abstract = {The main engine internal combustion and friction of moving parts
   generate great amount of heat. This heat should be maintained within
   maker temperature thresholds. This is ensured by main engine fresh

   seawater as cooling fluid media. Then the hot seawater is thrown
   overboard ship. The heat generated by friction of the moving parts is
   absorbed by the lubricating oil system. This cooling process represent a
   great heat loss that is originally produced by consumption of fuel oil.
   This leads to the increase of fuel consumption and production of

Abstract = {The Systems Approach Framework is a methodological framework designed to
   enhance the efficacy of human decision-making processes within
   social-ecological systems with regard to sustainability. The objective
   of resilience adaptive management is to either maintain the system
   within the current regime such that the desired ecosystem goods and
   services continue to be delivered, or to move the system phase to a
   preferred regime. Although the objectives of the two frameworks are not
   exactly the same, there are considerable complementarities between them.
   Through application of the Systems Approach Framework in a case study
   regarding the urban beaches of Barcelona, Spain, we present some of the
   main findings revealed during the model construction and stakeholder
   participatory process. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Systems
   Approach Framework could be considered a useful step-by-step
   methodological guide that employs many of the vital components and
   processes of adaptive management.},

Abstract = {Climate change-induced sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, sudden water
   surge, natural calamities, etc. affect the fish biodiversity, food
   security, and coastal livelihoods that highlight the necessities of
   developing climate-resilient strategies e.g. adaptive aquaculture
   techniques. Cage culture of salinity-tolerant fish may be an adaptation
   strategy to compensate for the losses of freshwater fish production by
   climate change in coastal areas. Therefore, a 120-day long field
   experiment was conducted to evaluate the cage culture potentiality of
   Mystus gulio in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Three treatments at
   the stocking density of 90 (T-1), 135 (T-2), and 180 (T-3)/m(2) were
   stocked in nine cages (1.115 m(2)). Significantly (p<0.05) higher growth
   performance and feed utilization were recorded in T-1 followed by T-2
   and T-3. In return, considering overall growth, survival, production,
   coast-benefit analysis, T-2 was found more profitable followed by T-3
   and T-1. This result revealed that the culture of M. gulio in floating
   net cages might be a potential climate-adaptive aquaculture technique in
   the coastal region. However, further research works are necessary for
   optimizing stocking density, nutrition, social acceptance, etc. before
   conclude it as a viable climate-resilient adaptive aquaculture practice.},

Abstract = {Investigating the regional correlation and factors affecting
   agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can help establish a
   regional mechanism for the synergistic reduction of emissions and
   produce chain-like reductions. Different from the traditional
   geographical relationship analysis framework, linear analysis ideas, we
   use social network analysis to discern the regional correlations in
   agricultural GHG emissions from a relational network viewpoint, clarify
   the network functions of each node, and explain agricultural GHG
   correlation from a spatial, economic, and technological viewpoint by
   nonparametric regression. The results indicate that (1) the emission
   network is stable and there is a relationship of control between
   regions, (2) Central China is the most important region in agricultural
   GHG networks; however, the importance of the northwest and southwest has
   increased; the northeast has remained relatively independent, (3)
   influencers are mainly concentrated in the middle of the Yangtze River
   and the northwest, while dependentors are concentrated in municipalities
   such as Beijing and Tianjin, and the coastal regions in the southeast,
   and (4) the interprovincial agricultural GHG correlation can be enhanced
   by shortening the spatial distance, strengthening economic ties, and
   increasing the diffusion of technology. Implementing a
   ``leader-follower{''} strategy according to the role of each region and
   enhancing the intermediator's ``conduit{''} role will ultimately lead to
   the formation of an interprovincial interactive and cooperative emission
   reduction mechanism.},

Title = {Coastal adaptation to climate change through zonation: A review of
   coastal change management areas (CCMAs) in England},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {215},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Climate change and accelerated rates in sea-level rise are expected to
   increase flooding and erosion on the world's coastlines. Coastal
   managers and planners face the challenge of helping communities to adapt
   to the changing coast. Traditionally hard engineering has been used to
   defend communities on the coast, but as this option becomes
   unsustainable and financially unviable, coastal managers are
   increasingly employing planning policy to mitigate the risk posed by
   coastal change. Zonation of coastal change areas and delineation of
   erosion extents, such as set-back lines, are used globally to restrict
   development in the coastal zone. In England there is policy in place to
   allow planning authorities to restrict certain development in areas
   expected to be affected by coastal change. This study aims to examine
   how coastal planning authorities in England have implemented coastal
   change adaptation policies, specifically Coastal Change Management Areas
   (CCMA). These areas should include sections of coast that will
   experience significant change over the next 100 years through erosion,
   accretion or flooding. Through an analysis of planning documents, we
   have found that since the policy was introduced in 2012, only 15\% of
   coastal planning authorities have designated a CCMA, with just 5.7\% of
   the coast of England designated as a CCMA. We have found that inadequate
   and ambiguous guidance has reduced the effectiveness of the national
   policy with coastal planning authorities unsure of which datasets to
   apply for delineating areas of coastal change. This has led to
   vulnerable coastal areas being omitted from CCMAs. The datasets that are
   available for mapping the coastal change areas are found to vary in
   erosion extent and do not account for expected increases in the rate of
   sea-level rise. We suggest that for coastal zonation and climate change
   adaptation policy to be successful, a robust methodology, including a
   classification of coastal typologies and their response to sea level
   rise, is needed to delineate the extent of erosion or coastal change
   over the next 100 years. Understanding and mapping coastal response to
   sea level rise will aid planning authorities to build more resilient
   communities on the coast.},

Title = {An ecosystem approach to kelp aquaculture in the Americas and Europe},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Kelp farming is increasing along the temperate coastlines of the
   Americas and Europe. The economic, ecological, and social frameworks
   surrounding kelp farming in these new areas are in contrast with the
   conditions of progenitor kelp farming regions in China, Japan, and
   Korea.
   Thus, identifying and addressing the environmental and social impacts of
   kelp farming in these regions is vital to ensuring the industry's
   long-term sustainability. Here, a conceptual model of the human and
   natural systems supporting this nascent kelp aquaculture sector was
   developed using Maine, USA as a focal region. Potential negative impacts
   of kelp aquaculture were identified to be habitat degradation,
   overfishing of wild seeds, predation and competition with wild fish and
   genes, and transmission of diseases. Increased food security, improved
   restoration efforts, greater fisheries productivity, and alternative
   livelihoods development were determined to be potential positive impacts
   of kelp aquaculture. Changes in biodiversity and productivity resulting
   from either negative or positive impacts of kelp aquaculture were
   confirmed to have downstream effects on local fisheries and coastal
   communities. Recommendations to improve or protect the ecosystem
   services tangential to kelp farming include: define ecosystem and
   management boundaries, assess ecosystem services and environmental
   carrying capacity, pursue ecologically and socially considerate
   engineering, and protect the health and genetic diversity of wild kelp
   beds. Recommendations to ensure that kelp farming improves the
   well-being of all stakeholders include: increase horizontal expansion,
   expand and teach Best Management Practices, and develop climate change
   resiliency. Additionally, an integrated management strategy should be
   developed for wild and farmed kelp to ensure that kelp aquaculture is
   developed in the context of other sectors and goals.},

   Carbon-Free Island in Korea},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The power industry is rapidly changing as demand for eco-friendly and
   stable power supply increases along with global greenhouse gas emission
   regulations. Small-capacity renewable power sources represented by
   photovoltaics and wind are continuously increasing as a form of
   microgrid to supply electric power to a community or island. As a
   result, microgrids based on renewable resources have come into wide
   usage around small areas or islands in Korea. In particular, the
   microgrid development policy of Korea is focused on electric power
   quality, as well as expansion in renewable energy supply for reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions. From 2009, the government began to develop
   independent carbon-free microgrids with photovoltaic and wind powers
   instead of traditional power diesel generators for small islands. The
   goal of this paper is to investigate a feasible economic microgrid
   topology for implementing the carbon-free island (CFI) under an
   acceptable level of reliability. First, we derive three scenarios of
   power systems including photovoltaics, wind, battery, and fuel cells.
   Next, we assess economic feasibility on top of the power supply
   reliability of the scenarios. Then, we perform a sensitivity test to
   suggest economic conditions for achieving the CFI goals. Finally, we
   present carbon-free-based microgrid models considering the CFI policy of
   Korea.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SCIENCE IN FINLAND},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {235-249},
Abstract = {Future changes in atmospheric composition and consequent global and
   regional climate change are of increasing concern to policy makers,
   planners and the public. However, predictions of these changes are
   uncertain. In the absence of single, firm predictions, the next best
   approach is to identify sets of plausible future conditions termed
   scenarios.
   This paper focuses on the development of climate change scenarios for
   northern high latitude regions. Three methods of scenario development
   can be identified: use of analogues having conditions similar to those
   expected in the study region, application of general circulation me del
   results, and composite methods that combine information from different
   sources. A composite approach has been used to produce scenarios of
   temperature, precipitation, carbon dioxide and sea-level change for
   Finland up to 2100, as part of the Finnish Research Programme on Climate
   Change (SILMU). Tools for applying these scenarios in impact assessment
   studies, including stochastic weather generators and spatial downscaling
   techniques, are also examined.
   The SILMU scenarios attempt to capture uncertainties both in future
   emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere and in
   the global climate response to these emissions. Two types of scenario
   were developed: (i) simple `'policy-oriented'' scenarios and (ii)
   detailed `'scientific'' scenarios. These are compared with new model
   estimates of future climate and recent observed changes in climate over
   certain high latitude regions.},

Title = {Inter-Annual Variability of Area-Scaled Gaseous Carbon Emissions from
   Wetland Soils in the Liaohe Delta, China},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},

Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Global management of wetlands to suppress greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, facilitate carbon (C) sequestration, and reduce atmospheric
   CO2 concentrations while simultaneously promoting agricultural gains is
   paramount. However, studies that relate variability in CO2 and CH4
   emissions at large spatial scales are limited. We investigated
   three-year emissions of soil CO2 and CH4 from the primary wetland types
   of the Liaohe Delta, China, by focusing on a total wetland area of 3287
   km(2). One percent is Suaeda salsa, 24\% is Phragmites australis, and
   75\% is rice. While S. salsa wetlands are under somewhat natural tidal
   influence, P. australis and rice are managed hydrologically for paper
   and food, respectively. Total C emissions from CO2 and CH4 from these
   wetland soils were 2.9 Tg C/year, ranging from 2.5 to 3.3 Tg C/year
   depending on the year assessed. Primary emissions were from CO2 (similar
   to 98\%). Photosynthetic uptake of CO2 would mitigate most of the soil
   CO2 emissions, but CH4 emissions would persist. Overall, CH4 fluxes were
   high when soil temperatures were > 18 degrees C and pore water salinity
   < 18 PSU. CH4 emissions from rice habitat alone in the Liaohe Delta
   represent 0.2\% of CH4 carbon emissions globally from rice. With such a
   large area and interannual sensitivity in soil GHG fluxes, management
   practices in the Delta and similar wetlands around the world have the
   potential not only to influence local C budgeting, but also to influence
   global biogeochemical cycling.},

Abstract = {Ship hull and propeller fouling has a severe impact both on fuel costs
   and on greenhouse gas emission, thus, it is an important subject to
   consider when developing a maintenance plan to enhance energy efficiency
   and reduce gas emissions from ships. This paper presents a two-step
   approach for evaluating the actual propulsive performance of a ship
   through analyzing continuous onboard measurement. First, the onboard
   monitored data are corrected for the wind and wave effects using fast
   and transparent empirical methods. Second, the corrected data are
   filtered based on hydrodynamic criteria. A case study is presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. Subsequently, the
   processed data are analyzed by mathematical tools to derive an engine
   power-rpm curve to represent the actual propulsive performance of the
   ship. By comparing the derived curve against the nominal curve for
   engine design, it is possible to identify the deterioration of the
   ship's condition, which is the key task in developing the identification
   capability that is needed in a proactive maintenance procedure. This
   methodology is expected to support the maritime sector in combating
   climate change by reducing the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from ship
   operations.},

Abstract = {The climate change in the Toarcian (Early Jurassic) was characterized by
   a major perturbation of the global carbon cycle. The event lasted for
   approximately 200,000 years and was manifested by a global warming of
   similar to 6 degrees C, anoxic conditions in the oceans, and extinction
   of marine species. The triggering mechanisms for the perturbation and
   environmental change are however strongly debated. Here, we present
   evidence for a rapid formation and transport of greenhouse gases from
   the deep sedimentary reservoirs in the Karoo Basin, South Africa.
   Magmatic sills were emplaced during the initial stages of formation of
   the Early Jurassic Karoo Large Igneous Province, and had a profound
   influence on the fate of light elements in the organic-rich sedimentary
   host rocks. Total organic carbon contents and vitrinite reflectivity
   data from contact aureoles around the sills show that organic carbon was
   lost from the country rocks during heating. We present data from a new
   type of geological structures, termed breccia pipes, rooted in the
   aureoles within the shale of the Western Karoo Basin. The breccia pipes
   are cylindrical structures up to 150 meters in diameter and are mainly
   comprised of brecciated and baked black shale. Thousands of breccia
   pipes were formed due to gas pressure build-up during metamorphism of
   the shales, resulting in venting of greenhouse gases to the Toarcian
   atmosphere. Mass balance calculations constrained by new aureole data
   show that up to 1800 Gt of CO2 was formed from organic material in the
   western Karoo Basin. About 15 times this amount of CO2 (27,400 Gt) may
   have formed in the entire basin during the intrusive event. U-Pb dating
   of zircons from a sill related to many of the pipes demonstrates that
   the magma was emplaced 182.5+/-0.4 million years ago. This supports a
   causal relationship between the intrusive volcanism, the gas venting,
   and the Toarcian global warming. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This paper outlines the conflicts and synergies between risk and
   resilience approaches to climate change adaptation planning in
   vulnerable coastal areas of Australia. It examines whether current
   planning processes shaping vulnerable coastal settlements in Australia
   are sufficiently informed to build adaptive capacity for their
   communities under climate change impacts. Considerable research to date
   has focused on the application of risk management in identifying
   vulnerabilities and predicted worst-case scenarios. This approach often
   proposes `hard' infrastructure changes for climate change adaptation.
   However, little work has been done looking at the processes for
   implementing and supporting such adaptation strategies while addressing
   the inherent uncertainty of future climate change impacts. This
   so-called `soft' infrastructure is critical to building a community's
   ability to innovate and prosper while adapting to unforeseen challenges
   posed by a changing climate. It is argued that introducing concepts of
   resilience to municipal planning processes for vulnerable coastal
   settlements, particularly in development control plans (DCP's) may
   provide a more comprehensive approach to climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Climate Clever Beef: options to improve business performance and reduce

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {207-218},
Abstract = {The Rangeland Journal - Climate Clever Beef special issue examines
   options for the beef industry in northern Australia to contribute to the
   reduction in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to engage in the
   carbon economy. Relative to its gross value (A\$5 billion), the northern
   beef industry is responsible for a sizable proportion of national
   reportable GHG emissions (8-10\%) through enteric methane, savanna
   burning, vegetation clearing and land degradation. The industry occupies
   large areas of land and has the potential to impact the carbon cycle by
   sequestering carbon or reducing carbon loss. Furthermore, much of the
   industry is currently not achieving its productivity potential, which
   suggests that there are opportunities to improve the emissions intensity
   of beef production. Improving the industry's GHG emissions performance
   is important for its environmental reputation and may benefit individual
   businesses through improved production efficiency and revenue from the
   carbon economy. The Climate Clever Beef initiative collaborated with
   beef businesses in six regions across northern Australia to better
   understand the links between GHG emissions and carbon stocks, land
   condition, herd productivity and profitability. The current performance
   of businesses was measured and alternate management options were
   identified and evaluated. Opportunities to participate in the carbon
   economy through the Australian Government's Emissions Reduction Fund
   (ERF) were also assessed. The initiative achieved significant producer
   engagement and collaboration resulting in practice change by 78 people
   from 35 businesses, managing more than 1272000ha and 132000 cattle.
   Carbon farming opportunities were identified that could improve both
   business performance and emissions intensity. However, these
   opportunities were not without significant risks, trade-offs and
   limitations particularly in relation to business scale, and uncertainty
   in carbon price and the response of soil and vegetation carbon
   sequestration to management. This paper discusses opportunities for
   reducing emissions, improving emission intensity and carbon
   sequestration, and outlines the approach taken to achieve beef business
   engagement and practice change. The paper concludes with some
   considerations for policy makers.},

Abstract = {Time-dependent geographical distributions of surface-air temperature
   change relative to year 2000 are constructed for four scenarios of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, and are
   compared to the IS92a scenario. The four new scenarios have been
   developed by four different modeling teams. The four scenarios are
   noninterventionist, in that they do not include abatement of GHG
   emissions for the purpose of climate-change mitigation. The rime
   evolution of the changes in global-mean surface-air temperature and sea
   level are calculated for each scenario by our
   energy-balance-climate/upwelling-diffusion-model. The temperature
   changes individually and jointly for the radiative forcing by the GHGs
   and by the sulfate aerosol, which is formed in the atmosphere from the
   emitted SO2. These GHG- and SO2-induced global-mean temperature changes
   are used to scale in time the geographical distributions of surface-air
   temperature simulated by our University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
   (UIUC) atmospheric-general-circulation/mixed-layer-ocean model,
   respectively for a doubling of the CO2 amount and for a 10-fold increase

Abstract = {Climate change and improved life quality have increased water demand,
   while water supplies are shrinking. The increasing water demand in
   combination with extensive dry periods due to climate change has
   decreased water resources. The primary goal of this study was to suggest
   measures that can be taken to resolve the water supply insufficiency in
   Cyprus. Those measures should be as friendly as possible to the
   environment, so no further vulnerabilities are caused to the environment
   by treating the current ones. Reviewing the measures that have been
   taken to resolve the insufficiency of water resources in Cyprus,
   numerous dams were originally constructed to store water, followed by
   the construction of the Southern Conveyor Pipeline and finally
   desalination plants. Desalination facilities provided sufficiency of
   water but at the same time introduced further impacts on the
   environment, such as increase in greenhouse gas emissions, because of
   their power demand, and saline density increase, due to the rejection of
   residual salt back to the sea. The economic effect in conjunction with
   the environmental impact of desalination units on various sections is
   presented, taking into account greenhouse gas emissions and the Kyoto
   protocol. The study concludes with the pursuit of new more advanced
   technologies on renewable energy sources and environmentally friendly
   methods from around the world that could be applied in Cyprus for its
   economic benefit and satisfaction of public water supply.},

Abstract = {Earth's climate has experienced notable changes during the past 50-70
   years when global surface temperature has risen by 0.8 degrees C during
   the 20th century. This was a consequence of the rise in the
   concentration of biogenic gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
   chlorofluorocarbons, and ozone) in the atmosphere that contribute, along
   with water vapor, to the so-called `greenhouse effect'. Most of the
   emissions of greenhouse gases have been, and still are, the product of
   human activities, namely, the excessive use of fossil energy,
   deforestations in the humid tropics with associated poor land
   use-management, and wide-scale degradation of soils under crop
   cultivation and animal/pasture ecosystems. General Circulation Models
   predict that atmospheric CO2 concentration will probably reach 700
   mol(CO2) mol(-1). This can result in rise of Earth's temperature from
   1.5 to over 5 degrees C by the end of this century. This may instigate
   0.60-1.0 m rise in sea level, with impacts on coastal lowlands across
   continents. Crop modeling predicts significant changes in agricultural
   ecosystems. The mid- and high-latitude regions might reap the benefits
   of warming and CO2 fertilization effects via increasing total production
   and yield of C-3 plants coupled with greater water-use efficiencies. The
   tropical/subtropical regions will probably suffer the worst impacts of
   global climate changes. These impacts include wide-scale socioeconomic
   changes, such as degradation and losses of natural resources, low
   agricultural production, and lower crop yields, increased risks of
   hunger, and above all waves of human migration and dislocation. Due to
   inherent cassava tolerance to heat, water stress, and poor soils, this
   crop is highly adaptable to warming climate. Such a trait should enhance
   its role in food security in the tropics and subtropics.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change and related ocean warming have affected marine ecological
   and socioeconomic systems worldwide. Therefore, it is critically
   important to assess the performance of conservation mechanisms,
   particularly marine protected areas (MPAs) to moderate the risks of
   climate-related impacts. In this study, sea surface temperature trends
   of Australian Commonwealth MPAs are assessed against climate change
   management criteria, as defined in Adapting to Climate Change: Guidance
   for Protected Area Managers and Planners. Monthly sea surface
   temperature trends between 1993 and 2017 were statistically assessed
   using the Mann-Kendall trend test and management plans were subject to a
   thematic analysis. Temperature trends showed variable SST changes among
   the regions, with the northern reserves all showing statistically
   significant increases in temperature, and the Southwest Network having
   the least number of reserves with statistically significant increases in
   temperature. The thematic analysis shows that management plans address
   approximately half of the climate change adaptation criteria. Several
   management strategies, such as dynamic MPAs, replication, and
   translocations, are currently absent and have been suggested as
   necessary tools in supporting the climate readiness of Australian MPAs.
   This study is significant because it helps to identify and synthesize
   regions most vulnerable to the impacts of ocean warming and provides
   management suggestions make MPAs ``climate ready.{''}},

Abstract = {Through the construction of a socio-ecological timeline for the
   Porsanger fjord ecosystem, this article illustrates the different ways
   in which environmental and social-ecological changes have influenced the
   adaptations of rural households in coastal Sami communities in Finnmark,
   north Norway. The main finding is that, although environmental change in
   the form of seal invasions and dwindling fish stocks directly impacted
   the fisheries, the introduction of a new vessel quota system decisively
   changed adaptive capacity and coastal Sami household adaptation
   strategies. These changes represented a tipping point for the
   social-ecological system in the period between 1986 and 1990. It is thus
   important to discuss the ways in which governance systems may facilitate
   actions to adapt to climate and biodiversity change and foster
   sustainable rural livelihood systems in coastal Norway. Based on
   traditional and local ecological knowledge on the state of the ecosystem
   prior to the tipping point, two relevant actions to increase the
   resilience of the system were identified: ensuring the possibility of
   re-entry into fisheries as part of rural livelihood combinations, and
   ecological restoration of kelp beds. Flexible diversification of
   livelihoods allows exploitation of a range of adjacent species without
   large investments in a fossile fuel-driven fisheries economy. Investing
   in regrowth of macroalgae to foster cod nursery areas and increase
   carbon sequestration can be a relevant alternative for communities that
   are interested in contributing to climate change mitigation on a larger
   scale.},

Abstract = {While rapidly reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is the most obvious
   approach to reducing the deleterious consequences of the accelerating
   pace and nature of global climate change, doing so will require a near
   total shift away from carbon-emitting fuels by the mid-to late-21(st)
   century. At the present pace of international actions aimed at limiting
   emissions, there seems little likelihood that atmospheric composition
   can be stabilized at a level that will avoid `` dangerous anthropogenic
   interference{''} with the climate system, as called for in the UN
   Framework Convention on Climate Change. Complicating the situation, as
   greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, reductions in the offsetting
   cooling influence of sulfate aerosols from the associated sulfur dioxide
   emissions will create an additional warming influence that could raise
   global average temperature by about 0.5 degrees C, over and above a
   similar commitment that will materialize as oceans warm.
   That climate change can be inadvertently induced by human activites has
   led to consideration of whether advertent steps could be taken to
   counterbalance the warming influence of greenhouse gases, thus allowing
   continued benefits from the use of fossil fuels while limiting or
   avoiding the dangerous and damaging consequences. The approaches that
   have been proposed include: (1) accelerating removal of greenhouse gases
   from the atmosphere; (2) limiting incoming solar radiation or increasing
   the amount of solar radiation reflected by the atmosphere-surface system
   back to space; and (3) taking actions to limit one or more of the most
   severe impacts. To date, none of the proposed approaches is capable of
   counterbalancing all of the most important impacts of fossil fuel use,
   although a few, while inducing some side effects, appear capable of
   limiting some of the most adverse consequences if implemented in the
   near future and continued for many decades into the future.
   Before the relative costs, benefits and risks of intentionally
   intervening can be evaluated in terms of their potential to complement
   mitigation and proactive adaptation, substantial research is needed. As
   a first phase in evaluating potential global-scale actions, it would
   seem most practical and acceptable to initiate research and testing on
   the effectiveness and complications of four possible interventions that
   would limit particularly serious impacts: (1) limiting ocean
   acidification by increasing the removal of carbon dioxide from the
   atmosphere and upper ocean; (2) limiting the increasing intensity of
   tropical cyclones; (3) limiting the warming of the Arctic and slowing
   consequent sea level rise from the melting of glaciers and ice sheets;
   and (4) sustaining or enhancing the existing sulfate cooling influence
   that presently offsets about 0.5 degrees C soC of global warming. To
   `complement the physical and ecological research, in depth consideration
   is needed of the potential governance structure for an international
   geoengineering decision-making framework in the event that
   geoengineering of the global climate system over the longterm becomes
   essential.},

Abstract = {The combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant impacts on climate may
   now represent one of the largest environmental threats. In the
   Mediterranean Sea, changes in bio-chemical and physical seawater
   properties resulting from global warming are likely to alter marine

   encourage diseases, toxic algal bloom and propagation of thermophilic
   species. This review highlights the current and potential threats Of
   climate change to the Mediterranean marine ecosystems, including
   cetaceans, and stresses the emergent necessity for more integrated
   regulations and policies for the protection of marine biodiversity. For
   instance, in the Mediterranean Sea, the distribution and abundance of
   the small euphausid species Meganyctiphanes norvegica is correlated with
   specific hydrobiological parameters including seawater temperature,
   salinity and current patterns. Situated at the northern limit of its

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Competing usage of marine space has prompted several coastal nations to
   implement marine spatial planning (MSP). While progressive governments
   promote the deployment of renewable energy technologies (RETs) in order
   to meet renewable energy capacity and greenhouse gas emissions
   reductions targets, offshore RETs become another player operating within
   a finite and already stressed marine environment. This paper applies the
   sectoral MSP process employed by Scotland to the Nova Scotia context in
   order to draft a MSP for the province's tidal energy sector. Applicable
   legislation is reviewed in order to establish the regulatory authorities
   with powers to plan for both the marine development and ecosystem
   protection agendas. The scoping process identifies suitable resource
   areas based on the operational parameters of commercially viable tidal
   current turbines (TCTs), while the sustainability appraisal identifies
   areas of cultural, industry, ecological, and socioeconomic constraint
   and exclusion. Plan option areas emanating from the applied methodology
   demonstrated a 238.345 km(2) (98.1\%) increase in suitable TCT
   deployment area than the marine renewable energy areas identified in
   Nova Scotia's Marine Renewable Energy Act which did not undertake such a

Abstract = {Conversion to renewable energy sources is a logical response to the
   increasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean wave
   energy is the least developed renewable energy source, despite having
   the highest energy per unit area. While many hurdles remain in
   developing wave energy, assessing potential conflicts and evaluating
   tradeoffs with the existing uses is essential. Marine planning
   encompasses a broad array of activities that take place in and affect
   large marine ecosystems, making it an ideal tool for evaluating wave
   energy resource use conflicts. In this study, we used a spatially
   explicit, open source decision support tool to evaluate wave energy
   facility development off the U.S. west coast. We then used this output
   to identify potential conflicts between wave energy facilities and the
   existing marine uses in the context of marine planning. We found that
   regions with the highest wave energy potential were distant from major
   cities and that infrastructure limitations (cable landing sites)
   restrict integration with the existing power grids. We also identified
   multiple potential conflicts, including commercial fishing, shipping and
   transportation, and marine conservation areas. While wave energy
   generation facilities may be economically viable, we must also
   incorporate costs associated with conflicts that arise with the existing
   marine uses.},

Abstract = {Reducing vulnerability is the aim of flood risk management plans, yet
   their success depends on acceptance and implementation by their
   community. It is important, then, to study approaches that encourage
   societal participation in decision-making. The present study combined
   three participatory methods to capture and understand local knowledge on
   flood vulnerability reduction in a coastal town in southern Mexico. As a
   feasibility outcome, we found that these kinds of approaches involving
   community participation and consultation are attainable and easy to
   integrate into the local planning processes of vulnerability reduction
   and flood risk management. On process outcomes, we found that the
   community is aware of the flood risk given by their spatial location,
   has taken actions to adapt, and proposed other actions to reduce their
   vulnerability. We found no quantitative relationship between the levels
   of flood delimited by the participatory geographic information systems
   approach and the community's socioeconomic characteristics obtained by
   the house survey. Still, qualitative analysis of the three methods
   revealed that the collective memory of experiencing a flood plays a
   significant role in the measures the population takes to adapt and
   reduce vulnerability.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the methodology and data used to determine
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to ten cities or
   city-regions: Los Angeles County, Denver City and County, Greater
   Toronto, New York City, Greater London, Geneva Canton, Greater Prague,
   Barcelona, Cape Town and Bangkok. Equations for determining emissions
   are developed for contributions from: electricity; heating and
   industrial fuels; ground transportation fuels; air and marine fuels;
   industrial processes; and waste. Gasoline consumption is estimated using
   three approaches: from local fuel sales; by scaling from regional fuel
   sales; and from counts of vehicle kilometres travelled. A simplified
   version of an intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) method
   for estimating the GHG emissions from landfill waste is applied. Three
   measures of overall emissions are suggested: (i) actual emissions within
   the boundary of the city; (ii) single process emissions (from a
   life-cycle perspective) associated with the city's metabolism; and (iii)
   life-cycle emissions associated with the city's metabolism. The results
   and analysis of the study will be published in a second paper. (C) 2009

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions from an arid-zone reservoir and their
   environmental policy significance: Results from existing global models
   and an exploratory dataset},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {53-62},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Reservoirs in arid regions often provide critical water storage but
   little is known about their greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. While there
   is growing appreciation of the role reservoirs play as GHG sources,
   there is a lack of understanding of GHG emission dynamics from
   reservoirs in arid regions and implications for environmental policy.
   Here we present initial GHG emission measurements from Lake Powell, a
   large water storage reservoir in the desert southwest United States. We
   report CO2-eq emissions from the shallow (< 15 m) littoral regions of
   the reservoir that are higher than the global average areal emissions
   from reservoirs (9.4 vs. 5.8 g CO2-eq m-2 d-1) whereas fluxes from the
   main reservoir were two orders of magnitude lower (0.09 g CO2-eq m- 2
   d-1). We then compared our measurements to modeled CO2 + CH4 emissions
   from the reservoir using four global scale models. Factoring these
   emissions into hydropower production at Lake Powell yielded low GHG
   emissions per MWh-1 as compared to fossil-fuel based energy sources.
   With the exception of one model, the estimated hydropower emissions for
   Lake Powell ranged from 10-32 kg CO2-eq MWh-1, compared to -400-1000 kg
   CO2-eq MWh-1 for natural gas, oil, and coal. We also estimate that
   reduced littoral habitat under low water levels leads to -50\% reduction
   in the CO2 equivalent emissions per MWh. The sensitivity of GHG
   emissions to reservoir water levels suggests that the interaction will
   be an important policy consideration in the design and operation of arid
   region systems.},

Title = {Dark green electricity comes from the sea: Capitalizing on ecological
   merits of offshore wind power?},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {1023-1033},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {European consumers are willing to pay more for ``green{''} electricity,
   as they highly value renewable energy sources for the contribution to
   combating climate change. There is a push for getting higher levels of
   sustainability, leading to a differentiation of Europe's electricity
   market. In this differentiation, the large potential of wind energy is
   recognized. More specifically, North Sea countries prefer to plan wind
   arrays (far) out at sea. This article offers a review of the main
   arguments for offshore wind energy, described in comparison with its
   onshore counterpart. It is stated that offshore wind farms (OWFs)
   generate ``dark green{''} electricity as they mitigate greenhouse gas
   emissions and contribute to the protection of (some) marine life.
   Applying an informational governance framework, this article further
   assesses whether this dark green message has been exploited through
   further differentiation of the electricity market, and provides an
   analysis of why this is not (yet) the case. It is concluded that the
   dominant discourse in onshore wind power development hinders a favorable
   ecological differentiation toward offshore wind power. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We performed laboratory experiments to investigate the response of
   Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, a predominant diatom species in the
   Southern Ocean, to different concentrations of dissolved iron in the
   culture medium to assess changes in nutrients, trace metals, and
   greenhouse gases-CO2, CH4, and N2O-during growth. F. kerguelensis was
   cultured in standard f/2+Si media contained in closed chambers at
   2a{''}integral, which is a typical surface temperature of the Southern
   Ocean in summer, under continuous irradiation with similar to 44 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1) for 8 days. The media contained 2.2 nM, 7.0 nM, and
   10.6 nM of dissolved iron at inoculation. F. kerguelensis grew faster if
   the initial dissolved iron concentration was higher. Its production rate
   was similar to 40 cells mL(-1) d(-1) with an increase of 10-18 molar
   dissolved iron on a single cell basis. Fe and Mo were consumed faster
   than the growth rate at higher dissolved iron concentrations while Mn
   and Zn were consumed more slowly taking the mean values into account.
   Nitrate consumption by single cells increased with an increase of
   dissolved iron in the media, but phosphate and silicate showed a
   tendency to decrease. Hence, dissolved iron enhanced uptake of nitrate,
   but not the other nutrients, on a single cell basis. The carbon uptake
   per cell decreased with an increase in dissolved iron, which is opposite
   to the growth rate, suggesting that carbon content in single cells could
   not keep up with the cell growth. The iron efficacy of carbon uptake by
   single cells, defined as the ratio of the carbon uptake to the iron
   uptake, also showed a significant reduction with an increase in
   dissolved iron. This implies the inefficient usage of iron to absorb
   carbon at a high dissolved iron concentration. CH4 uptake by F.
   kerguelensis occurred in our experiments, but it was trivial in relation
   to the overall impact. N2O was consumed at a lower concentration of
   dissolved iron, but was emitted at a higher dissolved iron
   concentration, suggesting a facultative response of F. kerguelensis to
   the available dissolved iron.},

Abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using CO2+N2O mixed gas
   hydrates for the development of advanced greenhouse gas (GHG)
   sequestration technology. Structural characteristics of gas hydrates at
   different mole fractions of the gas mixture (CO2: N2O = 0.7: 0.3 and
   0.5: 0.5) was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution
   X-ray powder diffraction. The mixed gas hydrates can contain both CO2
   and N2O molecules simultaneously, in small and large cages of structure
   I hydrate without structural deformation. Their volume can be expanded
   by increase of the N2O portion. The phase equilibrium condition of the
   mixed gas hydrates was more stable than that of pure CO2 hydrates, and
   estimated dissociation enthalpies of the mixed gas hydrates were higher
   than those of the CO2 hydrates. We confirmed that the mixed gas hydrates
   can reduce massive amounts of GHG emissions due to their potentially
   higher storage capacity. These research results provide basic knowledge
   useful for the simultaneous mitigation of the effects from major GHGs
   and application of the CO2+N2O mixed hydrates to advanced offshore GHG
   sequestration in marine sediment environments.},

Abstract = {The shipping sector is encountering remarkable costs concerning
   decarbonization of the maritime business. Both the International
   Maritime Organization and the European Union are developing tools to
   limit greenhouse gas emissions of shipping. Given all the tools and
   planned regulations, it seems that energy efficiency and cost cutting
   would be a feasible strategy of the future. However, in addition to cost
   cutting, shipping with net-zero or zero emission fuels might be a way to
   promote sustainable shipping services. A growing consumer segment is
   ready to pay for sustainability-marketed consumer goods, and it is
   possible that people would be ready to pay for net-zero or zero emission
   shipping as well. Our objective is to pinpoint, how big price premiums
   would be needed to cover the costs of shipping with sustainable, and
   typically more expensive, maritime fuels. We do this by calculating the
   amounts of fuel needed to ship specific good categories at first, and
   then we estimate the costs of shipping these goods with alternative
   fuels. We analyze Finnish maritime foreign trade during the year 2018,
   the time prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. We estimate fuel
   consumption to the value and quantities of goods. Our findings indicate
   that a shift to low carbon and carbon neutral fuels would have a limited
   effect to the price of most goods.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to solve the state's hydropower dependence, build energy
   security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a hybrid renewable
   energy system and its implementation in Willingdon Island. Hybrid
   Optimisation of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) is used to find the
   optimal solution for two grid-connected and off-grid scenarios. Of the
   19 solutions, an optimal off-grid, an optimal grid-connected, a 100\%
   variable renewable energy, and a diversified energy portfolio option are
   selected, analyzed, and ranked based on their techno-economic and
   emissions characteristics. The results suggest the combination of
   PV/Wind/Grid with a cost of energy of \$0.044 as an optimal solution for
   the Island. The diversified energy solution takes the second position,
   having 51.4\% and 38.8\% solar and wind, respectively.},

Abstract = {Current evidence is that climate change is occurring, it is largely
   manmade and it will have significant implications for human
   civilisation. Australia is particularly vulnerable to the anticipated
   effects of climate change, creating major challenges for water resource
   management and water supply security. Climate change adaptation offers a
   means by which we can reduce our exposure to future climate change
   risks, whilst at the same time exploiting any potential benefits that
   may arise from climatic changes. This review outlines the current major
   climate change adaptation challenges facing the water supply industry at
   large, with a particular focus on these challenges in an Australian
   context. It also aims to highlight the critical knowledge gaps and
   strategies required to assist in the formulation of adaptation responses
   to the range of potential impacts on water infrastructure and future
   water security. A diverse range of management and assessment techniques
   are used by relevant professions in industry. Here, an adaptive
   management approach is presented highlighting the important information
   required for robust assessment.},

Abstract = {Understanding climate change caused by different external forcings is an
   urgent need for crisis management and sustainable economic development.
   It remains unclear how differently global precipitation changes in
   response to global temperature variations induced by the change of
   individual solar, volcanic, or greenhouse gas (GHG) forcings. We address
   this issue by performing three last millennium simulations under each of
   these individual forcings with the Community Earth System Model version
   1.0. The results show that all three forcings can excite strong
   low-frequency variations that are longer than one decade, that is,
   global warming under strong solar radiation or high GHG concentration
   and global cooling under frequent volcanic eruptions. For a given global
   temperature change, the global precipitation change under volcanic
   forcing is larger than that under solar and GHG forcings. The reason is
   that the volcanic forcing induces the strongest solar irradiance change
   in the wet tropics. Among the three forcings we examined, the GHG
   forcing excites the strongest high-latitude warming, especially the
   Arctic amplification of global warming. There is no Arctic amplification
   of temperature decrease under the volcanic forcing-induced global
   cooling. The volcanic forcing weakens the Intertropical Convergence Zone
   and reduces precipitation. The results suggest that while volcanic
   eruptions can reduce precipitation, they do not mitigate the Arctic
   amplification of temperature increase under the GHG-induced warming. The
   underlying mechanisms for these different climate responses are also
   discussed.},

Title = {Impact of functional microbes on nitrogen removal in artificial tidal
   wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary: Evidence from molecular and
   stable isotopic analyses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {287},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {After decades of rapid development in the delta, the worsening water
   quality in the Yangtze River estuary has become a concern in China. To
   improve the situation, we explored the use of two tidal wetland
   mesocosms (PA and NP), by evaluating nitrogen removal performance,
   greenhouse gas emissions and underlying molecular mechanisms. Our
   results show the mesocosms removed similar to 23.9\% of TN from
   nitrate-dominated river water (1.20 mg L-1), with PA twice effective as
   NP, which is consistent with the molecular and stable isotopic data. The
   emissions of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O)
   were low in the soil of both PA and NP, while integrated microbial
   analyses suggest nitrification was the major contributor of nitrite to
   anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and also the dominant ammonia
   removal pathway in the mesocosms, particularly PA. The simultaneous
   dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), anammox,
   denitrification and nitrification had mainly contributed to the nitrogen
   removal and greenhouse gas emission reduction, with rates of 0.86-2.05,
   11.94-24.38, 44.95-340.95, and 458.56-1046.91 nmol N-2 g(-1) dry soil
   d(-1), respectively. This study would expand our understanding of the
   nitrogen-cycling in tidal wetlands, helping develop a sustainable
   solution to the water pollution problem in the Yangtze River estuary.

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Throughout history, humans living in the coastal area constantly adapt
   to the natural environment and create a changing environment. The rapid
   coastal development occurred in the mid-19th century and peaks in the
   mid-20th century, which was a common process in most industrialized
   areas. With increasing population growth and urban sprawl, many coastal
   lowlands are unprecedently vulnerable to climate change impacts such as
   sea level rise, increasing extreme storm events, and coastal flooding.
   Under the influence of urban revitalization and conservation, the
   landward shoreline movement accelerated and coastal land shrank,
   accompanied by community retreat. This research focuses on the
   importance of incorporating an understanding of the changing coastal
   land-ocean interaction into adaptive management strategies by
   illustrating the relationship of land use change, social-economic
   development, and climate change. Typical coastal changes in Connecticut
   were selected: New Haven Harbor reflects a dramatic seaward land
   accretion under industrial and transportation development, New London
   downtown waterfront reveals a trend of building retreat under industrial
   and commercial transformation and coastal hazard, New London Ocean Beach
   indicates how overdeveloped coastal low-lying community fully retreat
   after a natural disaster, and Jordan Cove barrier island shows a highly
   dynamic coastal land change and proactive management strategy. The
   results reveal that to cope with a constantly changing shoreline and the
   challenges of climate change, a resilient management process must
   incorporate a cycle of learning, experimenting, and creating with the
   goal of developing new solutions that are able to deal with our
   ever-changing environment.},

Title = {Prioritizing climate change adaptation options for iconic marine species},

Abstract = {Adaptation options in response to climate impact scenarios for marine
   mammals and seabirds were developed based on the IPCC vulnerability
   framework. Under this framework, vulnerability to the physical effects
   of climate change can be reduced by adaptation options that reduce
   exposure of individuals, reduce the sensitivity of individuals, and
   increase the adaptive capacity of individual/species to cope with
   climate change. We evaluated options in each vulnerability category with
   three screening tools collectively forming an approach we term
   sequential adaptation prioritization for species. These tools were
   designed to evaluate (i) technical aspects (cost-benefit-risk, CBR),
   (ii) institutional barriers, and (iii) potential social acceptability.
   The CBR tool identified which adaptation options were high cost and low
   benefit, might be discarded, and which were high benefit and low cost,
   might be rapidly implemented (depending on risk). Low cost and low
   benefit options might not be pursued, while those that are high cost,
   but high benefit deserve further attention. Even with technical merit,
   adaptation options can fail because of institutional problems with
   implementation. The second evaluation tool, based on the conceptual
   framework on barriers to effective climate adaptation, identifies where
   barriers may exist, and leads to strategies for overcoming them.
   Finally, adaptation options may not be acceptable to society at large,
   or resisted by vocal opponents or groups. The social acceptability tool
   identifies potentially contested options, which may be useful to
   managers charged with implementing adaptation options. Social
   acceptability, as scored by experts, differed from acceptability scored
   by the public, indicating the need to involve the public in assessing
   this aspect. Scores from each tool for each scenario can be combined to
   rank the suite of adaptation options. This approach provides useful
   tools to assist conservation managers in selecting from a wide range of
   adaptation strategies; the methodology is also applicable to other
   conservation sectors.},

Abstract = {US imports of wood and paper products from countries with emerging
   economies such as China and Brazil have dramatically increased in recent
   decades, partially displacing US domestic production. Such displacements
   may have reduced the direct production costs of these products, yet
   generated indirect economic and environmental impacts that are not well
   understood or taken into account. This study uses general equilibrium
   modeling to assess and compare the economy-wide impacts and greenhouse
   gas (GHG) consequences between US domestic production and imports from
   China and Brazil. Both the United States and China will benefit from
   enhancing US production of wood and paper products. In addition,
   strengthening the US wood products industries can help reduce GHG
   emissions and conserve tropical natural forests as China and Brazil
   import or use more tropical logs to produce wood products than the
   United States. These findings reveal the economic and environmental
   advantages of increasing US production of forest products, particularly
   wood products.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {856},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The residential sector is one of the primary energy consumers and
   emitters of greenhouse gases. Given the environ-mental problem, one of
   the methods of mitigating electricity consumption and reducing the
   temperature in buildings is green infrastructure: green roofs and walls.
   This article presents a compilation of the studies carried out in Mexico
   about green infrastructure; the energy, thermal and environmental
   benefits obtained were analyzed according to the vegetation, substrate,
   climate, and systems configuration. In addition, the development of
   policies, laws, regula-tions, and incentives in the field of green roofs
   in Mexico was also analyzed. The results indicate that using green
   infrastructure can help mitigate greenhouse gases since a green roof can
   reduce the indoor temperature up to 19.9 degrees C, save 28 \% annually
   in electricity consumption and remove 80 \% of rainwater pollutants.
   Finally, the results of this research can provide insight for
   researchers, legislators, and urban planners about the state in which
   Mexico is located, as well as help in decision-making.},

Title = {Adaptation to coastal hazards: the livelihood struggles of a fishing

Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-85},

Abstract = {This case study examines the coastal hazard adaptation strategies of a
   fishing community in a village in Kerala, India. It shows that formal
   adaptation strategies are highly techno-centric, costly, and do not take
   into account the vulnerabilities of the fishing community. Instead, they
   have contributed to ecological, livelihood, and knowledge uncertainties.
   The adaptation strategies of the fishing community are a response to
   these uncertainties. However, they may not lead to the fishing
   community's recovery from its vulnerability contexts. This case study is
   primarily qualitative in nature. Data were collected through in-depth
   interviews. Insights reveal that when actors with diverse values,
   interests, knowledge, and power evolve or design their respective
   adaptation strategies, the resulting interface often aggravates existing
   uncertainties associated with hazards. Furthermore, the study
   demonstrates that local discourses on coastal hazards are
   livelihood-centric and socially constructed within the struggle of the
   fishing community to access resources and to acquire the right to
   development.},

Title = {Large CO2 sinks: Their role in the mitigation of greenhouse gases from
   an international, national (Canadian) and provincial (Alberta)
   perspective},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {209-227},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Significant reduction of CO2 emissions on a global scale may be achieved
   by reduction of energy intensity, by reduction of carbon intensity or by
   capture and storage of CO2. A portfolio of these methods is required to
   achieve the large reductions required; of which utilization of carbon
   sinks (i.e. material, geosphere and biosphere) will be an important
   player. Material sinks will probably only play a minor role as compared
   to biosphere and geosphere sinks in storage of CO2. Biosphere sinks are
   attractive because they can sequester CO2 from a diffuse source whereas
   geosphere sinks require a pure waste stream of CO2 (obtained by using
   expensive separation methods). On the other hand, environmental factors
   and storage time favor geosphere sinks. It is expected that a
   combination of the two will be used in order to meet emission reduction
   targets over the next 100 yr.
   A critical look is taken at capacities, retention/residence times, rates
   of uptake and relative cost of utilization of biosphere and geosphere
   sinks at three scales - global, national (Canada) and provincial
   (Alberta). Biosphere sinks considered are oceans, forests and soils.
   Geosphere sinks considered are enhanced oil recovery, coal beds,
   depleted oil and gas reservoirs and deep aquifers. The largest sinks are
   oceans and deep aquifers. The other biosphere and geosphere sinks have
   total capacities approximately of an order of lower magnitude. The sinks
   that will probably be used first are those that are economically viable
   such as enhanced oil-recovery, agriculture, forestry and possibly
   enhanced coalbed methane-recovery. The other sinks will be used when
   these options have been exhausted or are not available or a penalty
   (e.g. carbon tax) exists. Although the data tabulated for these sinks is
   only regarded as preliminary, it provides a starting point for
   assessment of the role of large sinks in meeting greenhouse gas emission
   reduction targets. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of coastal marsh conversion to shrimp aquaculture ponds on CH4

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {199},
Pages = {125-131},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {In this study, we compared the CH4 and N2O fluxes from a tidal brackish
   Cyperus malaccensis marsh ecosystem and nearby shrimp ponds, converted
   from C malaccensis marsh in the last 3-4 years, in the Min River estuary
   of southeast China over the aquaculture period of the year. Significant
   differences in CH4 and N2O fluxes were observed in space (between
   brackish marsh and shrimp ponds) and in time (between sampling occasions
   that were distributed over the aquaculture period). CH4 fluxes from the
   shrimp ponds were on an average 10-fold higher than from the brackish
   marsh. N2O emissions, on the other hand, were lower from the shrimp pond
   (25\% of the emissions from the brackish marsh). Accessory data
   indicates that these patterns were primarily linked to water level
   variability and temperature (all fluxes), sediment porewater sulfate
   concentrations (CH4 flux) and total nitrogen concentrations (N2O flux).
   Our research demonstrates that the coastal marsh ecosystem converted to
   aquaculture ponds considerably alter emissions of CH4 and N2O and
   provides input to the global discussion on how to account for emissions
   from various types of flooded land in greenhouse gas inventories. (C)

   satellites, i.e. GCOM-A1 and GCOM-B1. The target of GCOM-A1 is to
   monitor greenhouse gases distribution and ozone as well as ozone related
   constituents from oblique orbit. It is now planned to carry two core
   instruments, i.e. SOFIS and ODUS. The target of GCOM-B1 is to measure
   geophysical parameters which are uncertain in the today's climate
   models. Those parameters include, but not limited to, optical thickness
   of aerosols and clouds, thermal fluxes, carbon fluxes, sink and source
   of greenhouse gases, etc. GCOM-B1 will carry three core instruments,
   i.e. SGLI (GLI follow on), AMSR2 (AMSR follow on), alpha -Seat (SeaWinds
   follow on). The orbit of GCOM-B1 will be a sun synchronous orbit, which
   is almost the same as ADEOS2. GCOM-A1 is planned to be launched in
   February 2006, and GCOM-B1 is planned to be launched in August 2006.},

Abstract = {Morocco has two coasts, an Atlantic coast that stretches over 3000 km
   and a Mediterranean facade 500 km long which gives it a considerable
   maritime potential. It is committed to a policy of environmental
   preservation, the fight against global warming and the reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions to promote all renewable energies {[}1]. The
   assessment of Morocco's maritime potential can be studied using marine
   information from sea currents, waves, wind, water temperature, water
   salinity and other types of parameters required for this diagnosis
   {[}2]. To do this, we used monthly data of sea currents, winds and
   surface temperature from the MARINE COPERNICUS site and processed by
   statistical methods using computer tools such as MATLAB software to
   highlight the main characteristics of our site facades: Atlantic and
   Mediterranean Sea in relation to the parameters studied to exploit them
   to study the possibilities of installation of marine renewable energies
   especially tidal energy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reduction in greenhouse gas and other emissions from ship engines:
   Current trends and future options},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ENERGY AND COMBUSTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {94},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The impact of ship emission reductions can be maximised by considering
   climate, health and environmental effects simultaneously and using
   solutions fitting into existing marine engines and infrastructure.
   Several options available enable selecting optimum solutions for
   different ships, routes and regions. Carbon-neutral fuels, including
   low-carbon and carbon-negative fuels, from biogenic or non-biogenic
   origin (biomass, waste, renew-able hydrogen) could resemble current
   marine fuels (diesel-type, methane and methanol). The carbon-neutrality
   of fuels depends on their Well-to-Wake (WtW) emissions of greenhouse
   gases (GHG) including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
   oxide emissions (N2O). Additionally, non-gaseous black carbon (BC)
   emis-sions have high global warming potential (GWP). Exhaust emissions
   which are harmful to health or the envi-ronment need to be equally
   removed using emission control achieved by fuel, engine or exhaust
   aftertreatment technologies. Harmful emission species include nitrogen
   oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), ammonia (NH3), formaldehyde,
   particle mass (PM) and number emissions (PN). Particles may carry
   polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals, which cause serious
   adverse health issues. Carbon-neutral fuels are typically sulphur -free
   enabling negligible SOx emissions and efficient exhaust aftertreatment
   technologies, such as particle filtration. The combinations of
   carbon-neutral drop-in fuels and efficient emission control technologies
   would enable (near-)zero-emission shipping and these could be adaptable
   in the short-to mid-term. Substantial savings in external costs on
   society caused by ship emissions give arguments for regulations,
   policies and investments needed to support this development.},

Abstract = {Taiwan imports more than 99\% of her energy and suffers from the climate
   change such as rising ocean level. Therefore, energy insecurity and GHG
   emissions offset are two serious problems facing Taiwan. This paper
   examines the possibilities for domestic bioenergy production in Taiwan
   utilizing set-aside land and analyzes the comparative economics and
   choice among these alternatives under current Taiwanese agricultural
   system policies and also under altered energy and greenhouse gas/carbon
   prices. Biochar, produced from pyrolysis, is also investigated by
   different uses: whether it is best used as an energy source and/or a
   soil amendment. Agricultural residuals and animal wastes possible
   alternatives for pyrolysis systems and therefore, land competition for
   agricultural feedstocks and supply of agricultural and animal wastes
   will be incorporated into the study. The study employs modified
   Taiwanese Agricultural Sector Model (TASM) to simulate the effects of
   the alternatives in the face of energy and greenhouse gases prices. (C)

Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},

Volume = {129},
Pages = {16-26},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Transitioning to sustainability will require innovation, not just in
   technological and economic terms but also in governance and culture. The
   work presented here sought a remote, vulnerable island context (Fiji,
   South Pacific) to enable further insight into the innovation process
   related to resilience and sustainability. The innovation targeted by
   this work was off-grid solar renewable energy (RE) systems framed as a
   development instrument to promote local, community-based resilience to
   climate change through increased livelihood security and reduction of
   climate change effects. Applying a local-level resilience framework to
   solar technology use, we conclude that the RE system can improve
   resilience, however, unintended consequences included a rush for energy
   usage causing a ``tragedy of commons{''} of finite stored energy and
   subsequently increased supplementary fossil fuel use. This suggests that
   there are still missed resilience opportunities in the way that the
   innovation is implemented in developing countries and remote areas in
   particular. Further analysis demonstrated that improved planning at the
   socio-technological interface has the potential to strengthen
   communities' resilience. With significant RE investments required for a
   transition to a low-carbon future in many developing countries, there is
   a pressing need to effectively introduce innovative uses of
   technologies. Existential threats to many local communities, and some
   nations in the Pacific may mean that sub-optimal innovation will not be
   enough.},

Abstract = {The assessment of local air pollution due to aircraft emissions at/near
   the airport is an important issue from the standpoint of environment and
   human health, but has not received due attention in China. In this
   paper, the pollutant emissions (i.e. HC, CO, NOx, SQ(x) and PM) from
   aircraft during landing and take-off (LTO) cycles at Nanjing Lukou
   Airport (NKG) in 2016 were investigated using an improved method, which
   considered the taxi-in and -out time calculated based on the real data
   from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), instead of using
   the referenced time recommended by ICAO. First, the pollutant emissions
   and their characteristics were studied from different perspectives.
   Second, two various mitigation measures of emissions were proposed, and
   the performance of emission reduction was analysed Our analysis shows
   that: (1) A320 and B738 emitted the largest emissions at NKG; (2)
   pollutants were mainly emitted during the taxi mode, followed by climb
   mode; (3) B738 had the lowest emissions per (seat.LTO) among all
   aircraft, while CRJ had the lowest emissions per unit LTO; (4)
   shortening the taxiing time and upgrading aircraft engines are both
   effective measures to mitigate pollutant emissions.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the Paris Agreements, many countries around the

   being released into the atmosphere. To do so, it is important that the
   amount of renewable energy in the electricity grid increases. However,
   there are worries of the capacity of the grid to cope with intermittent
   energy sources. To assess the feasibility of a 100\% renewable energy
   system in Japan, the authors conducted an hourly simulation of future
   electricity production based on wind, solar and tidal data. The system
   was shown to be stable, and the authors calculated the required capacity
   of electrical batteries that would be necessary to balance such a

Abstract = {Low-Elevation Coastal Zones in Central and South America are exposed to
   climate-related hazards (sea-level rise, climate variability and storms)
   which threaten the assets (people, resources, ecosystems,
   infrastructure, and the services they provide), and are expected to
   increase due to climate change. A non-systematic review is presented
   focusing on vulnerability elements, impacts, constraints to adaptation,
   and their possible strategies. The analysis emphasises the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Reasons for Concern (e.g.,
   threatened systems, extreme events, aggregated impacts, and critical
   thresholds), particularly on sea-level rise, degradation of mangroves,
   and invasive alien species in Central and South America focusing on case
   studies from Uruguay and Venezuela. Despite recent advances in coastal
   adaptation planning in Central and South America, there is an adaptation
   deficit in the implementation of measures and strategies against
   climate-related hazards, such as sea-level rise. Adaptation constraints
   are linked with poverty, resource allocation, lack of political will,
   and lack of early warning systems for climate-related hazards.
   Non-structural adaptation measures such as community-based adaptation
   and ecosystem-based adaptation are not fully mainstreamed into national
   plans yet. Government-level initiatives (e.g. National Adaptation
   Programmes of Action) are being developed, but a few are already
   implemented. In addition to specific thematic measures, the
   implementation of non-structural approaches, National Adaptation
   Programmes of Action and early warning systems, based on the reasons for
   concern, should foster adaptive capacity in coastal areas. (C) 2019

Abstract = {The dynamic response evaluation of the idealized offshore platform model
   on wind energy production subjected to wave force and seismic force is
   carried out in the present study. It is expected that development of the
   offshore wind energy production would be very effective to encourage the
   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The safety evaluation of the
   offshore platform would be carried out with the available estimation of
   the dynamic response to the wave force and seismic force with
   uncertainty. It is suggested that the evaluation with the MCS simulation
   gives important roles on the reliable performance based evaluations for
   the offshore platform with wind energy production subjected to dynamic
   forces with considerably different characteristics},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on oil palm production in Malaysia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},

Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {9760-9770},

Abstract = {Studies reveal that climate change (CC) has higher negative impacts on
   agricultural production than positive impacts. Therefore, this article
   attempts to explore the impacts of CC on oil palm production in Malaysia
   and provides mitigation and adaptation strategies towards reducing such
   impacts. The multiple regression analysis is applied to assess the
   impacts of CC on oil palm production by using time series data in the
   period of 1980 to 2010. A negative and significant relationship is found
   between annual average temperature and oil palm production. If
   temperature rises by 1 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 3 degrees C, and 4
   degrees C, production of oil palm can decrease from a range of 10 to
   41\%. This article has also found a negative impact of sea level rise
   (SLR) on oil palm production. Findings reveal that if areas under oil
   palm production decrease by 2\%, 4\%, and 8\% due to SLR of 0.5, 1, and
   2 m, oil palm production can decrease by 1.98\%, 3.96\%, and 7.92\%,
   respectively, indicating that CC has a significant impact on the
   reduction of oil palm production in Malaysia, ultimately affecting the
   sustainability of oil palm sector in Malaysia. Finally, this study
   suggests to practice appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies,
   including promotion and development of climate resilient varieties, soil
   and water conservation, afforestation, insurance and other risk transfer
   mechanisms, emission reduction technology, protection of coastal
   flooding for reducing the impacts of CC on oil palm production.},

Title = {From coast to coast: Public perception of ocean-derived benefits in
   Canada},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {77-84},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The ocean provides many benefits, such as food provision, tourism
   opportunities, and coastal protection, to people around the world. To
   manage ocean uses in a sustainable way, managers need to limit some
   activities, but which benefits are most important to preserve? To answer
   this question, an opinion survey of 2000 Canadians was conducted,
   combining a best-worst scaling experiment and a Likert-scale choice
   instrument, to determine their perception of 10 ocean-derived benefits.
   Both approaches showed that `Clean Waters' is highly important across
   all Canadians. The importance of other benefits such as `Food Provision'
   and `Biodiversity' varied with respondent age, political affiliation,
   and/or seafood-eating frequency. A majority (83\%) of Canadians favoured
   non-extractive over extractive benefits. This case study demonstrates
   how survey approaches can reveal the values and preferences of the
   general public and provide an inclusive means to help managers align
   environmental policies with public priorities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {2014},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {38-49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A global effort is underway by scientists, stakeholders, resource
   managers, and multisectoral ministerial representatives (e.g. fisheries,
   transportation, mining, energy, tourism, environment) from 110
   economically developing countries to implement ecosystem-based
   management at the Large Marine Ecosystem scale. The effort is supported
   with \$3.1 billion in financial assistance from the Global Environmental
   Facility and World Bank to assess and manage goods and services of Large
   Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) along the coasts of economically developing
   countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe. Through a
   systematic spatial and temporal scaling across multiple jurisdictions
   (e.g. community, municipal, regional, national, and international) a
   generic suite of indicators is applied to monitor the annual changes in
   LME productivity, fish and fisheries, pollution and ecosystem health,
   socioeconomics, and governance. Ecosystem-based governance practices are
   being implemented by Commissions that serve as institutional frameworks
   for restoring and sustaining transboundary LME goods and services. Under
   activities guided by LME Commissions, the suites of indicators are
   analyzed in relation to drivers of change and the results are applied to
   adaptive management regimes to reduce coastal pollution, restore damaged
   habitats, recover depleted fisheries conserve biodiversity, control
   nutrient over-enrichment and ocean acidification, and mitigate and adapt
   to the effects of climate warming. Application of ecosystem-based
   adaptive management practices presently underway by the People's
   Republic of China and the Republic of Korea are discussed for the Yellow

Title = {Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emission of Korean Offshore
   Fisheries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA},

Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {675-682},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
   assessments of Korean offshore fisheries. The consumption of energy by
   fisheries is a significant concern because of its attendant
   environmental effect, as well as the cost of the fuel consumed in
   fishing industry. With the global attention of reducing GHG emission and
   increasing energy efficiency of fuel, the seafood industry needs to
   further understand its energy use and reduce its GHG emission. In the
   present study, the amount of energy consumed and the GHG emission of
   Korean offshore fisheries in a period from 2009 to 2013 were examined.
   Offshore fisheries accounted for 24\% of Korean production in 2013 and
   60\% of fuel consumption related GHG emission. Whereas the total GHG
   emission intensity of this sector improved slightly between 2009 and
   2012; as such emission decreased by approximately 1.9\%, which increased
   again in 2013. The average amount of total GHG emission in this five
   years period was 1.78 x 10(6) tons of carbon dioxide equivalent/year (t
   CO2 eq. y(-1)). Active fishing gear was found to consume 20\% more fuel
   than passive gear. However, the production from passive gear was 28\%,
   lower than 72\% from active gear. The reason for this is that less
   abundant stationary resources are harvested using passive gear.
   Furthermore, the consumption of fuel was significantly influenced by the
   fishing method. Implementation and development of new fishing
   technologies and methods are important for improving energy efficiency
   and reducing the climate impact on fisheries. To realize these purposes,
   the fishery management system needs to be established by centralizing on
   energy efficiency and climate effect.},

Title = {Tidal rewetting in salt marshes triggers pulses of nitrous oxide
   emissions but slows carbon dioxide emission},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {156},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Pulsed emission of CO2 following rainfall in terrestrial ecosystems is
   well characterized, but coastal wetlands show the opposite trend for
   CO2, and less is known about the responses of other biogenic greenhouse
   gases like CH4 and N2O. Tidal inundation in coastal wetlands such as
   salt marshes is an additional form of rewetting with the potential to
   cause biological pulses that may not resemble rain-induced pulses.
   Accurately predicting the carbon and nitrogen cycling in salt marshes
   requires estimates of pulse responses to both rainfall and tidal
   inundation, in addition to baseline greenhouse gas flux rates. We
   measured CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes from salt marsh sediment cores while
   we simulated rewetting by rainfall and/or tidal inundation, and we
   measured the total and potentially-active microbial communities at the
   end of the experiment. Rewetting from tidal inundation and from rainfall
   led to a short term (begun within 1 h, concluded within similar to 1 d)
   pulse of N2O, a sustained drop in CO2 emission, but no change in CH4.
   The N2O pulse peaked on average at 20x and 10x baseline flux rates after
   tidal inundation and rainfall respectively. Peak N2O fluxes far exceeded
   the highest emission observed in field measurements at these sites. By
   global warming potential, the pulse of N2O only slightly offset the drop
   in CO2 emission, therefore rewetting had a net cooling effect on marsh
   radiative forcing. Microbial communities were similar in rewetted and
   non-rewetted cores two days after rewetting, which reflects rapid
   recovery and/or resilience of the community to rewetting. We estimated
   the contribution of pulsed vs. baseline N2O emissions to annual totals
   by modelling rewetting events over 65-year tide gauge and precipitation
   records, and found that pulsed emissions constitute the majority of salt
   marsh N2O emissions, and could constitute the entirety in marshes with a
   net-sink baseline.},

Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one method to reduce CO2 emissions
   to the atmosphere. As CCS has the greatest potential for greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emission reduction, it gains a wide currency in the developed
   countries. However, the technology for CCS does not spread at the
   international level especially to the developing countries like South
   China Sea states. As the CO2 storage period is quite long and potential
   environmental risks involved, fully deployed CCS projects need not only
   the technological support but the appropriate legal and regulatory
   regime to safeguard CCS operations. This article offers a survey of CCS
   projects in the South China Sea region and discusses the legal
   challenges associated with CCS activities in state practice.},

Title = {The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and their energy, land use, and
   greenhouse gas emissions implications: An overview},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {153-168},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
   (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs
   are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change
   research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of
   future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The
   pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort
   and describe plausible major global developments that together would
   lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation
   to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing
   alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable
   development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development,
   and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and
   economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range
   consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used
   for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions
   trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to
   global energy consumption of 400-1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly
   different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in
   cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million
   hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline
   scenarios range from about 25 GtCO(2) to more than 120 GtCO(2) per year
   by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs
   strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the
   socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The
   carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m(2) that is consistent
   with a temperature change limit of 2 degrees C, differs in our analysis
   thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios.
   Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with
   high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent
   different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives
   and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly
   representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent
   use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical
   next steps for the community scenario process will, among others,
   involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the
   adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios
   with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th
   climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6). (C) 2017 The Authors.

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Coastal area is a typical, complex area interacted between terrestrial
   and ocean systems. Catastrophic regime shifts of coastal ecosystem may
   occur as a result of gradual changing forces exerted by external
   factors. In this study, we presented an indicator-based framework which
   includes the land-water-biodiversity (LWB) nexus indices of catastrophe
   analysis to emphasize resilience of Xiamen, a coastal city of China,
   associated with implementation of integrated coastal management (ICM).
   The results demonstrate the changes of equilibria in land, water, and
   biodiversity subsystems that were divided into three periods (1996-2000,
   2000-2012, and 2012-2015). The implementation of several ICMs helped to
   preserve resilient coastal ecosystems since 1997, which indicates
   effective guidance of resilient coastal management on coastal land,
   water and biodiversity. Based on trends of indicator changes, we
   identified the main indicators controlling catastrophic transformation
   of the LWB nexus system state, which include built-up area and coastal
   reclaimed area in land subsystem, seawater quality in water subsystem,
   and all four biodiversity indices. The identified key drivers to
   catastrophic regime shifts can help to navigate decision making in
   resilient coastal ecosystem management. The Xiamen case study provides a
   systematic and quantitative framework for resilience assessment of
   integrated coastal management and sustainable development.},

Title = {Impact of coal seam as interlayer on CO2 storage in saline aquifers: A
   reservoir simulation study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-114},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Geological storage of CO2 is a viable option for the mitigation of
   greenhouse gas emissions. Two main reservoir types exist; porous
   formations such as saline aquifers or depleted oil or gas reservoirs
   and, of lesser importance in terms of storage capacity, coal or shale
   reservoirs. These reservoirs have distinct storage mechanisms; in the
   porous formations the CO2 is stored within the porosity by compression
   and/or dissolution in the formation fluid, whereas in coal or shale, the
   CO2 is primarily stored by adsorption. Geological storage scenarios
   exist where these two reservoir types could be present within a
   geological sequence and come into contact with migrating CO2. In order
   to simulate this situation simulators are required which represent the
   mechanisms operating for both reservoir types. One aspect of the work
   presented in this paper involves further development of the coal seam
   gas reservoir simulator, SIMED 11, to include CO2 dissolution in
   formation waters and a more accurate Equation of State, the Span and
   Wagner model, to describe CO2 density. The modified model is first
   tested through a code comparison study with TOUGH2 for CO2 storage in a
   saline aquifer with dissolution in formation water, which finds that the
   two simulators are in close agreement. The second component of this
   paper involved investigating the potential impact that coal seams could
   have on CO2 storage in saline formations. A series of hypothetical cases
   are constructed to investigate the impact of coal seams as (1) a layer
   within the target aquifer above the injection point, (2) two layers
   separated by an aquifer above the injection point, (3) a layer in the
   target aquifer below the point of injection, and (4) a layer in the
   overburden. The results show that coal seams can have a significant
   impact on CO2 storage and migration behaviour by providing extra storage
   capacity and influencing the CO2 flow path both vertically and
   horizontally. The potential impact of coal seams in these scenarios is
   related to a range of factors but key ones are the adsorption capacity
   and the permeability. The results also demonstrate that coal seam
   permeability decrease due to CO2 adsorption induced coal swelling,
   although regarded as a technical obstacle to CO2 injection in the deep
   unminable coal seams to enhance coalbed methane recovery and for CO2
   storage in coal, would further influence the CO2 flow path, helping to
   reduce the upward CO2 flow due to buoyancy and pressure. This could act
   to reduce CO2 contact with cap rocks and lower the risk of CO2 leakage.

Abstract = {The subject addressed in this paper is the definition of some strategies
   for the design and the optimaized management of EES (Electrical Energy
   Storage) systems, for an existing islanded distribution network

   In the paper the authors have drawn interesting conclusions through the
   application of an efficient MO (multi-objective) optimization algorithm,
   the NSGA-II, minimizing the energy losses in the grid, the total
   electricity generation cost and the greenhouse gas emissions.
   The results obtained for different installation scenarios of the EES are
   presented and discussed, putting into evidence the technical,
   environmental and economical benefits of using EES as well as the
   technical issues connected to their installation into an existing
   distribution network.
   The paper describes in details the second part of a feasibility study

Title = {Local knowledge and democracy in fisheries management: a case study of
   adaptation to the Anthropocene in southeast Louisiana},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The onset of the Anthropocene necessitates new forms of environmental
   planning and management as communities adapt to new ecological
   realities. Despite the global reach of the Anthropocene, localized
   adaptation strategies are critical for a successful transition into this
   new epoch. Within local contexts, inclusive, democratic political
   processes facilitate complex and effective ecological solutions to
   social problems resulting from environmental change. Genuine
   incorporation of local knowledge into the decision-making process is
   critical to fostering this ecological democracy and building effective
   adaptation strategies. Coastal systems are important nexus points to
   investigate the relationship between environmental problems and social
   processes. Fisheries are a critical piece of coastal systems that
   sustain local communities and the larger economy. I provide a case study
   of local adaptation to ecological changes as the State of Louisiana
   attempts to protect vulnerable communities, infrastructure, and
   fisheries through coastal planning and management. Louisiana's fisheries
   are a critical asset that stand to be significantly impacted by
   continuing coastal erosion. Like the Anthropocene itself, Louisiana's
   coastal erosion crisis is largely the result of human intervention in
   the biosphere for social and economic purposes. The state's adaptive
   response is an ambitious master plan that seeks to rebuild the coast and
   protect its communities and economic interests. Although the plan is
   ambitious and generally lauded, I argue that the top-down approach the
   State of Louisiana uses in setting coastal priorities undercuts the
   plan's efficacy by struggling to incorporate local knowledge and
   establish a trusting relationship with coastal stakeholders. Without a
   genuinely deliberative process that bridges across scales and knowledge
   systems, the state will ultimately struggle to draw in local knowledge,
   inhibiting comanagement of local fisheries and potentially undermining
   the ecological solutions it aims to achieve.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {336},

Abstract = {Expanded shellfish mariculture is an important strategy to improve
   global food security. However, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
   with mariculture are a concern when evaluating the benefits of protein
   production. In this study, we conducted two field campaigns in a
   constricted tagelus (Sinonovacula constricta) farming system (March 3-5
   and April 21-23, 2021) to observe the changes in GHGs. In a routine
   cycle of water exchange, the CO2 fluxes varied and followed a diurnal
   pattern (-7.6 to 23.1 mmol/m(2)/d), which is related to changes in the
   concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity
   (TA). Non-CO2 GHGs were significantly released (CH4: 0.1-1.0
   mmol/m(2)/d; N2O: similar to 0.1 mmol/m(2)/d) during the farming period
   and were responsible for over 75\% of the net global warming potential
   over a centurial period. We argue that the significant GHG emissions in
   the constricted tagelus farming system were mainly attributed to the
   farming mode, which loads many nutrients to make algae blooms for
   tagelus feeding and disturbs the sediment surface by water
   draining/bivalve activity, increasing the possibility of GHG production
   and emissions. We suggest improving the monoculture mode and tempering
   the adoption of water drainage to ameliorate the current situation. We
   recommend that further research in mariculture consider non-CO2 GHGs,
   including CH4 and N2O, to evaluate the potential of GHG emissions and
   their local importance.},

Title = {Future of our coasts: The potential for natural and hybrid

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {There is substantial evidence that natural infrastructure (i.e., healthy
   ecosystems) and combinations of natural and built infrastructure
   ({''}hybrid{''} approaches) enhance coastal resilience by providing
   important storm and coastal flooding protection, while also providing
   other benefits. There is growing interest in the U.S., as well as around
   the world, to use natural infrastructure to help coastal communities
   become more resilient to extreme events and reduce the risk of coastal
   flooding. Here we highlight strengths and weaknesses of the coastal
   protection benefits provided by built infrastructure, natural
   ecosystems, and the innovative opportunities to combine the two into
   hybrid approaches for coastal protection. We also examine some case
   studies where hybrid approaches are being implemented to improve coastal
   resilience as well as some of the policy challenges that can make
   implementation of these approaches more difficult, The case studies we
   examine are largely in the U.S. but also include a couple of
   international examples as well. Based on this analysis, we conclude that
   coastal communities and other decision makers need better information in
   order to incorporate ecosystem protection and restoration into coastal
   resilience planning efforts. As additional projects are developed, it is
   important to capitalize on every opportunity to learn more about the
   cost of natural and hybrid infrastructure projects, the value of the
   storm and erosion protection benefits provided, and the full suite of
   co-benefits provided by healthy coastal ecosystems. We highlight top
   priorities for research, investment in, and application of natural and
   hybrid approaches. These data are critical to facilitate adoption of
   these approaches in planning and decision-making at all levels to
   enhance the resilience of our coasts. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Negative emission technologies (NETs) could play a key role in ensuring
   net-zero and longer-term net negative emission ambitions are met.
   However, greenhouse gas emissions (and other pollutants) will occur over
   the life cycle of a NET and will need to be taken into consideration
   when developing schemes to roll out their use. We compare five NETs:
   afforestation/reforestation (AR), enhanced weathering (EW), mangrove
   restoration (MR), bioenergy and direct air capture with carbon storage
   (BECCS and DAC), using life cycle assessment to determine their
   environmental impacts (global warming, freshwater, toxicity etc.). We
   find that there is a wide range in the environmental impacts estimated
   across the NETs and the context in which they are used will directly
   impact which NET has low or high environmental impacts. This is an
   important aspect to consider when deciding which NET to prioritise in
   strategies to roll out their use on large scales. If consistent removal
   of CO2 from the atmosphere is the goal, then AR and MR have the lowest
   environmental impacts. However, if large and quick CO2 removal is the
   goal then EW, DAC and BECCS have similar, if not lower, environmental
   impacts. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Title = {California shellfish farmers: Perceptions of changing ocean conditions
   and strategies for adaptive capacity},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Coastal communities along the U.S. West Coast experience a myriad of
   environmental stressors, including exposure to low pH waters exacerbated
   by ocean acidification (OA). This can result in ecological and social
   consequences, making necessary the exploration and support for locally
   relevant strategies to adapt to OA and other environmental changes. The
   shellfish aquaculture industry along the West Coast is particularly
   vulnerable to OA, given the negative effects of low pH on shellfish
   survival and growth. As such, the social-ecological system exemplified
   by this industry serves as an opportunity to identify and address
   strategies for local adaptation. Through interviews conducted with West
   Coast shellfish farm owners and managers ('growers'), we investigate
   perceptions of OA and environmental change and identify specific
   strategies for adaptation. We find that growers are concerned about OA,
   among many other environmental stressors such as marine pathogens and
   water temperature. However, growers are often unable to attribute
   changes in shellfish survival or health to these environmental factors
   due to a lack of data and the resources and network required to acquire
   and interpret these data. From these interviews, we identify a list of
   adaptive strategies growers employ or would like to employ to improve
   their overall adaptive capacity to multiple stressors (environmental,
   economic, political), which together, allow farms to weather periods of
   OA-induced stress more effectively. Very few studies to date have
   identified specific adaptive strategies derived directly from the
   communities being impacted. This work therefore fills a gap in the
   literature on adaptive capacity by amplifying the voices of those on the
   front lines of climate change and identifying explicit pathways for
   adaptation.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of the offshore wind farm alpha ventus},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2459-2464},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Due to better wind conditions at sea, offshore wind farms have the
   advantage of higher electricity production compared to onshore and
   inland wind farms. In contrast, a greater material input, leading to
   increased energy consumptions and emissions during the production phase,
   is required to build offshore wind farms. These contrary effects are
   investigated for the first German offshore wind farm alpha ventus in the
   North Sea. In a life cycle assessment its environmental influence is
   compared to that of Germany's electricity mix.
   In comparison to the mix, alpha ventus had better indicators in nearly
   every investigated impact category. One kilowatt-hour electricity,
   generated by the wind farm, was burdened with 0.137 kWh Primary
   Energy-Equivalent and 32 g CO(2)-Equivalent, which represented only a
   small proportion of the accordant values for the mix. Furthermore, the
   offshore foundations as well as the submarine cable were the main energy
   intensive components. The energetic and greenhouse gas payback period
   was less than one year.
   Therefore, offshore wind power, even in deep water, is compatible with
   the switch to sustainable electricity production relying on renewable
   energies. Additional research, taking backup power plants as well as
   increasingly required energy storage systems into account, will allow
   further calculation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Benefit transfer of climate change adaptation policies in island tourist

Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Benefit transfer is a non-market valuation method that offers a quick
   and cost effective alternative to costly valuation methods for assessing
   the economic value of environmental goods and policies in tourism. This
   paper assesses the validity of the benefits transfer method for the
   policies to adapt to climate change impacts across tourist destinations.
   To do so, a discrete choice experiment is designed and conducted
   simultaneously across seven island destinations with similar
   sociological and environmental characteristics. The results show some
   climate change adaptation policies are more valued than others by
   tourists, and some destinations attract higher preferences for
   environmental actions. The tests give significant support to the
   validity of the transfer of benefits of adaptation policies across
   destinations, thereby providing an alternative for the economic
   assessment of the benefits of non-market goods and climate change
   adaptation policies in tourism, as worldwide information about the costs
   and benefits involved in tourism policy decision making become
   increasingly available.},

Abstract = {The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta enables Bangladesh to sustain a dense
   population, but it also exposes people to natural hazards. This article
   presents findings from the Gibika project, which researches livelihood
   resilience in seven study sites across Bangladesh. This study aims to
   understand how people in the study sites build resilience against
   environmental stresses, such as cyclones, floods, riverbank erosion, and
   drought, and in what ways their strategies sometimes fail. The article
   applies a new methodology for studying people's decision making in
   risk-prone environments: the personal Livelihood History interviews (N =
   28). The findings show how environmental stress, shocks, and
   disturbances affect people's livelihood resilience and why adaptation
   measures can be unsuccessful. Floods, riverbank erosion, and droughts
   cause damage to agricultural lands, crops, houses, and properties.
   People manage to adapt by modifying their agricultural practices,
   switching to alternative livelihoods, or using migration as an adaptive
   strategy. In the coastal study sites, cyclones are a severe hazard. The
   study reveals that when a cyclone approaches, people sometimes choose
   not to evacuate: they put their lives at risk to protect their
   livelihoods and properties. Future policy and adaptation planning must
   use lessons learned from people currently facing environmental stress
   and shocks.},

Title = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane in paddy soil: Role of electron acceptors
   and fertilization in mitigating CH4 fluxes},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {141},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine ecosystems is
   ubiquitous and largely coupled to sulfate reduction. In contrast, the
   role of AOM in terrestrial environments and the dominant electron
   acceptors driving terrestrial AOM needs deeper understanding. Submerged
   rice paddies with intensive CH4 production have a high potential for
   AOM, which can be important for greenhouse gas mitigation strategies.
   Here, we used (CH4)-C-13 to quantify the AOM rates in paddy soils under
   organic (Pig manure, Biochar) and mineral (NPK) fertilization.
   Alternative-to-oxygen electron acceptors for CH4 oxidation, including
   Fe3+, NO3, SO42-, and humic acids, were examined and their potential for
   CH4 mitigation from rice paddies was assessed by (CH4)-C-13 oxidation to
   (CO2)-C-13 under anoxic conditions.
   During 84 days of anaerobic incubation, the cumulative AOM
   (13CH4-derived CO2) reached 0.15-1.3 mu g C g-1 dry soil depending on
   fertilization. NO3- was the most effective electron acceptor, yielding
   an AOM rate of 0.80 ng C g(-1) dry soil h(-1) under Pig manure. The role
   of Fe3+ in AOM remained unclear, whereas SO42- inhibited AOM but
   strongly stimulated the production of unlabeled CO2, indicating
   intensive sulfate-induced decomposition of organic matter. Humic acids
   were the second most effective electron acceptor for AOM, but increased
   methanogenesis by 5-6 times in all fertilization treatments. We
   demonstrated for the first time that organic electron acceptors (humic
   acids) are among the key AOM drivers and are crucial in paddy soils. The
   most pronounced AOM in paddy soils occurred under Pig manure, followed
   by Control and NPK, while AOM was the lowest under Biochar. We estimate
   that nitrate (nitrite)-dependent AOM in paddy fields globally consumes
   similar to 3.9 Tg C-CH4 yr-1, thereby offsetting the global CH4
   emissions by similar to 10-20\%. Thus, from a broader agroecological
   perspective, the organic and mineral fertilizers control an important
   CH4 sink under anaerobic conditions in submerged ecosystems. Appropriate
   adjustments of soil fertilization management strategies would therefore
   help to decrease the net CH4 flux to the atmosphere and hence the global
   warming.},

Abstract = {The current study models the implementation of a 6 MW grid connected
   photovoltaic (PV) system in five Canadian locations. The locations cover
   the most populous cities in five Canadian provinces. Solar map has been
   inspected to ensure different irradiation levels in the considered
   locations Canadian solar market is still underdeveloped in renewable
   integration unlike other European countries. Scarce research has
   provided comparison of potential photovoltaic integration in different
   Canadian climate zones. RETScreen has been used to model the system
   under realistic conditions. The weather conditions were imported from
   the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) website.
   RETScreen has been used as it provides comprehensive five stage analysis
   of renewable projects economic feasibility. It was shown that Regina has
   the highest average annual solar irradiation of 4 kWh/m(2)/day. The PV
   project has a simple payback of 11.2 years. It can offer 55.2 tCO2
   reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The PV system installed in the
   rest of locations have shown reasonable financial feasibility as well.
   The lowest potential was found in Western coast cities like Victoria.
   The payback in such location is two years more and its greenhouse gas
   mitigation potential is 6\% less than Regina This ensures a promising
   future for solar PV system incorporation in the Northern climate unlike
   the common misconception. However, care needs to be taken with different
   project economic parameters. Increases in initial cost, operation and
   maintenance cost, and debt interest rate adversely impact the project
   financial viability.},

Abstract = {Poland's energy policy is determined by: a relatively high energy
   self-reliance indicator based on substantial resources of coal,
   dependence on the import of fossil fuels, especially natural gas from
   Russia, and German-Russian cooperation in the area of energy in the
   Baltic Sea region and the rigorous EU climate policy towards high CO2
   emissions in the generation of electricity. The article presents
   conditioning factors and assumptions of Poland's energy policy and
   consequences of the process of decarbonisation which requires a drastic
   reduction in the participation of coal in the national energy balance.
   Poland's energy policy requires a deep transformation consisting in a
   departure from the monopoly of coal in the electric power generation and
   diversification of energy sources by increasing the role of renewable
   energy (wind, biofuels, geothermal energy) and constructing the first
   nuclear power plant. An increased share of renewable energy will serve
   to decrease the use of primary energy from fossil fuels and will also
   serve to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing the
   energy efficiency is another important goal.},

Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) poses significant threats to northeast and
   mid-Atlantic Tribal Nations' climate and water justice. Existing SLR
   adaptation frameworks do not include Indigenous knowledge. Furthermore,
   SLR adaptation policy prioritizes economic and property rights and is
   misaligned with Indigenous coastal protection priorities. If Tribal
   Nations are to respond effectively to SLR then adaptation frameworks
   must be designed and developed by Indigenous Peoples for Indigenous
   Peoples. Eastern coastal Tribal Nations have a unique history of
   survival and resilience despite settler-colonial expansion in the
   northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of what is currently referred to as
   the United States. Experiences of eastern Atlantic coastal Tribal
   Nations highlight innovative response strategies for SLR adaptation and
   coastal stewardship practices not reflected in existing adaptation
   frameworks for the region. Indigenist SLR adaptation frameworks that
   utilize Indigenous knowledge are needed to combat water security issues
   resulting from SLR risks such as flooding, saltwater intrusion, storm
   surge, and erosion. This article proposes the WAMPUM adaptation
   framework informed by northeastern and mid-Atlantic coastal Tribal
   Nation science and knowledge systems for climate change adaptation to
   SLR.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions from constructed wetlands are mitigated by
   biochar substrates and distinctly affected by tidal flow and
   intermittent aeration modes},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {271},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Biochar substrates and tidal flow (TF) and intermittent aeration (IA)
   operation modes have recently been applied to improve the treatment
   performance of constructed wetlands (CWs), but their roles in regulating
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from CWs are still unclear. In this
   preliminary study, CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes and associated microbial
   characteristics in four groups of subsurface-flow CWs, i.e., ceramsite
   CWs (C-CWs), biochar-amended CWs (B-CWs), intermittently aerated B-CWs
   (AB-CWs) and tide-flow B-CWs (TB-CWs), were comparatively investigated.
   The results showed that biochar amendment significantly mitigated CH4
   and N2O fluxes from the CWs by supporting higher abundances of mcrA and
   nosZ genes and higher ratios of pmoA/mcrA and nosZ/(nirK + nirS), thus
   reducing global warming potential (GWP, a decrease of 55.8\%), in
   addition to promoting total nitrogen (TN) removal by 41.3\%, mainly by
   increasing the abundances and activities of nitriflers and denitriflers.
   The TF mode efficiently improved nitrogen removal, but it greatly
   increased GHG fluxes since large amounts of GHGs escaped from the empty
   CW matrix after water draining. IA abated GHG emissions from the CWs,
   mainly after aeration. TF and IA decreased the abundances of functional
   bacteria and archaea related to C and N transformation, except
   nitriflers, and shaped the microbial community structures. The
   application of a biochar substrate and IA mode can facilitate the design
   and operation of CWs in a more ecologically sustainable way. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Starting from some key outcomes of the first agreement on the Protocol
   on ICZM (Integrated Coastal Zone Management) in the Mediterranean Region
   recently signed in Madrid, the paper seeks to contribute to an
   evaluation of what the application of climate change adaptation policies
   along Italian coasts really could mean.
   This research aims to provide a concrete comparison between the present
   coastal land use and substantive obligations stated in the Protocol.
   Among these, we have mainly considered building limitations in an area
   of at least one hundred metres from the sea. In this context, the paper
   analyses the present land use and its spatial features regarding the
   coastal vulnerability to climate change and the feasibility of
   adaptation strategies.
   An index-based evaluation of the aptness of application of the Protocol
   along Italian coasts has been prepared, showing substantial differences
   in regional potential.
   The research presents methods to select zones where the Protocol could
   be applied and used to consider non-standard solutions, such as
   converting the impact of the railways into a coastal protection
   perspective.
   This study intends to offer a concrete stimulus for a national coastal
   adaptation programme that is still lacking in Italy, suggesting
   innovative methods for a national comparison of regional particularities
   regarding coastal adaptation.},

Title = {Dynamical greenhouse-plus feedback and polar warming amplification. Part
   I: A dry radiative-transportive climate model},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {26},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {661-675},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we use a dry radiative-transportive climate model to
   illustrate that the atmospheric poleward heat transport plays an
   important role in amplifying the polar surface warming due to
   anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Because of a much warmer surface in
   tropics, the anthropogenic radiative forcing is larger in tropics than
   in extratropics for same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. A
   direct response to the anthropogenic radiative forcing is an increase in
   the atmosphere equator-to-pole temperature contrast, leading to a
   strengthening of the atmospheric poleward heat transport. As a result,
   part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the low-latitude
   atmosphere due to an increase in its opacity is transported to high
   latitudes. This implies a ``greenhouse-plus{''}
   ({''}greenhouse-minus{''}) feedback to the high (low) latitude surface
   temperatures, which acts to amplify (reduce) the initial surface warming
   in high (low) latitudes and may cause a larger surface warming in high
   latitudes. The Stefan-Boltzmann feedback suppresses the negative
   dynamical feedback in low latitudes more strongly than the positive in
   high latitudes, amplifying the global mean surface temperature warming.
   Because of the oceanic poleward heat transport, the ocean surface
   temperature in extratropics is warmer in winter compared to the land,
   implying a larger radiative forcing for the same amount of anthropogenic
   greenhouse gases. The same dynamical feedback mechanism would also
   amplify the land surface warming in extratropics by transporting part of
   the extra amount of energy intercepted by the atmosphere over the ocean
   surface to land. This explains partly why the observed land surface
   warming in extratropics is stronger than the surrounding oceans in
   winter.},

Title = {Comparison of greenhouse gas emissions from rice paddy fields under
   different nitrogen fertilization loads in Chongming Island, Eastern
   China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {472},
Pages = {381-388},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Rice is one of the major crops of southern China and Southeast Asia.
   Rice paddies are one of the largest agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG)
   sources in this region because of the application of large quantities of
   nitrogen (N) fertilizers to the plants. In particular, the production of
   methane (CH4) is a concern. Investigating a reasonable amount of
   fertilizers to apply to plants is essential to maintaining high yields
   while reducing GHG emissions. In this study, three levels of fertilizer
   application {[}high (300 kg N/ha), moderate (210 kg N/ha), and low (150
   kg N/ha)] were designed to examine the effects of variation in N
   fertilizer application rate on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and
   nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the paddy fields in Chongming Island,
   Shanghai, China. The high level (300 kg N/ha) represented the typical
   practice adopted by the local farmers in the area. Maximum amounts of
   CH4 and N2O fluxes were observed upon high-level fertilizer application
   in the plots. Cumulative N2O emissions of 23.09, 40.10, and 71.08 mg
   N2O/m(2) were observed over the growing season in 2011 under the low-,
   moderate-, and high-level applications plots, respectively. The field
   data also indicated that soil temperatures at 5 and 10 cm soil depths
   significantly affected soil respiration; the relationship between Rs and
   soil temperature in this study could be described by an exponential
   model. Our study showed that reducing the high rate of fertilizer
   application is a feasible way of attenuating the global-warming
   potential while maintaining the optimum yield for the studied paddy
   fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To mitigate the projected global warming in the 21st century, it is
   well-recognized that society needs to cut CO2 emissions and other
   short-lived warming agents aggressively. However, to stabilize the
   climate at a warming level closer to the present day, such as the ``well
   below 2 degrees C{''} aspiration in the Paris Agreement, a net-zero
   carbon emission by 2050 is still insufficient. The recent IPCC special
   report calls for a massive scheme to extract CO2 directly from the
   atmosphere, in addition to decarbonization, to reach negative net
   emissions at the mid-century mark. Another ambitious proposal is
   solar-radiation-based geoengineering schemes, including injecting sulfur
   gas into the stratosphere. Despite being in public debate for years,
   these two leading geoengineering schemes have not been directly compared
   under a consistent analytical framework using global climate models.
   Here we present the first explicit analysis of the hydroclimate impacts
   of these two geoengineering approaches using two recently available
   large-ensemble (>10 members) model experiments conducted by a family of
   state-of-the-art Earth system models. The CO2-based mitigation
   simulation is designed to include both emission cuts and carbon capture.
   The solar-radiation-based mitigation simulation is designed to inject
   sulfur gas strategically at specified altitudes and latitudes and run a
   feedback control algorithm to avoid common problems previously
   identified such as the overcooling of the tropics and large-scale
   precipitation shifts.
   Our analysis focuses on the projected aridity conditions over the
   Americas in the 21st century in detailed terms of the potential
   mitigation benefits, the temporal evolution, the spatial distribution
   (within North and South America), the relative efficiency, and the
   physical mechanisms. We show that sulfur injection, in contrast to
   previous notions of leading to excessive terrestrial drying (in terms of
   precipitation reduction) while offsetting the global mean greenhouse gas
   (GHG) warming, will instead mitigate the projected drying tendency under
   RCP8.5. The surface energy balance change induced by sulfur injection,
   in addition to the well-known response in temperature and precipitation,
   plays a crucial role in determining the overall terrestrial hydroclimate
   response.
   However, when normalized by the same amount of avoided global warming in
   these simulations, sulfur injection is less effective in curbing the
   worsening trend of regional land aridity in the Americas under RCP8.5
   when compared with carbon capture. Temporally, the climate benefit of
   sulfur injection will emerge more quickly, even when both schemes are
   hypothetically started in the same year of 2020. Spatially, both schemes
   are effective in curbing the drying trend over North America. However,
   for South America, the sulfur injection scheme is particularly more
   effective for the sub-Amazon region (southern Brazil), while the carbon
   capture scheme is more effective for the Amazon region. We conclude that
   despite the apparent limitations (such as an inability to address ocean
   acidification) and potential side effects (such as changes to the ozone
   layer), innovative means of sulfur injection should continue to be
   explored as a potential low-cost option in the climate solution toolbox,
   complementing other mitigation approaches such as emission cuts and
   carbon capture (Cao et al., 2017). Our results demonstrate the urgent
   need for multi-model comparison studies and detailed regional
   assessments in other parts of the world.},

Title = {Make the Most of the Data You've Got: Bayesian Models and a Surrogate
   Species Approach to Assessing Benefits of Upstream Migration Flows for
   the Endangered Australian Grayling},

Abstract = {Environmental water managers must make best use of allocations, and
   adaptive management is one means of improving effectiveness of
   environmental water delivery. Adaptive management relies on generation
   of new knowledge from monitoring and evaluation, but it is often
   difficult to make clear inferences from available monitoring data.
   Alternative approaches to assessment of flow benefits may offer an
   improved pathway to adaptive management. We developed Bayesian
   statistical models to inform adaptive management of the threatened
   Australian grayling (Prototroctes maraena) in the coastal Thomson River,
   South-East Victoria Australia. The models assessed the importance of
   flows in spring and early summer (migration flows) for upstream
   dispersal and colonization of juveniles of this diadromous species.
   However, Australian grayling young-of-year were recorded in low numbers,
   and models provided no indication of the benefit of migration flows. To
   overcome this limitation, we applied the same models to young-of-year of
   a surrogate species (tupong-Pseudaphritis urvilli)-a more common
   diadromous species expected to respond to flow similarly to Australian
   grayling-and found strong positive responses to migration flows. Our
   results suggest two complementary approaches to supporting adaptive
   management of Australian grayling. First, refine monitoring approaches
   to allow direct measurement of effects of migration flows, a process
   currently under way. Second, while waiting for improved data, further
   investigate the use of tupong as a surrogate species. More generally,
   alternative approaches to assessment can improve knowledge to inform
   adaptive management, and this can occur while monitoring is being
   revised to directly target environmental responses of interest.},

Abstract = {Canada's present position is to stabilize emissions of greenhouse gases,
   including CO2, at the 1990 levels by the year 2000. While the major
   element to achieve this is efficiency, future options must be kept open.
   One of the technical options is CO2 removal and disposal. Several
   technical studies are underway, notably a pilot project for CO2 removal
   from a coal-fired electric generating station for use in enhanced oil
   recovery (in Saskatchewan) and a large, Alberta-led feasibility study on
   removal and use in enhanced oil recovery. Potential sinks include
   exhausted natural gas reservoirs in Canada's western sedimentary basin.
   Precipitating out salts may be possible by combining CO2 with the huge
   subsurface brine (evaporites) occurrences in the Western Sedimentary
   Basin and elsewhere. Deep ocean disposal is a distant possibility.
   Technical investigations into removal and disposal should continue.},

Title = {The adaptation towards climate change impacts among islanders in
   Malaysia},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {699},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {The climate change phenomenon has been occurring in every part of the
   world, including Malaysia. In particular, changes such as rising
   temperature, sea level rise, and unstable rain pattern are proven to
   affect the socio-economic routine of the community. Hence, it is
   necessary to learn how to adapt to it, especially those who heavily rely
   on nature stability. The present study examined the adaptation towards
   climate change among islanders in Malaysia. In addition, the current
   research was performed quantitatively using a developed questionnaire as
   the main data collection tool. In this case, a total of 400 islanders
   were selected as the respondents through a multi-stage sampling
   technique. The results revealed that the respondents recorded a moderate
   to high mean score for adaptation aspects namely awareness, dependency
   and structure. Accordingly, a number of recommendations that were
   highlighted can be utilized as a basis to develop community adaptation
   policy that is in line with the islanders' need, ability, and interests.

Abstract = {The debate on emission targets of greenhouse gasses designed to limit
   global climate change has to take into account the ecological
   consequences. One of the clearest ecological consequences is shifts in
   phenology. Linking these shifts to changes in population viability under
   various greenhouse gasses emission scenarios requires a unifying
   framework. We propose a box-in-a-box modeling approach that couples
   population models to phenological change. This approach unifies
   population modeling with both ecological responses to climate change as
   well as evolutionary processes. We advocate a mechanistic embedded
   correlative approach, where the link from genes to population is
   established using a periodic matrix population model. This periodic
   model has several major advantages: (1) it can include complex seasonal
   behaviors allowing an easy link with phenological shifts; (2) it
   provides the structure of the population at each phase, including the
   distribution of genotypes and phenotypes, allowing a link with
   evolutionary processes; and (3) it can incorporate the effect of climate
   at different time periods. We believe that the way climatologists have
   approached the problem, using atmosphere-ocean coupled circulation
   models in which components are gradually included and linked to each
   other, can provide a valuable example to ecologists. We hope that
   ecologists will take up this challenge and that our preliminary modeling
   framework will stimulate research toward a unifying predictive model of
   the ecological consequences of climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the process and results of stakeholder focus

   resilience research project in the northern US Gulf of Mexico. The focus
   groups' purpose was to better understand local coastal professionals'
   and decision-makers' (e.g., natural resource managers, community
   planners, extension and outreach specialists) views on mitigation
   options for coastal hazards (e.g., storm surge, nuisance flooding, sea
   level rise) including use of natural and nature-based features (NNBF;
   e.g., sand dunes, living shorelines, oyster reefs). Overall, results
   revealed that participants were aware of various mitigation options, had
   favorable views toward NNBF infrastructure, and perceived five major
   benefits and six major barriers or challenges with such approaches.
   Designing and implementing NNBF infrastructure was perceived as complex
   and requiring several types of ecological and socioeconomic
   considerations and information for decision-making. We conclude with a
   discussion of findings, practical implications for coastal resilience

Title = {The `responsiveness gap' in RFMOs: The critical role of decision-making
   policies in the fisheries management response to climate change},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {145},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change, owing to their potentially vast reach and
   scale, embody a critical challenge for fisheries management
   organizations. We conduct a systematic literature review to present an
   overview of how the peer-reviewed academic literature recommends
   fisheries management frameworks should respond to the climate
   change-driven uncertainty, vulnerability and risk facing resource bases.
   Our review identifies 21 different potential management responses.
   Adaptive management was the most commonly identified strategy, with
   institutional capacity development and input/output controls also
   frequently cited. We contrast our findings with illustrative cases
   characterizing management practice and outcomes in RFMOs, and argue that
   the ability of RFMOs to implement the climate change mitigation
   strategies identified in our review is a function of an organization's
   decision-making rules. We argue that consensus-based decision-making
   policies limit adaptiveness, and that a `responsiveness gap' exists
   between consensus and majority-based decision-making frameworks. This
   gap will become more evident, and increase in importance, as the impacts
   of climate change shift from potential to kinetic. Considering that
   decision-making rules in RFMOs are unlikely to change, we argue that
   increased analytical effort concentrated on institutional contexts and
   member state interest complexes may promote adaptive management,
   expediting the pace at which scientific recommendations and findings
   inform policy and practise in RFMOs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Tourism, Transport and Climate Change: The Carbon Footprint of
   International Air Traffic on Islands},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many small islands base their economy on tourism. This activity, based
   to a large extent on the movement of millions of people by air
   transport, depends on the use of fossil fuels and, therefore, generates
   a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this work, these
   emissions are evaluated by means of various carbon calculators, taking
   the Canary Islands as an example, which is one of the most highly
   developed tourist archipelagos in the world. The result is that more
   than 6.4 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 are produced per year exclusively
   due to the massive transport of tourists over an average distance of
   more than 3000 km. The relative weight of these emissions is of such
   magnitude that they are equivalent to more than 50\% of the total amount
   produced by the socioeconomic activity of the archipelago. Although,
   individually, it is travelers from Russia and Nordic countries who
   generate the highest carbon footprint due to their greater traveling
   distance, the British and German tourists account for the greatest
   weight in the total, with two-thirds of emissions.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change in small-scale fisheries: Insights from
   indigenous communities in the global north and south},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {160-170},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change is having a significant influence on global fish
   production as well as on small-scale fishers' livelihoods, nutrition,
   and food security. We compared two climate-sensitive small-scale
   fisheries (SSFs) - an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic and the
   Coastal-Vedda in Sri Lanka - to broaden our understanding of how
   fisheries-dependent Indigenous communities respond and adapt to climate
   change impacts. We used three steps to achieve this comparative study.
   To do this, we developed a resilience-based conceptual framework to
   empirically assess adaptations in two SSF communities, based on a
   literature review. Using the proposed framework and collecting
   qualitative field data over three years (2016-2019) to investigate how
   different remote SSFs experience and respond to climate change, we
   assessed Inuit and Coastal-Vedda case studies. The framework provided
   the structure for data analysis and conceptual guidance for two
   empirical assessments and the comparative analysis. Finally, we carried
   out the comparative analysis across the case studies using content
   analysis, identifying adaptive strategies, sources of resilience, and
   characteristics of successful adaptation. Additionally, we used
   discourse analysis to develop sources of resilience and characteristics
   of successful adaptation. Two key adaptive strategies emerged in common
   across the two communities - diversification and adaptive co-management.
   Eight sources of resilience that underpin adaptive capacity: i) use of
   diverse kinds of knowledge; ii) practice of different ways of learning;
   iii) use of community-based institutions; iv) efforts to improve human
   agency; v) unique worldviews; vi) specific cultural attributes that keep
   up with adaptation; vii) effective social networks; and viii) a high
   level of flexibility. Definitive characteristics that need to promote
   successful community adaptation: continuous learning through knowledge
   co-production; capacity-building to improve human agency; a
   place-specific nature (rootedness); collective action and partnerships
   through community-based institutions; and flexibility.},

Abstract = {The soil attributes controlling the CO2, and CH4 emissions were assessed
   in semiarid mangrove soils (NE-Brazil) under different anthropogenic
   activities. Soil samples were collected from different mangroves under
   different anthropogenic impacts, e.g., shrimp farming (Jaguaribe River);
   urban wastes (Coco River) and a control site (Timonha River). The sites
   were characterized according to the sand content; physicochemical
   parameters (Eh and pH); total organic C; soil C stock (SCS) and
   equivalent SCS (SCSEQV); total P and N; dissolved organic C (DOC); and
   the degree of pyritization (DOP). The CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the soils
   were assessed using static closed chambers. Higher DOC and SCS and the
   lowest DOP promote greater CO2 emission. The CH4 flux was only observed
   at Jaguaribe which presented higher DOP, compared to that found in
   mangroves from humid tropical climates. Semiarid mangrove soils cannot
   be characterized as important greenhouse gas sources, compared to humid
   tropical mangroves. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fisher's perceptions inform adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability
   to climate change in a Mexican natural protected area},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fishing activities are vulnerable to climate change and natural climatic
   variability. Fishery-dependent coastal communities with low
   diversification of economic activities are especially threatened by
   climate change. We prioritized adaptation measures to climate change,
   through participatory community workshops that captured stakeholders'
   knowledge and perceptions, including fishers, scientists, and managers
   within the Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, in Baja California, Mexico.
   During these participatory community workshops, participants addressed
   the potential changes in the spatial distribution of fishery resources,
   the loss of ocean productivity, the increase in sea level, and higher
   storm frequency. The adaptation measures proposed to reduce
   vulnerability to these climate change effects can be grouped in three
   categories: 1) economic diversification, 2) improvement in the
   processing and commercialization of fishery products, and 3) fisheries
   management. Some of the key adaptation measures included diversification
   of fishing activities, processing and marketing, and improving fisheries
   management. In general, Mexico has the comprehensive policy framework
   necessary to implement these measures, but requires financing and a more
   efficient regulatory process that can respond to the rapid effects of
   climate change in marine systems.},

Title = {Microalgae as embedded environmental monitors},
Journal = {ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {954},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In marine ecosystems, microalgae are an important component as they
   transform large quantities of inorganic compounds into biomass and
   thereby impact environmental chemistry. Of particular relevance is
   phytoplankton's sequestration of atmospheric CO2, a greenhouse gas, and
   nitrate, one cause of harmful algae blooms. On the other hand,
   microalgae sensitively respond to changes in their chemical environment,
   which initiates an adaptation of their chemical composition. Analytical
   methodologies were developed in this study that utilize microalgae's
   adaptation as a novel approach for in-situ environmental monitoring.
   Longterm applications of these novel methods are investigations of
   environmental impacts on phytoplankton's sequestration performance and
   their nutritional value to higher organisms feeding on them.
   In order to analyze the chemical composition of live microalgae cells
   (Nannochloropsis oculata), FTIR-ATR spectroscopy has been employed. From
   time series of IR spectra, the formation of bio-sediment can be
   monitored and it has been shown that the nutrient availability has a
   small but observable impact. Since this bio-sediment formation is
   governed by several biological parameters of the cells such as growth
   rate, size, buoyancy, number of cells, etc., this enables studies of
   chemical environment's impact on biomass formation and the cells'
   physical parameters.
   Moreover, the spectroscopic signature of these microalgae has been
   determined from cultures grown under 25 different CO2 and NO3- mixtures
   (200 ppm-600 ppm CO2, 0.35 mM-0.75 mM NO3-). A novel, nonlinear modeling
   methodology coined `Predictor Surfaces' is being presented by means of
   which the nonlinear responses of the cells to their chemical environment
   could reliably be described. This approach has been utilized to measure
   the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere over the phytoplankton culture
   as well as the nitrate concentration dissolved in their growing
   environment. The achieved precision of concentration predictions were a
   few percent of the measurement range. Moreover, the Predictor Surface
   itself allows for a chemical interpretation of the cells' response to a
   shift in their chemical environment. This will open new approaches to
   study the link between concentration levels in an ecosystem and the
   biological consequences for this ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {On the relationship between metrics to compare greenhouse gases the case
   of IGTP, GWP and SGTP},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {139-147},
Abstract = {Metrics for comparing greenhouse gases are analyzed, with a particular
   focus on the integrated temperature change potential (IGTP) following a
   call from IPCC to investigate this metric. It is shown that the global
   warming potential (GWP) and IGTP are asymptotically equal when the time
   horizon approaches infinity when standard assumptions about a constant
   background atmosphere are used. The difference between IGTP and GWP is
   estimated for different greenhouse gases using an upwelling diffusion
   energy balance model with different assumptions on the climate
   sensitivity and the parameterization governing the rate of ocean heat
   uptake. It is found that GWP and IGTP differ by some 10\% for CH4 (for a
   time horizon of less than 500 yr), and that the relative difference
   between GWP and IGTP is less for gases with a longer atmospheric life
   time. Further, it is found that the relative difference between IGTP and
   GWP increases with increasing rates of ocean heat uptake and increasing
   climate sensitivity since these changes increase the inertia of the
   climate system. Furthermore, it is shown that IGTP is equivalent to the
   sustained global temperature change potential (SGTP) under standard
   assumptions when estimating GWPs. We conclude that while it matters
   little for abatement policy whether IGTP, SGTP or GWP is used when
   making tradeoffs, it is more important to decide whether society should
   use a metric based on time integrated effects such as GWP, a ``snapshot
   metric{''} as GTP, or metrics where both economics and physical
   considerations are taken into account. Of equal importance is the
   question of how to choose the time horizon, regardless of the chosen
   metric. For both these overall questions, value judgments are needed.},

Title = {A sea trial of enhancing carbon removal from Chinese coastal waters by
   stimulating seaweed cultivation through artificial upwelling},
Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {101},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The potential of artificial upwelling (AU) in enhancing transport of
   nutrient-rich bottom water to the surface, stimulating seaweed growth
   and consequently increasing organic carbon removal from coastal waters
   to land after harvest has attracted increasing scientific interest. This
   practice, however, hardly have field experiments to confirm the
   hypothesis. The coastal mariculture environment requires rigid AU system
   that not only can withstand rough weather conditions but also be
   effective in fertilizing the surface ocean. In this paper, a new
   solar-powered, air-lifted AU system was applied to study the potential
   effect on regional carbon removal. Experiments were conducted in the
   oligotrophic Aoshan Bay, Shandong Province, China. Comparison of the
   temperature and nutrient column between AU influenced site and the
   reference site suggests that the nutrient rich bottom water has been
   successfully lifted to the surface. The results show that the growth of
   seaweeds was effectively stimulated by AU. The average weight of a
   single plant has increased by 8.98g, and consequently an extra carbon
   removal potential of 14.8 thousand tons in Chinese coastal waters could
   be expected if the system can be applied along the Chinese coastal
   waters.},

Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization (IMO) pays close attention to
   the issues of reducing the harmful impact of shipping on the

   The paper presents the results of assessing the possibility of reducing
   EEDI and meeting current and future requirements for its level. Methods
   for reducing EEDI by improving the parameters of the propulsion complex
   and, in general, ship power plants of new vessels are considered. The
   advantages and disadvantages of various methods for reducing CO2
   emissions are described. Practically achievable limits of EEDI reduction
   are determined. Prospective ways of increasing the efficiency of a
   number of the considered methods are indicated. The possibility of
   achieving zero emissions is shown. A number of contradictions with other

Abstract = {Rapid economic development induces energy shortage and environmental
   pollution, and the utilization of renewable energy becomes a hot topic.
   Taking the tidal energy in Shanghai as a research object, this article
   analyzes the reserves, potential developing mode, and potential capacity
   on the basis of observation data for 18 years. The results show that the
   tidal energy resources are abundant in Shanghai's sea area of China.
   Through tidal range analysis and tidal energy reserves calculation, the
   tidal barrage can be built to explore the tidal energy from the water
   head difference between the flood tide and the ebb in the north branch
   of Yangtze River Estuary, while the tidal turbines can be built to
   generate electricity in the Northern Hangzhou Bay. The tidal energy
   reserve is 3.65 million kW per year in Shanghai's sea area of China. The
   annual electricity generating capacity is 10.07 billion kWh, which is
   equivalent to 3.63 million tons of standard coal, accounting for 3.72\%
   of Shanghai energy consumption in 2007. It can also reduce 9.50 million
   tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, 30.8 thousand tons of sulfur
   dioxide emissions, and 26.8 thousand tons of nitrogen oxides emissions.
   The utilization of tidal energy is an effective method to solve

Abstract = {The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a union occurring in the arid
   subtropical belt of the world. Contemporary climate change is a serious
   environmental issue at the regional and global levels. The main purpose
   of this study was to investigate the changes and trends in the regional
   climate in the GCC countries in terms of the land surface temperatures
   and surface anomalies, precipitation, and sea surface temperatures over
   the first two decades of this millennium. Research data exclusively
   relied on satellite remote sensing. Spatial, statistical, and
   cartographic analyses were performed to extract, manipulate, and display
   thematic maps reflecting the changes and trends of the regional climate.
   The results showed that notable climate changes were obvious and
   frequent throughout the GCC countries, with symptoms influencing the
   atmosphere, lithosphere, and the hydrosphere of the region. However, a
   prominent gradient in the severity of climate change occurred from north
   to south. Remarkably, serious impacts were observed in Kuwait and
   eastern Saudi Arabia, while the least effects were recorded in Oman. The
   study denotes the competence of remote sensing for monitoring regional

   Evaluated in a Circular Carbon Economy Perspective},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sustainability and waste management on board are key issues that need to
   be addressed by the maritime sector also in terms of greenhouse gas
   emissions (GHG). With the aim of evaluating waste management
   alternatives in a circular economy perspective, the study examines a
   combined system for the optimisation of ship waste management and
   assesses its possible use for energy purposes. Different systems are
   analysed in relation to their GHG emission reduction potential
   regardless of routes and ports of destination. A SWOT (Strengths,
   Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis was carried out on waste
   management alternatives in order to preliminary identify their potential
   in terms of GHG emissions reduction, cost, environmental sustainability,
   methodological coherence, feasibility and replicability. Following this
   analysis, two case studies of particular interest were identified: (1)
   the thermo-chemical treatment of waste oils and sludge to obtain fuel
   oils; (2) the installation of a waste-to-energy plant and subsequent
   energy recovery on board. UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change) methodologies were applied to these two case studies to
   calculate GHG emission reduction resulting from their implementation.
   The obtained results are presented with the aim of supporting
   sustainable waste management strategies on board in a circular carbon

Abstract = {Permanent freshwater and brackish marshes are the typical wetland type
   of the Mediterranean Spanish coast. Historically, alterations to the
   original morphological and hydrological characteristics of some these
   ecosystems have increased their trophic status, which could influence
   the carbon (C) balance, while other ecosystems remain close to their
   natural condition. In this work, the main processes related to the C
   cycle were studied in several Mediterranean coastal marshes with
   different degrees of alteration and in sites restored and managed in
   different ways. Carbon associated with greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4)
   was determined using gas exchange methods for plankton, benthos, and
   sediments, as well as net production estimations for helophytes, to
   determine the influence of wetland conservation status, restoration, and
   management practices on C balances. Freshwater and brackish marshes
   showed capacity for C capture, especially in the restored sites (similar
   to 950g m(-2) yr(-1)), with a paramount role of helophytes. Differences
   among the study sites revealed the importance of alterations and
   restoration for C exchange. Specifically, a highly altered site showed
   increased rates of aerobic respiration compared to undisturbed sites,
   with a decrease in C storage capacity to similar to 50g m(-2) yr(-1).
   Management practices resulting in instability of the organic sediments
   favoured degradative metabolism, with release of stored C and
   concomitant increases in CH4 emissions. Our results indicate that the
   hydromorphological alterations in these sites may convert healthy
   ecosystems contributing to C sequestration and climate change mitigation
   into C-emitting ecosystems.},

Title = {Climate adaptation in South America with emphasis in coastal areas: the
   state-of-the-art and case studies from Venezuela and Uruguay},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {364-382},
Abstract = {The South American (SA) region is particularly vulnerable to climate
   change and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events which threaten its
   economy and sustainable development. Therefore, climate adaptation is a
   regional priority. At least 6\% of SA population live at low-elevation
   coastal zones (LECZ) exposed to sea-level rise, ENSO variability and
   storminess. This paper reviews some recent and current adaptation
   experiences in SA coasts focusing on (i) socioeconomic and vulnerability
   status, (ii) links between adaptation and sustainable development, and
   (iii) constraints to adaptation. Despite the regional economic growth
   and poverty reduction over the last decade, an adaptation deficit to
   current climate variability persists. Overall, SA countries show a poor
   link between public policies, adaptation, and theoretical-academic
   scope. Public adaptation efforts in coastal areas are mostly oriented
   towards risk assessment, vulnerability and reduction of impacts at urban
   and touristic settlements. Many experiences developed from the academy
   follow the community-based adaptation (CBA) approach mainstreamed into
   local plans. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, social
   priorities, allocation of resources and the multifaceted impacts of
   climate change. Two coastal CBA case studies in Venezuela and Uruguay
   based on scientific and local knowledge show that non-structural
   adaptation measures can improve the populations' perception of risks,
   provided that stakeholders, mainly the community, are informed and
   integrated to define adaptation actions. There are lots of plans and
   less specific actions. We propose that the assessment of adaptation
   success has to rely on implementation and effectiveness criteria rather
   than solely on plans.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {18},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The deglacial change of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
   (AMOC) since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; similar to 21 ka) has been
   studied extensively in both reconstructions and model simulations. While
   reconstructions suggest a shoaling of AMOC at the LGM, the strength of
   glacial AMOC relative to the modern day remains highly uncertain in both
   reconstructions and models. Using transient simulations of climate
   evolution forced by individual deglacial forcings since the LGM, this
   study shows that the uncertainties in glacial AMOC intensity can be
   caused by a competition between the elevated glacial Northern Hemisphere
   (NH) ice sheets and the reduced glacial greenhouse gases, in which the
   former tend to strengthen the AMOC while the latter play an opposite
   role. In spite of the dramatic difference of climate between the LGM and
   the present, the cancellation between the impacts of the two forcings
   leaves the strength of the glacial AMOC not too different from the
   modern day (0.5 Sv stronger in our study; 1 Sv  10(6) m(3) s(-1)).
   Furthermore, consistent with theoretical analysis, the response of the
   AMOC return flow to either forcing is predominantly compensated by an
   interbasin exchange between the Indo-Pacific (including the Indo-Pacific
   sector of Southern Ocean) and Atlantic via the Agulhas Current.},

Title = {The Role of Nanofluids and Renewable Energy in the Development of
   Sustainable Desalination Systems: A Review},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Desalination accounts for 1\% of the total global water consumption and
   is an energy-intensive process, with the majority of operational
   expenses attributed to energy consumption. Moreover, at present, a
   significant portion of the power comes from traditional
   fossil-fuel-fired power plants and the greenhouse gas emissions
   associated with power production along with concentrated brine discharge
   from the process, pose a severe threat to the environment. Due to the
   dramatic impact of climate change, there is a major opportunity to
   develop sustainable desalination processes to combat the issues of brine
   discharge, greenhouse gas emissions along with a reduction in energy
   consumption per unit of freshwater produced. Nanotechnology can play a
   vital role to achieve specific energy consumption reduction as
   nanofluids application increases the overall heat transfer coefficient
   enabling the production of more water for the same size desalination
   plant. Furthermore, concentrated brine discharge harms the marine
   ecosystems, and hence, this problem must also be solved to support the
   objective of sustainable desalination. Several studies have been carried
   out in the past several years in the field of nanotechnology
   applications for desalination, brine treatment and the role of renewable
   energy in desalination. This paper aims to review the major advances in
   this field of nanotechnology for desalination. Furthermore, a hypothesis
   for developing an integrated solar thermal and nanofluid sustainable
   desalination system, based on the cyclic economy model, is proposed.},

Title = {Spatial and Temporal Variability of Diffusive CO2 and CH4 Fluxes From

Abstract = {Variability in greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs creates
   uncertainty in global estimates of C emissions from reservoirs. This
   study examines the temporal and spatial variability in CO2 and CH4
   surface water concentrations and diffusive fluxes from an Amazonian
   reservoir using an original data set combining both a high temporal (1
   central site x 22 years) and spatial (44 sites x 1 season) resolution
   monitoring. The gas concentrations at the central site decreased over
   time and suggested reduced bioavailability of C in the initial flooded
   soil but exhibited strong seasonal variation. Not accounting for this
   variability may result in uncertainties in estimates of annual
   concentrations (ranging from -68.9\% to +260\% for CH4 and from -71.5\%
   to +156\% for CO2) and thus in estimates of diffusive gas emissions. Gas
   concentrations and diffusive fluxes exhibited high spatial variability
   in the reservoir, 24 years after impoundment. In particular, diffusive
   fluxes were higher in littoral and transitional areas than in open
   areas, suggesting a large contribution of allochthonous C to current
   gaseous emissions. Not accounting for this spatial variability in
   diffusive fluxes may underestimate the total emissions expressed in CO2
   equivalents from the whole reservoir by 50.7\%. Our study stresses the
   importance of well-resolved temporal and spatial monitoring to provide
   reliable estimated of C emissions and a comprehensive understanding of
   the processes involved; both of these inputs are needed to support
   decision-making for developing energy strategies.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment and cost analysis of fly ash-rice husk ash blended
   alkali-activated concrete},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The utilization of industrial and agricultural by-products for the
   production of alkali activated concrete (AAC) has the potential to yield
   significant benefits towards sustainability goals. To be a viable
   material, the construction industry requires a construction material
   that achieves the requisite strength and the other property requirements
   as specified in codes and standards while demonstrating improved
   sustainability criteria. Fly ash and Rice Husk Ash (RHA) are abundantly
   available waste products, principally located in Asian countries.
   Currently, a significant proportion of these materials are disposed of
   in landfills, lagoons and rivers but offer potential to utilize in AAC.
   Hence, the identification of variables associated with fly ash and fly
   ah-RHA blended AAC by utilizing fly ash and RHA is vital. This study
   quantifies the environmental and economic factors by assessing the
   Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, environmental impacts and benefits, and
   cost analysis of utilizing fly ash and RHA in AAC compared to Portland
   Cement (PC) concrete. Alkaline activator is a key component responsible
   for the highest GHG emission, cost and environmental impact amounts
   obtained for fly ash geopolymer and blended alkali-activated concrete
   compared with PC concrete. Alkali activators contribute to 74\% of the
   total GHG emission, while heat curing contributed only 9\% to the total
   GHG emission. The addition of 10\% RHA to alkali-activated concrete
   showed a slight benefit for the analysis. Utilization of waste fly ash
   and RHA is responsible for providing significant benefits in terms of
   fresh and marine water ecotoxicity by avoiding waste disposal at the
   dumpsites, rivers, and storage lagoons.},

Title = {Carbon dioxide dynamics from sediment, sediment-water interface and
   overlying water in the aquaculture shrimp ponds in subtropical
   estuaries, southeast China},

Abstract = {Aquaculture ponds can emit a large amount carbon dioxide (CO2), with the
   consequence of exacerbating global climate change. Many studies about
   CO2 dynamics across the water-air interface, but CO2 in sediment and
   overlying water received relative less attention. In this study, CO2
   concentration in sediment porewater, the diffusive CO2 fluxes across the
   sediment-water interface (SWI), and the CO2 production rates in the
   overlying water (CO2-wp) were determined in the shrimp ponds in the Min
   River Estuary (MRE) and Jiulong River Estuary (JRE), southeast China, to
   analyze the dynamics of CO2 among different growth stages of shrimps.
   Our results showed large variations in porewater CO2 concentrations, CO2
   diffusive fluxes and CO2-wp rates among different growth stages, with
   markedly larger values in the middle stage of shrimp growth. The
   temporal variation of CO2 in both estuarine ponds followed closely the
   seasonal change of temperature. The internal CO2 production (CO2 JO in
   these ponds was dominated by sediments. A significantly larger mean
   porewater CO2 concentrations, diffusive fluxes and production rate were
   observed in the MRE ponds than those in the JRE ponds, which could be
   attributed to the lower water salinity and a larger source of carbon
   substrates in the former estuary. Considering a total surface area of
   6.63 x 10(3) km(2) across the mariculture ponds in subtropical
   estuaries, it is estimated conservatively that approximately 100
   Gigagram (Gg) of dissolved organic carbon and 190 Gg of dissolved
   inorganic carbon were transported annually from the mariculture ponds
   into China's coastal areas. Because of the substantial supply of
   dissolved carbon, the adjacent coastal waters receiving effluent
   discharge from the mariculture ponds could become ``hotspots{''} of CO2
   emissions. Our results highlight the role of aqua culture pond as a
   major CO2 source in China's coastal areas, and effective actions are
   needed to alleviate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these ponds.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions of Norwegian seafoods: From comprehensive to
   simplified assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {The seafood sector is facing difficulties to meet the increasing demand
   for product greenhouse gas emission (GHG) assessments. We quantified
   GHGs of important seafood products of Norway, the world's second largest
   seafood exporter. We present results and improvement options for
   products of farmed salmon and wild-caught shrimp, king crab, cod, and
   herring, followed to their dominating markets, based on detailed data
   for 2017. To enable more frequent monitoring, without engaging in a full
   assessment, we then suggest a simplified approach, focusing on the main
   drivers of production-related emissions. The simplified approach is used
   to analyze temporal trends from 2007-2017 for fisheries and 1990-2017
   for salmon aquaculture. Finally, the simplified approach was compared to
   the comprehensive assessment for 2017 to define species-specific
   upscaling factors. Results show that salmon and crustacean products in
   2017 caused higher emissions than cod and herring products, with feed
   and fuel use being the main emission drivers, whereas airfreighted
   products had the highest emissions of all products. Large improvement
   potential from average to best performers within each production system
   exists. The simplified approach shows that the fuel-use intensity of
   Norwegian fisheries has increased by almost 50\% for shrimp over the
   past decade whereas it has decreased for fish by 20\% for demersal
   species such as cod and 5-10\% for pelagic species such as herring.
   Feed-related emissions for salmon, on the other hand, have increased by
   almost 30\% during the same period, because of an increasing feed
   conversion ratio and increased inclusion of emission-intensive feed
   inputs.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies for coral reef ecosystems in Small Island
   Developing States: Integrated modelling of local pressures and long-term
   climate changes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {253},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Planning and decision-making vastly benefit from a holistic and
   systematic understanding of the long-term impacts of climate change and
   other non-climatic stressors on the health and resilience of coral reef
   ecosystems, and the efficacy of adaptation strategies and management
   interventions on mitigating these impacts and maintaining ecosystem
   condition and associated ecosystem service. This study reports on an
   approach to modelling coral reef stressors and possible adaptation
   interventions using the coral reef ecosystem of Port Resolution on Tanna
   Island, Vanuatu as the case study serving as a microcosm of endangered
   Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). A novel participatory
   modelling framework was developed and followed in a stepwise manner to
   integrate local and long-term climate change pressures by coupling
   structural analysis and the Bayesian Network (BN) techniques. The BN
   model was quantified through an advanced consolidated data-induced,
   evidence-based, and expert-driven approach that incorporated: (1)
   projections of future climate conditions and changing human activities;
   (2) the influences of multiple stressors including physical
   environmental and sociological factors; and (3) spatial variability in
   the key processes and variables. The first and second phases
   conceptualised the whole system by providing a graphical presentation of
   system variables within the Driver-Pressure-StateImpact (DPSI) framework
   using the structural analysis technique. In the third phase, the BN
   technique was used to integrate the outcomes of multidisciplinary
   assessments and analysis with experts' opinion. The BN modelling phase
   was completed based on evidence extracted from literature which reported
   the results of regional and downscaled climate models, GIS-based
   analysis, parametrised data obtained from the region, and tacit
   knowledge elicited from experts. The validated model was employed to
   anticipate the future health and resilience condition of coral reefs
   under different sets of climatic trajectories and adaptive responses
   scenarios. The results predict the risks to the health and resilience of
   the Port Resolution coral reef system from the adverse impacts of
   climate change and harmful human activities and the possible success of
   adaptations strategies. A sobering conclusion was that despite the
   current satisfactory condition of coral reefs in the case study zone,
   their health and resilience would be severely threatened by 2070 in the
   absence of implementing adaptation strategies and associated sustainable
   management interventions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Enhanced CO2 uptake at a shallow Arctic Ocean seep field overwhelms the
   positive warming potential of emitted methane},

   AMERICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},

Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Continued warming of the Arctic Ocean in coming decades is projected to
   trigger the release of teragrams (1 Tg = 10(6) tons) of methane from
   thawing subsea permafrost on shallow continental shelves and
   dissociation of methane hydrate on upper continental slopes. On the
   shallow shelves (< 100 m water depth), methane released from the
   seafloor may reach the atmosphere and potentially amplify global
   warming. On the other hand, biological uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   has the potential to offset the positive warming potential of emitted
   methane, a process that has not received detailed consideration for
   these settings. Continuous sea-air gas flux data collected over a
   shallow ebullitive methane seep field on the Svalbard margin reveal
   atmospheric CO2 uptake rates (-33,300 +/-7,900 mu mol m(-2) . d(-1))
   twice that of surrounding waters and similar to 1,900 times greater than
   the diffusive sea-air methane efflux (17.3 +/- 4.8 mu mol m(-2) .
   d(-1)). The negative radiative forcing expected from this CO2 uptake is
   up to 231 times greater than the positive radiative forcing from the
   methane emissions. Surface water characteristics (e.g., high dissolved
   oxygen, high pH, and enrichment of C-13 in CO2) indicate that upwelling
   of cold, nutrient-rich water from near the seafloor accompanies methane
   emissions and stimulates CO2 consumption by photosynthesizing
   phytoplankton. These findings challenge the widely held perception that
   areas characterized by shallow-water methane seeps and/or strongly
   elevated sea-air methane flux always increase the global atmospheric
   greenhouse gas burden.},

Abstract = {In order to overcome the electricity demand in the country and in its
   effort to reduce the greenhouse gas emission and climate change, South
   African (SA) government is encouraging research in the field of
   renewable energy (RE). Higher educational institutions in each province
   are involve in different renewable energy projects found by provincial
   governments and private companies. This paper presents an evaluation of
   RE potential sources in the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). It is found
   that KZN province has a RE potential exploitable of about 45 GW divided
   into 53.63 \% of global normal irradiance (GHI), 23.28 \% of direct
   normal irradiance (DNI), 13.52 \% of wind energy, 9.51 \% of geothermal
   and 0.06 \% of biomass energy that can be converted into electricity,
   ocean energy and hydropower excluded. With the results exposed in this
   article, further investigations can be done to determine the net
   electrical energy that can be produced from those sources for design of
   RE systems and energy harvesting as well as the appropriate areas to
   install RE systems. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   livelihood security of the people that depend on the reefs. Adaptive
   management strategies are needed to adequately deal with these threats,
   but they require an understanding of the underlying drivers, which often
   originate and act on multiple levels. Using a social-ecological system
   approach, the coral reef fishery of the Spermonde Archipelago in South
   Sulawesi/Indonesia is assessed to identify key drivers and strategic
   leverage points for management. Under the influence of international
   markets and technological changes, several export-oriented fisheries
   have developed in the area that led to distinct subsequent peaks in
   fishing activity in a pattern of sequential marine resource
   exploitation. In response to stressors such as seasonality and
   overfishing of individual locations or species, a number of coping
   strategies have developed locally. These include extensive borrowing
   from fishing patrons, diversification of fishing methods, fishing
   migrations, and the crafting of local institutions to regulate fishing
   activity. However, the coping strategies hinder, and even decrease, the
   capacity of the system to adapt to future stressors and undermine the
   sustainability of the fishery. Potential strategies that target
   different levels of the fishery system in order to strengthen adaptive
   management are identified.},

Abstract = {For the first time an attempt was made to quantify the methane fluxes in
   the different land-uses of the semi-arid region in India. Measurement of
   methane fluxes was carried out using static chamber in a highly saline
   wetland - Sambhar Lake, an urban lake - Mansagar Lake, a small reservoir
   - Kanota Dam and a landfill site in Jaipur district of Rajasthan, India.
   The results showed that semi-arid region has a significant impact on the
   methane budget. The parameters for water and soil were also studied and
   a positive correlation of soil organic matter and total organic carbon
   with methane fluxes were obtained. In the presence of high sulphate,
   methane production was observed at Kanota Dam which may be due to the
   symbiotic relationship between methanogens and sulphur reducing
   bacteria. The study revealed that the role of the semi-arid region is
   important for global methane budgeting and Sambhar Lake may play a
   significant role in methane budget with suitable conservation measures.},

Abstract = {Coastal salt marshes play an important role in mitigating global warming
   by removing atmospheric carbon at a high rate. We investigated the
   environmental controls and emergent scaling of major greenhouse gas
   (GHG) fluxes such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in coastal
   salt marshes by conducting data analytics and empirical modeling. The
   underlying hypothesis is that the salt marsh GHG fluxes follow emergent
   scaling relationships with their environmental drivers, leading to
   parsimonious predictive models. CO2 and CH4 fluxes, photosynthetically
   active radiation (PAR), air and soil temperatures, well water level,
   soil moisture, and porewater pH and salinity were measured during
   May-October 2013 from four marshes in Waquoit Bay and adjacent
   estuaries, MA, USA. The salt marshes exhibited high CO2 uptake and low
   CH4 emission, which did not significantly vary with the nitrogen loading
   gradient -1 (5-126 kg.ha(-1).year ) among the salt marshes. Soil
   temperature was the strongest driver of both fluxes, representing 2 and
   4-5 times higher influence than PAR and salinity, respectively. Well
   water level, soil moisture, and pH did not have a predictive control on
   the GHG fluxes, although both fluxes were significantly higher during
   high tides than low tides. The results were leveraged to develop
   emergent power law-based parsimonious scaling models to accurately
   predict the salt marsh GHG fluxes from PAR, soil temperature, and
   salinity (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency = 0.80-0.91). The scaling models are
   available as a user-friendly Excel spreadsheet named Coastal Wetland GHG
   Model to explore scenarios of GHG fluxes in tidal marshes under a
   changing climate and environment.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs face multiple anthropogenic threats, from pollution and
   overfishing to the dual effects of greenhouse gas emissions: rising sea
   temperature and ocean acidification {[}1]. While the abundance of coral
   has declined in recent decades {[}2, 3], the implications for humanity
   are difficult to quantify because they depend on ecosystem function
   rather than the corals themselves. Most reef functions and ecosystem
   services are founded on the ability of reefs to maintain their
   three-dimensional structure through net carbonate accumulation {[}4].
   Coral growth only constitutes part of a reef's carbonate budget;
   bioerosion processes are influential in determining the balance between
   net structural growth and disintegration {[}5, 6]. Here, we combine
   ecological models with carbonate budgets and drive the dynamics of
   Caribbean reefs with the latest generation of climate models. Budget
   reconstructions using documented ecological perturbations drive shallow
   (6-10 m) Caribbean forereefs toward an increasingly fragile carbonate
   balance. We then projected carbonate budgets toward 2080 and contrasted
   the benefits of local conservation and global action on climate change.
   Local management of fisheries (specifically, no-take marine reserves)
   and the watershed can delay reef loss by at least a decade under
   ``business-as-usual{''} rises in greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   local action must be combined with a low-carbon economy to prevent
   degradation of reef structures and associated ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Deep cuts in CO2 emissions will be required to stabilise and, in the
   long term, decrease CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Technologies
   for capturing CO2 from major stationary sources (power stations,
   industrial plants, etc) and storing that CO2 for long periods of time is
   one of few near term options for decreasing CO2 emissions. This
   transition to low carbon intensity energy and possibly the hydrogen
   economy through renewables and in the long-term technological
   developments such as artificial photosynthesis.
   Capture Of CO2 from post combustion emissions can be done using a range
   of technologies though costs are currently high and dependent on the
   concentration Of CO2 in the emissions. Techniques include solvents,
   pressure swing adsorption and the use of membranes. Options for
   decreasing capture costs by increasing the concentration Of CO2 in the
   emission stream include the use of oxyfuels (in pulverized fuel types
   boilers) and by moving to integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
   operations either simply for power generation or for poly-generation
   opportunities.
   Once the CO2 has been captured it can be stored using a variety of
   methods. Storage in the ocean has been suggested but is considered an
   unlikely option because of environmental uncertainties and political
   opposition. Mineral storage is a niche opportunity. The greatest
   potential lies in geological storage Of CO2 and this option is
   commanding, increased attention from the Australian and international
   community.
   In Australia, the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas
   Technologies (CO2CRC) is an important new initiative that will support
   energy companies and energy intensive industries in meeting challenges
   posed by greenhouse gas issues and assist them in their efforts to
   reduce their emissions profile.
   The progress of geo-sequestration and the challenges in the capture and
   separation of CO2 in the process industries are discussed.},

Title = {Understanding smallholder farmers' capacity to respond to climate change
   in a coastal community in Central Vietnam},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Pages = {701-716},
Abstract = {Climate change as expressed by erratic rainfall, increased flooding,
   extended droughts, frequency tropical cyclones or saline water
   intrusion, poses severe threats to smallholder farmers in Vietnam.
   Adaptation of the agricultural sector is vital to increase the
   resilience of smallholder farmers' livelihoods in times of climate
   change. To complement efforts already implemented by farmers to reduce
   social vulnerability it is important to understand how farmers perceive
   their current and future capacity to adapt to climate change. This paper
   aims to explore smallholder farmers' capacity to respond to climate
   change in current and future agricultural production. We carried out
   open, in-depth interviews (n=13), focus group discussions, and
   structured interviews (n=114) in the Thua Thien Hue province. Our
   findings show that farmers nowadays experience more extreme climate
   variability. Farmers report increasing stresses due to temperature
   increase and droughts. The autonomous adaptation strategies adopted by
   farmers include; adjusting the season calendar, using tolerant varieties
   and breeds, applying integrated crop production models, and income
   diversification. The motives for adopting particular planned adaptation
   options differ between farmers in crop production and livestock
   production. Four factors were found to be significant (p<.05) in
   influencing the spread of adaptation measures (AMs) farmers adopted:
   farm income, the number of available information sources, number of
   workers on the farm, and farmable land available during the summer
   season. Farmers report several barriers to implement adaptation
   strategies including; market price fluctuations, lack of skilled labour,
   lack of climate change information, and lack of capacity to learn and
   apply techniques in their daily practice. While both crop and livestock
   farmers participated in one or several training courses on climate
   change in the past years, livestock farmers were still uncertain about
   their future capacity and possible AMs.},

Abstract = {Wetlands play an important role as carbon stores; however, these
   ecosystems also contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). In
   this study, we compared the carbon balance (CB) in coastal freshwater
   marshes and swamps. We use three different methods, which are described
   in the literature. The first is based upon the CB basis (Carbon-emission
   subtracted to Carbon-sequestration), without considering the global
   warming potential (GWP) of GHG. The second method is a CB considering
   the GWP, and the third method estimated the wetland function as carbon
   sink or source, by using a dynamic model with different horizon times
   (20, 100 and 500 years). With the first method, the studied wetland
   soils functioned as carbon sinks. Using the second method, the carbon in
   the form of GHG was up to 5 times more than sequestered carbon, however,
   the methodology does not consider the dynamics of gases in the
   atmosphere. By using a dynamic model that integrates productivity, plant
   respiration, the half-life of the gases and soil carbon emitted as
   methane, it was found that these ecosystems are net sinks carbon at
   horizon times of 500 years. This outlines a need to conserve and restore
   wetlands, and demonstrates the wetlands role as carbon sinks without
   concerning that they are sources of GHGs.},

Abstract = {The IPCC was founded in 1988 with the aim of providing assessments of
   all aspects of global climate change especially the influence of human
   activities on such change. It aims to involve as many scientists as
   possible in these assessments and also to involve governments in
   ensuring that their presentation is relevant and clear. A Third
   Assessment Report (TAR) is in preparation and will be published next
   year. Particular attention will be given in this report to all known
   contributions to radiative forcing, to the simulation of the climate of
   the 20(th) century, to the details of the carbon cycle, to advances in
   climate modelling, to the form of he climate response to increased
   radiative forcing from greenhouse gases and to possible major influence
   of such forcing on the ocean circulation. Two of the most important
   likely impacts of climate change will result from the rise in sea level
   and the more intense hydrological cycle. The internationally agreed
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) has the Objective of
   stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This will
   require large reductions in projected emissions of gases such as carbon
   dioxide with important implications for the world's energy industry.},

Abstract = {The successful implementation and sustainability of many marsh
   restoration efforts, including coastal adaptation to buffer inundation
   and mitigate sea level rise, often hinges upon support from surrounding
   human communities. Yet, stakeholder engagement in these projects remains
   relatively undervalued and underutilized. We present the
   Social-Ecological Systems, Adaptive Management, and Engagement (SESAME)
   framework that provides reciprocal connections between the human and
   ecological components of restoration efforts and the resulting
   management and engagement needs. We built and describe this framework
   through discussion of two case studies of coastal restoration efforts in
   southern New England salt marshes. The first case study focuses on the
   use of sediment placement to increase the elevation of the surface of a
   drowning marsh in Rhode Island as an interim measure to protect against
   sea level rise. The second case study describes the use of living
   shorelines for erosion mitigation on a salt marsh in Massachusetts.
   These cases included significant partner and stakeholder engagement and
   provided important lessons learned for practical implementation of the
   SESAME framework. Valuable lessons included the need for engagement
   throughout the entirety of the process, specific clarification of roles
   within the restoration efforts, and flexibility in implementation and
   goal setting.},

Title = {Coastal riverine wetland biogeochemistry follows soil organic matter
   distribution along a marsh-to-mangrove gradient (Florida, USA)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {797},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Many subtropical coastal wetland vegetation communities are
   transitioning from herbaceous marsh to woody mangrove, often facilitated
   by sea-level rise. This study investigated the relationships between
   vegetation community (upstream marsh, ecotone/transition, and downstream
   mangrove), salinity (S), and soil biogeochemistry in wetlands along
   three rivers on the Florida Gulf coast (the Little Manatee, Peace, and
   Fakahatchee Rivers). Vegetation was surveyed, and soil and water samples
   were collected during both the dry and the wet season and analyzed for
   biogeochemical properties (soil: bulk density, pH, organic matter,
   extractable inorganic and total nutrients, dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon; water: inorganic nutrients and DOC)
   and processes (greenhouse gas production) while salinity and water level
   were continuously monitored in the field. Results indicated
   landscape-scale patterns in soil biogeochemistry differed significantly
   by river and were most strongly correlated with soil organic matter
   content, regardless of vegetation community or salinity regime. Contrary
   to expectations, soil organic matter content gradients were not always
   inversely related to salinity gradients, and methane production was
   observed in moderate-(S = 12) and high-(S = 34) salinity mangrove
   communities. The vegetation ecotone experienced seasonally variable
   salinity and did not serve as a true biogeochemical intermediate between
   the marsh and mangrove communities. This study demonstrates the need for
   site-specific studies of biogeochemical gradients in coastal wetlands
   and indicates the marsh-to mangrove ecotone is not a proxy for salinity
   or biogeochemical tipping points. Instead, soil organic matter content
   is suggested as the most relevant indicator of biogeochemical properties
   and processes in wetlands along coastal rivers, superseding vegetation
   community or salinity. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {`Blue carbon' ecosystems-seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves-serve
   as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas
   concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We
   sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline
   (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability
   across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical
   ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (C-org) stock (+/- SE) to a
   depth of 30 cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes
   (87.1 +/- 4.90 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (65.6 +/- 4.17 Mg C-org
   ha(-1)), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3 +/- 1.82 Mg
   C-org ha(-1)). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or
   forest) had a stronger relationship with C-org stock than catchment
   region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks
   more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 million +/-
   199,000 Mg C-org in the top 30 cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria
   (53\% in tidal marshes, 36\% in seagrasses, and 11\% in mangroves) and
   sequestration rates of 22,700 +/- 5510 Mg C-org year(-1) (valued at over
   \$AUD1 million +/- 245,000 year(-1) based on the average price of
   \$AUD12.14 Mg CO2 eq(-1) at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund
   auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may
   equate to emissions as high as 4.83 million +/- 358,000 Mg CO2
   equivalents (assuming 90\% remineralization of stocks), 98\% of which
   was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been
   sequestering 9360 +/- 2500 Mg C-org year(-1). This study is among the
   first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across
   and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and
   valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have
   suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the
   future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.},

Abstract = {Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time for development.
   Adaptation to this change combined with the reduction of greenhouse gas
   emissions can help to boost the economic transformation which stimulates
   growth, fills the energy gap and reduces poverty. This paper focuses on
   the potential of renewable energy sources (RES) for electricity
   generation in Madagascar which is a lower-income country. A large
   accessibility to electricity could be a driving force for the economic
   development of this fourth worldwide Island. The Electricity mix is
   currently heavily dependent to fossil fuel imports. Indeed, most of the
   electric demands are fulfilled by diesel power plants. An overview of
   the power situation and renewable energy potential of Madagascar is
   first presented, then different scenarios for the evolution its
   electricity mix are proposed.},

Title = {Assessing historical and projected carbon balance of Alaska: A synthesis

Abstract = {We summarize the results of a recent interagency assessment of land
   carbon dynamics in Alaska, in which carbon dynamics were estimated for
   all major terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems for the historical period
   (1950-2009) and a projection period (2010-2099). Between 1950 and 2009,
   upland and wetland (i.e., terrestrial) ecosystems of the state gained
   0.4 Tg C/yr (0.1\% of net primary production, NPP), resulting in a
   cumulative greenhouse gas radiative forcing of 1.68 x 10(-3) W/m(2). The
   change in carbon storage is spatially variable with the region of the
   Northwest Boreal Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) losing carbon
   because of fire disturbance. The combined carbon transport via various
   pathways through inland aquatic ecosystems of Alaska was estimated to be
   41.3 Tg C/yr (17\% of terrestrial NPP). During the projection period
   (2010-2099), carbon storage of terrestrial ecosystems of Alaska was
   projected to increase (22.5-70.0 Tg C/yr), primarily because of NPP
   increases of 10-30\% associated with responses to rising atmospheric
   CO2, increased nitrogen cycling, and longer growing seasons. Although
   carbon emissions to the atmosphere from wildfire and wetland CH4 were
   projected to increase for all of the climate projections, the increases
   in NPP more than compensated for those losses at the statewide level.
   Carbon dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems continue to warm the climate
   for four of the six future projections and cool the climate for only one
   of the projections. The attribution analyses we conducted indicated that
   the response of NPP in terrestrial ecosystems to rising atmospheric CO2
   (similar to 5\% per 100 ppmv CO2) saturates as CO2 increases (between
   approximately +150 and +450 ppmv among projections). This response,
   along with the expectation that permafrost thaw would be much greater
   and release large quantities of permafrost carbon after 2100, suggests
   that projected carbon gains in terrestrial ecosystems of Alaska may not
   be sustained. From a national perspective, inclusion of all of Alaska in
   greenhouse gas inventory reports would ensure better accounting of the
   overall greenhouse gas balance of the nation and provide a foundation
   for considering mitigation activities in areas that are accessible
   enough to support substantive deployment.},

Abstract = {Wildfire episodes are becoming more rampant with global warming and
   climate change. Every year it causes lot of damage in terms of burnt
   acres and also impacts the air quality and climate through emission of
   various trace greenhouse gases. As emissions from large fires increase
   with time, it is essential to monitor the extent and spatial
   distribution of such changes that can have both short term and long-term
   implications in terms of human health and feedback on global radiative
   forcing. In this paper we have used the vertical profile distributions
   of some of the key trace gases, from AQUA-AIRS sensor to better
   understand the impact of wildfires in terms of magnitude, spatial and
   seasonal distribution. Our study shows the impact of season on fire
   emission in the planetary boundary layer and the free troposphere and
   also highlights areas in the continental United States (CONUS) where
   different trace gas emissions are more preponderant. Overall it
   successfully demonstrates the applicability of satellite-based sensors
   for regular monitoring of fire related trace gas emissions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Coastal erosion and storms represent a source of risk for settlements
   and infrastructure along the coast. At the same time, coastal natural
   assets, including landscape, are threatened by increasing development
   mainly driven by tourism. The Mediterranean coast is especially
   vulnerable to these processes, considering its high biological and
   cultural diversity. An additional challenge is represented by climate
   change, as it will force coastal communities to apply more or less
   drastic adaptation strategies. Coastal setbacks, used to protect coastal
   communities and infrastructure from storms and erosion, and to preserve
   coastal habitats and landscapes from degradation, is one of the main
   instruments suggested by the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone
   Management of the Barcelona Convention, entered into force on the 24 of
   March 2011. Its implementation has the potential to influence coastal
   policies in other regions, such as the neighbouring Black Sea.
   The CONSCIENCE project has formalized concepts and conducted specific
   studies to provide new tools for coastal erosion management practice.
   The objective of this paper is to present a synthesis of the research
   conducted into coastal setbacks for coastal erosion management and
   climate change adaptation. This is done by analysing the requirement of
   the Protocol, current processes and management practices in two case
   study areas (Costa Brava Bays in Spain and Danube Delta, in Romania) and
   the new challenges posed by climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Achieving an economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal by
   mid-century in the United States entails transforming the energy
   workforce. In this study, we focus on the influence of increased labor
   compensation and domestic manufacturing shares on (a) renewable energy
   technology costs, (b) the costs of transitioning the U.S. economy to
   net-zero emissions, and (c) labor outcomes, including total employment
   and wage benefits, associated with the deployment of utility-scale solar
   photovoltaics (PV) and land based and offshore wind power. We find that
   manufacturing and installation labor cost premiums as well as increases
   in domestic content shares across wind and utility-scale solar PV supply
   chains result in relatively modest increases in total capital and
   operating costs. These small increases in technology costs may be
   partially or fully offset by increases in labor productivity. We also
   show that solar and wind technology cost premiums associated with high
   road labor policies have a minimal effect on the pace and scale of
   renewable energy deployment and the total cost of transitioning to a
   net-zero emissions economy. Public policies such as tax credits,
   workforce development support, and other instruments can redistribute
   technology cost premiums associated with high road labor policies to
   support both firms and workers.},

   U.S. Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. Fishery adaptation strategies
   were categorized using the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework, a novel
   application to understand social transformation in a social-ecological
   system in response to a disturbance. A number of innovations emerged, or
   were facilitated, that could improve the fisheries' resilience to future
   disruptions. Fishers with diversified options and strategic flexibility
   generally fared better, i.e., had fewer disruptions to their
   livelihoods. Using the RAD framework to identify adaptation strategies
   from fishery system actors highlights opportunities for improving
   resilience of fisheries social-ecological systems to future stressors.},

   Is there a real possibility to contribute to C sequestration?},

Abstract = {Agriculture in the Mediterranean basin is currently contributing to
   greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and in the future is expected to be
   strongly affected by climate change. Increasing soil organic carbon
   (SOC) via soil organic matter (SOM) improvement is widely regarded as a
   way to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. Using as a case study
   the Mediterranean coastal area in Spain, which is regarded as one of the
   most intensively managed areas in Europe for orchards and horticultural
   cropping, we analyzed the potential for climate change mitigation of
   introducing different practides that are expected to increase SOC. We
   selected both as a single measure and in cOmbination, cover cropping and
   application to the soil of the available underutilized exogenous organic
   matter (EOM), treated (e.g. composted or digested) or non-treated. These
   practices were compared against a baseline scenario that intended to
   reflect the current practices in the area (e.g. all livestock manure
   produced in the area is applied to the agricultural soil). We carried
   out a modelling exercise at the regional scale using the agricultural
   activity data and current climatic conditions as inputs. Modelling nins
   were performed coupling a widely used dynamic model of SOC turnover
   (RothC) with a model to simulate the GHG emissions from EOM processing
   or storage prior to soil application (SIMSWASTE).
   Results indicate that the most promising practice, considered as a
   single measure and with respect to the baseline, was introducing cover
   crops in woody cropping systems. This practice resulted in an increase
   of 0.44 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years (range 0.41-0.52 Mg
   C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and led to a total SOC accumulation of about 30 Tg C
   after 100 years. Amendment of all agricultural land With available
   underutilized EOM resulted in an increase of up to 0.09 Mg C ha(-1)
   yr(-1) (range 0.07-0.16 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) as a single measure (Urban
   waste) and 0.13 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (range 0.11-0.21 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1))
   as a combined measure (urban waste and composted agroindustry
   by-products), leading to a total SOC accumulation of about 7 Tg C (urban
   waste) and 10 Tg C (urban waste and composted agroindustry by-products)
   after 100 years. Manure anaerobic digestion or composting as a single
   measure did not result in significant SOC changes but, if GHG emissions
   and savings from manure storage and processing management stages are
   considered, they could help to reduce about 4.3 (anaerobic digestion) or
   1.1 Tg CO(2)eq yr(-1) (composting) in the study area, which represents a
   significant amount compared with total agricultural emissions in Spain.

Abstract = {Progress on the development of a differential radiometer based upon the
   Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) for methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide
   (CO2) detection in the atmosphere is presented. Carbon dioxide and
   methane measurements are becoming increasingly important as a component
   of NASA's programs to understand the global carbon cycle and quantify
   the threat of global warming. Methane is the third most important
   greenhouse gas in the Earth's radiation budget (after water vapor and
   carbon dioxide) and the second most important anthropogenic contributor
   to global warming. The importance of global warming and air quality to
   society caused the National Research Council to recommend that NASA
   develop the following three missions(1,2) ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2
   Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons), GEOCAPE (Geostationary
   Coastal and Air Pollution Events), and GACM (Global Atmosphere
   Composition Mission). The importance of CO2 and methane study is
   reflected in the successful operation of the Japanese Greenhouse gases
   Observing Satellite (GOSAT) monitoring those trace gases globally from
   orbit.(3)},

Title = {Groundwater-Driven Methane Export Reduces Salt Marsh Blue Carbon
   Potential},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The burial of ``blue carbon{''} in coastal marsh soils is partially
   offset by marsh-atmosphere methane (CH4) fluxes, but this offset may be
   greater if other pathways of CH4 export exist. Here we report that salt
   marshes also export dissolved CH4 via submarine groundwater discharge
   (SGD). The volumetric fluxes of salt marsh groundwater into adjacent
   tidal creeks were calculated from mass balances of the conservative
   tracer Ra-226 at four study sites in coastal Georgia, USA. Over the
   2-year study period, volumetric groundwater fluxes across all sites
   ranged between 1,700 and 105,000 m(3) day(-1). Dissolved CH4 fluxes of
   27-1,200 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1) were calculated by multiplying the
   volumetric groundwater flux by the groundwater CH4 concentration and
   normalizing to the intertidal salt marsh area estimated from satellite
   images. On a mass basis, the cross-site range in CH4 fluxes was 1.3-5.5
   g CH4 m(-2) year(-1) with a cross-site mean of 2.8 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1).
   This is equivalent to 125 (56-245) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) assuming that
   CH4 is 45 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year
   time frame. This sustained-flux global warming potential is similar to
   the 138 (1.1-260) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) average calculated across other
   studies of the direct marsh soil to atmosphere CH4 flux. Therefore, SGD
   drives an effective doubling of salt marsh CH4 export that offsets a
   combined total of similar to 30\% of the global cooling potential
   derived from soil carbon sequestration.
   Plain Language Summary Salt marshes are wetland ecosystems found along
   the coast. Scientists and policymakers are interested in salt marshes
   because they accumulate carbon in their soil over long time scales. This
   carbon would otherwise enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,
   exacerbating global climate change. However, microorganisms living in
   the soil break down some of this buried carbon and produce other
   greenhouse gases, such as methane, that contribute more to warming than
   carbon dioxide. Scientists have measured how much methane escapes from
   the soil to the atmosphere. Carbon burial more than offsets this methane
   export, meaning that salt marshes have a small net cooling effect on
   Earth's climate. In this study, we incorporate a previously unaccounted
   pathway for methane export from salt marshes into their radiative
   budget. Methane in marsh soil and surrounding sediments can be dissolved
   in groundwater that discharges from the pore spaces between soil and
   sediment particles. This groundwater flows slowly toward the marsh edge
   until it discharges into nearby surface waters, carrying dissolved
   methane with it. We estimate that this methane export from groundwater
   approximately doubles total methane emissions from salt marshes. This is
   still not enough methane export to counteract all of the climate cooling
   benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils. However, it is important
   for policymakers to include both pathways of methane export when
   calculating the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh
   soils or its economic value.},

Title = {Using ocean-glint scattered sunlight as a diagnostic tool for satellite
   remote sensing of greenhouse gases},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2509-2520},
Abstract = {Spectroscopic measurements of sunlight backscattered by the Earth's
   surface is a technique widely used for remote sensing of atmospheric
   constituent concentrations from space. Thereby, remote sensing of
   greenhouse gases poses particularly challenging accuracy requirements
   for instrumentation and retrieval algorithms which, in general, suffer
   from various error sources. Here, we investigate a method that helps
   disentangle sources of error for observations of sunlight backscattered
   from the glint spot on the ocean surface. The method exploits the
   backscattering characteristics of the ocean surface, which is bright for
   glint geometry but dark for off-glint angles. This property allows for
   identifying a set of clean scenes where light scattering due to
   particles in the atmosphere is negligible such that uncertain knowledge
   of the lightpath can be excluded as a source of error. We apply the
   method to more than 3 yr of ocean-glint measurements by the Thermal And
   Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation (TANSO) Fourier Transform
   Spectrometer (FTS) onboard the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite
   (GOSAT), which aims at measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)
   concentrations. The proposed method is able to clearly monitor recent
   improvements in the instrument calibration of the oxygen (O-2) A-band
   channel and suggests some residual uncertainty in our knowledge about
   the instrument. We further assess the consistency of CO2 retrievals from
   several absorption bands between 6400 cm(-1) (1565 nm) and 4800 cm(-1)
   (2100 nm) and find that the absorption bands commonly used for
   monitoring of CO2 dry air mole fractions from GOSAT allow for
   consistency better than 1.5 ppm. Usage of other bands reveals
   significant inconsistency among retrieved CO2 concentrations pointing at
   inconsistency of spectroscopic parameters.},

   life-cycle assessment (LCA) of its total nonrenewable energy (NE) cost
   and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is presented in this
   paper. The results show that the total energy cost for one joule of
   biomass gas output from the project is 2.93 J, of which 0.89 J is from
   nonrenewable energy, and the related GHG emission cost is 1.17 x 10(-4)
   g CO2-eq over its designed life cycle of 20 years. To provide equivalent
   effective calorific value for cooking work, the utilization of one joule
   of biomass gas will lead to more life cycle NE cost by 0.07 J and more
   GHG emissions by 8.92 x 10(-5) g CO2-eq compared to natural gas taking
   into consideration of the difference in combustion efficiency and
   calorific value. The small-scale bio-energy project has fallen into
   dilemma, i.e., struggling for survival, and for a more successful future
   development of village-level gasification projects, much effort is
   needed to tide over the plight of its development, such as high cost and
   low efficiency caused by decentralized construction, technical
   shortcomings and low utilization rate of by-products.},

Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) strive to continue economic
   growth, mitigate climate change and reduce their dependence on imported
   fossil fuels. They offer a geographical landscape which encourages
   distributed generation in order to provide power to end users that are
   located in remote areas. Often times, this distributed generation is
   accomplished through grid connected solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.
   Because they do not emit greenhouse gas, and they use the free light
   from the sun to generate electricity, solar PV systems provide renewable
   energy in a sustainable way. This paper will respectively discuss the
   challenges and opportunities associated with grid connected solar PV in
   island states. It will also propose potential waste management
   strategies of such solar PV systems from cradle to grave.},

Title = {China's energy status: A critical look at fossils and renewable options},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {81},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {China relies heavily on fossil fuels to keep the wheel of its huge
   economy running. Fossil fuels are however not a sustainable energy
   source due largely to their environmental footprint and supply
   insecurity. These concerns have necessitated the need for alternative
   energy sources that are both renewable and environmentally friendly.
   This policy direction is in line with the Kyoto protocol that
   constrained countries to follow certain energy consumption pattern that
   encourages the use of less carbon intensive energy sources. In line with
   this protocol, China has over the years adopted the use of various
   renewable energy sources including solar, wind, marine, as well as
   hydropower. This commitment by the Chinese government has yielded
   significant result over the years. Notably, between 2014 and 2015, wind
   and solar energies were responsible for 25.4\% of electrical energy
   produced in China. However, enabling laws to support the optimum
   consumption of these energies has not been provided, thereby resulting
   in a serious setback. In spite of the increased production in renewable
   energies, biofuels have contributed only marginally to the entire
   growth. Biofuels are very important considering the contribution of the
   transport sector to carbon emissions. Although there are ethical issues
   associated with current biofuels due to energy-food nexus, this review
   submits that algal biofuel could serve as an alternative. To this end,
   there is urgent need for the government to put in place laws and
   policies that will support not only production but also consumption of
   renewables, including algal biofuel, so that dependence on coal and
   other fossil fuels can be further reduced. This will not only reduce the
   country's dependence on oil import which is currently at 59.4\% but
   greatly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.},

Title = {The influence of lipid content and taxonomic affiliation on methane and

Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1915-1925},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are end
   products of microbial anaerobic degradation of organic matter (OM) in
   lake sediments. Although previous research has shown that phytoplankton
   lipid content influences sediment methanogenesis, current understanding
   on how OM quality affects methanogenesis is still limited. Such
   information is needed to more accurately assess how lake greenhouse gas
   emissions may change in response to anthropogenic activities. We
   cultured 11 phytoplankton species from five classes and studied how
   taxonomic identity, C : N ratio, lipid content, and fatty acid
   composition of phytoplankton biomass affects the CH4 and net CO2
   production in anaerobic lake sediments with an incubation experiment
   that lasted > 100 d. The carbon-normalized potential CH4 (0.09-0.23 mu
   mol mg C-1 d(-1)) and net CO2 (0.09-0.28 mu mol mg C-1 d(-1)) production
   rates were not related to phytoplankton taxonomic affiliation (e.g.,
   class, species), C : N ratio, or fatty acid composition of algal
   biomass. Methane or net CO2 production potentials did not increase with
   higher lipid content (10-30\%); however, total fatty acid content had a
   weak correlation with CH4 production potential. In contrast to previous
   research, our results suggest that lipid content is of minor importance
   in determining methanogenesis rates from the biomass of multispecies
   phytoplankton communities settling on sediments. The decrease in CO2
   concentration and the correlation between stable carbon isotope
   signatures of CH4 and molar ratio of CH4 and CO2 at the end of the
   experiment may indicate that importance of hydrogenotrophic
   methanogenesis, which uses CO2 when other substrates become limiting,
   increased during the long incubation.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of global environmental change, management strategies
   that can deal with unexpected change in resource dynamics are becoming
   increasingly important. In this paper we undertake a novel approach to
   studying resource growth problems using a computational form of adaptive
   management to find optimal strategies for prevalent natural resource
   management dilemmas. We scrutinize adaptive management, or
   learning-by-doing, to better understand how to simultaneously manage and
   learn about a system when its dynamics are unknown. We study important
   trade-offs in decision-making with respect to choosing optimal actions
   (harvest efforts) for sustainable management during change. This is
   operationalized through an artificially intelligent model where we
   analyze how different trends and fluctuations in growth rates of a
   renewable resource affect the performance of different management
   strategies. Our results show that the optimal strategy for managing
   resources with declining growth is capable of managing resources with
   fluctuating or increasing growth at a negligible cost, creating in a
   management strategy that is both efficient and robust towards future
   unknown changes. To obtain this strategy, adaptive management should
   strive for: high learning rates to new knowledge, high valuation of
   future outcomes and modest exploration around what is perceived as the
   optimal action.},

   (CO2)/methane (CH4)/carbon monoxide (CO)/water vapor (H2O) analyzer, a
   continuous ozone analyzer, and an ambient temperature and humidity
   sensor. Air samples collected in flight are analyzed at NOAA/ESRL for
   the major greenhouse gases and a variety of halocarbons and hydrocarbons
   that influence climate, stratospheric ozone, and air quality.
   We describe the overall system for making accurate greenhouse gas
   measurements using a CRDS analyzer on an aircraft with minimal operator
   interaction and present an assessment of analyzer performance over a
   three-year period. Overall analytical uncertainty of CRDS measurements
   in 2011 is estimated to be 0.15 ppm, 1.4 ppb, and 5 ppb for CO2, CH4,
   and CO, respectively, considering short-term precision, calibration
   uncertainties, and water vapor correction uncertainty. The stability of
   the CRDS analyzer over a seven-month deployment period is better than
   0.15 ppm, 2 ppb, and 4 ppb for CO2, CH4, and CO, respectively, based on
   differences of on-board reference tank measurements from a laboratory
   calibration performed prior to deployment. This stability is not
   affected by variation in pressure or temperature during flight. We
   conclude that the uncertainty reported for our measurements would not be
   significantly affected if the measurements were made without in-flight
   calibrations, provided ground calibrations and testing were performed
   regularly. Comparisons between in situ CRDS measurements and flask
   measurements are consistent with expected measurement uncertainties for
   CH4 and CO, but differences are larger than expected for CO2. Biases and
   standard deviations of comparisons with flask samples suggest that
   atmospheric variability, flask-to-flask variability, and possible flask
   sampling biases may be driving the observed flask versus in situ CO2
   differences rather than the CRDS measurements.},

Title = {Techno-Economic Operation and Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment of a
   Solar PV-Driven Islanded Microgrid},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {111828-111839},
Abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) are playing an important role in the maximum
   utilization of distributed energy resources. The optimal economic
   operation and low-carbon electricity generation can enhance MGs
   effectiveness. This paper presents the results of a solar-photovoltaic
   (PV)-driven islanded MG's technoeconomic optimization analysis and
   environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) to achieve economical and
   environmentally superior performance. A net present cost (NPC)-based
   simulation for optimal sizing of the MG is proposed. A novel life-cycle
   inventory (LCI) is developed to evaluate the impacts of the MG under 21
   midpoint indicators and three endpoint indicators by the ReCiPe 2016
   method, metal particle releases by the Ecopoints approach, and the
   greenhouse-gas emissions by the IPCC method. The sensitivity analysis is
   carried out to verify the effects for three different batteries and five
   different PV modules for all of the considered impact indicators. The
   results reveal that the proposed MG offers a revenue of 29,520 US\$/yr
   by routing excess energy to neighbors after fulfilling the prosumers'
   demand at an optimal net present cost of 364,906 US\$. Furthermore, the
   outcomes obtained from the LCA analysis show that, among the MG
   components, batteries have the highest impact on human health (74\%) and
   the ecosystem (78\%) due to greater greenhouse-gas emissions (CO2-48\%,
   CH4-37\%, and N(2)0-48\%).},

Abstract = {Isoetid macrophytes such as Lobelia dortmanna and Littorella uniflora
   are engineering species with an extensive root system and high radial
   oxygen loss. Despite several studies on these macrophytes, the effect of
   their oxygenation on methane dynamics has never been investigated. In
   this study, we hypothesise that isoetids promote dissolved inorganic
   carbon fixation and methane oxidation in sandy sediments. Our
   whole-ecosystem approach study lasted 2 years (2013-2014) on two
   oligo-mesotrophic shallow lakes. Benthic chamber incubations confirmed
   that, as a result of primary production and methanotrophy, isoetid lawns
   had consistently lower benthic carbon fluxes than bare sediments. On a
   daily basis, vegetated areas acted as a carbon sink (-0.7 +/- 0.4 g C
   m(-2) days(-1), as DIC + CH4), whereas bare sediments acted as a net
   source (0.6 +/- 0.5 g C m(-2) days(-1), as DIC + CH4). Photosynthetic
   quotients of < 1 indicated that photosynthetically produced oxygen was
   not released into the water column, but accumulated in leaf lacunae or
   was transferred to the rhizosphere, that contributing to the alteration
   of net benthic fluxes at the sediment-water interface. This preliminary
   study highlights the necessity of further investigating the role that
   isoetids play in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from temperate
   shallow lakes.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas fluxes in mangrove forest soil in an Amazon estuary},

Abstract = {Tropical mangrove forests are important carbon sinks, the soil being the
   main carbon reservoir. Understanding the variability and the key factors
   that control fluxes is critical to accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, particularly in the current scenario of global climate
   change. This study is the first to quantify carbon dioxide (CO2) and
   methane (CH4) emissions using a dynamic chamber in natural mangrove soil
   of the Amazon. The plots for the trace gases study were allocated at
   contrasting topographic heights. The results showed that the mangrove
   soil of the Amazon estuary is a source of CO2 (6.66 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1))
   and CH4 (0.13 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) to the atmosphere. The CO2 flux was
   higher in the high topography (7.86 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) than in the low
   topography (4.73 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) in the rainy season, and CH4 was
   higher in the low topography (0.13 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) than in the high
   topography (0.01 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) in the dry season. However, in the
   dry period, the low topography soil produced more CH4. Soil organic
   matter, carbon and nitrogen ratio (C/N), and redox potential influenced
   the annual and seasonal variation of CO2 emissions; however, they did
   not affect CH4 fluxes. The mangrove soil of the Amazon estuary produced
   35.40 Mg CO2eq. ha(-1) yr(-1). A total of 2.16 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) needs
   to be sequestered by the mangrove ecosystem to counterbalance CH4
   emissions.},

Abstract = {Salt-affected soils are extensively present and constitute about 7\% of
   total land surface. However, our knowledge about greenhouse gas (GHG)
   turnover between the atmosphere and the saline soils is very limited. In
   order to evaluate the potential of GHG consumption in saline soils, we
   measured gas fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) from the soil surface to the atmosphere under
   saline-alkaline mudflat and various community types in the Yellow River
   Delta in China. In general, the emissions of GHG of different ecosystems
   showed a unique peak diurnal pattern, with the peak at 13:00h and the
   lowest value at 07:00h. The CH4 and N2O emission of different ecosystems
   followed the order: saline-alkaline mudflat>T. chinensis>S. salsa>P.
   australis, while the CO2 emission followed the order: T. chinensis>P.
   australis>S. salsa >saline-alkaline mudflat. On the whole,
   saline-alkaline mudflat and different vegetations acted as CO2 and N2O
   source in spring, while saline-alkaline mudflat and P. australis
   communities acted as CH4 source and CH4 sink, respectively. However, T.
   chinensis and S. salsa communities acted as CH4 sink before 12:00h and
   CH4 source after 12:00h. Although measurements of the CO2, CH4 and N2O
   fluxes were taken simultaneously, CH4 and N2O fluxes were strongly
   correlated with soil moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity,
   while no significant correlation was found between CO2 flux with above
   environmental factors. These results probably suggest that factors other
   than soil temperature, moisture and salinity exerted a larger impact on
   fluxes than on CH4 and N2O release and/or that there were not enough
   samples for CO2 flux measurements because of its higher spatial and
   temporal variability.},

Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the greenhouse gases known to be an
   influential driver of global warming. Recognizing the pressing need to
   identify sources and magnitudes of CO2 emissions worldwide, estimations
   of CO2 fluxes were made by analyzing 19 years of data (1999-2018) from
   30 sampling locations covering the entire Chilika Lake, India. The
   overall positive value of CO2 flux indicated that Chilika Lake acts as a
   source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Biological respiration is the major
   factor for the outflux of CO2 into the atmosphere. The C flux estimation
   (8.81 x 10(-6) PgC Y-1) from this long-term data set indicated Chilika
   contributes approximately 0.001\% of the global annual carbon emission
   and 0.002\% of the emission from global estuaries. The trend obtained
   through 19 years of monthly data indicated a significant annual increase
   in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) (mu atm) and CO2 flux (mmol
   m(-2)d(-1)) which are 1.57 and 0.048, respectively. During the same
   period, a significant decrease in pH at the rate of 0.0006/year could be
   an indication of the impact of acidification on carbon flux.},

Abstract = {Ocean nourishment is a process for stimulating the sequestration of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide in the deep ocean by providing the nutrients
   needed to enhance the production of phytoplankton. The carbon dioxide
   sink thus created, can be used to generate tradeable carbon credits. The
   costs of sequestering carbon by the process of ocean nourishment have
   been estimated using as a basis, the previous experience in nitrogen
   fixing of Toyo Engineering Corporation. While there are uncertainties
   about the biological uptake efficiency, these introduce only a moderate
   uncertainty in our overall estimates of costs. The major determinants of
   the costs are the interest that must be paid on capital and the cost of
   the feedstock, natural gas. We have used for discussion purposes, an
   interest rate of 4-8\% per annum and natural gas costs of US\$0.5-\$2
   per GJ. The costs of carbon credits lie in the range US\$6.70-\$12.40
   per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions sequestered. It should be noted
   that we have adopted the measure of carbon avoided by non-emission,
   because of the complex partitioning of anthropogenic carbon between the
   atmosphere, land and ocean. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {California coastal management with a changing climate},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {111},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {45-73},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With over 2,000 miles (3,218 km) of ocean and estuarine coastline,
   California faces significant coastal management challenges as a result
   of climate change-induced sea level rise. Under high emission scenarios,
   recent models predict 1.4 m or more of sea level rise by 2100,
   accompanied by increasing storm surges. This article investigates the
   most important issues facing coastal managers, explores the policy tools
   available for adapting to the impacts of climate change, assesses
   institutional constraints to adaptation, and identifies priorities for
   future research and policy action. We find that adaptation tools exist
   for dealing with anticipated increases in coastal erosion and flooding,
   but they involve significant costs and tradeoffs. In particular, coastal
   armoring, such as seawalls, can protect developed coastal lands, but
   destroys beaches and habitat. Although California already has policies
   and institutions that aim to balance the competing objectives for
   coastal development, management agencies are at the early stages of
   understanding how to facilitate adaptation. Research priorities to
   inform coastal adaptation planning include: (i) inventorying coastal
   resources to provide a firmer basis for balancing decisions on property
   and habitat protection, (ii) identifying opportunities for coastal
   habitat migration, (iii) assessing the vulnerabilities of existing and
   planned coastal infrastructure, and (iv) experimenting with alternatives
   to armoring as a way of managing the changing coastline.},

   Enhancement Programme through Sustainable Artificial Reefs in Galicia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The principle of sustainability should condition a project in which
   artificial reefs are being installed to protect biodiversity as well as
   enhance costal ecosystems. In particular, this principle should be taken
   into account in the logistical processes related to manufacture and
   transport. This study assesses the global warming potential (GWP) and
   cumulative energy demand (CED) of developing a coastal ecosystem
   enhancement programme in the estuary region of Galicia, north-western
   Spain. The focus is on the processes involved in creating green
   artificial reefs (GARs): manufacture, transport and installation. The
   starting point is the supply chain for the green artificial reef (GAR)
   units; greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and energy needs for each phase
   are analysed. Various scenarios are considered to determine which
   options are indeed available when it comes to establishing the supply
   chain. Different types of energy supplies, different options for the
   location of production centres, as well as different means of transport
   were studied. Results reveal the critical phases for selecting how the
   GAR units must be produced, transported by road and sea and then
   installed in their permanent location.},

Title = {``Disasters threaten livelihoods, and people cope, adapt and make
   transformational changes{''}: Community resilience and livelihoods
   reconstruction in coastal communities of Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the face of serious disruptions to local livelihoods and asset bases
   by extreme climatic events, it is paramount to reconstruct but also to
   transform and diversify livelihoods. However, the literature on these
   aspects is scant. In this paper, we posit that two frameworks, namely
   the livelihood strategy approach and community resilience thinking, are
   useful tools for effectively analyzing post-disaster transformational
   changes. In the empirical context of coastal communities of Bangladesh,
   our study specifically examines the changes experienced in livelihood
   assets due to Cyclones Sidr and Aila. Two coastal communities, namely
   Nilganj and Dhulasar Unions in the Kalapara Upazila of Patuakhali
   District, were selected to analyze the strategies used by local people
   to cope with and adapt to cyclone and storm surge disaster-shocks.
   Primary data were collected from three sources: a socioeconomic survey
   of 300 households, eight focus group discussions, and 20 key informant
   interviews. Our findings reveal that a significant number of cyclone
   victims were displaced from their homes by recent severe cyclones,
   changed their occupations - both intra- and intersectorally - and
   confronted increased consumption and social costs. We observed
   significant differences in impacts between farmers and those engaged in
   other occupations, such as fishing, with the latter being far more
   likely to change occupation post-disaster. The study uncovered
   significant evidence that local people are learning to live with change
   and uncertainty by nurturing and combining various types of knowledge
   and social memory, generating diversified livelihood options, and
   self-organizing to enhance their resilience to future extreme weather
   events.},

Abstract = {Heat stress is one of the most severe climate threats to human society
   in a future warmer world. The situation is further exacerbated in urban
   areas by urban heat islands (UHIs). Because the majority of world's
   population is projected to live in cities, there is a pressing need to
   find effective solutions for the heat stress problem. We use a climate
   model to investigate the effectiveness of various urban heat mitigation
   strategies: cool roofs, street vegetation, green roofs, and reflective
   pavement. Our results show that by adopting highly reflective roofs,
   almost all the cities in the United States and southern Canada are
   transformed into ``white oases{''} - cold islands caused by cool roofs
   at midday, with an average oasis effect of -3.4K in the summer for the
   period 2071-2100, which offsets approximately 80\% of the greenhouse gas
   (GHG) warming projected for the same period under the RCP4.5 scenario. A
   UHI mitigation wedge consisting of cool roofs, street vegetation, and
   reflective pavement has the potential to eliminate the daytime UHI plus
   the GHG warming.},

Abstract = {This study investigates dissipated heat removal from the internal cargo
   holds of an ultra-large container ship utilizing an LNG waste cold
   source. The reefer containers in the cargo hold dissipate heat to
   maintain certain freight conditions. While the extracted air from the
   atmosphere absorbs cold energy during LNG vaporization, it prevents a
   temperature increase inside the cargo holds by supplying cooled air.
   Herein, the marine power system is an electric propulsion type with a
   combined gas turbine electric and steam system. The
   cooled-airflow-ventilation system linked to the power system is
   evaluated regarding energy and exergy flows and greenhouse gas
   emissions. Cooled-airflow-ventilation performs efficiently as its
   coefficient-of-performance becomes twice that of
   atmospheric-airflow-ventilation when the reefer container box
   temperature is above zero and heat dissipation is high. Moreover,
   cooled-airflow-ventilation reduces the maximum-continuous-rating and
   improves the exergy efficiency. LNG waste cold source utilization
   benefits the response to the enforced regulation of ship greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, a high atmospheric temperature makes dissipated heat
   removal difficult. Consequently, cold energy cannot be provided to all
   cargo holds. The lower the box temperature is; the more cargo holds that
   can utilize cold energy.},

Title = {Household response to cyclone and induced surge in coastal Bangladesh:
   coping strategies and explanatory variables},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {477-499},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to explore indigenous coping strategies
   and identify underlying demographic, socio-economic and other relevant
   variables that influence the adoption of coping strategies in three
   distinct cyclone-prone coastal villages of Bangladesh. The study finds
   that cyclones and induced surges are a recurrent phenomenon in coastal
   Bangladesh; hence people are used to adjusting their lifestyle and
   adopting their own coping strategies intelligently. Adoption of a
   particular set of coping strategies depends not only on the magnitude,
   intensity and potential impacts of the cyclone and induced surge, but
   also age, gender, social class, dissemination of early warning
   information, locational exposure, external assistance, social protection
   and informal risk sharing mechanisms within the community. Indigenous
   cyclone disaster prevention and mitigation strategies significantly
   minimize the vulnerability of the people. Under extreme situations, when
   such disasters surpass the shock-bearing capacity of the victims,
   informal risk sharing mechanisms through social bonding and social
   safety-nets become vital for short-term survival and long-term
   livelihood security. Therefore, proper monitoring and understanding of
   local indigenous coping strategies are essential in order to target the
   most vulnerable groups exposed to disasters. Additionally, proper
   dissemination of early warning and government and non-government
   partnerships for relief and rehabilitation activities should be
   prioritized to ensure pro-poor disaster management activities. The study
   also recommends effective monitoring of the impact of aid to ensure
   corrective measures to avoid the development of relief dependency by
   disaster victims.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have modified the rate at which
   oceans have absorbed atmospheric CO2 over the last centuries through
   rising atmospheric CO2 and modifications in climate. However, there are
   still missing pieces in our understanding of the recent evolution of
   air-sea CO2 exchanges related to the magnitude of their response to
   anthropogenic forcings versus that controlled by the internal
   variability. Here, to detect and attribute anthropogenic influences on
   oceanic CO2 uptake between 1960 and 2005, we compare an ensemble of
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model
   simulations forced by individual drivers to ocean-only model
   reconstructions. We demonstrate that the evolution of the global oceanic
   carbon sink over the last decades can be understood without invoking
   climate change, attributing rising atmospheric CO2 as prominent driver
   of the oceanic sink. Nonetheless, at regional scale, the influence of
   climate change on air-sea CO2 exchanges seems to emerge from the
   internal variability within the low-latitude oceans.},

Journal = {ONE EARTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-211},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Blue carbon provides opportunities to mitigate climate change while
   increasing ecosystem services for coastal communities, including climate
   change adaptation; however, blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to
   climate change, leading to uncertainties in the future efficacy of these
   ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate
   change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in
   coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon
   habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved
   water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could
   result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed
   beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change
   mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full
   potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of
   ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with
   climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits.
   Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg
   of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur.},

Title = {Adaptive coping strategies towards seasonal change impacts: Indonesian
   small-scale fisherman household},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Small-scale fishers are always expected to adapt to fishing activities
   that cannot be conducted all year round due to weather and fishing
   season. This condition, especially when it is not the fish season, makes
   fishers face a problem. Notwithstanding, fishermen households need to
   develop an adequate adaptation strategy to solve the problem of
   fulfilling their needs, known as coping strategies. This study aims to
   analyze fishermen households' coping strategies in facing the fishing
   season and non-fish season by using fishermen's family resources and two
   types of internal and external family coping strategies. The data were
   gathered from approximately 150 smallscale fishing households using
   simple random sampling. The results indicate the fishers do fishing
   activities in three batch: peak season (68\%), mild season (20\%), and
   off-season (12\%). The use of resources for fishermen households' coping
   strategy is carried out by diversifying the sources of household income.
   Some economic activities include cultivating forest land belonging to
   the forest department, marine tour guides, livestock, and his wife. This
   study also confirm that all households use internal family coping
   strategies with humor indicator as the highest percentage. Accordingly,
   the households also adopt the external family coping strategy to deal
   with the existing situation. This strategy follows the local community's
   characteristics and culture who are friendly and open and based on
   religion. The household coping strategy strengthening model is generated
   through the synergy of formal institutional roles in society and
   government institutions as policymakers.},

Title = {Energy systems for climate change mitigation: A systematic review},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {263},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global greenhouse
   gas emissions. A good understanding of energy systems from existing
   research will provide multidimensional insights for appropriate actions
   against global warming. This study conducts a systematic review of the
   literature covering 1,184 articles on energy issues dealing with climate
   change mitigation. Using a novel hand-coding typology analysis, we
   characterize the body of knowledge and identify possible research gaps
   according to the heterogeneity of the energy process, time scale,
   geographic location, energy technology, and concerned end-use sector. We
   find that research interest mainly focuses on the energy supply (496
   papers) and the end-use process (359 papers). Energy storage and the
   energy-water-land nexus are two emerging areas. Biomass, solar, wind,
   and nuclear energy are the technologies that attract the most attention,
   while interest in hydrogen energy production and waste-to-energy has
   grown very recently. The cost-benefit and mitigation potential of
   renewable generation are the most studied topics, followed by the
   impacts of climate change on electricity production. In contrast, little
   attention is paid to research on traditional oil and gas exploration.
   Regarding the end-use sector, residents and transport are the most
   evident sectors studied. China, the United States, and Europe are the
   most featured regions while very few studies focus on Africa, South
   America, and Small Island Developing States. Current research topics
   concentrate on how to maximize the co-benefit of greenhouse gas
   mitigation and eco-environment protection via cost-benefit reinventions
   of energy systems. Discussions of technological innovation are grounded
   in optimal technology portfolio deployment and cost reduction potential,
   along with financial and political incentives.},

Title = {Proposed improvement of coastal habitat resilience: The case study of
   Pantano forest of Policoro in southern Italy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {In the last decades, climate change and the rapid urbanization due to
   the development of the coastal economy have led to biodiversity loss and
   the fragmentation of habitat in many coastal zones. The presence of
   protected areas cannot prevent the progress of land degradation.
   However, these areas are very important because they provide significant
   ecosystem services and affect local tourism. With regard to increasing
   adaptation strategies to human pressures and climate change, the present
   study proposes a detailed monitoring activity and an ecological
   restoration plan which could improve the resilience of a protected
   coastal zone in the Pantano forest of Policoro, located on the Ionian
   coast (southern Italy). In this area, continuous phenomena of intensive
   deforestation, hydraulic reclamation actions, and fires have reduced the
   native species of particular naturalistic value, favouring the
   advancement of desertification, coastal erosion, and saltwater
   intrusion. The proposed actions are derived from a preliminary analysis
   on maps, UAV-images, climate data and from meetings with the local
   community. The operative process detailed in this article could be
   applied to other protected areas which are subjected to the same
   phenomena and problems.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variation of CO2 and CH4 emissions from a septic
   tank soakaway},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {679},
Pages = {185-195},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {CO2 and CH4 flux measurements over a septic tank soakaway located in a
   northern maritime climate (Ireland) were conducted for a period of 81
   days using a multi-chamber automated soil gas flux chamber system with
   high spatial and temporal resolution. Overall median CO2 fluxes were
   7.28; 6.40 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) from the soakaway and control soil,
   respectively. Overall median CH4 fluxes were - 0.28; -0.67 nmol CH4
   m(-2) s(-1) from the soakaway and control soil, respectively. While CO2
   fluxes expressed strong diurnal variability driven by soil temperature.
   CH4 fluxes were less affected by environmental factors and effectively
   limited to the first few meters from the septic tank. However, localised
   CH4 degassing events were observed during drying conditions with up to
   60-times higher fluxes compared to the overall median. The soakaway was
   found to be a net emitter of both CO2 and CH4, releasing a total of
   7.327 kg CO2 yr(-1) and 0.033 kg CO2Eq. yr(-1), respectively. The
   apparent spatio-temporal heterogeneity of observed soil gas fluxes
   identified in this study emphasises the importance of integrating
   measurements with both high spatial and temporal resolution from on-site
   installations as engineered nature-based solutions. (C) 2019 Published

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {Since 2006 the scientific community in California, in cooperation with
   resource managers, has been conducting periodic statewide studies about
   the potential impacts of climate change on natural and managed systems.
   This Special Issue is a compilation of revised papers that originate
   from the most recent assessment that concluded in 2009. As with the 2006
   studies that influenced the passage of California's landmark Global
   Warming Solutions Act (AB32), these papers have informed policy
   formulation at the state level, helping bring climate adaptation as a
   complementary measure to mitigation. We provide here a brief
   introduction to the papers included in this Special Issue focusing on
   how they are coordinated and support each other. We describe the common
   set of downscaled climate and sea-level rise scenarios used in this
   assessment that came from six different global climate models (GCMs) run
   under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios: B1 (low emissions) and A2
   (a medium-high emissions). Recommendations for future state assessments,
   some of which are being implemented in an on-going new assessment that
   will be completed in 2012, are offered.},

Title = {Obstacles to climate change adaptation decisions: a case study of

Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {International aid is increasingly focused on adaptation to climate
   change. At recent meetings of the parties to the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change, the developed world agreed to
   rapidly increase international assistance to help the developing world
   respond to the impacts of climate change. In this paper, we examine the
   decision-making challenges facing internationally supported climate
   change adaptation projects, using the example of efforts to implement
   coastal protection measures (e.g. sea walls, mangrove planting) in
   Kiribati. The central equatorial Pacific country is home to the Kiribati
   Adaptation Project, the first national-level climate change adaptation
   project supported by the World Bank. Drawing on interview and document
   research conducted over an 8-year period, we trace the forces
   influencing decisions about coastal protection measures, starting from
   the variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, through
   the trade-offs between different measures, to the social, political, and
   economic context in which decisions are finally made. We then discuss
   how sub-optimal adaptation measures may be implemented despite years of
   planning, consultation, and technical studies. This qualitative analysis
   of the real-world process of climate change adaptation reveals that
   embracing a culturally appropriate and short-term (similar to 20 years)
   planning horizon, while not ignoring the longer-term future, may reduce
   the influence of scientific uncertainty on decisions and provide
   opportunities to learn from mistakes, reassess the science, and adjust
   suboptimal investments. The limiting element in this approach to
   adaptation is likely to be the availability of consistent, long-term
   financing.},

Abstract = {The likelihood of leakage from sub-seabed Carbon Capture and Storage
   (CCS) sites has been debated since geological storage was proposed as an
   effective option to remove greenhouse gas emissions from the climate
   system. Within the marine environment, passive acoustics has been
   presented as a feasible way for detecting and quantifying any such
   leakage. When determining estimates of gas escape across the seabed, the
   influence of dynamic environments, introducing natural variations in
   seepage rates must be considered, including tidal cycles. Panarea,
   Sicily, is the location of a series of natural marine CO2 gas seeps and
   provides an excellent test bed to investigate variations of natural
   seabed gas leakage across a tidal cycle. A multivariate statistical
   approach was used to recognize the relationship when gas leakage is
   dominated by natural forcing. We show that the tidal height correlates
   negatively with the bubble sound power spectral density, the gas flux,
   and the bubble size. The strength of the correlation can vary
   significantly for different investigated time periods of observation,
   showing sensitivity of tidal influence. Our results corroborate evidence
   that natural migration of CO2 through the seabed is moderated by tidal
   cycles.},

Abstract = {Climate reconstructions reveal unprecedented warming in the past

   monsoon. We reconstructed the monsoon winds for the past 1000 years
   using fossil Globigerina bulloides abundance in box cores from the
   Arabian Sea and found that monsoon wind strength increased during the
   past four centuries as the Northern Hemisphere warmed. We infer that the
   observed link between Eurasian snow cover and the southwest monsoon
   persists on a centennial scale. Alternatively, the forcing implicated in
   the warming trend (volcanic aerosols, solar output, and greenhouse
   gases) may directly affect the monsoon. Either interpretation is
   consistent with the hypothesis that the southwest monsoon strength will
   increase during the coming century as greenhouse gas concentrations
   continue to rise and northern latitudes continue to warm.},

Abstract = {Since 1750, land-use change and fossil fuel combustion has led to a 46\%
   increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, causing
   global warming with substantial societal consequences. The Paris
   Agreement aims to limit global temperature increases to well below 2
   degrees C above preindustrial levels. Increasing levels of CO2 and other
   greenhouse gases (GH6s), such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O),
   in the atmosphere are the primary cause of climate change. Approximately
   half of the carbon emissions to the atmosphere are sequestered by ocean
   and land sinks, leading to ocean acidification but also slowing the rate
   of global warming. However, there are significant uncertainties in the
   future global warming scenarios due to uncertainties in the size,
   nature, and stability of these sinks. Quantifying and monitoring the
   size and timing of natural sinks and the impact of climate change on
   ecosystems are important information to guide policy-makers' decisions
   and strategies on reductions in emissions. Continuous, long-term
   observations are required to quantify GHG emissions, sinks, and their
   impacts on Earth systems. The Integrated Carbon Observation System
   (ICOS) was designed as the European in situ observation and information
   system to support science and society in their efforts to mitigate
   climate change. It provides standardized and open data currently from
   over 140 measurement stations across 12 European countries. The stations
   observe GHG concentrations in the atmosphere and carbon and GHG fluxes
   between the atmosphere, land surface, and the oceans. This article
   describes how ICOS fulfills its mission to harmonize these observations,
   ensure the related long-term financial commitments, provide easy access
   to well-documented and reproducible high-quality data and related
   protocols and tools for scientific studies, and deliver information and
   GHG-related products to stakeholders in society and policy.},

Abstract = {Climate change has added a new layer to the existing challenges in
   Africa that adaptation is high on the development agenda. Adaptation is
   necessary to build resilience of cities' response to climate change.
   Inland, coastal and mountainous cities face different climate risks
   ranging from storm surges, droughts, excessive rainfall, heat waves and
   cold waves. The impacts also range from flooding, storm surges, water
   scarcity and landslides. The urgency of climate change adaptation
   promises to revitalize practice in urban development around which
   innovations in planning, institutional readiness and community
   resilience are crucial to successful adaptation. Being an inland city,
   Kampala experiences increased frequency of floods with associated
   impacts on health, infrastructure and human settlements. Building on
   early and scalable adaptation measures is paramount to enable
   communities, institutions, urban authorities and different actors become
   climate ready while addressing the inherent challenges. In Kampala,
   community adaptation offers lessons but the requirement for scaling up
   needs urgent attention by city authorities and government for widespread
   adaptation.},

Title = {Effect of inundation on greenhouse gas emissions from temperate coastal
   wetland soils with different vegetation types in southern Australia},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {763},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Predicted sea level fluctuations and sea level rise with climate change
   will lead to inundation of coastal and estuarine soils. Coastal wetlands
   usually contain large amounts of organic matter, which can be potential
   sources of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs; CO2, CH4, N2O) during
   decomposition, but there are limited studies on the effects of sea level
   variation on GHGs in coastal wetlands. We measured the effect of
   brackish water inundation and wetting and drying cycles on GHG emissions
   from coastal wetland soil cores that supported four different vegetation
   types: Apiurn gravedens (AG), Leptospermurn lanigerurn (LL), Phragmites
   australis (PA) and Paspalum distichurn (PD) from the estuarine
   floodplain of the Aire River in south-western Victoria, Australia.
   Intact soil cores were incubated under either dry, flooded, or a 14 day
   wet-dry cycle treatments for a total of 56 days at a constant
   temperature of 23 degrees C. CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were investigated
   in closed chambers and measured with gas chromatography. In the dry
   treatment, a positive correlation was found between soil organic carbon
   (SOC) and CO2 flux, and between SOC and CH4 flux. Higher SOC is
   indicative of higher amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) which acts as
   a source of substrate for microbes to produce CO2 or CH4 emissions under
   aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The NO2 and NO3 concentrations were
   positively correlated with N2O emissions in the wet-dry cycle treatment.
   NO2- and NO3- provide a supply of substrate for denitrification. The
   flooded treatment decreased cumulative CO2 emissions by 34\%,25\% and
   14\% at the LL PA, PD sites, respectively, and decreased cumulative N2O
   emissions by 42\%, 39\% and 43\% at the AG, LL and PA sites, compared to
   the dry treatment. The wet-dry cycle treatment and dry treatment
   decreased cumulative CH4 emissions for all vegetation types compared to
   the flooded treatment. The redox potential (Eh) was negatively
   correlated with CH4 flux and positively correlated N2O flux at all
   sites. This study highlights the significance of sea level fluctuations
   when estimating GHG flux from coastal and estuarine floodplains which
   are highly vulnerable to inundation, and the role of SOC and mineral N
   as important drivers affecting GHG flux. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {188},

Abstract = {A study was conducted from 2015 to 2018 to find out the sustainability,
   profitability, energy efficiency and environmental impact of
   crop-livestock-aquaculture integration in west coast of India. Rice
   grown in rice-baby corn sequence recorded higher yield than rice-cowpea
   system. About 4 ton of fodder and 0.7 ton of azolla were produced and
   recycled as feed to the dairy animals. The household requirements of
   vegetables and fruits were produced in the kitchen garden (80 m(2)). The
   farming system recorded energy efficiency, net energy gain, and energy
   profitability of 2.63, 103311 MJ and 1.63 MJ, respectively. The
   greenhouse gas emission from the system was found to be 10.7 t CO2 eq.
   and the main contributor to the total emission were enteric methane
   emissions (24\%) from livestock component, diesel consumptions (16\%)
   and N2O emissions mainly from the chemical fertilizers (13\%). The
   percent share of different components to the net return was found higher
   in cropping systems (40.5\%) followed by dairy (37.8\%) with an
   employment potential of 269 man-days/year. The study conclusively
   reveals that integration of dairy, fishery, poultry components with
   diversified cropping in coastal lowland ecosystem is essential to offset
   the ecological imbalances arising due to continuous cultivation of rice
   crop. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing the coastal protection services of natural mangrove forests
   and artificial rock revetments},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal flooding and erosion cause significant social and economic
   impacts, globally. There is a growing interest in using natural habitats
   such as mangroves to defend coastlines. The protective services of
   mangroves, however, have not been assessed in the same rigorous
   engineering and socio-economic terms as rock revetments, and therefore
   are often overlooked by coastal managers. We used field measurements, a
   social science survey and economic valuation to compare the coastal
   protection services of mangroves and rock revetments, at five locations
   across Victoria, Australia. The results showed, in sheltered locations,
   both mangroves and rock revetments attenuated waves, however, the wave
   attenuation (per metre) of rock revetments was greater than mangroves,
   at two of the five locations. Only a small proportion of the survey
   respondents had observed flooding or erosion in their suburb but most
   agreed that mangroves provide important coastal protection benefits.
   Coastal landowners visited areas with mangroves more often than the
   public but were less likely to worry about the links between climate
   change and coastal erosion and flooding, or to agree that the coast was
   well protected with existing artificial coastal infrastructure, than
   other respondents. There were much higher up-front costs associated with
   building rock revetments, than planting mangroves, but rock revetments
   required less land than mangroves. Mangroves covered a larger area and
   averted more damages than rock revetments. Coastal managers and policy
   makers will have more success in advocating for nature-based solutions
   for coastal protection, if they are implemented in locations where they
   are eco-engineering and socio-economically acceptable options for
   climate change adaptation.},

Title = {How Much Human-Caused Global Warming Should We Expect with
   Business-As-Usual (BAU) Climate Policies? A Semi-Empirical Assessment},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In order to assess the merits of national climate change mitigation
   policies, it is important to have a reasonable benchmark for how much
   human-caused global warming would occur over the coming century with
   ``Business-As-Usual{''} (BAU) conditions. However, currently,
   policymakers are limited to making assessments by comparing the Global
   Climate Model (GCM) projections of future climate change under various
   different ``scenarios{''}, none of which are explicitly defined as BAU.
   Moreover, all of these estimates are ab initio computer model
   projections, and policymakers do not currently have equivalent
   empirically derived estimates for comparison. Therefore, estimates of
   the total future human-caused global warming from the three main
   greenhouse gases of concern (CO2, CH4, and N2O) up to 2100 are here
   derived for BAU conditions. A semi-empirical approach is used that
   allows direct comparisons between GCM-based estimates and empirically
   derived estimates. If the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases
   implies a Transient Climate Response (TCR) of >= 2.5 degrees C or an
   Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of >= 5.0 degrees C then the 2015
   Paris Agreement's target of keeping human-caused global warming below
   2.0 degrees C will have been broken by the middle of the century under
   BAU. However, for a TCR < 1.5 <degrees>C or ECS < 2.0 <degrees>C, the
   target would not be broken under BAU until the 22nd century or later.
   Therefore, the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   ``likely{''} range estimates for TCR of 1.0 to 2.5 degrees C and ECS of
   1.5 to 4.5 degrees C have not yet established if human-caused global
   warming is a 21st century problem.},

Title = {Forecasting of future greenhouse gas emission trajectory for India using
   energy and economic indexes with various metaheuristic algorithms},

Abstract = {The accelerating increment of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration in the
   atmosphere already reached an alarming level, and nowadays its adverse
   impacts on the living organisms, environment, and ecological balance of
   nature have been well-understood. India is one of the top countries that
   contribute the most to global GHG emissions. Therefore, it is of great
   significance to forecast the future GHG trends of the country in advance
   and accordingly take measures against the parameters that cause these
   emissions, considerably. In this direction, the present research has
   centered on forecasting the greenhouse gas trajectory of India with
   various metaheuristic algorithms. In this framework, marine predators
   algorithm (MPA), lightning search algorithm (LSA), equilibrium optimizer
   (EO), symbiotic organisms search (SOS), and backtracking search
   algorithm (BSA) are used for modeling the future GHG emission trajectory
   of India. Accordingly, the significant economic and energy indicators of
   India such as renewable energy generation, electricity generation from
   coal, electricity generation from gas, electricity generation from oil,
   gross domestic product, and population between 1990 and 2018 are
   collected to make a nexus with GHG emissions. As GHG emissions, CO2,
   CH4, F-gases, N2O, as well as total GHG emissions are separately
   forecasted by the year 2050. To make a better comparison, each GHG
   emission data in the last year five years is used for the testing phase
   of the algorithms, and then statistically discussed in terms of R2, MBE,
   rRMSE, and MAPE benchmarks. In the results, it is found that the R2
   value changes between 0.8822 and 0.9923 for CO2, 0.2855-0.9945 for CH4,
   0.9-0.9904 for F-gases, 0.4655-0.9964 for N2O, and 0.9016-0.9943 for
   total GHG emission, and the results in terms of rRMSE are very
   satisfying for all algorithms. In the study, it is forecasted that the
   two greenhouse gas emissions with the highest increase rate in 2050 will
   be between 2.5 and 2.87 times for CO2 emissions and between 2.8 and 3.5
   times for F-gases, compared to today's data. According to the results of
   the present paper, the total GHG emission for India is forecasted to be
   2.1-2.4 times higher in the year 2050 as compared to today. Given all
   forecasting results together, it is seen that the MPA algorithm
   generally gives the best results according to the statistical metric
   results, while the LSA algorithm generally gives the worst results.
   Consequently, the present paper strongly reports that the

Title = {A New Compact Cryogenic Air Sampler and Its Application in Stratospheric
   Greenhouse Gas Observation at Syowa Station, Antarctica},

Abstract = {To collect stratospheric air samples for greenhouse gas measurements, a
   compact cryogenic air sampler has been developed using a cooling device
   called the Joule-Thomson (J-T) minicooler. The J-T minicooler can
   produce liquefied neon within 5 s from high pressure neon gas precooled
   by liquid nitrogen. The sampler employs liquid neon as a refrigerant to
   solidify or liquefy sampled atmospheric constituents. Laboratory
   experiments showed that the sampler is capable of collecting about 3 and
   more than 7 L STP of air at 25 and 120 hPa, respectively, which
   corresponds to about 25 and 15 km above ground within 240 s,
   respectively. The new balloon-borne sampling system, which was set up
   for Antarctic experiments, consists of the compact sampler, a 2-L high
   pressure neon gas cylinder, pneumatic and solenoid valves, a controller
   with a GPS receiver, a telemetry transmitter, and batteries. The size of
   the sampling system is 300 mm width X 300 mm depth X 950 mm height and
   it weighs about 22 kg (including liquid nitrogen). Two of these compact
   sampling systems (configured for sampling at altitudes 18 and 25 km)
   were launched from Syowa Station (69.0 degrees S, 39.5 degrees E)
   Antarctica, in January 2008 using 1000 or 2000 m(3) plastic balloons.
   They were launched successfully and recovered without any problem on sea
   ice on the same day as their launch. The collected stratospheric air
   samples showed reasonable concentrations of the stratospheric greenhouse
   gases over the Antarctic region.},

Abstract = {We searched the literature for experimental and observational studies
   assessing the effects of seagrass overgrazing on erosion of sediment and
   sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) and found that most studies reported a
   significant impact, likely caused by a cascading effect (i.e., seagrass
   shoot loss -> belowground biomass degradation -> sediment
   destabilization or SOC erosion). However, there appears to be a clear
   lack of knowledge on the extent and mechanisms behind SOC erosion in
   seagrass meadows and we highlight the need for research to (1) define
   spatial and temporal scales of occurrence; (2) assess the influence of
   belowground biomass degradation, sediment characteristics, and
   hydrodynamic exposure on sediment stabilization; and (3) estimate the
   greenhouse gas emission after a disturbance. Such information would help
   coastal resource managers to address the causes and effects of SOC loss
   and sediment erosion when evaluating impacts of global change on coastal
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, and atmospheric pollutants,
   such as sulphur, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, are mainly
   generated from energy production and consumption. For several years the
   European Commission has given great importance to the control of
   atmospheric pollutants, establishing emission limits for LCPs (Large
   Combustion Plants), as well as national emission ceilings, at Member
   State level. The development of energy scenarios is the most crucial
   step in creating emission projections of air pollutants and greenhouse
   gases from energy sources, and ``business as usual{''} (b.a.u.) energy
   scenarios are normally considered to elaborate upon reference emission
   scenarios, on the basis of the abatement measures ruled in the current
   legislation. However, the b.a.u. energy scenarios could be deeply
   modified by the implementation of policies and measures aimed at energy
   saving, so emphasising the synergies existing between Air Quality and
   Climate Change, and at the same time reducing the abatement costs to
   ultimately protect human health and the environment. From this point of
   view, energy efficiency and renewable sources comprise two essential
   policy instruments to achieve the final objective. In this paper, an
   alternative energy scenario, taking into account a set of policies for
   increasing the energy efficiency and the share of renewable sources, is
   analysed and assessed in terms of decreased air pollutants and carbon
   dioxide emissions. Synergies and trade offs in air pollution are also
   analysed through a comparative and quantitative analysis of the
   reference and alternative scenarios, under the commitment to achieve the
   reduction objectives. The study has been carried out by the GAWS-Italy
   model, a national integrated assessment model developed by ENEA in
   collaboration with the International Institute for Applied Systems
   Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg. The modelling activity is ongoing under
   the sponsorship of the Italian Ministry for the Environment, the Land

Title = {Increased risk of near term global warming due to a recent AMOC
   weakening},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Some of the new generation CMIP6 models are characterised by a strong
   temperature increase in response to increasing greenhouse gases
   concentration(1). At first glance, these models seem less consistent
   with the temperature warming observed over the last decades. Here, we
   investigate this issue through the prism of low-frequency internal
   variability by comparing with observations an ensemble of 32 historical
   simulations performed with the IPSL-CM6A-LR model, characterized by a
   rather large climate sensitivity. We show that members with the smallest
   rates of global warming over the past 6-7 decades are also those with a
   large internally-driven weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
   Circulation (AMOC). This subset of members also matches several AMOC
   observational fingerprints, which are in line with such a weakening.
   This suggests that internal variability from the Atlantic Ocean may have
   dampened the magnitude of global warming over the historical era. Taking
   into account this AMOC weakening over the past decades means that it
   will be harder to avoid crossing the 2 degrees C warming threshold.
   New climate models show a stronger warming with greenhouse gas emissions
   than is suggested by observations. Here, the authors argue that internal
   variability of the Atlantic Ocean may have dampened some of the recent
   warming, which could explain part of the disagreement between the newer
   models and observations.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise poses a crisis for coastal communities. Many local
   governments have identified strategies to prepare for the impacts of sea
   level rise but often lack funding mechanisms. To date, the assumption
   that coastal adaptation is a public good has limited the tools used to
   finance responses to sea level rise. We argue that good characteristics
   - subtractability, excludability, heterogeneity, joint production, and
   capital intensity - combine in unique ways across adaptation strategies,
   and few strategies provide exclusively public goods. These good
   characteristics create political opportunities for application of
   financing mechanisms such as property taxes, district-level finance, and
   bonds that have been less commonly used for adaptation. Exploring the
   good characteristics of a particular adaptation strategy can help
   communities identify an appropriate and feasible mechanism for financing
   it.},

Title = {Resilience of coastal agricultural systems in Bangladesh: Assessment for
   agroecosystem stewardship strategies},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {106},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Assessments of ``resilience{''} are becoming a priority across multiple
   sectors. Specifically, the coastal agricultural system in Bangladesh
   faces a multitude of problems such as sea level rise. Building
   resilience for this system is thus important in accelerating the
   country's socio-economic development. Therefore, the objectives of this
   study are (a) to assess resilience of coastal agricultural systems and
   (b) to develop coastal agroecosystem stewardship strategies in
   Bangladesh. Resilience was assessed quantitatively, based on an
   established framework that includes three capacities (i.e., absorptive,
   adaptive and transformative) and five dimensions, namely, social,
   economic, ecological, physical and institutional. Fifteen indicators
   were developed by applying an assemblage of top-down and bottom-up
   approaches. A structured questionnaire was used to survey 330 households
   from 15 villages in five coastal sub-districts. The percentile value of
   composite resilience indices revealed that one-fifths of the coastal
   farmers (or households) had a mixed ability (e.g., fish farming skills)
   and capacity (e.g., better decision-making) to recover, reorganise and
   evolve following shocks (e.g., flash flood) and stresses (e.g., water
   logging). Following resilience assessment, five coastal agroecosystem
   stewardship strategies (facilitating adaptive agricultural governance;
   promoting economic and ecological diversity; fostering social learning;
   investing in coastal infrastructure; and increasing agricultural
   productivity) are developed based on principal component analysis. The
   methods of objectively developing stewardship strategies can be
   replicable to other coastal areas. The findings of this study are
   intended to be used for contributing to coastal adaptation planning in
   Bangladesh, especially for the Delta Plan 2100.},

Abstract = {Recently Taiwan's coastal land is highly development and utilization.
   Particularly in the west coastal space carry large bearing capacity. But
   the study assessment of the climate change capacity for coastal zoning
   has less researches in Taiwan. Therefore, this study discussed the
   management competition in laws, regulations and space, proposed the
   suitable designated range and criteria, established the indicators based
   on Chiu {[}1]. On the other hand, the increasing of typhoons frequency
   and sea level rise on the coastal impact are discussed. Combined with
   vulnerability in the coastal areas, through the relevant disaster risk
   analysis and assessment of coastal areas can be described by future
   adaptation strategies to climate change and coastal protection zoning
   basic analysis of the basis set. This study not only defined the range
   for Coastal Protection Areas (CPA), but also based on the suggestion of
   International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) proposed the
   Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) and Coastal Vulnerability Level (CVL)
   fitting Taiwan's coastal environment by 10 factors and the impact of sea
   level rising. Finally, we developed a classification approach and
   designed criteria as a reference for coastal protection zone planning in
   the future.},

Title = {Coastal management in Portugal: Practices for reflection and learning},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {181},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Portugal is located in the southwest of Europe. From economic, cultural,
   social and environmental point of views, Portuguese coastal areas face
   multiple challenges related to the coastal management policy,the
   functionality of the governmental services and the responses to the
   society, in particular, to the affected citizens. Qualitative and
   quantitative understanding of the coastal morphological processes is
   necessary, as it is a precondition for a successful coastal management
   approach. This paper aims to provide a general overview of the recent
   morphological coastal development in Portugal, summarize some past
   experiences on coastal protection and identify potential problems and
   challenges as an attempt to support an integrated coastal management
   policy that can be applied in Portugal and other countries facing the
   same difficulties to mitigate and manage coastal erosion. Special focus
   is given to the legal status and policy on coastal monitoring, by
   analyzing the administration responsibilities concerning coastal
   management, legislation and regulations, as well as policy tools
   schemes, built into the legal structure with different levels of
   hierarchy. The manuscript ends with a brief analysis of some future
   coastal protection measures that are part of a national coastal
   adaptation strategy proposed to fulfill a set of goals to be established
   by 2050.},

Journal = {ENERGY TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {13-28},

Abstract = {A clear consensus exists in German society that it is necessary to
   achieve ambitious greenhouse-gas emission reduction targets and that
   renewable energies have to play a dominant role in the future German
   energy-supply system. However, many questions are still under
   discussion, for instance about the relevance of the different
   technologies such as photovoltaic systems or wind energy converters
   installed offshore in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Concerns are
   often expressed regarding the cost of a future energy system mainly
   based on renewable energies. To be able to address the raised issues on
   a scientifically sound basis we have set up a new simulation model
   REMod-D (Renewable Energy Model-Deutschland) that models a possible
   future German energy system for all sectors, including all renewable
   energy converters, storage components, secondary energy converters, and
   loads for an entire year based upon an hourly simulation. Moreover, the
   model includes retrofitting of buildings for energy efficiency as a
   measure to reduce the future heat loads of the building sector. A
   generic optimizer is applied to identify system compositions with
   minimal overall annual cost. After a short introduction about the
   modeling approach, the results of parameter studies are presented.},

Title = {Ebullition was a major pathway of methane emissions from the aquaculture
   ponds in southeast China},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {184},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Aquaculture ponds are hotspots of carbon cycling and important
   anthropogenic sources of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4).
   Despite the importance of CH4 ebullition in aquatic ecosystems, its
   magnitude and spatiotemporal variations in aquaculture ponds remain
   poorly understood. In this study, we determined the rates and
   spatiotemporal variations of ebullitive CH4 emissions from three
   mariculture ponds during the aquaculture period of two years at a
   subtropical estuary in southeast China. Our results showed that the mean
   ebullitive CH4 flux from the studied ponds was 14.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)
   during the aquaculture period and accounted for over 90\% of the total
   CH4 emission, indicating the importance of ebullition as a major CH4
   transport mechanism. Ebullitive CH4 emission demonstrated a clear
   seasonal pattern, with a peak value during the middle stage of
   aquaculture. Sediment temperature was found to be an important factor
   influencing the seasonal variations in CH4 ebullition. Ebullitive CH4
   fluxes also exhibited considerable spatial variations within the ponds,
   with 49.7-71.8\% of the whole pond CH4 ebullition being detected in the
   feeding zone where the large loading of sediment organic matter fueled
   CH4 production. Aquaculture ponds have much higher ebullitive CH4
   effluxes than other aquatic ecosystems, which indicated the urgency to
   mitigate CH4 emission from aquaculture activities. Our findings
   highlighted that the importance of considering the large spatiotemporal
   variations in ebullitive CH4 flux in improving the accuracy of
   large-scale estimation of CH4 fluxes in aquatic ecosystems. Future
   studies should be conducted to characterize CH4 ebullitive fluxes over a
   greater number and diversity of aqua culture ponds and examine the
   mechanisms controlling CH4 ebullition in aquatic ecosystems. (c) 2020

Title = {Beyond Global Warming Potential A Comparative Application of Climate
   Impact Metrics for the Life Cycle Assessment of Coal and Natural Gas

Abstract = {In the ongoing debate about the climate benefits of fuel switching from
   coal to natural gas for power generation, the metrics used to model
   climate impacts may be important. In this article, we evaluate the life
   cycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal and natural gas used in new,
   advanced power plants using a broad set of available climate metrics in
   order to test for the robustness of results. Climate metrics included in
   the article are global warming potential, global temperature change
   potential, technology warming potential, and cumulative radiative
   forcing. We also used the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas
   Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) climate-change model to validate the
   results. We find that all climate metrics suggest a natural gas combined
   cycle plant offers life cycle climate benefits over 100 years compared
   to a pulverized coal plant, even if the life cycle methane leakage rate
   for natural gas reaches 5\%. Over shorter time frames (i.e., 20 years),
   plants using natural gas with a 4\% leakage rate have similar climate
   impacts as those using coal, but are no worse than coal. If carbon
   capture and sequestration becomes available for both types of power
   plants, natural gas still offers climate benefits over coal as long as
   the life cycle methane leakage rate remains below 2\%. These results are
   consistent across climate metrics and the MAGICC model over a 100-year
   time frame. Although it is not clear whether any of these metrics are
   better than the others, the choice of metric can inform decisions based
   on different societal values. For example, whereas annual temperature
   change reported may be a more relevant metric to evaluate the human
   health effects of increased heat, the cumulative temperature change may
   be more relevant to evaluate climate impacts, such as sea-level rise,
   that will result from the cumulative warming.},

Abstract = {Methodology of the Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H) ratio retrieval based on
   high-resolution infrared spectra observed by space sensors has been
   described. Simulated atmospheric radiance in the spectral range of
   650-2500 cm(-1) for the case of nadir observation from satellite with
   resolution of about 0.1 cm(-1) is investigated aiming to find
   appropriate signals of isotopes of greenhouse gases. Signals
   corresponding to an atmospheric water vapor isotoporner, HDO, were
   selected. These signals were identified in Interferometric Monitor for
   Greenhouse gases (IMG) spectra observed during Advanced Earth Observing
   Satellite (ADEOS) mission. The developed method includes the following
   stages: temperature profile retrieval with aerosol correction, H2O and
   HDO profiles and their column amounts retrieval, and D/H ratio
   determination. The method has been applied to the analysis of the
   IMG/ADEOS data identified as to be observed under clear sky conditions
   over an ocean area between 80S-80N and 130-170W to determining D/H
   column amount ratios. The latitudinal distribution of D/H ratio for a
   short period in December 1996 was obtained.},

Journal = {ANALYTICAL METHODS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {756-762},
Abstract = {Obtaining in situ information on greenhouse gases arising from deepwater
   environments is a challenge that has not been satisfactorily resolved to
   date. An infrared attenuated total reflection (IR-ATR) based on-line
   sensor system for detecting, monitoring, and differentiating carbon
   dioxide and methane in dissolved and gaseous states at different
   pressures (i.e., up to 6 MPa) in saline aquifer and/or synthetic brine
   environments is presented. It is demonstrated that the detection of
   dissolved CO2 next to (CO2)-C-13 and methane under pressurized
   conditions is possible under saline downhole conditions, and that
   gaseous vs. dissolved states of methane and CO2 in aqueous environments
   may be differentiated using IR-ATR sensing techniques. Finally, it is
   shown for the first time that there are observable changes associated
   with distinctive infrared signatures of methane under the conditions of
   greenhouse gas storage mechanisms. These are of particular importance
   for advancing carbon capture and storage processes and fundamentally
   understanding the impact of emissions during the extraction of
   fossil-based fuels (i.e., shale, petroleum, etc.) from offshore
   environments.},

Abstract = {The cycling of carbon on Earth exerts a fundamental influence upon the
   greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere, and hence global climate over
   millennia. Until recently, ice sheets were viewed as inert components of
   this cycle and largely disregarded in global models. Research in the
   past decade has transformed this view, demonstrating the existence of
   uniquely adapted microbial communities, high rates of
   biogeochemical/physical weathering in ice sheets and storage and cycling
   of organic carbon (>10(4) Pg C) and nutrients. Here we assess the active
   role of ice sheets in the global carbon cycle and potential
   ramifications of enhanced melt and ice discharge in a warming world.},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {In terms of net intensification in the greenhouse effect ie., rise of
   global temperature which has triggered melting of glacier thus
   increasing sea level and acidification of sea, carbon dioxide alone
   contributes approximately three-fourth of the net greenhouse radiative
   forcing by man-made (anthropogenic) greenhouse gases emissions. Carbon
   dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology; a promising strategy for
   capturing of carbon dioxide from point sources before its release to
   atmosphere by using various sorbents is gaining global interest. In this
   study, the established carbon capture technologies with methods of
   carbon dioxide separation along there pros and cons are discussed.
   Carbon-based adsorbents are considered as the most versatile adsorbents
   for carbon dioxide due to their extraordinary physical and chemical
   properties. In this manuscript, recent developments on carbonaceous
   adsorbents (biochar, activated carbons, and graphene-based adsorbents)
   and their role in carbon dioxide capture during different combustion
   processes and conditions have been comprehensively focused. (C) 2019

Title = {Global Lessons for Adapting Coastal Communities to Protect against Storm
   Surge Inundation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {790-801},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal inundation as a result of global sea-level rise and storm surge
   events is expected to affect many coastal regions and settlements.
   Adaptation is widely accepted as necessary for managing inundation risk.
   However, managing inundation risk is inherently contentious because of
   many uncertainties and because a large number of stakeholder interests
   and values are mobilised. For these reasons, among others, adaptation
   progress in many countries has been slow. Despite progress in adaptation
   research, a critical knowledge gap remains regarding the appropriateness
   and applicability of various adaptation options, including their
   transferability between different coastal settings. We review the
   international literature on coastal adaptation options (including
   options to defend, accommodate, or retreat) to manage inundation risk,
   focusing on developed, liberal economies of Western Europe, North
   America, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand. In doing so, we identify
   the favoured strategies adopted by these nations, probe the influence of
   physical and institutional context on the selection of these options,
   and identify what lessons might be exchanged or future directions
   inferred. The review places particular emphasis on the Australian
   experience as a comparative device to highlight some important
   distinctions. These distinctions focus on how government responsibility
   is exercised, including the degree of centralisation; the ``fit{''} of
   options to local coastal environments and social values (i.e. their
   suitability and acceptability); and the transferability of different
   adaptation options in international contexts.},

Abstract = {Small community businesses bear the brunt of climate change impacts.
   Studies of the vulnerability and resilience of such businesses
   predominantly focus on firm-level characteristics and organizational
   issues. This paper addresses the lack of individual-level
   considerations. It explores an analytical approach that draws upon the
   concepts of social capital and sense of place for understanding
   community businesses' resilience to extreme weather. An empirical study
   was conducted to investigate whether and how the attributes of these
   concepts are related to adaptation practice. This study is based on a
   structured questionnaire survey of community businesses at various
   locations around the Pearl River Estuary that are exposed to storm
   surges. The findings partially support the hypothesis that action is
   more likely to be taken when social capital is strong. Community
   businesses are more likely to adopt adaptation strategies when their
   owners or operators perceive a higher level of social expectation, but
   are less likely to do so when they have better relationships with the
   people around them. This study indicated the potential for moral hazard
   driven by good social relationships and supported the understanding of
   small community businesses as firms and social agents in responding to
   climate change impacts. There is a need for recognizing the social
   dimensions of small businesses' rationality in their adaptation and
   hazard adjustment, and strengthening their engagement with
   community-based adaptation through social institutions.},

Title = {Index for climate change adaptation in China and its application},

Abstract = {With the increasing awareness of the risks and impacts of climate
   change, scholars tend to pay more attention to the applications of
   indicators, which access the effectiveness of climate change adaptation.
   This study aims to evaluate the overall progress of climate change
   adaptation in China during 2010-2018 in a quantitative manner. The Index
   for Climate Change Adaptation in China (ICCAC) has been thus developed
   by adopting the analytic hierarchy process weighting and expert scoring
   method. Namely, ICCAC is composed of national climate change impacts,
   adaptation actions in key sectors, adaptation progress in key sectors,
   and the national adaptation policy framework. Overall, the ICCAC and its
   four sub-indexes increased significantly from 2010 to 2018, on a
   yearly-basis. Each sub-index implied that the socio-economic impacts
   caused by climate change in China have been alleviated gradually;
   specifically, the mainstream endeavor of key sectors has witnessed
   remarkable progress, however, it is worth noting that the gap between
   individual adaptation actions and policies still exists; the
   implementation effect of policies in key sectors is not as affluent as
   that of actions; the current adaptation endeavor in key areas is still
   closely related to the mainstream business of corresponding competent
   ministries rather than adaptation-aimed actions; the national adaptation
   policy framework has been primarily formed, but there are still some
   deficiencies. As a result, the gap in China's adaptation process could
   be mainly manifested in the following five aspects: i) adaptation
   effectiveness assessment in forestry and urban infrastructure is
   urgently needed; ii) policies in marine and water resources sectors need
   structural reforms; iii) evaluation criteria for national adaptation are
   not necessarily sufficient; iv) the improvement of adaptive management
   efficiency has stagnated recently; and v) the adaptation works of
   relevant Ministries should be coordinated and put forward the
   corresponding strategies. Finally, this study presents four proposals:
   conducting an evaluation of adaptation actions in all key sectors,
   integrating climate change impacts into sectoral planning decisions,
   launching concrete action plans for adaptation, establishing a complete
   policy framework on adaptation.},

Title = {Using big data analytics to synthesize research domains and identify

Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The growing concerns over urbanization and climate change have resulted
   in an exponential growth in publications on urban climatology in recent
   decades. However, an advanced synthesis that characterizes the existing
   studies is lacking. In this review, we used citation network analysis
   and a text mining approach to identify research trends and extract
   common research topics and the emerging domains in urban climatology.
   Based on the clustered networks, we found that aerosols and ozone, and
   urban heat island are the most popular topics. Together with other
   clusters, four emerging topical fields were identified: secondary
   organic aerosols, urban precipitation, flood risk and adaptation, and
   greenhouse gas emissions. The city case studies' geographical
   information was analyzed to explore the spatial-temporal patterns,
   especially in the emerging topical fields. Interdisciplinary research
   grew in recent years as the field of urban climatology expanded to
   interact with urban hydrology, health, energy issues, and social
   sciences. A few knowledge gaps were proposed: the lack of long-term
   high-temporal-resolution observational data of organic aerosols for
   model validation and improvements, the need for predictions of urban
   effects on precipitation and extreme flooding events under climate
   change, and the lack of a framework for cooperation between physical
   sciences and social sciences under urban settings. To fill these gaps,
   we call for more observational data with high spatial and temporal
   resolution, using high-resolution models that adequately represent urban
   processes to conduct scenario analyses for urban planning, and the
   development of intellectual frameworks for better integration of urban
   climatology and social-economical systems in cities.

Title = {Carbon emissions from a temperate peat fire and its relevance to

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {111},

Abstract = {{[}1] The contribution of wildfire in peatlands outside of boreal and
   tropical regions to interannual variability of global carbon emissions
   has been relatively little studied. There are 0.19 to 0.88 million km(2)
   of localized peat deposits in the temperate zone ( 30 - 50 degrees
   latitude) where drainage and climate change may affect the status of
   this potentially large carbon pool. For example, in the coastal plain of
   North Carolina, USA, where wildfire is common, over 325 teragrams of
   carbon (Tg C) are stored in peat deposits up to 5 m deep. We estimated
   carbon emissions for a temperate peatland fire in North Carolina using
   remote sensing to reconstruct burn severity and topographic lidar to
   constrain peat burn depths. Total carbon emissions for the fire ranged
   from 1 to 3.8 Tg, with spatially heterogeneous patterns of carbon fluxes
   (0.2 to 11 kg C m(-2)) responding to variation in vegetation type, peat
   burn depth, soil substrate ( mineral or organic), and fire severity. To
   maintain a carbon sink in this region at the current rates of carbon
   sequestration (0.109 to 0.127 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) we estimated a fire
   return interval of greater than 20 - 80 years. Continued drainage and
   future drought could decrease the fire return interval to less than 20
   years or increase peat burn depths thereby converting these peatlands
   into a net carbon source. On a global scale, this study suggests that
   temperate peatland fires may emit up to 0.32 petagrams of carbon during
   drought years, a significant contribution to interannual greenhouse gas
   variability.},

Abstract = {Global warming is leading to a water resources decrease in the
   Mediterranean basin, where future farming resilience depends on
   incorporating alternative water sources and improving water-energy use
   efficiency. This paper assesses water and energy consumption when
   natural water sources are partially replaced by desalinated sea water.
   Initially, energy consumption, water supply and GHG (greenhouse gas)
   emissions were recorded for the current farming practices in SE
   (southeast) Spain. The results of our study indicate that citrus
   orchards have the lowest energy consumption and GHG emissions. Annual
   vegetables were the least energy efficient crops. Subsequently, two
   alternative water supply scenarios were analysed, in which the reduction
   of natural water resources associated to climate change was compensated
   with desalinated sea water. The use of 16.8\% of desalinated seawater
   would increase energy consumption by 32.4\% and GHG emissions by 19.6\%,
   whereas for the use of 26.5\% of desalinated seawater such increases
   would amount to 50.0\% and 30.3\%, respectively. Therefore maintaining
   irrigated agriculture in water-stressed regions by incorporating high
   energy demanding non-traditional water sources could negatively
   contribute to combat global warming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Algae a promising energy reserve due to its adaptability, cheap source,

   sequester than terrestrial plants in an eco-friendly and economical way
   with simultaneous wastewater remediation. Hydrothermal liquefaction of
   algae biomass was the most preferred mode for biofuel generation than
   pyrolysis due to high moisture content. The algae based fuels exhibit
   less greenhouse gases emission and higher energy value. This review
   helps the researchers, environmentalists and industrialists to evaluate

Abstract = {The interactive and cumulative impacts of climate change on natural
   resources such as coral reefs present numerous challenges for
   conservation planning and management. Climate change adaptation is
   complex due to climate-stressor interactions across multiple spatial and
   temporal scales. This leaves decision makers worldwide faced with local,
   regional, and global-scale threats to ecosystem processes and services,
   occurring over time frames that require both near-term and long-term
   planning. Thus there is a need for structured approaches to adaptation
   planning that integrate existing methods for vulnerability assessment
   with design and evaluation of effective adaptation responses. The Corals
   and Climate Adaptation Planning project of the U.S. Coral Reef Task
   Force seeks to develop guidance for improving coral reef management
   through tailored application of a climate-smart approach. This approach
   is based on principles from a recently-published guide which provides a
   framework for adopting forward-looking goals, based on assessing
   vulnerabilities to climate change and applying a structured process to
   design effective adaptation strategies. Work presented in this paper
   includes: (1) examination of the climate-smart management cycle as it
   relates to coral reefs; (2) a compilation of adaptation strategies for
   coral reefs drawn from a comprehensive review of the literature; (3)
   in-depth demonstration of climate-smart design for place-based crafting
   of robust adaptation actions; and (4) feedback from stakeholders on the
   perceived usefulness of the approach. We conclude with a discussion of
   lessons-learned on integrating climate-smart design into real-world
   management planning processes and a call from stakeholders for an
   ``adaptation design tool{''} that is now under development.},

Abstract = {RECONSTRUCTIONS of early Eocene climate depict a world in which the
   polar environments support mammals and reptiles, deciduous forests, warm
   oceans and rare frost conditions 1-5. At the same time, tropical sea
   surface temperatures are interpreted to have been the same as or
   slightly cooler than present values 6. The question of how to warm polar
   regions of Earth without noticeably warming the tropics remains
   unresolved; increased amounts of greenhouse gases would be expected to
   warm all latitudes equally 7. Oceanic heat transport has been postulated
   as a mechanism for heating high latitudes 8-10, but it is difficult to
   explain the dynamics that would achieve this 7,11. Here we consider
   estimates of Eocene wetland areas and suggest that the flux of methane,
   an important greenhouse gas, may have been substantially greater during
   the Eocene than at present. Elevated methane concentrations would have
   enhanced early Eocene global warming, and also might specifically have
   prevented severe winter cooling of polar regions because of the
   potential of atmospheric methane to promote the formation of optically
   thick, polar stratospheric ice clouds 12-14.},

Abstract = {The storage of anomalous heat and carbon in the Southern Ocean in
   response to increasing greenhouse gases greatly mitigates atmospheric
   warming and exerts a large impact on the marine ecosystem. However, the
   mechanisms driving the ocean storage patterns are uncertain. Here using
   recent hydrographic observations, we compare for the first time the
   spatial patterns of heat and carbon storage, which show substantial
   differences in the Southern Ocean, in contrast with the conventional
   view of simple passive subduction into the thermocline. Using an
   eddy-rich global climate model, we demonstrate that redistribution of
   the preindustrial temperature field is the dominant control on the heat
   storage pattern, whereas carbon storage largely results from passive
   transport of anthropogenic carbon uptake at the surface. Lastly, this
   study highlights the importance of realistic representation of wind and
   surface buoyancy flux in climate models to improve future projection of
   circulation change and thus heat and carbon storage.},

Abstract = {The South Carolina Aquarium's Resilience Initiative for Coastal
   Education (R.I.C.E.) is a scalable model for community resilience
   outreach and action that facilitates engagement across socioeconomic
   strata and aids the collaborative development of coordinated coastal
   resilience strategies along the South Atlantic Bight. Projected
   biosphere climate perturbations pose a significant threat to human
   health and safety, commerce, culture, and stability of ecosystem
   services on a local level, particularly in the South Carolina Low
   country. At notable risk are socially vulnerable communities, the
   cultural heritage of the Gullah Geechee people, and the reproductive
   success of threatened loggerhead sea turtles reliant on South Carolina's
   Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge for nesting purposes. The R.I.C.E.
   endeavor's solution-oriented collaborative approach leverages innovative
   technologies and novel methods to engage citizens, inclusive of
   environmental justice principles, in locally-appropriate
   resilience-building actions. Advanced technological tools, including the
   SeaRise Beta web application with integrated citizen science
   functionality, generate community literacy on the topic of sea level
   rise and efficiently convert knowledge to action to help communities
   actualize on-the-ground mitigation strategies in partnership with
   municipal leaders, policy makers, conservation agencies, and businesses.
   The initial success of the R.I.C.E. model bolsters its ability to serve
   as a national prototype for effective education and engagement of
   diverse communities on the topic of coastal resilience.},

Title = {Impact of direct greenhouse gas emissions on the carbon footprint of
   water reclamation processes employing nitrification-denitrification},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {505},
Pages = {1166-1173},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Water reclamation has the potential to reduce water supply demands from
   aquifers and more energy-intensive water production methods (e.g.,
   seawater desalination). However, water reclamation via biological
   nitrification-denitrification is also associated with the direct
   emission of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, N2O, and CH4. We quantified
   these direct emissions from the nitrification-denitrification reactors
   of a water reclamation plant in Southern California, and measured the
   C-14 content of the CO2 to distinguish between short- and long-lived
   carbon. The total emissions were 1.5 (+/- 0.2) g-fossil CO2 m(-3) of
   wastewater treated, 0.5 (+/- 0.1) g-CO2-eq of CH4 m(-3), and 1.8 (+/-
   0.5) g-CO2-eq of N2O m(-3), for a total of 3.9 (+/- 0.5) g-CO2-eq m(-3).
   This demonstrated that water reclamation can be a source of GHGs from
   long lived carbon, and thus a candidate for GHG reduction credit. From
   the C-14 measurements, we found that between 11.4\% and 15.1\% of the
   CO2 directly emitted was derived from fossil sources, which challenges
   past assumptions that the direct CO2 emissions from water reclamation
   contain only modern carbon. A comparison of our direct emission
   measurements with estimates of indirect emissions from several water
   production methods, however, showed that the direct emissions from water
   reclamation constitute only a small fraction of the plant's total GHG
   footprint. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Hazards},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are effective natural coastal flood barriers that protect
   adjacent communities. Coral degradation compromises the coastal
   protection value of reefs while also reducing their other ecosystem
   services, making them a target for restoration. Here we provide a
   physics-based evaluation of how coral restoration can reduce coastal
   flooding for various types of reefs. Wave-driven flooding reduction is
   greatest for broader, shallower restorations on the upper fore reef and
   between the middle of the reef flat and the shoreline than for deeper
   locations on the fore reef or at the reef crest. These results indicate
   that to increase the coastal hazard risk reduction potential of reef
   restoration, more physically robust species of coral need to be
   outplanted to shallower, more energetic locations than more fragile,
   faster-growing species primarily being grown in coral nurseries. The
   optimization and quantification of coral reef restoration efforts to
   reduce coastal flooding may open hazard risk reduction funding for
   conservation purposes.},

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Nature-based shoreline protection provides a welcome class of
   adaptations to promote ecological resilience in the face of climate
   change. Along coastlines, living shorelines are among the preferred
   adaptation strategies to both reduce erosion and provide ecological
   functions. As an alternative to shoreline armoring, living shorelines
   are viewed favorably among coastal managers and some private property
   owners, but they have yet to undergo a thorough examination of how their
   levels of ecosystem functions compare to their closest natural
   counterpart: fringing marshes. Here, we provide a synthesis of results
   from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared
   numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish,
   invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon
   storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living
   shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia,
   USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading,
   placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S.
   alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward
   and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found
   that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes
   in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due
   to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic
   sands. These data support the prioritization of living shorelines as a
   coastal adaptation strategy.},

Title = {Mopping up leaking carbon: A natural analog at Wadi Namaleh, Jordan},
Journal = {CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-279},
Abstract = {Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is one of the important options
   available for partially stemming greenhouse gas emissions from large
   point sources. The possibility of leaking from deep storage needs to be
   addressed. The Wadi Namaleh area in southern Jordan provides an
   interesting case study of how excess CO2 can be trapped in the form of
   carbonates in the near surface, even when the local geology is not
   obviously conducive for such a process.
   Carbonate veins are formed in surface alteration zones of rhyolite host
   rock in this arid region. The alteration zones are limited to areas
   where surface soil or colluvium are present. Oxygen, deuterium and
   carbon isotopes of the carbonates and near-surface ground water in the
   area suggest that the source of carbon is deep seated CO2, and that the
   carbonate precipitated in local meteoric water under ambient temperature
   conditions. Analysis of strontium in the carbonate, fresh rhyolite and
   altered host shows that the source for calcium is aeolian. Trace
   elements show that metal and REE mobility are constrained to the
   alteration zone.
   Thus, interaction of H2O, CO2 and atmospheric wet and dry deposition
   lead to the formation of the clayey (montmorillonite) alteration zone.
   This zone acts to trap seeping CO2 and water, and thus produces
   conditions of progressively more efficient trapping of carbon dioxide by
   means of a positive feedback mechanism. Replication of these conditions
   in other areas will minimize CO2 leakage from man-made CCS sites. (C)

Title = {Energy and Air Emission Effects of Water Supply},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {43},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2680-2687},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Life-cycle air emission effects of supplying water are explored using a
   hybrid life-cycle assessment For the typically sized U.S. utility
   analyzed, recycled water is preferable to desalination and comparable to
   importation. Seawater desalination has an energy and air emission
   footprint that is 1.5-2.4 times larger than that of imported water.
   However, some desalination modes fare better, brackish groundwater is
   53-66\% as environmentally intensive as seawater desalination. The
   annual water needs (326 m(3)) of a typical Californian that is met with
   imported water requires 5.8 GJ of energy and creates 360 kg of CO2
   equivalent emissions. With seawater desalination, energy use would
   increase to 14 GJ and 800 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. Meeting the
   water demand of California with desalination would consume 52\% of the
   state's electricity. Supply options were reassessed using alternative
   electricity mixes, including the average mix of the United States and
   several renewable sources. Desalination using solar thermal energy has
   lower greenhouse gas emissions than that of imported and recycled water
   (using California's electricity mix), but using the U.S. mix increases
   the environmental footprint by 1.5 times. A comparison with a more
   energy-intensive international scenario shows that CO2 equivalent
   emissions for desalination in Dubai are 1.6 times larger than in
   California. The methods, decision support tool (WEST), and results of
   this study should persuade decision makers to make informed water policy
   choices by including energy consumption and material use effects in the
   decision-making process.},

Title = {Nitrate removal and potential soil N2O emissions in eutrophic salt
   marshes with and without Phragmites australis},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {282},
Pages = {49-58},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Wetlands are highly effective systems mitigating the negative effects of
   N excess, but at the same time they contribute to global warming through
   greenhouse gas emissions. The present study aimed to ascertain the role
   of Phragmites australis in N transformations in eutrophic semiarid salt
   marshes, under low (NO3- = 20 mg L-1) and high (NO3- = 200 mg L-1)
   nutrient level and alternating flooding-drying phases. Methacrylate
   mesocosms were filled with a saline soil, with and without the presence
   of Phragmites stands, and subjected to alternating flooding-drying
   conditions. For 44 weeks the soil Eh was regularly monitored at two
   depths and the N-NO3- and N-NH4+ concentration in pore water and
   drainage and the potential soil N-N2O emissions to the atmosphere
   measured. In the surface soil layers, more than the 80\% of N-NO3- was
   removed regardless of the presence of plants, the nutrient level and the
   season of the year. Denitrification seemed to be the main responsible of
   this. In the subsurface soil layers N-NO3- decreased an average of
   similar to 83\% in presence of Phragmites and similar to 32\% without
   plants during the warmer period (soil temp. similar to 15 to similar to
   30 degrees C), but the effectiveness was reduced to <10\% during the
   colder period (soil temp. similar to 10 to similar to 15 degrees C). The
   N-NH4+ increased during the flooding phases (reaching 2-6 mg L-1), and
   the results indicated that it was nitrified during the following drying
   phases. A tendency to lower potential soil N-N2O emissions was observed
   in treatments with Phragmites during drying phases, pointing that the
   plants absorbed this newly formed N-NO3-. Hence, we propose harvesting
   Phragmites stands at the beginning of the summer, but after a lag time
   to permit N-NO3- absorption by plants before the complete drying of the
   watercourses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Coal mine methane (CMM) is a term given to the methane gas produced or
   emitted in association with coal mining activities either from the coal
   seam itself or from other gassy formations underground. The amount of
   CMM generated at a specific operation depends on the productivity of the
   coal mine, the gassiness of the coal seam and any underlying and
   overlying formations, operational variables, and geological conditions.
   CMM can be captured by engineered boreholes that augment the mine's
   ventilation system or it can be emitted into the mine environment and
   exhausted from the mine shafts along with ventilation air. The large
   amounts of methane released during mining present concerns about
   adequate mine ventilation to ensure worker safety, but they also can
   create opportunities to generate energy if this gas is captured and
   utilized properly. This article reviews the technical aspects of CMM
   capture in and from coal mines, the main factors affecting CMM
   accumulations in underground coal mines, methods for capturing methane
   using boreholes, specific borehole designs for effective methane
   capture, aspects of removing methane from abandoned mines and from
   sealed/active gobs of operating mines, benefits of capturing and
   controlling CMM for mine safety, and benefits for energy production and
   greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Farming adaptation in low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh is mandatory
   due to increasing impacts of climate change on agriculture. The study
   evaluated farmers' perception on climate-related hazards, climate
   variables and factors. Further, the study identified different existence
   sustainable farming adaptation measures. The final outcomes are
   concluded throughout synergic data analysis, quantitative including
   climatic and environmental data, and qualitative from farmers'
   perception. Eight focus group discussions, 200 household surveys and six
   key informant interviews were carried out to receive farmers' perception
   on climate change and impacts of agriculture. Results revealed that
   farmers' perception and climate data analytical outcomes for decreasing
   annual precipitation and increasing temperature are highly correlated,
   whereas 20-year (1995-2015) climate data from 11 meteorological stations
   showed that annual precipitation is decreased 548 mm, and atmospheric
   annual mean temperature is increased 1.06 degrees C. Crop model showed a
   change in cropping seasons, where the autumn and late autumn are no
   longer existing and monsoon season is moving toward the winter. Farmers'
   are migrating their occupations which showed the seasonal livelihood
   calendar and choosing shrimp and crab cultivation nowadays. Pearson
   Chi-square independence test identified the significant relationship
   between 24 independent and 4 dependent variables. This statistical
   analysis identified five key factors, including climatic, social,
   environmental, economic and physical, for farming adaptation due to
   climate change. The study exposed that farmers are adapted 11
   adaptations strategies introduced by the local farming community,
   governmental and non-governmental officials. However, according to
   farmers' communities these measures are not well managed. Therefore,
   this study explored the farmers' needs for better sustainable farming
   adaptation strategies based on climatic data scenarios. In conclusion,
   the outcomes will support to achieve SDG 2 for southwest coastal areas

Abstract = {Seventy-one sensitivity experiments have been performed using a
   two-dimensional sector-averaged global climate model to assess the
   potential impact of six different factors on the last millennium climate
   and in particular on the surface air temperature evolution. Both natural
   (i.e, solar and volcanism) and anthropogenically-induced (i.e.
   deforestation, additional greenhouse gases, and tropospheric aerosol
   burden) climate forcings have been considered.
   Comparisons of climate reconstructions with model results indicate that
   all the investigated forcings are needed to simulate the surface air
   temperature evolution. Due to uncertainties in historical climate
   forcings and temperature reconstructions, the relative importance of a
   particular forcing in the explanation of the recorded temperature
   variance is largely function of the forcing time series used.
   Nevertheless, our results indicate that whatever the historical solar
   and volcanic reconstructions may be, these externally driven natural
   climate forcings are unable to dive climate responses comparable in
   magnitude and time to the late-20th-century temperature warming while
   for earlier periods combination of solar and volcanic forcings can
   explain the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period. Only the
   greenhouse gas forcing allows the model to simulate an accelerated
   warming rate during the last three decades. The best guess simulation
   (largest similarity with the reconstruction) for the period starting
   1850 AD requires however to include anthropogenic sulphate forcing as
   well as the impact of deforestation to constrain the magnitude of the
   greenhouse gas twentieth century warming to better fit the observation.
   On the contrary, prior to 1850 AD mid-latitude land clearance tends to
   reinforce the Little Ice age in our simulations.},

Abstract = {Resilient ecosystems are vital to human well-being and are increasingly
   recognised as critical to supporting communities' efforts to adapt to
   climate change. The governing bodies of the Convention on Biological
   Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   are encouraging parties to adopt `ecosystem-based adaptation' (EbA)
   approaches, which utilise biodiversity and ecosystem services to support
   climate change adaptation. These approaches are wide ranging and include
   mangrove restoration to buffer against storm surges; watershed
   management to protect against droughts and floods; rangeland management
   to prevent desertification; and sustainable management of fisheries and
   forests to ensure food security. This article examines the emergence of
   EbA in international legal frameworks for climate change and
   biodiversity and progress towards implementation. The EbA concept is
   potentially powerful in catalysing international and national
   commitments to act due to its key defining features of a focus on
   societal adaptation rather than ecocentricism, and a targeting of the
   immediate adaptation needs of the poorest and most vulnerable
   communities who are adversely affected by climate change. However,
   examination of national policy and practice in two least developed
   countries, Samoa and Cambodia, reveals that institutional and legal
   barriers at national level can pose significant challenges to
   operationalising EbA to achieve adaptation objectives.},

Abstract = {The ecosystem services afforded by coastal wetlands are threatened by
   climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. The Kennedy Space
   Center and Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central
   Florida offer a representative site for investigating how changes to
   vegetation distribution interact with management to impact coastal
   protection. Here, salt marshes are converting to mangroves, and mosquito
   impoundment structures are being modified. The resulting changes to
   vegetation composition and topography influence coastal protection
   services in wetlands. We used a model-based assessment of wave
   attenuation and erosion to compare vegetation (mangrove, salt marsh) and
   impoundment state (intact, graded). Our findings suggest that the
   habitat needed to attenuate 90\% of wave height is significantly larger
   for salt marshes than mangroves. Erosion prevention was significantly
   higher (470\%) in scenarios with mangroves than in salt marshes. Intact
   berms attenuated waves over shorter distances, but did not significantly
   reduce erosion. Differences in coastal protection were driven more by
   vegetation than by impoundment state. Overall, our findings reveal that
   mangroves provide more coastal protection services, and therefore more
   coastal protection value, than salt marshes in east central Florida.
   Other coastal regions undergoing similar habitat conversion may also
   benefit from increased coastal protection in the future.},

Abstract = {Uncontrolled high emission of greenhouse gases due to the use of fossil
   fuels has high impact on global warming. Due to this global warming, the
   earth's temperature is increasing and consequently has changed the
   patterns of various natural phenomena such as wave height and wind
   speed. Wave power energy resources are ideal alternative to reduce the
   effects of global warming and climate change. One of the major obstacles
   lies in the fact that the occurrence of extreme events can jeopardize
   the wave power plant suspended in the ocean waves. In order to better
   understand the impact of extreme events on the wave energy generation, a
   comprehensive analysis of utilization efficiency of wave energy
   converters with respect to extreme events was conducted in the present
   investigation with the help of utilization efficiency function (UEF) as
   an indicative index function. The effect of the extreme events was
   simulated by the polynomial neural network (PNN) architectures, and
   change in UEF in the future scenarios was noted. According to the
   results, the maximum impact on the utilization efficiency of the WEC was
   observed in the time slab of 2050-2060, where 5.1\% change in
   utilization efficiency was observed.},

Abstract = {This work presents a multi-objective optimization approach to designing
   integrated water supply systems for the mining industry. The main goal
   is to estimate the total operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions
   from water supply systems. Chilean mining industry has been selected as
   a case study because of acute problem of water scarcity that it
   experiences. The current strategy to face the problem applied by the
   mining companies operating in Chile consists in building independent
   water supply systems that use ocean as the source of water. This
   solution is highly energy intensive, which is why the problem of water
   consumption is also a problem of energy consumption. The proposed
   optimization approach determines - from technical, economic and
   environmental perspective - the optimal topology of the system, optimal
   locations and sizes of water treatment plants, pumping stations, and
   pipelines. In addition, the analysis takes into account the eventual use
   of photovoltaic solar system in order to decrease greenhouse gas
   emissions. Our main findings have demonstrated that an integrated water
   supply system is always the best option from an economic and
   environmental point of view. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Energy content and indirect greenhouse gas emissions embedded in

Abstract = {In the absence of direct sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e.
   combustion), other sources of emission become dominant in so-called
   `emission-free' power plants. In this study the indirect GHG emissions,
   related to construction of nuclear plants, windfarms and photovoltaic
   plants, are estimated with two different types of life-cycle assessment.
   The process-chain analysis divides an investment good into its material
   components (tons of material) and then unravels the entire production
   process of each material product. The energy required in, and the GHG
   emissions related to, the construction of the power plant are obtained
   by integration over all process steps and summation over all material
   products. The input/output analysis looks at the different economic
   sectors called on in the construction of the power plant. The sectors
   that represent a part of the total cost of the power plant are
   responsible for the amount of energy used (and the corresponding GHG
   emissions) to deliver their final product. A result is provided by
   detailed analysis of all relevant sectors and fitting them into the
   construction phase. Using similar techniques, energy use and GHG
   emissions related to maintenance and demolition, including storage of
   nuclear equipment, can be quantified. For construction, maintenance and
   demolition of these power plants, following orders of magnitude are
   obtained: nuclear: 40kJ(prim)/kWh(el), 3g(CO2)/kWh(el); wind(coast):
   120kJ(prim)/kWh(el), 9g(CO2)/kWh(el); wind(inland): 350kJ(prim)/kWh(el),
   25g(CO2)/kWh(el); PV(1998): 3000kJ(prim)/kWh(el), 130g(CO2)/kWh(el);
   PV(near future): 1500kJ(prim)/kWh(el) and 60g(CO2)/kWh(el). (C) 2000

Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},

Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to focus on the local-level
   initiatives through coastal afforestation, the natural and
   socio-economic context of the study area (Hatiya Upazila of Noakhali
   District, Bangladesh) and the adaptation and DRR strategies generated
   through coastal afforestation in coastal Bangladesh.
   Design/methodology/approach Field observations, focus group discussions
   (FGDs), semi-structured interviews, and transects were accomplished in
   both the dry and wet season. Spatial database generated and land use
   mapping integrated social and technical investigation. Five FDG sessions
   with participants from different livelihood options (fishermen, farmers
   and social representatives) were organised and, on average, 15 similar
   to 18 participants participated in each participatory session. Findings
   Mangrove plantation can be used to access new land and create
   alternative livelihoods, which are important for local community
   adaptation and to reduce disaster risks. Mangrove plantations provide
   chances for new land management options to be developed for use in
   Bangladesh.
   Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted only at the
   south-central coastal district of Bangladesh. Data collection to
   summarise all the socio-economic issues is limited. Practical
   implications - This paper can be used for the integration of geospatial
   and social research techniques to understand the community approach to
   fight against climate change-induced impacts.
   Originality/value - The research is solely conducted by the authors. The
   conducted approach is a blend of social and technical knowledge and
   techniques in generating community resilience at the south- central
   coast of Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Desalination is a water technology that is gaining increasing importance
   for addressing water needs, but it is costly and energy intensive and
   further strains the environment with brine disposal and greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. In order to desalt seawater, either through membrane or
   thermal processes, a large amount of energy is required. Desalination
   has negative impacts in the form of depletion of fossil fuels and GHG
   emissions from the power production process to deliver this energy. What
   is more, the wastewater (brine) produced during the desalination process
   causes damages to the local sea environment where the brine is
   discharged. In order for desalination to be considered a sustainable
   water solution, both issues must be successfully resolved. This paper
   discusses the potential for coupling desalination with renewable energy
   (RES-D). Different renewable technologies can be combined with certain
   desalination techniques. The technical development stage of the RES-D
   combinations already applied is given. Currently applied management as
   well as an innovative alternative for brine management based on zero
   liquid discharge (ZLD) is also presented. This pilot system was
   developed in the framework of an European project with the acronym
   SOL-BRINE (LIFE09 ENV/GR/000299).},

   and biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). We use the
   JULES land surface model coupled to an inverted form of the IMOGEN
   climate emulator to investigate mitigation scenarios that achieve the
   1.5 or 2 degrees C warming targets of the Paris Agreement. Specifically,
   within this IMOGEN-JULES framework, we focus on and characterise the
   global and regional effectiveness of land-based (BECCS and/or AR) and
   anthropogenic methane (CH4) emission mitigation, separately and in
   combination, on the anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emission budgets (AFFEBs) to 2100. We use consistent data and
   socio-economic assumptions from the IMAGE integrated assessment model
   for the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2). The analysis
   includes the effects of the methane and carbon-climate feedbacks from
   wetlands and permafrost thaw, which we have shown previously to be
   significant constraints on the AFFEBs.
   Globally, mitigation of anthropogenic CH4 emissions has large impacts on
   the anthropogenic fossil fuel emission budgets, potentially offsetting
   (i.e. allowing extra) carbon dioxide emissions of 188-212 Gt C. This is
   because of (a) the reduction in the direct and indirect radiative
   forcing of methane in response to the lower emissions and hence
   atmospheric concentration of methane and (b) carbon-cycle changes
   leading to increased uptake by the land and ocean by CO2-based
   fertilisation. Methane mitigation is beneficial everywhere, particularly
   for the major CH4-emitting regions of India, the USA, and China.
   Land-based mitigation has the potential to offset 51100 Gt C globally,
   the large range reflecting assumptions and uncertainties associated with
   BECCS. The ranges for CH4 reduction and BECCS implementation are valid
   for both the 1.5 and 2 degrees C warming targets. That is the mitigation
   potential of the CH4 and of the land-based scenarios is similar for
   regardless of which of the final stabilised warming levels society aims
   for. Further, both the effectiveness and the preferred land management
   strategy (i.e. AR or BECCS) have strong regional dependencies.
   Additional analysis shows extensive BECCS could adversely affect water
   security for several regions. Although the primary requirement remains
   mitigation of fossil fuel emissions, our results highlight the potential
   for the mitigation of CH4 emissions to make the Paris climate targets
   more achievable.},

Abstract = {Island regions are at a heightened level of vulnerability to climate
   change impacts and recently a great degree of political attention has
   been given to planning low-carbon economic strategies for Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS). To develop useful mitigation strategies, an
   understanding of greenhouse gas emissions currently attributable to
   various social sectors is necessary. We use consumption-based life cycle
   accounting techniques to assess the carbon footprint of typical
   households within the US Virgin Islands. We find the average carbon
   footprint in the territory to be 13 tCO(2)e per year per capita, roughly
   35\% less than the average US per capita footprint. Also, electricity
   and food are much larger contributors to total footprint than in the US.
   Results highlight scope for behavioral and technological changes that
   could significantly reduce the footprint. The model has been developed
   into an open access online tool for educational purposes. (c) 2012

Title = {Causes of climate change over the historical record},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This review addresses the causes of observed climate variations across
   the industrial period, from 1750 to present. It focuses on long-term
   changes, both in response to external forcing and to climate variability
   in the ocean and atmosphere. A synthesis of results from attribution
   studies based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions covering the recent few
   centuries to the 20th century, and instrumental data shows how
   greenhouse gases began to cause warming since the beginning of
   industrialization, causing trends that are attributable to greenhouse
   gases by 1900 in proxy-based temperature reconstructions. Their
   influence increased over time, dominating recent trends. However, other
   forcings have caused substantial deviations from this emerging
   greenhouse warming trend: volcanic eruptions have caused strong cooling
   following a period of unusually heavy activity, such as in the early
   19th century; or warming during periods of low activity, such as in the
   early-to-mid 20th century. Anthropogenic aerosol forcing most likely
   masked some global greenhouse warming over the 20th century, especially
   since the accelerated increase in sulphate aerosol emissions starting
   around 1950. Based on modelling and attribution studies, aerosol forcing
   has also influenced regional temperatures, caused long-term changes in
   monsoons and imprinted on Atlantic variability. Multi-decadal variations
   in atmospheric modes can also cause long-term climate variability, as
   apparent for the example of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and have
   influenced Atlantic ocean variability. Long-term precipitation changes
   are more difficult to attribute to external forcing due to spatial
   sparseness of data and noisiness of precipitation changes, but the
   observed pattern of precipitation response to warming from station data
   supports climate model simulated changes and with it, predictions. The
   long-term warming has also led to significant differences in daily
   variability as, for example, visible in long European station data.
   Extreme events over the historical record provide valuable samples of
   possible extreme events and their mechanisms.},

Abstract = {The main target of this research is to allow modern distributed energy
   resources (DERs) to contribute effectively in the economic feasibility
   of hybrid renewable power generation system. There are several factors
   such as the net present cost (NPC), levelized cost of energy (COE),
   amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and the ability of the
   hybrid system to meet the load at different meteorological conditions to
   consider when evaluating the effectiveness of hybrid generation system
   within microgrids. A multi-objective based optimization algorithm to
   reduce cost, emissions, and a combined solution between cost and
   emissions is investigated in this research. This research presents an
   approach to optimize a hybrid microgrid (HMG) system with different fuel
   options. The power management approach determines the optimal sizing of
   DERs based on ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. In order to find
   the best configuration, the obtained results are compared with genetic
   algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and HOMER. Three
   isolated areas in Egypt with different metrological conditions are
   selected for optimization of HMG system, namely: Kharga, Saint
   Katherine, and Qussair. The results show that the combined optimal
   configuration of HMG system is better in satisfying load demands without
   violating any restraints. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Water has a significant role in all our daily activities and its overall
   consumption is growing every day because of increasing scheme of mankind
   living standards. Iran is located in the dry belt of the earth, where
   nearly 70\% of its area is located in arid and semi-arid regions. At the
   present time, Iran is experiencing a serious water crisis. It has been
   projected that the total per capita annual renewable water of the
   country will reach to about 800 m(3) by 2021, which is less than the
   global threshold of 1000 m(3). In this context, seawater desalination
   seems to be a potential solution to meet the water supply and demand
   balance in Iran as the country is surrounded by three main water bodies
   of the Caspian Sea at northern and Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman. at the
   southern borders. Annually, about 120 million cubic meter of freshwater
   supply is from conventional desalination plants centralized in the
   southern coastal regions of Iran. The fossil-fuel powered desalination
   systems are no longer sustainable to overcome the water crisis in the
   country due to both depletion risks of available energy resources and
   increase of greenhouse gas emissions. This is while that Iran has
   excellent solar energy potentials of about 15.3 kWh/m(2)/day, which can
   effectively be harnessed to run desalination processes. Therefore, in
   the modern time, solar desalination is an emerging solution to close the
   water gap in the country by considering the required change in terms of
   policy, financing, and regional cooperation to make this alternative
   method of desalination a success. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {162},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1515-1520},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A question often asked by many, and across different strands of society,
   is what would happen to global warming levels if atmospheric greenhouse
   gases (GHGs) are held at their current concentrations. Existing
   research, e.g. as summarised by Meehl et al. (2007), estimates
   potentially considerable additional warming resulting from stable
   present-day atmospheric GHG concentrations. We use the Equilibrium
   Climate Sensitivity (ECS) values of the latest set of Earth System
   Models (ESMs) in the CMIP6 ensemble, to estimate equilibrium global
   warming. Radiative forcing characterises the combined effect of
   human-induced changes to all GHGs and aerosols in a single metric. We
   find that based on the ECS values and contemporary radiative forcing,
   additional warming would be substantial. Approximately half of CMIP6
   ESMs project an equilibrium global warming greater than two degrees
   (compared to pre-industrial times) for the year 2019 radiative forcing.
   This statistic increases to around 80\% for the risk of exceeding the
   1.5 degrees C threshold. Our analysis is specific to what is sometimes
   referred to as the ``constant composition commitment{''}. For
   comparison, ``net-zero{''} emissions imply no overall net emissions by
   humans, which would involve even larger reductions in fossil fuel
   burning. Achieving net-zero implies that natural land- and
   ocean-atmosphere exchanges would modulate GHG concentrations and likely
   including the removal of some atmospheric CO2.},

Abstract = {The replacement of native species by invasive Phragmites australis in
   coastal wetlands may impact ecosystem processes including fluxes of the
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). To
   investigate differences in daytime CH4 and CO2 fluxes as well as
   vegetation properties between Phragmites and native vegetation zones
   along a salinity gradient, fluxes were measured via cavity ringdown
   spectroscopy in 3 New England coastal marshes, ranging from oligohaline
   to polyhaline. While daytime CH4 emissions decreased predictably with
   increasing soil salinity, those from Phragmites zones were larger (15 to
   1254 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) than those from native vegetation (4-484 mu mol
   m(-2) h(-1)) across the salinity gradient. Phragmites zones displayed
   greater daytime CO2 uptake than native vegetation zones (-7 to -15 mu
   mol m(-2) s(-1) vs. -2 to 0.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) at
   mesohaline-polyhaline, but not oligohaline, sites. Results suggest that
   vegetation zone and salinity both impact net emission or uptake of
   daytime CO2 and CH4 (respectively). Future research is warranted to
   demonstrate Phragmites-mediated impacts on GHG fluxes, and additional
   measurements across seasonal and diel cycles will enable a more complete
   understanding of Phragmites' net impact on marsh radiative forcing.},

Abstract = {The traditional view of adaptation to climate change tends to assume
   that a national government is responsible for implementing technological
   adaptation measures (e.g., seeds, dams, irrigation schemes), which are
   selected on the basis of specific knowledge of future climate
   conditions. This view has been widely challenged but is still prevalent
   within sectors dominated by engineering, such as water and coastal
   management. The purpose of this chapter is to show that while technology
   has an important part to play in climate adaptation, its effectiveness
   relies on it being part of a broader strategy that acknowledges
   uncertainty and addresses the underlying drivers of people's current and
   future vulnerability. Such a strategy requires the integration of
   adaptation with human and economic development efforts.},

Abstract = {Green energy is the key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thus
   helping to combat climate change. Modern wind turbines have been
   implemented all over the world and represent a significant alternative
   for the elimination of fossil fuels or other methods of obtaining
   energy. Europe plays an important role in the offshore wind energy
   sector, with wind farms installed in 11 countries, of which the mainstay
   is the North Sea. The North Sea is home to the world's largest offshore
   wind farm, completed in 2020, with a capacity of 1218 MW of 174
   turbines. This study presents an overview of the wind farms deployed in
   the North Sea, the types of turbines, and the types of structures for
   turbines. Based on the characteristics of the North Sea, the
   classification society's rules for the environmental conditions that
   these structures must comply with were also investigated. (C) 2022 The

Title = {In-situ measurement on air-water flux of CH4, CO2 and their carbon

Abstract = {Inland waters are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the
   atmosphere that may partially offset the terrestrial carbon sink.
   However, GHG emissions from high altitude saline lakes on the Tibetan
   Plateau are currently poorly constrained. In this study, we measured
   methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and their carbon
   stable isotope (delta C-13), and calculated diffusive water-to-air
   fluxes from two saline high-altitude lakes, Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake,
   located in northeast Tibetan Plateau in October 2020. The two lakes were
   mostly supersaturated in CH4 (89.8\%-4623.9\% sat) and acted as sources
   of CH4 to the atmosphere. Conversely, more than 96\% investigated area
   of Qinghai Lake and all investigated area of Hala Lake was a sink of
   CO2. The average diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in the surface waters
   of Qinghai Lake were 34.51 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) and -1.29 mmol m(-2)
   d(-)(1), while diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in Hala Lake averaged
   5.48 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) and -5.24 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively.
   Salinity (Sal), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), temperature
   (Temp) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are key factors for diffusive CH4 and
   CO2 flux in Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake. CH4 diffusive fluxes across
   water-air interface from Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake were found to be
   significantly lower than other freshwater lakes, likely due to their
   saline nature. A simple isotope mixing model (Miller-Tans plots)
   revealed a distinctly different isotopic source values of CO2 and CH4 in
   Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake. The CH4 production pathway of Qinghai Lake
   was mainly by the acetate fermentation, while that of Hala Lake was
   mainly by the CO2 reduction. The results show that the continuous
   measurement can help capture the spatial variability of GHGs fluxes in
   saline lakes.},

Abstract = {To tackle the increasing global energy demand the climate change
   problem, the integration of renewable energy and negative emission
   technologies is a promising solution. In this work, a novel concept
   called ``negative emission hybrid renewable energy system{''} is
   proposed for the first time. It is a hybrid solar-wind-biomass renewable
   energy system with biochar production, which could potentially provide
   energy generation, carbon sequestration, and waste treatment services
   within one system. The optimization and the conflicting economic and
   environmental trade-off of such system has not yet been fully
   investigated in the literature. To fill the research gap, this paper
   aims to propose a stochastic multi-objective decision-support framework
   to identify optimal design of the energy mix and discuss the economic
   and environmental feasibilities of a negative emission hybrid renewable
   energy system. This approach maximizes energy output and minimizes
   greenhouse gas emissions by the optimal sizing of the solar, wind,
   combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and energy storage components in
   the system. A case study on Carabao Island in the Philippines, which is
   representative of an island-mode energy system, is conducted based on
   the aim of achieving net-zero emission for the whole island. For the
   island with a population of 10,881 people and an area of 22.05 km(2),
   the proposed optimal system have significant negative emission
   capability and promising profitability with a carbon sequestration
   potential of 2795 kg CO2-eq/day and a predicted daily profit of 455
   US\$/day.

Abstract = {In this study, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from the logistics
   sector were investigated using Hong Kong as an example. The data
   including cargo freight between Hong Kong and other places by different
   transport modes (i.e. aircraft, container ships, trucks, and trains) for
   the period of 2007-2012 were collected. Combining transport data with
   the GHG emitted from each mode of transport in terms of tonne CO2-eq per
   kilotonne-kilometer, GHG emissions for each transport mode and the total
   amount of GHG emissions were determined. In 2012, the total cargo
   freight between Hong Kong and other places via air freight was 4024
   kilotonnes and produced 22,623 kilotonnes of CO2-eq. The total cargo
   freight via sea freight was 269,283 kilotonnes and produced 12,784
   kilotonnes of CO2-eq. The total cargo freight via land freight was
   26,215 kilotonnes and produced 463 kilotonnes of CO2-eq. The total
   amount of GHG emissions was 35,834 kilotonnes of CO2-eq. The
   environmental effectiveness of Hong Kong's logistics sector was obtained
   by normalizing the total amount of GHG emissions with respect to the
   value added. The calculated value was 534 tonnes of CO2-eq per million
   HKD value added. The results of scenario analysis showed that the amount
   of GHG emissions could be reduced at about 100 kilotonnes of CO2-eq. per
   100 kilotonnes of cargo by switching a portion of air cargo movements to
   and from mainland China to land freight or sea freight. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Jakarta, as the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, has long been
   known to be at risk from flood hazard. It is increasingly recognized
   that community responses and adaptation strategies are essential for
   planning future mitigation action. In order to investigate the community
   responses and adaptation strategies employed in Jakarta, in-depth
   interviews were performed in the flood-prone areas. The results reveal
   that vulnerability to flooding is increasing, and it is linked to
   several factors: (1) stakeholders, (2) environment, (3) communities, and
   (4) infrastructure and its maintenance. Various physical adaptation
   strategies have been adopted by the local communities, which include
   raising the housing level, building terraced housing, and building small
   dikes to prevent water entering the settlements. Several non-physical
   adaptations were also identified from the fieldwork. These adaptations
   tend to be conducted through communal work and the reuse of resources
   and materials left undamaged by flooding. However, uncoordinated
   responses during flood events produce greater exposure to the hazard,
   and it can be inferred that community responses remain below the ideal.
   This study highlights the need for urgent attention to be given to
   improving the institutional links between stakeholders, especially at
   the municipal level, which could provide more efficient disaster
   response.},

Title = {GIS assessment of coastal vulnerability to climate change and coastal
   adaption planning in Vietnam},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-36},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Vietnam's coastal zone provides a diverse range of natural resources and
   favourable conditions for social and economic development. However, its
   coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable, due to several natural coastal
   hazards, over-exploitation and other human activities. In spite of
   diverse interventions, Vietnam's coastal zone continues to experience
   significant damage from floods, erosion and typhoons. These hazards are
   being intensified by climate change and associated rising sea levels.
   This paper assesses the potential vulnerability of Vietnam's coast to
   climate change and discusses possible adaptation policies and plan to
   reduce the impacts. GIS analysis was used for the assessment of coastal
   vulnerability. Related literature was reviewed to develop detailed
   understanding of coastal adaptation to climate change. Adaptation
   policies and plans were appraised to identify potential coastal
   adaptation policies and plans that could be adapted by Vietnam. It was
   identified that vulnerability of the coastal zone of Vietnam could not
   be attributed only to climatic factors, but also to the physical
   condition of the coastline. Much of Vietnam's coastline, particularly,
   areas around the Red River delta and the Mekong River have elevations
   below 1 m. These coastlines are largely developed and serve as economic
   centres of the country, which makes the coast more vulnerable to climate
   change and the rising sea level. The paper concluded that a
   non-structural approach (coastal buffer zones, building houses on
   stilts, storm warning systems, growing of flood-resistant crops and
   elevated storm shelters with medicine and food storage) could be used by
   Vietnam to adapt her low-lying coastline around the two deltas to
   climate change as this strategy enables vulnerable areas to be occupied
   for longer before eventual retreat. However, for these policies to be
   successful, it should be planned, implemented well in advance, monitored
   and evaluated over time.},

Title = {Optimal design and operation of maritime energy systems based on
   renewable methanol and closed carbon cycles},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {269},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The phasing out of fossil fuels in the shipping sector is of key
   importance for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Synthetic fuels based
   on renewable energy are a promising option for a sustainable maritime
   sector, with renewable methanol being one of the most widely considered
   energy carriers. However, the availability of renewable methanol is
   still limited and the costs associated with it are significantly higher
   than for conventional fuels, also because fuel synthesis must rely on
   carbon dioxide as a resource. Through the use of onboard carbon capture,
   the release of carbon dioxide during combustion can be avoided, and this
   closed cycle reduces the need for carbon sources. This paper
   investigates such a scenario by analyzing overall ship energy systems
   that use internal combustion engines with connected pre-combustion and
   post-combustion carbon capture technologies. The effect of these
   technologies on the techno-economic performance of a fully renewable
   energy system is investigated by setting up a mixed-integer optimization
   framework for the optimal design and operation of ship propulsion
   systems. The propulsion demand for the chosen case study consists of a
   typical operational profile of a ferry operating in the Baltic Sea.
   Comparison of the capture cases to a system solely based on renewable
   methanol reveals significant cost advantages of the closed carbon cycle
   systems. The baseline scenario has nearly 20\% lower annual costs, with
   total capture rates of 90\% in the post-combustion case and around 40\%
   in the pre-combustion case. An extensive sensitivity analysis shows that
   these cost advantages are robust against various technological and
   economic boundary conditions. In the pre-combustion case, process heat
   demand reduction in combination with increased engine heat supply might
   enable higher capture rates beyond 90\%. The results indicate that
   combining renewable fuels with onboard carbon capture creates
   opportunities for cost-effective, sustainable shipping.},

Abstract = {Maritime shipping represents a valuable and economical mode of
   international cargo transportation. Also maritime transport operates
   from combustion of fossil fuels which represents a substantial part of
   the total greenhouse gas emission and contributes significant amounts of
   greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with global warming. International
   Maritime Organization has developed technical and operational measures
   to control the CO2 emissions from ships and additionally vessels today
   are designed with better energy efficiency. An important operational
   management aspect is slow steaming where as an action on ship
   intentionally reduces vessel service speed and results the reduction of
   fuel costs. This paper investigates the relationship and impact among
   slow steaming cost reduction and furthermore the carbon emission
   reduction, shipment delay and dangerous anchoring due to ports
   limitations, through the evaluation with Technique for Order of
   Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. This method represents a
   multi-criteria decision analysis method and is a useful tool for
   decision makers facing multi criteria processes in order to investigate
   the value of an alternative compared with the ideal solution. It also
   evaluates the decisions that should be taken into consideration from the

Title = {Impacts of harmful algal blooms on marine aquaculture in a low-carbon
   future},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {110},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C highlights
   the potential for dietary shifts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from
   livestock. Reductions in the consumption of terrestrial animal protein
   require increases in the consumption of other food categories, to
   maintain food security, balanced dietary patterns, and protein intake.
   Aquaculture has long been suggested as one way to meet future food
   security needs, and marine and estuarine aquaculture in particular is
   associated with comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   marine and freshwater aquaculture is affected by factors including
   harmful algal blooms (HABs), which have been increasingly documented
   around the world, correlated to increases in worldwide aquaculture. In
   this study, we applied a global multi-region input-output model to
   capture the direct effects as well as the indirect and induced effects
   HABs might pose to a global dietary transition from terrestrial
   livestock to increased seafood consumption from marine and estuarine
   aquaculture sources. We found that marine and estuarine aquaculture has
   a substantial potential to replace meat consumption from terrestrial
   livestock sources, as increases in CO2 emissions from aquaculture were
   more than offset by reductions in emissions from mainly cattle grazing
   and associated land clearing. HABs were found to have a minor monetary
   impact, but the impact on protein supply was found to be potentially
   sizeable. For example, in a future setting where 40\% of terrestrial
   protein sources were replaced by aquaculture, a HAB-caused global loss
   of 5\% would set in motion numerous supply-chain cascades, affecting
   industries auxiliary to aquaculture, indirectly and ultimately reducing
   protein intake by 10-20\%. Such reductions have the potential for
   pushing parts of Sub-Saharan populations into protein-energy
   malnutrition. Nevertheless, there remains a significant potential for a
   dietary transition to increased aquaculture seafood to contribute to
   reductions in GHG.},

Abstract = {Identifying locations for secure sequestration of CO2 in geological
   formations is one of our most pressing global scientific problems.
   Injection into basalt formations provides unique and significant
   advantages over other potential geological storage options, including
   large potential storage volumes and permanent fixation of carbon by
   mineralization. The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province basalt flows
   along the eastern seaboard of the United States may provide large and
   secure storage reservoirs both onshore and offshore. Sites in the South
   Georgia basin, the New York Bight basin, and the Sandy Hook basin offer
   promising basalt-hosted reservoirs with considerable potential for CO2
   sequestration due to their proximity to major metropolitan centers, and
   thus to large industrial sources for CO2. Onshore sites are suggested
   for cost-effective characterization studies of these reservoirs,
   although offshore sites may offer larger potential capacity and
   additional long-term advantages for safe and secure CO2 sequestration.},

Title = {Variations in ozone and greenhouse gases as drivers of Southern

Volume = {53},
Number = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The climate of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is being affected not only
   by the global increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG)
   but also by the ongoing recovery of stratospheric ozone. The competing
   roles of both are usually studied by means of state-of-the-art global
   climate models (GCM) due to the complexity in the atmospheric processes
   and interactions involved. The main objective of this paper is to
   determine whether quantitatively similar results can be achieved using a
   simpler, medium-complexity GCM. This includes addressing the sensitivity
   of the medium-complexity model to changes in GHG and ozone
   concentrations as well as looking into the plausible mechanisms driving
   such patterns of variations in atmospheric circulation, precipitation
   and temperature extremes. Two sets of simulations are performed: one
   with fixed sea surface temperatures (SST) and another one making use of
   a mixed-layer ocean model coupled to the GCM. Results show that the GCM
   is highly sensitive to changes in the atmospheric composition, and that
   the largest differences are found when SST are allowed to vary
   accordingly, particularly in the case of temperature extremes. Specific
   analyses are also performed on changes in subtropical precipitation over
   the continental regions of the SH, with moisture budget decomposition
   being applied in order to provide explanations for the rainfall changes
   described in the manuscript.},

Title = {The rise of resilience: Evolution of a new concept in coastal planning
   in Ireland and the US},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {102},
Number = {A},
Pages = {19-31},

Abstract = {Interest in the concept of resilience has grown significantly in recent
   years. The perceived strengths of resilience as a concept stem from its
   foundations in the sciences and humanities, and have recently gained
   currency amongst political actors and in policy spheres. This papers
   objective is to investigate the value of resilience as a concept when
   applied to the process of coastal climate change adaptation with a focus
   on place specificity. As applied to coastal hazards and climate change
   adaptation, we expect that resilience encompasses more system
   complexities than a traditional vulnerability or hazards approach. Our
   aim in this paper is achieved through carrying out a critical analysis
   of Irish and US academic and policy literature and determining if, and
   to what degree, one or more of the three selected lenses of
   psychological, engineering and ecological resilience are applied.
   Through contrasting the evolution of coastal adaptation policy
   developments in both Ireland and the U.S. the paper highlights the
   importance of policy, environment and geography in the area of coastal
   management. It furthermore examines the question of whether the concept
   of resilience represents a paradigm shift, or whether it maintains the
   dominant anthropological perspective of earlier hazard mitigation
   approaches under new guise.
   The increasing focus on climate adaptation as more than enhanced hazard
   mitigation exemplifies that shift. In the U.S. proposals for large-scale
   retreat programs post-Sandy are further evidence that combined
   ecological-anthropological approaches are gaining traction, though
   planning actions taken and factors considered continue to be dominated
   by parochialism and anthropocentric or psychological definitions of
   resilience. In Ireland there is a noticeable increase in the ecological
   resilience grounded practices of adaptive management and co-management
   in relation to coastal planning. The fostering of Integrated Coastal
   Zone Management (ICZM) frameworks as well as a clear linking between
   climate adaption and the management of coastal regions underlines this
   development. Results indicate that resilience, under the three forms
   explored, is a concept that has recently increased in popularity.
   Simultaneously, there has been a discernible shift in the direction of
   broader inclusion of concerns about human environment interactions, but
   the two are not necessarily coextensive, and concepts of resilience do
   not always encompass these concerns. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Annual CO2 and CH4 fluxes in coastal earthen ponds with Litopenaeus
   vannamei in southeastern China},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {545},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Small-scale aquaculture operation is being increasing practised around
   the world, particularly in the developing countries, but the greenhouse
   gas (GHG) dynamics and fluxes from small aquaculture ponds are still
   poorly assessed. In this study, the dissolved concentrations and fluxes
   of CO2 and CH4 were determined in three coastal earthen shrimp ponds
   over one whole year, covering both the farming and non-farming periods,
   in the Min River Estuary, southeastern China. Both ebullitive and
   diffusive CH4 fluxes were measured, which were rarely done in previous
   studies. The average concentrations of dissolved CO2 and CH4 in water
   column in the farming period varied between 18.1 +/- 0.1 and 79.6 +/-
   1.1 mu mol L-1, and 1.3 +/- 0.1 and 55.9 +/- 3.2 mu mol L-1,
   respectively. When averaged across the whole year, the mean CO2 and CH4
   fluxes from the ponds were - 18.4 +/- 7.4 and 22.6 +/- 6.9 mg m- 2 h-1,
   respectively, suggesting that the shrimp ponds acted as a CO2 sink and a
   CH4 source. Based on the sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP)
   and sustained-flux global cooling potential (SGCP) models, the annual
   warming potential was estimated to be 7.1 x 103 g CO2-eq m- 2 yr- 1,
   with approximately 90\% of this arising from the farming period.
   Ebullition was the dominant emission pathway for CH4, accounting for
   over 90\% of the total CH4 emission during the farming period. This
   full-year study improves our understanding of carbon cycling in coastal
   aquaculture ponds and provides a scientific basis for updating the GHG
   inventories.},

Abstract = {Increasing temperatures and sea levels, changing precipitation patterns
   and more extreme weather pose severe threats for vulnerable communities,
   ecosystems, and livelihoods in cities of developing countries. Realizing
   these threats has heightened scholarly inquiry on future risk trends of
   climate change and adaptation strategies in the countries of Global
   South and North. However, most studies are based on data of North
   America, Europe, and Asia. There is minimal documentation of adaptation
   strategies to mitigate the risk of extreme weather in cities of
   Sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, this study addresses this need by examining
   the factors influencing individual and household adaptation strategies
   to climate risk in Port Harcourt Metropolis, Nigeria. Data was collected
   from 384 randomly selected household heads in different residential
   densities of the city. Household socioeconomic and demographic
   attributes, awareness of climate change and factors influencing their
   adaptation strategies to climate risk were assessed using descriptive
   and inferential statistics. The study showed that adaptation strategies
   adopted were reactive rather than anticipatory and varied in magnitude
   according to the different residential densities. Recommendations
   emanating from the study include integrating and implementing climate
   change adaptation policies and embarking on a rigorous awareness
   campaign to ease households' vulnerability and augment their climate
   change absorptive, adaptive, and transformative abilities in the city.},

Abstract = {Large-scale climate response to the spatial and temporal changes of
   anthropogenic aerosols are investigated in comparison with greenhouse
   gas (GHG) forcing using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6
   (CMIP6) simulations during 1930-2010. Globally, increasing anthropogenic
   aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) since the industrial revolution
   generates a North-South interhemispherically asymmetric climate response
   pattern. But this feature only dominates the historical climate change
   early in the twentieth century. In the second half of the twentieth
   century, anthropogenic aerosol emissions increase monotonically in Asia,
   but increase first and then decrease rapidly over Europe and North
   America. The shift of aerosol emissions from the western mid-latitude NH
   to the eastern low-latitude NH induces distinct climate response
   patterns compared with its global increase effect, anchoring an
   equatorial symmetric tropical sea surface temperature (SST) cooling and
   precipitation decrease, which resembles that in the GHG-induced response
   patterns with sign reversed. After the mid-1970s, with declining aerosol
   emissions over Europe and North America and increasing emissions in
   Asia, anthropogenic aerosol forcing generates a northward recovery of
   the tropical rainfall with little response in the tropical SST anomalies
   due to the cancellation effect of the distinct aerosol emissions
   conditions between the western and the eastern NH. While GHG forcing
   dominates observed climate change in the twentieth century, the distinct
   climate response patterns to the spatial and temporal evolutions of
   anthropogenic aerosol forcing highlight its important role in shaping
   the regional climate changes.},

Title = {Energy minimization strategies and renewable energy utilization for
   desalination: A review},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1907-1920},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Energy is a significant cost in the economics of desalinating waters,
   but water scarcity is driving the rapid expansion in global installed
   capacity of desalination facilities. Conventional fossil fuels have been
   utilized as their main energy source, but recent concerns over
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have promoted global development and
   implementation of energy minimization strategies and cleaner energy
   supplies. In this paper, a comprehensive review of energy minimization
   strategies for membrane-based desalination processes and utilization of
   lower GHG emission renewable energy resources is presented. The review
   covers the utilization of energy efficient design, high efficiency
   pumping, energy recovery devices, advanced membrane materials
   (nanocomposite, nanotube, and biomimetic), innovative technologies
   (forward osmosis, ion concentration polarization, and capacitive
   deionization), and renewable energy resources (solar, wind, and
   geothermal). Utilization of energy efficient design combined with high
   efficiency pumping and energy recovery devices have proven effective in
   full-scale applications. Integration of advanced membrane materials and
   innovative technologies for desalination show promise but lack long-term
   operational data. Implementation of renewable energy resources depends
   upon geography-specific abundance, a feasible means of handling
   renewable energy power intermittency, and solving technological and
   economic scale-up and permitting issues. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Adaptation to uncertain sea-level rise; how uncertainty in Antarctic
   mass-loss impacts the coastal adaptation strategy of the Netherlands},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Uncertainties in the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise (SLR)
   complicate decision making on coastal adaptation. Large uncertainty
   arises from potential ice mass-loss from Antarctica that could rapidly
   increase SLR in the second half of this century. The implications of SLR
   may be existential for a low-lying country like the Netherlands and
   warrant exploration of high-impact low-likelihood scenarios. To deal
   with uncertain SLR, the Netherlands has adopted an adaptive pathways
   plan. This paper analyzes the implications of storylines leading to
   extreme SLR for the current adaptive plan in the Netherlands, focusing
   on flood risk, fresh water resources, and coastline management. It
   further discusses implications for coastal adaptation in low-lying
   coastal zones considering timescales of adaptation including the
   decisions lifetime and lead-in time for preparation and implementation.
   We find that as sea levels rise faster and higher, sand nourishment
   volumes to maintain the Dutch coast may need to be up to 20 times larger
   than to date in 2100, storm surge barriers will need to close at
   increasing frequency until closed permanently, and intensified saltwater
   intrusion will reduce freshwater availability while the demand is
   rising. The expected lifetime of investments will reduce drastically.
   Consequently, step-wise adaptation needs to occur at an increasing
   frequency or with larger increments while there is still large SLR
   uncertainty with the risk of under- or overinvesting. Anticipating
   deeply uncertain, high SLR scenarios helps to enable timely adaptation
   and to appreciate the value of emission reduction and monitoring of the
   Antarctica contribution to SLR.},

Abstract = {It is not unreasonable to imagine that the future may herald higher
   energy prices and greater regulation of shipping's Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
   emissions. With the introduction of the Energy Efficiency Design Index
   (EEDI) into MARPOL Annex VI, tools are needed to assist Naval Architects
   and Marine Engineers to select the best solutions to meet evolving
   requirements for reduced fuel consumption and associated carbon dioxide
   emissions. To that end, a concept design tool, the Ship Impact Model
   (SIM), has been developed for quickly calculating the technical
   performance of a vessel with one or more Carbon dioxide Reducing
   Technologies (CRTs) at an early design stage. The underlying basis for
   this model is the calculation of changes from known `baseline ships'.
   The Ship Impact Model has been used in two projects to assess which
   selection (individual or combination) of Carbon dioxide Reducing
   Technologies (CRTs) have the most potential, in terms of
   cost-effectiveness and under other technical, operational and regulatory
   influences. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Opportunities for biodiversity conservation as cities adapt to climate
   change},
Journal = {GEO-GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {Cities are investing billions of dollars in climate change adaptation to
   combat the effects of sea-level rise, temperature extremes, increasingly
   intense storm events, flooding and water scarcity. Natural ecosystems
   have enormous potential to contribute to city resilience, and so,
   actions that rely on this approach could sustain considerable
   co-benefits for biodiversity. In this paper we identify the prevalence
   of key themes of human adaptation response that could have biodiversity
   conservation outcomes in cities. We then quantify the area of impact for
   actions that identify specific targets for greening or green
   infrastructure that could involve natural ecosystems, providing an
   indicator of potential co-benefits to biodiversity. We then extrapolate
   to explore the total area of land that could benefit from catchment
   management approaches, the area of waterways that could benefit from
   nature-based improvement of these spaces, and finally the number of
   threatened species that could benefit across these cities. From 80 city
   climate adaptation plans analysed, we found that urban greening plays a
   key role in most adaptation strategies, and represents an enormous
   opportunity for biodiversity conservation, given the diversity of animal
   and plant species in urban environments. We show that the ranges of at
   least 270 threatened species overlap with the area covered by just 58
   city adaptation plans, including watershed catchments totalling over 28
   million km(2). However, an analysis of 80 city adaptation plans (of a
   total 151 found globally) shows that this opportunity is being missed.
   Just 18\% of the plans assessed contained specific intentions to promote
   biodiversity. We highlight this missed opportunity, as climate
   adaptation actions undertaken by cities represent an enormous incipient
   opportunity for nature conservation. Finally, we encourage planners and
   city governments to incorporate biological conservation into climate
   adaption plans, for the mutual benefit of urban societies and their
   biodiversity.},

Title = {The Canadian Federation of Earth Sciences Scientific Statement on
   Climate Change - Its Impacts In Canada, and the Critical Role of Earth
   Scientists in Mitigation and Adaptation},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCE CANADA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {59-72},
Abstract = {The Canadian Federation of Earth Sciences (CFES) has issued this
   statement to summarize the science, effects, and implications of climate
   change. We highlight the role of Earth scientists in documenting and
   mitigating climate change, and in managing and adapting to its
   consequences in Canada. CFES is the coordinated voice of Canada's Earth
   Sciences community with 14 member organizations representing some 15,000
   geoscientists. Our members are drawn from academia, industry, education,
   and government. The mission of CFES is to ensure decision makers and the
   public understand the contributions of Earth Science to Canadian society
   and the economy.
   Climate change has become a national and global priority for all levels
   of government. The geological record shows us that the global climate
   has changed throughout. Earth's history, but the current rates of change
   are almost unprecedented. Over the last 70 years, levels of common
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere have steadily increased.
   Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is now 418 parts per million - its
   highest of the last three million years. The chemical (isotopic)
   composition of carbon in the atmosphere indicates the increase in GHGs
   is due to burning fossil fuels. GHGs absorb energy emitted from Earth's
   surface and re-radiate it back, warming the lower levels of the
   atmosphere. Climatic adjustments that have recently occurred are, in
   practical terms, irreversible, but further change can be mitigated by
   lowering emissions of GHGs.
   Climate change is amplified by three important Earth system processes
   and effects. First, as the climate warms evaporation increases, raising
   atmospheric concentrations of water vapour, itself a GHG - and adding to
   warming. Second, loss of ice cover from the polar ice sheets and
   glaciers exposes larger areas of land and open water - leading to
   greater absorption of heat from the sun. Third, thawing of near-surface
   permafrost releases additional GHGs (primarily CO2 and methane) during
   decay of organic matter previously preserved frozen in the ground. Some
   impacts of climate change are incremental and steadily occurring, such
   as melting of glaciers and ice sheets, with consequent sea level rise.
   Others are intermittent, such as extreme weather events, like hurricanes
   - but are becoming more frequent. Summer water shortages are
   increasingly common in western Canada as mountain snowpacks melt earlier
   and summer river flows decline. In northern Canada, warming and thawing
   of near-surface permafrost has led to deterioration of infrastructure
   and increased costs for buildings that now require chilled foundations.
   Other consequences of unchecked climate change include increased coastal
   erosion, increases in the number and size of wildfires, and reduction in
   winter road access to isolated northern communities. Reductions in net
   GHG emissions are urgently required to mitigate the many effects of
   further climate change. Industrial and public works development projects
   must now assess the effects of climate change in their planning, design,
   and management. Cities, municipalities, and rural communities need to
   plan new residential development carefully to avoid enhanced risk of
   flooding, coastal erosion, or wildfire.
   Earth Science knowledge and expertise is integral to exploration and
   development of new metals and Earth materials required for a
   carbon-neutral future, and in the capture and storage of CO2 within the
   Earth. Earth Science is also central to society's adaptation to new
   climatic regimes and reduction of risks. This includes anticipation,
   assessment, and management of extreme events, development of new
   standards and guidelines for geotechnical and engineering practice, and
   revision to regulations that consider climate change. Geoscientists also
   have an important role in the education of students and the public on
   the reasons for necessary action. Canada is uniquely positioned with its
   strong global geoscientific leadership, its vast landmass, and its
   northern terrain to effectively leverage research activities around
   climate change. Geoscience tools and geoscientists' skills will be
   integral to Canada's preparation for climate change.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a significant future driver of change in coastal
   social-ecological systems. Our knowledge of impacts, adaptation options,
   and possible outcomes for marine environments and coastal industries is
   expanding, but remains limited and uncertain. Alternative scenarios are
   a way to explore potential futures under a range of conditions. We
   developed four alternative future scenarios for the Great Barrier Reef
   and its fishing and tourism industries positing moderate and more
   extreme (2-3 A degrees C above pre-industrial temperatures) warming for
   2050 and contrasting `limited' and `ideal' ecological and social
   adaptation. We presented these scenarios to representatives of key
   stakeholder groups to assess the perceived viability of different social
   adaptation options to deliver desirable outcomes under varied contexts.},

Title = {Effect of salinity on greenhouse gas production and emission in marsh
   soils during the decomposition of wetland plants},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS},
Abstract = {Purpose Salinity and vegetation can significantly affect the productions
   and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in wetland soils. We aim to
   investigate the effect of salinity on the productions and emissions of
   GHGs in marsh soils during the decomposition of wetland plants under
   different scenarios. Methods Soils and wetland plants collected from a
   freshwater marsh (FM) and a saline marsh (SM) in the Louisiana Barataria
   Basin estuary were incubated under different levels of salinity
   treatment for 180 days. Gas and soil samples were periodically collected
   and analyzed for CO2, CH4, and N2O and for TN, TC, and DOC contents,
   respectively. Results CH4 and CO2 production rates reached maximums on
   day 30 as the decomposition processed. The increment of CH4 and CO2
   production rates in SM soils was greater than in FM soils. The CH4 and
   CO2 production rates were generally more significantly correlated with
   DOC than with TC. Reducing salinity inhibited the productions and
   emissions of CO2 and N2O but significantly promoted those of CH4 in SM
   soils, while in FM soils, increasing salinity significantly decreased
   the CO2 production and emission but had no significant effect on CH4 and
   N2O. The CO2-equivalent cumulative emissions increased by 41\% as the
   salinity decreased by 17.7\% in saline marsh, and the percent
   contribution of CH4 emissions to CO2-equivalent cumulative emissions
   increased from 15 to 47\%. Conclusion Our results suggested the
   potential that the diversion of Mississippi River water to the wetlands
   might promote the production and emission of CH4 in saline marsh.},

Abstract = {Climate change has significant implications for biodiversity and
   ecosystems. With slow progress towards reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions, climate engineering (or geoengineering') is receiving
   increasing attention for its potential to limit anthropogenic climate
   change and its damaging effects. Proposed techniques, such as ocean
   fertilization for carbon dioxide removal or stratospheric sulfate
   injections to reduce incoming solar radiation, would significantly alter
   atmospheric, terrestrial and marine environments, yet potential
   side-effects of their implementation for ecosystems and biodiversity
   have received little attention. A literature review was carried out to
   identify details of the potential ecological effects of climate
   engineering techniques. A group of biodiversity and environmental change
   researchers then employed a modified Delphi expert consultation
   technique to evaluate this evidence and prioritize the effects based on
   the relative importance of, and scientific understanding about, their
   biodiversity and ecosystem consequences. The key issues and knowledge
   gaps are used to shape a discussion of the biodiversity and ecosystem
   implications of climate engineering, including novel climatic
   conditions, alterations to marine systems and substantial terrestrial
   habitat change. This review highlights several current research
   priorities in which the climate engineering context is crucial to
   consider, as well as identifying some novel topics for ecological
   investigation.},

Abstract = {National security agencies of four major powers-the United States,
   Russia, China, and the United Kingdom-see their militaries taking on
   additional roles in domestic disaster relief because of the effects of
   global climate change. Otherwise, national security actors show
   drastically different responses to climate change. The US and Russian
   militaries are planning for a thawing of the Arctic; but outside the
   Arctic, Russia seems not to regard climate change as a serious national
   security issue. The United States, the United Kingdom, and China are
   studying the effect of rising sea levels on coastal military
   installations; Russia apparently is not. The United States and the
   United Kingdom have begun significant efforts to cut energy use and
   greenhouse gas emissions, but because of low domestic energy prices, the
   Russian military has few incentives to reduce energy consumption or
   increase alternative energy use. And out of deference to the
   government's official position that climate change is a development
   rather than security issue, China's military has largely limited its
   climate-related activities to mass tree planting and disaster relief.
   Regardless of their positions on climate change, national security
   entities in these four countries are not expressing much urgency or
   taking aggressive stands, in part due to the paucity of established
   knowledge about the connection between a warming climate and national
   security.},

Abstract = {Among the biggest global challenges for policymakers is the development
   of land use policies robust to climate change impacts. While diverse
   fields can inform adaptation, integrated social-ecological assessment of
   the multiple adaptation options are rare and cannot be easily applied.
   Here, we build on past studies by undertaking an integrated fine scale
   and strategic allocation of sea level rise (SLR) adaptation options that
   can direct policy making. We use models of probabilistic SLR inundation,
   urban growth, and sub-and intertidal ecosystem migration, to investigate
   the impacts of different SLR adaptation strategies, and how these can be
   allocated to best achieve both development and conservation goals.
   Coastal adaptation will involve trade-offs among development and
   conservation objectives and these will vary based on the extent to which
   sea levels rise. There will be trade-offs between conservation
   objectives regardless of the adaptation options chosen, however, retreat
   does provide opportunities for enabling the expansion of coastal
   ecosystems inland. Local governments can save billions of dollars and
   minimize political conflict between conservation and development goals
   through integrated strategic spatial planning. Our planning approach
   both informs policy and is transferable to other coastal regions faced
   with a rising sea.},

Title = {District Scale GHG Emission Indicators for Canadian Field Crop and
   Livestock Production},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The three main farm products from Canadian agriculture, i.e., proteins,
   vegetable oils, and carbohydrates, account for 98\% of the land in
   annual crops in Canada. The intensities and efficiencies of these field
   crops in relation to their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions were assessed
   for their value as land use change indicators. To facilitate spatial
   comparisons, this assessment was carried out at the Ecodistrict (ED)
   scale. The Unified Livestock Industry and Crop Emissions Estimation
   System (ULICEES) model was modified to operate at the ED scale, and used
   to quantify the GHG emission intensity of protein. GHG emissions were
   also calculated for plant products not used for livestock feed. The
   livestock GHG emissions and GHG-protein intensities estimated using ED
   scale inputs to ULICEES were reasonably close to GHG-protein intensities
   generated by the version of ULICEES driven by provincial scale census
   data. Carbohydrates were split into two groups, i.e., whether or not
   they supported livestock. Annual farm product data at 5-year intervals
   were used to generate GHG emissions from all farm operations. The range
   of GHG emissions from all farm operations in Western Canada was from 42
   to 54 Mt CO2e between in 1991 and 2011, while GHG emissions from
   livestock ranged from 22 to 34 Mt CO2e over the same period. The Eastern
   Canadian GHG emissions from all farm operations declined gradually from
   24 to 22 Mt CO2e over the period, with most of the eastern GHG emissions
   being from livestock. Ruminant livestock accounted for most of the
   livestock GHG emissions, particularly in the west. Provincial scale GHG
   emission efficiencies of the four farm product groups were assessed on a
   per-unit of GHG emissions basis for 2006. The most GHG-efficient
   province for protein was Ontario, whereas the most GHG-efficient
   province for all three plant products was Saskatchewan. The coastal
   provinces were the least GHG-efficient sources of all four farm product
   groups.},

Abstract = {This article aims to illustrate, through the presentation of case
   studies, the application of coal mine methane (CMM) drainage technology
   at two gassy coal mines in India, and to quantify the associated
   economic and environmental benefits. This work, which is based on two
   studies developed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
   through the Global Methane Initiative (GMI), demonstrates that the use
   of in-mine horizontal boreholes for pre-drainage, capture, and
   utilization of CMM is both technically and economically feasible.
   Furthermore, the results show reservoir simulation is a useful tool for
   optimizing in-mine horizontal pre-drainage borehole placement. The
   future development and implementation of CMM drainage at each mine has
   the potential to lower or offset electricity costs, reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions, unlock coal reserves, and improve mine safety and energy
   security. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Identifying Pathways for Climate-Resilient Multispecies Fisheries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {Fish live in communities, and most fisheries catch multiple species, yet
   fishery management predominately focuses on single species. In many
   multispecies fisheries, a variety of species are generally caught
   together at similar rates. Failure to account for this adequately in
   management has resulted in serial depletion and alterations to the
   ecosystem. Ideally, multispecies fisheries management should strive to
   produce good yields from specific valuable stocks and avoid adverse
   impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems. Moreover, multispecies
   management should aim to build resilience to changes in stock
   productivity and distribution driven by climate change. Here, we present
   tools and pathways that seven fisheries are adopting to achieve these
   goals. These case studies - from Mexico, Cuba, and Chile - differ in
   data richness, governance structure, and management resources. The
   management systems are also in various stages of evolution from
   unmanaged to complete management of a single species but transitioning
   to multispecies management. While various analytical tools and
   decision-making processes are described in the case studies, a common
   feature is the use of participatory stakeholder processes to build
   capacity and socialize the importance of multispecies management. We use
   lessons from these cases to recommend a multispecies management approach
   to overcome the limitations of current practices (typically
   single-species catch limits or large spatial restrictions), using the
   participatory processes and data-limited assessments to create stock
   complexes that simplify multispecies management (i.e., the ``fish
   baskets{''} approach). Indicator species for each fish basket are
   identified to support the development of fishery performance indicators,
   reference values, harvest control rules, and management measures to
   create an adaptive management cycle to enhance the fishery's resilience
   to impacts induced by climate change and other factors.},

Abstract = {The capture and geological storage of CO2 represents an option to avoid
   emissions of this greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, by seizing CO2
   from major stationary sources, transporting it by pipeline or ship and
   injecting it into deep underground reservoirs. Deployment of these
   systems could help Croatia to stay within the limitations set by the
   Kyoto Protocol. There are reservoir formations with,favourable
   conditions in the southern Pannonian basin as well as in the Adriatic
   off-shore that could be prepared for geological storage. Depleted oil
   and gas reservoirs might be the most promising in the beginning,
   particularly in the initiated FOR operations, but much larger potential
   can be assigned to the regionally extended deep saline aquifers.},

Title = {Integrating Typhoon Destructive Potential and Social-Ecological Systems
   Toward Resilient Coastal Communities},

Abstract = {The resilience of coastal communities becomes a critical issue of the
   social-ecological system adapting to impacts from hazards on coastal
   well-being. This paper formulates a framework integrating typhoon
   destructive potential and social-ecological system from a perspective of
   coastal resilience. Typhoon destructive potential is interpreted using
   the Power Dissipation Index as a metric. We use the distributional
   models in geographic information systems to identify the spatial
   hotspots of high Power Dissipation Index along the coast of Mainland
   China. Furthermore, we evaluate the community resilience in all
   identified hotspots with place-based indicators within five potential
   dimensions (Social, Ecological, Institutional, Economic, and Safety).
   Though the results show no significant long-term trends in the typhoon
   destructive potential, statistically significant interdecadal variations
   are identified in different hotspots during 1949-2014. The resilience
   assessment results reveal that ecological (predisaster defense) and
   safety resilience (postdisaster support) are critical issues in
   achieving coastal community resilience. We argue that improving the
   ecological stewardship (having great predisaster defense) and adopting
   integrated approaches contribute to resilience enhancement, providing
   opportunities to support all the dimensions of community resilience via
   improving the social-economic-ecological nexus. The integration of
   typhoon destructive potential and social-ecological system helps to
   achieve Sustainable Development Goal 13 through risk-informed
   decision-making. The results from this study have important policy
   implications for local-scale planning incorporating place-based
   indicators.},

Title = {Comparative study of methane emission in the reclamation-restored
   wetlands and natural marshes in the Hangzhou Bay coastal wetland},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {175},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wetlands play a crucial role in reducing global warming potential in
   response to global climate change. Largescale reclamation and artificial
   restoration of coastal wetlands significantly affect the greenhouse gas
   methane emissions of coastal ecosystems. To comprehensively understand
   the difference in methane emissions between natural and
   reclamation-restored wetlands, the natural bare mudflat (BM - bare
   mudflat) in Hangzhou Bay, three types of natural vegetation wetlands (SM
   - Scirpus mariqueter, PA - Phragmites australis, and SA - Spartina
   alterniflora), and four types of reclamation-restored P. australis
   wetlands with different water levels (RW0 - Water level at 0 cm; RW10 -
   Water level at 10 cm; RW20 - Water level at 20 cm; RW30 - Water level at
   30 cm) were selected to analyze the relationship between methane
   emissions and environmental factors through field observations and
   laboratory experiments. The results showed that the methane emission
   flux and methane production potential (MPP) of reclamation-restored
   wetlands were notably higher than those of natural wetlands, and the
   monthly dynamics in the different types of wetlands were consistent with
   temperature. The methane emission flux increased rapidly from April to
   July (summer), and reached a monotonic peak in July. Among the natural
   wetlands, the methane emission flux and MPP of SA were significantly
   higher, which was mainly driven by the soil organic carbon (SOC). In the
   reclamation-restored wetlands, the methane emission fluxes did not
   significantly differ between RW10, RW20, and RW30, but were remarkably
   higher than those of RW0 and natural wetlands, which was mainly driven
   by the water level and salinity. The differences in the MPP of the
   different soil layers were mainly affected by the SOC and water levels.
   Especially in the 0-5 cm surface soil layer of the reclamation-restored
   wetlands, the MPP was significantly higher, which was mainly driven by
   the SOC. Therefore, during the later stages of artificial
   reclamation-restored wetlands, appropriate water level and salinity
   management and other effective engineering measures should be explored
   to manage methane emissions during wetland restoration.},

Abstract = {Solar energy is the largest energy source on Earth. In contrast to the
   limited and greenhouse gases-emitting fossil fuels, solar energy is
   inexhaustible, carbon neutral, and nonpolluting. The conversion of this
   most abundant but highly diffused source into hydrogen is increasingly
   attractive. In nature, photosynthetic microorganisms exploit solar
   energy to produce hydrogen via photosynthesis, which is also known as
   photobiological hydrogen production. More recently, various types of
   artificial materials have been developed to hybrid microorganisms for
   converting solar energy into hydrogen, namely, semiartificial
   photosynthesis hydrogen production. Herein, the strategies for
   converting solar energy into hydrogen with whole-cell biocatalyst are
   summarized and their potentials for future social sustainable
   development are discussed.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Increasing the proportion of power derived from renewable energy sources
   is becoming an increasingly important part of many countries's
   strategies to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   renewable energy investments can often have external costs and benefits,
   which need to be taken into account if socially optimal investments are
   to be made. This paper attempts to estimate the magnitude of these
   external costs and benefits for the case of renewable technologies in
   Scotland, a country which has set particularly ambitious targets for
   expanding renewable energy. The external effects we consider are those
   on landscape quality, wildlife and air quality. We also consider the
   welfare implications of different investment strategies for employment
   and electricity prices. The methodology used to do this is the choice
   experiment technique. Renewable technologies considered include hydro,
   onshore and off-shore wind power and biomass. Welfare changes for
   different combinations of impacts associated with different investment
   strategies are estimated. We also test for differences in preferences
   towards these impacts between urban and rural communities, and between
   high- and low-income households. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Assessing the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from a green
   infrastructure-based urban drainage system},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {278},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) is a low-carbon solution for urban rainwater
   management. Hydrological processes and the corresponding emissions of
   greenhouse gas (GHG) during rainfall events are optimized by GI when the
   latter is compared with a traditional urban drainage system. This study
   establishes an city-scale quantitative analysis, based on hydrological
   processes, with which to assess the contribution of GIs to low-carbon
   urban drainage systems and cities. The emission factor method is applied
   to measure GHG emissions. Attributable sources of emissions are
   wastewater treatment plants and wastewater and rainwater pumps. The
   amount and rate of change in GHG emissions were selected as indicators
   of the impacts of GI-based urban drainage systems and a case study was
   conducted in Dongying, China, based on 48 hydrological scenarios from
   1970 to 2017. The amount of annual GHG emissions decreased by 3752.5 to
   26238.9 tons of CO2 equivalent at an average of 10677.3 tons/a. The rate
   of annual GHG emissions decreased by 25.9-68.7\% with an average
   reduction of 45.9\%. An S-shaped logistic curve fit the data, indicated
   that annual rainfall is non-linearly and positively correlated with both
   the amount and rate of annual GHG emissions mitigated. The probability
   of benefits to GHG emissions in the 48 hydrological scenarios is
   analyzed based on a Pearson type III distribution curve. These findings
   can provide information thatlocal authorities can use to guide policies
   towards their goals of applying GIs to mitigate GHG emissions in the
   urban drainage system.},

Abstract = {Understanding the origins of greenhouse gas methane in the ocean is of
   great environmental importance, especially for global climate change and
   the flow of carbon within the earth surface system. A mutant (E176H) of
   2-hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase (HEPD) has been reported to
   catalyze the transformation of 2-hydroxypropylphosphonate (2-HEP) to
   methylphosphonate (MPn), a compound that can be easily transformed to
   methane by C-P lyase in a marine microbe. Here, the HEPD E176H-catalyzed
   transformation of 2-HEP to MPn was investigated at the molecular level
   using the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method. The results
   evidenced the feasibility of the transformation of 2-HEP to MPn and
   highlighted that the transformation contains five elementary steps: H
   abstraction, O-O bond cleavage, H transfer, C-C bond cleavage, and MPn
   formation. H abstraction was found to be the rate-determining step with
   an energy barrier of 17.8 kcal/mol, which is in reasonable accordance
   with the experimentally determined rate constant (0.38 s(-1),
   corresponding to 18.0 kcal/mol). Three intersystem crossing events were
   involved in H-abstraction, H-transfer, and MPn-formation steps. Residue
   electrostatic analysis on the rate-determining step suggests that proper
   mutation of Tyr174 may improve the enzymatic efficiency.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a comparative study of four different cases on
   vulnerability, hazards and adaptive capacity to climate threats in
   coastal areas and communities in four developing countries: Bangladesh,
   Brazil, Cameroon and Uruguay. Coastal areas are vulnerable to sea-level
   rise (SLR), storm surges and flooding due to their (i) exposure, (ii)
   concentration of settlements, many of which occupied by less advantaged
   groups and (iii) the concentration of assets and services seen in these
   areas. The objective of the paper is twofold: (i) to evaluate current
   evidence of coastal vulnerability and adaptive capacity and (ii) to
   compare adaptation strategies being implemented in a sample of
   developing countries, focusing on successful ones. The followed approach
   for the case evaluation is based on (i) documenting observed threats and
   damages, (ii) using indicators of physical and socioeconomic
   vulnerability and adaptive capacity status and (iii) selecting examples
   of successful responses. Major conclusions based on cross-case
   comparison are (a) the studied countries show different vulnerability,
   adaptive capacity and implementation of responses, (b) innovative
   community-based (CBA) and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) and (c) early
   warning systems are key approaches and tools to foster climate
   resilience. A recommendation to foster the resilience of coastal
   communities and services is that efforts in innovative adaptation
   strategies to sea-level rise should be intensified and integrated with
   climate risk management within the national adaption plans (NAPAs) in
   order to reduce the impacts of hazards.},

Title = {Comparison of the greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from
   the SF-BREEZE high-speed fuel-cell ferry with a diesel ferry},

Abstract = {A theoretical comparison is made of the ``well to waves{''} (WTW)
   greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions from the SF-BREEZE
   high-speed hydrogen PEM fuel cell ferry and the VALLEJO ferry powered by
   traditional diesel engine technology but constrained to Tier 4 emissions
   standards. The emissions were calculated for a common maritime mission,
   the current ferry route between Vallejo CA and San Francisco CA.
   Calculations are made of the energy required for the SF-BREEZE and
   VALLEJO to perform the mission route profile. The SF-BREEZE requires
   10.1\% more fuel energy than the VALLEJO, primarily due to the SF-BREEZE
   being heavier. Estimates are made for the SF-BREEZE GHG emissions
   associated with five LH2 fuel production pathways including renewable
   and non-renewable (fossil-fuel based) methods. Estimates are also made
   for GHG emissions associated with fossil-diesel production and delivery
   as well as those for biodiesel, which can be considered a renewable
   ``drop-in{''} fuel replacement for conventional diesel fuel. We find
   that the GHG emissions for the SF-BREEZE using non-renewable LH2 are
   significantly higher than for the Tier 4 diesel-fueled VALLEJO on a per
   passenger basis. However, using renewable LH2, the GHG emissions for the
   SF-BREEZE ferry are reduced 75.8\% compared to the diesel-fueled VALLEJO
   operating at Tier 4 emissions standards. We also compare the criteria
   pollutant emissions (NOx, HC, PM10) for the SF-BREEZE to that of the
   VALLEJO held to Tier 4 emissions standards fueled by diesel fuel or
   biodiesel. Hydrogen PEM fuel cell technology dramatically reduces NOx
   and HC emissions below the most advanced Tier 4 criteria pollutant
   emissions requirements regardless of whether the LH2 is made by NG
   reforming or via water electrolysis using 70\% renewable energy.
   Renewable LH2 made with greater than 84\% renewable process energy is
   needed to also drop the SF-BREEZE PM10 emissions below that of Tier 4
   for high-speed fuel cell ferry transportation. Overall, the results show
   that operating a hydrogen fuel cell ferry on nearly 100\% renewable
   hydrogen provides the dramatic reduction in GHG and criteria pollutant
   emissions commensurate with the problems of global climate change and
   maritime air pollution worldwide. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of scientific uncertainty and the
   way it impedes planning for climate change and accelerated sea-level
   rise (CC \& ASLR) in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). The paper begins
   by discussing the problems CC \& ASLR poses for PICs, and it explores
   the limitations of the dominant approach to vulnerability and
   adaptation. Next, the paper considers the way scientific uncertainty
   problematizes policies aimed at adaptation to CC \& ASLR. It argues that
   the prevailing approach, which requires anticipation of impacts, is
   unsuccessful, and the paper proposes a complementary strategy aimed to
   enhance the resilience of whole island social-ecological systems. Recent
   developments in the theory and practice of resilience are discussed and
   then applied to formulate goals for adaptation policy in PICs. (C) 2001

Abstract = {Waste management is more challenging in small islands due to islands'
   special characteristics. For small islands where energy recovery by
   incineration is difficult due to smaller waste generation amount with
   large seasonal fluctuations, waste shipments outside of island can make
   energy recovery possible. This study evaluated the cost effectiveness
   and environmental performance of waste shipments for energy recovery in
   case of small islands. The results shown that the direct shipment for
   incineration is expensive, but the emission prevention by energy
   recovery can surpass the emission from waste transportation. Waste
   shipments in the form of refused derived fuel (RDF) can reduce the
   transportation and incineration cost, but the high fossil fuel
   consumption in RDF production process resulted in high greenhouse gas
   emissions. The shipping distance, RDF gate fee, and emission from RDF
   production process have high influence on the cost effectiveness and
   environmental performance of the waste treatment process. The results of
   this study revealed the cost effective and environmental beneficial

Title = {A Backcasting Analysis toward a 100\% Renewable Energy Transition by
   2040 for Off-Grid Islands},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The rapid increase in energy consumption results from population growth
   and technological advancement, while economic growth also relies heavily
   on the availability of energy. As fossil fuels become scarcer and
   greenhouse gas emissions increase, renewable energy sources are regarded
   as practical solutions to meet increasing energy demands. This study
   aims to develop a sustainable energy transition pathway for off-grid
   island communities in the Philippines. It adopts the concept of
   backcasting analysis, focusing on the demand and supply side of the
   energy transition. The transition considers three milestones: business
   as usual (BAU), minimal transition scenario (MTS), and absolute
   transition scenario (ATS). The techno-enviro-economic analysis is
   performed for each milestone to determine the optimal energy resource
   mix while addressing the three dimensions of the Energy Trilemma: energy
   security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. The approach
   is implemented in three off-grid island municipalities in Palawan,
   Philippines: Araceli, Balabac, and Cuyo. The results suggest that the
   optimal electrification configuration for each island at the MTS is a
   hybrid system consisting of a diesel generator and solar photovoltaics
   with batteries, while at the ATS, it is a hybrid system of solar
   photovoltaics and wind with batteries. In addition, greenhouse gas
   emissions are reduced by 79.7\% in Araceli, 78.7\% in Balabac, and
   41.2\% in Cuyo from the BAU scenario to MTS. The actors involved in said
   transition are identified. A transitional pathway can be seen as a
   strategic plan to achieve the desired goal: to have a sustainable energy
   transition.},

Abstract = {Comparison of options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions must take
   account of many different matters in a consistent manner. A method of
   full-fuel-cycle analysis has been developed with this aim in mind. In
   this method, technical options are compared using a measure made up from
   the `'private costs'' of owning and operating a power station together
   with the `'external costs'' representing its environmental impact. The
   method is tested on three types of power generation plant, each of which
   incorporates CO2 capture and sequestration technology - these include
   natural gas-fired and coal-fired power plant, as well as CO2 storage in
   a disused gas field, in the deep ocean or in an off-set forest.
   Emissions arising from all stages of the fuel cycle are estimated - from
   extraction of fossil fuel through to dispatch of power to the grid. All
   types of emission and their impact at local, regional and global level
   are assessed and valuation of these impacts is attempted. Previous work
   in this field has concentrated on local impacts, such as occupational
   health, and regional impacts, such as `'acid rain''. This study is one
   of the first to include a comprehensive assessment of global warming
   impacts, how these will vary with time as well as geographically,
   including allowance for any potential benefits. From this, the
   environmental external costs of the fuel cycles are determined. (C) 1997

Abstract = {In recent years, global warming has caused the sea level to rise. The
   river or coastal related disasters such as tsunami, cyclone and flood
   have also become higher in frequency and stronger in intensity. As one
   of the counter measures, some of the existing coastal protection
   structures need to be rehabilitated and new, stronger or taller coastal
   structures have to be built. How to construct coastal protection
   structures in a quicker and yet cost-effective way becomes a challenge
   to geotechnical engineers. The coastal protection structures can be
   classified into different categories according to the materials used. In
   this chapter, several new construction methods for coastal protection
   structures will be presented. These include the use of geo-tubes,
   geo-bags, geo-mattresses, geo-containers, precast concrete segments,
   suction caissons and assembly structures. The applications of some of
   these new techniques in the construction of coastal protection
   structures are illustrated using case histories.},

Title = {How Much Marsh Restoration Is Enough to Deliver Wave Attenuation Coastal
   Protection Benefits?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {As coastal communities grow more vulnerable to sea-level rise and
   increased storminess, communities have turned to nature-based solutions
   to bolster coastal resilience and protection. Marshes have significant
   wave attenuation properties and can play an important role in coastal
   protection for many communities. Many restoration projects seek to
   maximize this ecosystem service but how much marsh restoration is enough
   to deliver measurable coastal protection benefits is still unknown. This
   question is critical to guiding assessments of cost effectiveness and
   for funding, implementation, and optimizing of marsh restoration for
   risk reduction projects. This study uses SWAN model simulations to
   determine empirical relationships between wave attenuation and marsh
   vegetation. The model runs consider several different common marsh
   morphologies (including systems with channels, ponds, and fringing
   mudflats), vegetation placement, and simulated storm intensity. Up to a
   95\% reduction in wave energy is seen at as low as 50\% vegetation
   cover. Although these empirical relationships between vegetative cover
   and wave attenuation provide essential insight for marsh restoration, it
   is also important to factor in lifespan estimates of restored marshes
   when making overall restoration decisions. The results of this study are
   important for coastal practitioners and managers seeking performance
   goals and metrics for marsh restoration, enhancement, and creation.},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems represent a potential additional source of the
   greenhouse gas methane (CH4) that has been insufficiently quantified.
   Thus, to understand the mechanisms controlling greenhouse gas emissions
   in these ecosystems, this study investigated CH4 emissions from and the
   related microbial properties of mangrove soils. Soil and gas samples
   were collected from several plots at different distances from the
   seashore in Soc Trang and Ca Mau in Vietnam, and the Sundarbans in
   India. Soil samples were incubated under different conditions, i.e.,
   anaerobic or aerobic, and the microbial properties of each soil sample
   with the addition of different amounts of seawater were analyzed.
   Relatively high CH4 fluxes and production were detected during the
   aerobic incubation of samples from the seashore plots in Soc Trang and
   Ca Mau. However, CH4 production was reduced under anaerobic conditions
   {[}soil electrical conductivity (EC): 179-289 mSm(-1), pH (H2O):
   7.45-8.10] compared with aerobic conditions {[}water content:
   38.9-109.2\%, EC: 187-299 mSm(-1), pH (H2O): 6.86-7.72], but it
   increased with increasing sulfate concentration, soil EC and cellulase
   activity and lowering soil pH under anaerobic conditions. Furthermore,
   mangrove soil with a relatively high level of total organic carbon (C)
   exhibited relatively high CH4 production when diluted 4-fold with
   seawater under anaerobic conditions {[}water content: 38.9-109.2\%, EC:
   533 mSm(-1), pH (H2O): 6.67]. Nearly all of the DNA bands excised from
   polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   contained identical sequences related to archaea from the class
   Halobacteria. The high potential of the seashore plot for CH4 emissions
   could be due to the enhancement of cellulase activity under the
   intermittent oxygen supply, which promotes polysaccharide
   depolymerization and subsequently increases anaerobic methanogenic
   activities during tidal flooding. This study also indicates that the
   major archaea responsible for CH4 production require a particular
   hydrospheric salt concentration and soil pH.},

Title = {An evolving view on biogeochemical cycling of iron},
Journal = {NATURE REVIEWS MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {360-374},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Biogeochemical cycling of iron is crucial to many environmental
   processes, such as ocean productivity, carbon storage, greenhouse gas
   emissions and the fate of nutrients, toxic metals and metalloids.
   Knowledge of the underlying processes involved in iron cycling has
   accelerated in recent years along with appreciation of the complex
   network of biotic and abiotic reactions dictating the speciation,
   mobility and reactivity of iron in the environment. Recent studies have
   provided insights into novel processes in the biogeochemical iron cycle
   such as microbial ammonium oxidation and methane oxidation coupled to
   Fe(iii) reduction. They have also revealed that processes in the
   biogeochemical iron cycle spatially overlap and may compete with each
   other, and that oxidation and reduction of iron occur cyclically or
   simultaneously in many environments. This Review discusses these
   advances with particular focus on their environmental consequences,
   including the formation of greenhouse gases and the fate of nutrients
   and contaminants.
   In this Review, Kappler and colleagues highlight recent advances in our
   understanding of the biogeochemical iron cycle, exploring the great
   complexity of the processes involved and novel mechanistic insights that
   have been gained.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions simulated by
   the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, version 2, Earth System
   (HadGEM2-ES) to be compatible with four representative concentration
   pathways (RCPs) from 2006 to 2100. For three of the four RCPs, the
   analysis is extended to 2300. The compatible emissions compare well with
   those generated by integrated assessment models from which the RCPs were
   constructed. Historical compatible emissions are also presented, which
   closely match observation-based estimates from 1860 to 2005
   (cumulatively 330 and 319 GtC, respectively). Simulated land and ocean
   carbon uptake, which determines the compatible emissions, is examined,
   with an emphasis on changes in vegetation carbon. In addition,
   historical land and ocean carbon uptake is compared with observations.
   The influences of climate change and the carbon cycle on compatible
   emissions are investigated individually through two additional
   experiments in which either aspect is decoupled from the CO2 pathway.
   Exposure of the biogeochemical components of the Earth system to
   increasing CO2 is found to be responsible for 68\% of the compatible
   emissions of the fully coupled simulation, while increased radiative
   forcing from the CO2 pathway reduces its compatible emissions by 11\%.
   The importance of dynamic vegetation to compatible emissions is
   investigated and discussed. Two different methods of determining
   emissions from land use and land-use change are compared; differencing
   the land-atmosphere CO2 exchange of two experiments, one with fixed land
   use and the other variable, results in historical land-use emissions
   within the uncertainty range of observed estimates, while those
   simulated directly by the model are well below the lower limit of the
   observations.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems provide important services that can help people adapt to
   climate variability and change. Recognizing this role of ecosystems,
   several international and nongovernmental organizations have promoted an
   ecosystem-based approach to adaptation. We review the scientific
   literature related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) with forests and
   trees, and highlight five cases in which forests and trees can support
   adaptation: (1) forests and trees providing goods to local communities
   facing climatic threats; (2) trees in agricultural fields regulating
   water, soil, and microclimate for more resilient production; (3)
   forested watersheds regulating water and protecting soils for reduced
   climate impacts; (4) forests protecting coastal areas from
   climate-related threats; and (5) urban forests and trees regulating
   temperature and water for resilient cities. The literature provides
   evidence that EBA with forests and trees can reduce social vulnerability
   to climate hazards; however, uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain,
   particularly for regulating services in watersheds and coastal areas.
   Few studies have been undertaken on EBA specifically, but the abundant
   literature on ecosystem services can be used to fill knowledge gaps.
   Many studies assess the multiple benefits of ecosystems for human
   adaptation or well-being, but also recognize trade-offs between
   ecosystem services. Better understanding is needed of the efficiency,
   costs, and benefits, and trade-offs of EBA with forests and trees. Pilot
   projects under implementation could serve as learning sites and existing
   information could be systematized and revisited with a climate change
   adaptation lens. WIREs Clim Change 2012, 3:581596. doi: 10.1002/wcc.195

Abstract = {In a changing climate, understanding how soil hydrology impacts
   greenhouse gas dynamics will be important for the future management of
   the soils in the forests on the Canadian Pacific west coast. In a
   laboratory study, the impact of soil hydrology on potential net methane
   (CH4) exchange rates and the abundance of methanotrophs (CH4 oxidation)
   and methanogens (CH4 production) in upland and water-saturated wet soils
   were investigated. CH4 oxidation and production rates were highest in
   the wet soils, which corresponded to higher numbers of methanotrophs and
   methanogens, indicating a link between the microbial abundance and CH4
   exchange rates. Also, CH4 production was induced in the upland soils,
   indicating the presence of methanogens. The optimum soil moisture
   content for CH4 oxidation was highest in upland soils and the wet soils
   sustained higher CH4 oxidation rates over a broader range of soil
   moisture. These results underline the importance of the soil
   hydrological controls of CH4 oxidation in contrasting soils and forest
   types, which deserves further attention in field-based studies.},

Pages = {12665-12685},
Abstract = {Reducing greenhouse gas emissions becomes a top priority in the world
   with the emergence of global warming and environmental problems. Various
   renewable energies appear during the last decades. Ocean captures and
   stores huge amounts of energy, which could satisfy five times of world
   energy demand. Due to technology limitations and economic
   considerations, marine current energy appears the most attractive choice
   compared with the other ocean energy form. Although the existing
   expertise and technology in offshore wind energy conversion system can
   be partially transferred to marine current energy conversion system due
   to the similar structure, there are still many technological challenges
   to overcome. Meanwhile, the system operates under the water will
   inevitably have some negative or positive impacts on the surrounding
   environment. In this paper, it shows the interest and the principle of
   the marine current energy, and also discusses the advantages and
   disadvantages. The environmental impacts around the devices, the
   technological challenges, and the essential support structures are
   presented as well. The state-of-the-art horizontal axis turbines and
   their relative technologies and the latest projects are described
   finally. This review paper gives the useful information about the
   attraction and challenge of the marine current energy, and the newest
   development of the technologies and projects.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies to climatic variability: A case study of
   small-scale farmers in rural Mexico},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to have major consequences for small-scale
   farmers in the developing rural areas of the world. Rural areas,
   nonetheless, harbor opportunities to mitigate global climate changes.
   Identification of innovative adaptation strategies used by small-scale
   farmers, therefore, is crucial in order to understand the extent of
   their implications. This paper identifies the relationships between
   livelihood units and landscapes that they depend upon, in a small-scale
   farm community. It examines their experiences of increasing climatic
   variability, and how the different groups in the community are adapting
   to it. The study was conducted in a typical rural ejido community on the
   Pacific coast of Mexico (Ejido Ticuiz), where a detailed socio-cultural
   profile was obtained by means of semi-structured interviews. In the
   study area we encountered a range of individual and community-based
   adaptation strategies, built on farmers' recognition of the different
   types of landscapes which supply goods and benefits. Small-scale farmers
   have used their landscape diversity to build adaptation strategies to
   guarantee the supply of goods and benefits to cope with uncertain of
   climate events. Households rather than individuals or the community as
   an institution were depicted as the core socio-cultural group for better
   understanding of patterns, behavior and aspirations related to climate
   change adaptation at local level. The adaptation capacities of rural
   communities could be significantly strengthened if political, financial
   and institutional support is targeted at households rather than at
   individuals or the community level only. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Since sequential batch reactor (SBR) system is sequentially removes
   carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous in a single reactor by maintaining
   anoxic and aerobic stages, it recently has attracted a great deal of
   interest. This study evaluates the impact of wastewater treatment plant
   (WWTP) with a SBR system on a creek which is the influent tributary to
   Aegean Sea. Accordingly, this study demonstrates (1) the treatment
   efficiency of full-scale WWTP; (2) how WWTP influences creek's water
   quality from 2012 to 2015; (3) how creek influences receiving body's
   water quality; and (4) the potential climate change impact of a SBR
   treatment system. The study shows that SBR treatment plant complies with
   standards set by Turkish Legislations with 4-year average of 62 \% SS,
   71 \% BOD, 62 \% COD, 32 \% TN and 31 \% TP removal but the accumulation
   of pollutants occurs during low flows when point source is dominant.
   This is the case in the downstream of treated WWTP discharge point. The
   potential impact of treatment plant on climate change was calculated in
   terms of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The annual methane emissions
   from SBR alternated from minimum of 68.71 to maximum 248.99 tCO(2)e.
   Total emissions CH4, N2O and emission due to electricity usage) from a
   full-scale SBR were calculated as 144.22 tCO(2)e, 318.34 tCO(2)e, 474.79
   tCO(2)e and 996.62 tCO(2)e from 2012 to 2015, respectively.},

Abstract = {The shipping sector is likely to go through a fuel transition in the
   coming decades as a result of the increasing regulation and the
   commitment of part of the ship-owning community to reduce its
   environmental impact. If shipping is to limit its greenhouse gas
   emissions so that global warming is maintained below 2 degrees C as
   agreed by the IMO in April 2018 and in line with 2015 Paris Agreement,
   urgent action is needed in terms of environmentally friendly
   technologies uptake, operational measures and new forms of propulsion
   based on alternative fuels. While some research has appeared in the last
   decade on operational and technological measures aimed at reducing
   emissions for shipping, limited focus has been put on the economic and
   environmental impacts of a fuel shift. This research aims at analysing
   the alternative fuel options available for shipping and assess the
   emission reductions obtainable through a fuel shift. The paper also
   provides insights on the costs associated with such fuel transition.
   Through the development of a simulation based on existing information of
   alternative fuel costs and availability, the paper shows that a maximum
   of 24\% greenhouse gas emission reduction can be achieved by using
   alternative fuels. Such reduction, however, can be obtained at varying
   cost levels. An optimal fleet mix is provided for 2050 as guidance for
   policy makers and the shipping sector.},

Title = {Mangrove Rehabilitation and Restoration as Experimental Adaptive
   Management},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Rehabilitated and restored mangrove ecosystems have important
   ecological, economic, and social values for coastal communities.
   Although a sine qua non of successful mangrove rehabilitation or
   restoration projects is accurate attention to local hydrology and basic
   biology of mangrove trees and their associated fauna, their long-term
   success depends on far more axes, each with their own challenges.
   Rehabilitation projects: are planned, designed, executed, and managed by
   people with diverse backgrounds and different scientific and
   socio-political agendas; need to be responsive to these multiple
   stakeholders and agents who hold different values; are often influenced
   by laws and treaties spanning local to international scales; and must be
   able to adapt and evolve both geomorphologically and socioeconomically
   over decades-to-centuries in the context of a rapidly changing climate.
   We view these challenges as opportunities for innovative approaches to
   rehabilitation and restoration that engage new and larger
   constituencies. Restored mangrove ecosystems can be deliberately
   designed and engineered to provide valuable ecosystem services, be
   adaptable to climatic changes, and to develop platforms for educating
   nonspecialists about both the successes and failures of restored
   mangrove ecosystems. When mangrove rehabilitation or restoration
   projects are developed as experiments, they can be used as case-studies
   and more general models to inform policy- and decision-makers and guide
   future restoration efforts. Achieving this vision will require new
   investment and dedication to research and adaptive management practices.
   These ideas are illustrated with examples from mangrove restoration and
   rehabilitation projects in the Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean regions,
   the two hotspots of mangrove biodiversity and its ongoing loss and
   degradation.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Enhanced warming in the Arctic (Arctic amplification, AA) in the last
   decades has been linked to several factors including sea ice and the
   Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). However, how these factors
   contributed to AA variations in a long-term perspective remains unclear.
   By reconstructing a millennial AA index combining climate model
   simulations with recently available proxy data, this work determines the
   important influences of the AMO and anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing
   on AA variations in the last millennium, leading to identification of a
   significant downward trend of AA on top of a sustained strong AMO
   modulation at the multidecadal scales. The decreased AA during the
   industrial era was strongly associated with the anthropogenic forcing,
   proving the emerging role of the forcing in reducing the AA strength.
   Reconstructed Arctic amplification shows a significant downward trend
   over the past millennium which can to a large part be explained by the
   strength of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and recent
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing.},

Title = {From Understanding to Sustainable Use of Peatlands: The WETSCAPES
   Approach},
Journal = {SOIL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Of all terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands store carbon most effectively
   in long-term scales of millennia. However, many peatlands have been
   drained for peat extraction or agricultural use. This converts peatlands
   from sinks to sources of carbon, causing approx. 5\% of the
   anthropogenic greenhouse effect and additional negative effects on other
   ecosystem services. Rewetting peatlands can mitigate climate change and
   may be combined with management in the form of paludiculture. Rewetted
   peatlands, however, do not equal their pristine ancestors and their
   ecological functioning is not understood. This holds true especially for
   groundwater-fed fens. Their functioning results from manifold
   interactions and can only be understood following an integrative
   approach of many relevant fields of science, which we merge in the
   interdisciplinary project WETSCAPES. Here, we address interactions among
   water transport and chemistry, primary production, peat formation,
   matter transformation and transport, microbial community, and greenhouse
   gas exchange using state of the art methods. We record data on six study
   sites spread across three common fen types (Alder forest, percolation
   fen, and coastal fen), each in drained and rewetted states. First
   results revealed that indicators reflecting more long-term effects like
   vegetation and soil chemistry showed a stronger differentiation between
   drained and rewetted states than variables with a more immediate
   reaction to environmental change, like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   Variations in microbial community composition explained differences in
   soil chemical data as well as vegetation composition and GHG exchange.
   We show the importance of developing an integrative understanding of
   managed fen peatlands and their ecosystem functioning.},

Title = {Measuring community resilience against coastal hazards: Case study in
   Baron Beach, Gunungkidul Regency},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The impacts of natural disaster occurred in coastal area have pushed
   environmental damage and threatened its sustainability as well as the
   existence of community livelihood. Accelerating risks from coastal
   hazards add the disadvantages for communities living in coastal areas,
   especially those who are very dependent on natural resources. The
   objectives of the research are the research is intended to measure the
   resilience of coastal community through collective resilience assessment
   and bottom-up approach in community level. Based on overall scores,
   mix-livelihood community is categorized as medium resilience with the
   score of (1.99), whereas fishery community (2.3) and tourism community
   (2.5) are categorized as high resilience score. The result of the
   participatory approach suggests that communities in Baron Beach are
   highly aware of the importance of the coastal environment especially
   within karst ecosystem. however, their awareness does not in line with
   their action of managing the sustainability of the ecosystem. Their
   livelihood practices still neglect the principle of environment
   conservation. Environmental conservation efforts and long-term disaster
   mitigation practice are still behind economic fulfillment of the
   livelihood. Therelbre, community participation is a crucial requirement
   for implementing this approach. This research proposed co-management
   practice in form of Adaptive Co-Management that can be defined as a
   partnership approach where government and resource users share the
   responsibility and authority for the management of a fishery or area,
   based on collaboration between themselves and with other stakeholders.

Abstract = {Today, it is common knowledge that increased use of renewable energies
   has a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The most
   notable types of renewable energies are solar energy and wind energy,
   whose popularity comes from their prominent features such as
   cost-effectiveness, stability and easy utilization. The objective of
   this paper is to perform a technical-economic analysis on combined
   utilization of solar and wind power in two cities of Qom and Yazd, to
   conduct a feasibility study on the construction of clean energy
   producing power plants in these locations. To achieve this objective, we
   first gather the required data from the national meteorological
   organization, and then use Homer software to perform technical and
   economic analyses on the two considered sites. Solar and wind analyses
   on Qom and Yazd show that both cities have great potential in solar
   energy generation, but wind speed data indicate that only Qom has the
   wind characteristics appropriate for wind power generation. Overall,
   these results indicate that investments on solar energy sector of both
   cities will be economically justified, but only Qom has the wind
   characteristics required to make investments on its wind energy sector
   economic. (C) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ

Title = {Blue Carbon Storage in a Northern Temperate Estuary Subject to Habitat
   Loss and Chronic Habitat Disturbance: Cowichan Estuary, British
   Columbia, Canada},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Vegetated coastal ecosystems can contribute greatly to long-term carbon
   sequestration and greenhouse gas emission mitigation, providing a strong
   argument for their protection and restoration. We investigated carbon
   sequestration in the Cowichan Estuary, a temperate estuary on Vancouver
   Island, Canada, in relation to habitat type (salt marsh, eelgrass,
   mudflats, and oyster shell beds) and habitat degradation. Stored organic
   carbon and inorganic carbon were quantified in the top 20 cm of sediment
   as well as in eelgrass and salt marsh vegetation. Sedimentation and
   carbon sequestration rates were quantified by Pb-210 radiometric dating,
   and organic matter sources and quality were assessed by delta C-13, C:N
   ratios and photopigment content. We also examined the potential impact
   of habitat disturbance by industrial activity (log booms) on the
   estuary's carbon storage capacity. The salt marsh was the most important
   carbon reservoir, with a mean sediment organic carbon stock of 58.78 +/-
   19.30 Mg C ha(-1). Sediment organic carbon stocks in the upper mudflats,
   lower mudflats, eelgrass meadow, and oyster shell beds were 19.30 +/-
   3.58, 17.33 +/- 3.17, 18.26 +/- 0.86 and 9.43 +/- 1.50 Mg C ha(-1),
   respectively. Carbon accumulation rates in the salt marsh and eelgrass
   meadows were 68.21 +/- 21 and 38 +/- 26 g C m(-2) yr(-1), whereas Pb-210
   profiles indicated that mudflat sediments were subject to erosion and/or
   mixing. While eelgrass was absent from the log boom area, likely due to
   disturbance, sediments there had similar carbon sequestration and bulk
   properties to adjacent mudflats. Carbon stocks in the eelgrass meadow
   were similar to those of the mudflats and consistent with the relatively
   low values reported for other temperate Zostera marina meadows, compared
   with tropical eelgrass meadows. Stable isotope evidence was suggestive
   of substantial outwelling and/or decomposition of eelgrass vegetation.
   Finally, we compared the carbon sequestration potential of the estuary
   to selected sources and sinks of CO2 in the surrounding region. We
   estimated that annual carbon sequestration in the estuary offsets
   approximately twice the greenhouse gas emission increases attributable
   to local population growth, and is equivalent to approximately twice
   that of a 20-year-old stand forest.},

Abstract = {Climate change has been occurring in every part of the world for the
   last two decades, including Indonesia. This phenomenon constitutes key
   emerging threat to marine ecosystems and fisheries resources as well as
   to societies that depend on these coastal environment and natural
   resources for food and livelihood. Nowadays, coastal adaptation to
   climate change is one of the tremendous challenges for coastal
   communities. The east coast of Sidoarjo regency has one of the widest
   mudflat areas in East Java, with high sedimentation rate which is
   originated from Brantas Watershed. This area, specifically in Kepetingan
   Hamlet, Sawohan Village, is heavily impacted by tidal floods twice a
   year and this is considered the most vulnerable place in Sidoarjo
   coastal area. In terms of a climate change adaptation measures, it is
   important to assess the resilience of these communities. This research
   aimed to analyse the recent condition of Kepetingan Hamlet and to
   investigate the factors which increases local community vulnerability
   due to climate change impact. We conducted this research by undergoing
   field observations including interviews with related stakeholders. This
   result expected to provide a bigger picture about Kepetingan Hamlet and
   to provide the suitable adaptation strategies for building resilience in
   facing climate change.},

Abstract = {The effects of wastewater on atmospheric fluxes of three greenhouse
   gases, nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from
   mangrove soils were investigated, and the differences among shrimp pond
   wastewater (SP), livestock wastewater (LS) and municipal (S) sewage were
   compared. The gas emissions from mangrove soils were significantly
   enhanced after wastewater irrigation and the highest emission of N2O and
   CO2 were obtained from SP. High N2O emission was also found in S
   treatment, where fluxes varied from 13.42 to 16.78 mu mol m(-2) h(-1),
   but the CH4 and CO2 fluxes were as low as the control irrigated with tap
   water. Results of soil analyses indicated that the high N2O emissions
   from mangrove soils receiving SP and S treatments were attributed to the
   denitrification and nitrification processes, respectively. The highest
   CH4 flux was recorded in LS treatment (186.14-762.40 mu mol m(-2)
   h(-1)), which also had the highest CO2 flux. The fluxes measured during
   the non-irrigation period were lower than those measured 4 h after
   irrigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping: Is it
   time to consider market-based measures?},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {123-134},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {International shipping carries around 80 per cent of global trade by
   volume and over 70 per cent by value. However, there is concern that the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping lead to
   adverse effects on climate, human health and marine ecosystems.
   Currently the international climate change regime under the United
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process and the
   IMO through its Marine Environment Protection Committee are grappling
   with this issue, and GHG emissions from international shipping have been
   partially regulated by amendments to Annex VI to the International
   Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) in
   2011 and 2014. These amendments aim to reduce GHG emissions from
   international shipping by means of technical and operational measures.
   However, research indicates that the adopted technical and operational
   measures alone would not achieve absolute emissions reduction due to
   projected growth of international seaborne trade. Currently it is still
   controversial whether it is time to consider market based measures
   (MBMs) in furthering the reduction of shipping GHG emissions. This
   article examines whether it is necessary to adopt MBMs, proposes a
   preferred MBM, and suggests that a MBM be considered in or after 2016.

Abstract = {Scholars and practitioners have long noted the importance of community
   resilience to disaster recovery and environmental risk mitigation. Yet
   we know surprisingly little about how local residents perceive the
   resilience of their local communities, including how closely their
   perceptions align with objective measures of resilience or whether these
   perceptions affect community engagement and support for resilience
   building activities and policies. In this paper, we utilise the results
   of public opinion surveys of residents of four Texas coastal shoreline
   counties (Brazoria, Nueces, Galveston, and Cameron) to address this gap
   in the literature. The results reveal that perceptions of community
   preparedness largely reflect social trust and disaster awareness while
   perceptions of recovery reflect perceived risks and preparedness.},

Title = {Pleistocene equatorial Pacific dynamics inferred from the zonal
   asymmetry in sedimentary nitrogen isotopes},
Journal = {PALEOCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {There is little agreement among models in predicting the average state
   of the tropical Pacific when subjected to enhanced greenhouse gas
   forcing. This uncertainty emphasizes the importance of reconstructing
   past variability in tropical Pacific climate through episodes of
   significant and estimable radiative forcing. Thus far, efforts along
   these lines have concentrated primarily on inferences of sea surface
   temperature variability from deep-sea sediments. Here we offer a
   different view of the equatorial Pacific over the past similar to 1.2
   million years (Myr)-before and after the mid-Pleistocene shift in the
   structure of ice ages. The zonal gradient in the nitrogen isotopic
   composition of sediment across the equatorial Pacific reflects nutrient
   delivery to the surface and, by extension, ocean dynamical properties.
   Over the last similar to 1.2 Myr, the variability of eastern equatorial
   Pacific nutrient upwelling (inferred from relative nitrate utilization)
   was highly correlated with local seasonal insolation. By contrast,
   nitrate utilization was insensitive to the 100,000 year cycle that
   dominated many other aspects of the Pleistocene ice ages, including
   greenhouse gas concentrations. A strong linear relationship between
   relative nitrate utilization and seasonal insolation over the past
   similar to 1 million years suggests a predictable response of one
   primary determinant of tropical Pacific climate change.},

Abstract = {A scenario of increased risks due to climate change and coastal erosion,
   coupled with a stringent economic recession, is threatening the
   Portuguese coast. Three particular locations are the focus of CHANGE
   Changing Coasts, Changing Climate, Changing Communities, a 3-year study
   (2010-2013) that aims to understand social perceptions about coastal
   risks and to examine new ways of adaptive management. The project
   involved assessing peoples' representations about the coastal present
   and possible coastal futures and discussed coastal change with local
   populations, in a country in which the protection of vulnerable coast to
   date has had little public involvement. The three coastal stretches
   studied face increasing coastal risks and the perspective of reduced
   public spending, fuelling uncertainty about their future. Public
   participation in coastal management has been almost entirely absent,
   which makes the social science based contribution of this research even
   more relevant. This research combines: a) scientific assessments on the
   past and future evolution of the shoreline, taking into account the
   impacts of climate change; b) interviews with policy-makers, coastal
   experts and stakeholders, as well as local public opinion surveys; c)
   the outputs of a model for coastal governance and community building,
   based on local discussions through focus groups and workshops. This
   paper is based on the surveys and focus groups undertaken in the
   case-study area most at risk from coastal change, Vagueira. We conclude
   that there is a growing perception of coastal threat and potential for
   the development of adaptive coastal management, taking advantage of
   local knowledge and initiative.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a project that compared the economics of major
   technologies and practices under development for CO2 storage and sink
   enhancement, including options for storing captured CO2, such as active
   oil reservoirs, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep aquifers, coal
   beds, and oceans, as well as the enhancement of biological sinks such as
   forests and croplands. For the geologic and ocean storage options, CO2
   capture costs from another project were added to the costs Of CO2
   storage estimated in this project to provide combined costs Of CO2
   capture and storage. Combined Costs Of CO2 capture and storage were
   compared with CO2 Sink enhancement costs on a life-cycle greenhouse gas
   (GHG) avoided basis. The CO2 storage and sink enhancement options
   compared in this project differ greatly in the timing and permanence Of
   CO2 sequestration. In addressing the timing and permanence issue, a
   100-year planning horizon was assumed and the net present value of both
   costs and revenues was considered. The methods for comparing the
   economics of diverse CO2 storage and sink enhancement options are
   overviewed and representative base-case costs of storage and sink
   enhancement options are compared.},

Abstract = {Various endeavors are undertaken by the maritime industry, academia, and
   policy-makers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include the
   search for feasible technologies that could be used onboard merchant
   vessels and are propelled by international legal and social initiatives.
   To this end, this study aimed to critically analyze the research trends
   pertaining to the active methods of reducing the negative environmental
   impact of shipping. The research is focused on alternative fuels and
   renewable energy systems with respect to the related policy-making and
   existing legal framework. Therefore, a bibliometric approach was applied
   to a sample of 234 scientific papers indexed in the SCI-EXPANDED in
   Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection. The results indicate
   that the scientific efforts were made more on alternative fuels, while
   renewable energy sources only recently became a popular research
   subject. Moreover, the environmental benefits of prospective
   technologies are more investigated than their financial aspects. The
   research effort on alternative maritime fuels was made in parallel with
   the legal one, both aiming to combat global climate change and
   magnifying each other.},

Title = {Building resilience in practice to support coral communities in the

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {182-190},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Global environmental change and other site specific pressures (e.g. over
   fishing and pollution) are threating coral reefs and the livelihoods of
   dependent coastal communities. Multiple strategies are used to build the
   resilience of both coral reefs and reef dependent communities but the
   effectiveness of these strategies is largely unknown. Using the Western
   Indian Ocean (WIO) as a case study, this paper combines published
   literature and expert opinion elicited through a multi-stakeholder
   workshop to assess the intended and realised social and ecological
   implications of strategies commonly applied in the region. Findings
   suggest that all strategies can contribute to building social and
   ecological resilience, but this varies with context and the overall
   strategy objectives. The ability of strategies to be successful in the
   future is questioned. To support effective resilience policy development
   more nuanced lesson learning requires effective monitoring and
   evaluation as well as a disaggregated understanding of resilience in
   terms of gender, agency and the interaction between ecological and
   social resilience. Opportunities for further lesson sharing between
   experts in the region are needed.},

Journal = {STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {463-476},
Abstract = {In this work, a risk-based assessment method and benefit-cost analysis
   to support policy decisions for adapting Australian coastal residential
   buildings to future coastal inundation hazard is presented. Future
   coastal inundation is mainly influenced by storm surge and rising sea
   level. The sea level rises projected by the A1FI, A1B and B1 emissions
   scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are
   considered. The effects of economic and population growth are accounted
   for by three urban development scenarios: (a) business as usual, (b)
   urban consolidation and (c) regional development. The adaptation policy
   actions investigated include a `protect' stance (involving the
   construction of seawalls), an `accommodate' stance that mandates raising
   house floors to a certain height (e.g. at heights of 100-year events)
   and an `avoid' stance that limits new developments in hazardous areas.
   Policy stances classified as reactive (i.e. action taken after damage
   being incurred) and anticipatory (i.e. action taken anticipating what
   will happen) are developed for asset investment choices. In general,
   adaptation costs are an order of magnitude lower than benefits gained
   from avoided damages. The results highlight that adaptation action for
   coastal inundation has a no-regrets character and provides a strong case
   for reform to ensure that Australia-wide adaptation opportunities are
   realised.},

   case of Turkey},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {336-362},
Abstract = {Sea level rise is becoming a threat to the coastal areas, and a number
   of coastal cities will face the risk of sea level rise in the near
   future (2050-2100). However, adaptation strategies for coastal areas,
   especially of Turkey, are lacking. This study aims to construct a
   general framework for denoting impacts of sea level rise due to climate
   change in coastal cities and to propose adaptation strategies against
   these effects. It evaluates different aspects and scales, with focus on
   geographical/morphological, administrative and spatial/functional
   aspects and global, regional, national, urban and architectural scales.
   The discussion on the coastal areas is elaborated through the case of
   Turkey. Figured out by the related literature on coastal cities and
   elaborated through the case of Turkey, this comprehensive framework is
   intended to be used also for different coastal cities having a risk of
   sea level rise.},

   infant health in the Tennessee Valley in the 1980s},
Journal = {NATURE ENERGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Fukushima nuclear accident in March 2011 generated deep public
   anxiety and uncertainty about the future of nuclear energy. However,
   differently to fossil fuel plants, nuclear plants produce virtually no
   greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during power generation. Here
   we show the effect on air pollution and infant health in the context of
   the temporary closure of nuclear plants by the Tennessee Valley
   Authority (TVA) in the 1980s. After the Three Mile Island accident in
   1979, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission intensified inspections
   throughout the nation, leading to the shutdown of two large nuclear
   power plants in the TVA area. In response to that shutdown, electricity
   generation shifted one to one to coal-fired power plants within TVA,
   increasing particle pollution in counties where they were located.
   Consequently, infant health may have deteriorated in the most affected
   places, indicating deleterious effects to public health.},

Title = {Forest Management Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Fluxes from Riparian Soils
   Along Headwater Streams},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1810-1822},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs; CO2,
   CH4, N2O) cause climate change. Depending on the conditions, soils have
   the potential to store carbon or to be a source of GHGs to the
   atmosphere. Riparian soils in particular have high potential to store
   carbon, but also to be sources of CH4 and N2O. Headwater streams make up
   a large proportion of stream length in a drainage network, and their
   riparian zones have valuable ecosystem functions. In parallel, the
   riparian zones of headwater streams are particularly vulnerable to
   forest harvest. Studies of GHG fluxes from these unique ecosystems
   remain limited. Our objective was to quantify the effects of forestry
   practices and groundwater discharge (DIS) areas on GHG emissions from
   riparian forest soils in coastal British Columbia. We compared nine
   sites with three different forest management protocols: (1) harvesting
   with a riparian buffer, (2) no buffer, and (3) reference sites without
   harvesting. We measured gas fluxes, soil temperature, soil moisture and
   depth to the groundwater table alongside headwater streams monthly over
   one growing season. We found that CH4 uptake rates were 65\% lower at
   the no buffer sites, and N2O emission rates were 52\% lower at the no
   buffer sites, when compared to the reference sites. Additionally, CH4
   uptake was 54\% lower at DIS areas than in non-DIS areas. The results of
   our research help inform forest management by demonstrating that
   maintaining riparian buffers can be effective in protecting the
   ecosystem functions contributing to soil GHG fluxes.},

Abstract = {Due to the high reliance on fossil fuels in the electricity production
   and transport sectors, completing the energy transition holds a
   particular importance for non-interconnected territories. The
   environmental impacts from electricity generation are mainly imputed to
   fossil fuel based technologies, for instance in the case of French
   insular territories. This paper summarizes the present electricity
   situation in these territories and aims to determine their different
   emissions and environmental impacts through a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) approach. To deliver 1 kWh of electricity to the power grid from
   the studied regions, the electricity mix is defined as the functional
   unit. The results refer to a life cycle cradle-to-gate electricity
   production model. The impact categories discussed in this paper are
   related to global warming potential, acidification potential,
   tropospheric ozone precursor potential, and the cumulative energy used.
   Due to its high share of renewable energies sources, French Guyana has
   the lowest greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions per kilowatt-hour produced
   compared to the other islands (373 g CO2-eq/kWh, 4.29 g SO2-eq/kWh and
   2.65 g NMVOC-eq/kWh). Combined with other social, economic and
   environmental parameters, these results will be also used to determine
   the typologies of islands in order to define a common energy strategy
   for each group. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas, and to a lesser extent
   deforestation, land-cover change, and emissions of halocarbons and other
   greenhouse gases, are rapidly increasing the atmospheric concentrations
   of climate-warming gases. The warming of approximately 0.1-0.2 degrees C
   per decade that has resulted is very likely the primary cause of the
   increasing loss of snow cover and Arctic sea ice, of more frequent
   occurrence of very heavy precipitation, of rising sea level, and of
   shifts in the natural ranges of plants and animals. The global average
   temperature is already approximately 0.8 degrees C above its
   preindustrial level, and present atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases
   will contribute to further warming of 0.5-1 degrees C as equilibrium is
   re-established. Warming has been and will be greater in mid and high
   latitudes compared with low latitudes, over land compared with oceans,
   and at night compared with day. As emissions continue to increase, both
   warming and the commitment to future warming are presently increasing at
   a rate of approximately 0.2 degrees C per decade, with projections that
   the rate of warming will further increase if emission controls are not
   put in place. Such warming and the associated changes are likely to
   result in severe impacts on key societal and environmental support
   systems. Present estimates are that limiting the increase in global
   average surface temperature to no more than 2-2.5 degrees C above its
   1750 value of approximately 15 degrees C will be required to avoid the
   most catastrophic, but certainly not all, consequences of climate
   change. Accomplishing this will require reducing emissions sharply by
   2050 and to near zero by 2100. This can only be achieved if: (1)
   developed nations move rapidly to demonstrate that a modern society can
   function without reliance on technologies that release carbon dioxide
   (CO2) and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases to the atmosphere; and (2) if
   developing nations act in the near-term to sharply limit their non-CO2
   emissions while minimizing growth in CO2 emissions, and then in the
   long-term join with the developed nations to reduce all emissions as
   cost-effective technologies are developed.},

Abstract = {Past and present climate has shaped the valued ecosystems currently
   protected in parks and reserves, but future climate change will redefine
   these conditions. Continued conservation as climate changes will require
   thinking differently about resource management than we have in the past;
   we present some logical steps and tools for doing so. Three critical
   tenets underpin future management plans and activities: (1) climate
   patterns of the past will not be the climate patterns of the future; (2)
   climate defines the environment and influences future trajectories of
   the distributions of species and their habitats; (3) specific management
   actions may help increase the resilience of some natural resources, but
   fundamental changes in species and their environment may be inevitable.
   Science-based management will be necessary because past experience may
   not serve as a guide for novel future conditions. Identifying resources
   and processes at risk, defining thresholds and reference conditions, and
   establishing monitoring and assessment programs are among the types of
   scientific practices needed to support a broadened portfolio of
   management activities. In addition to the control and hedging management
   strategies commonly in use today, we recommend adaptive management
   wherever possible. Adaptive management increases our ability to address
   the multiple scales at which species and processes function, and
   increases the speed of knowledge transfer among scientists and managers.
   Scenario planning provides a broad forward-thinking framework from which
   the most appropriate management tools can be chosen. The scope of
   climate change effects will require a shared vision among regional
   partners. Preparing for and adapting to climate change is as much a
   cultural and intellectual challenge as an ecological challenge.},

Title = {Ocean iron fertilization in the context of the Kyoto protocol and the

Abstract = {Ocean iron fertilization is currently discussed as a potential measure
   to mitigate climate change by enhancing oceanic CO2 uptake. Its
   mitigation potential is not yet well explored, and carbon offsets
   generated through iron fertilization activities could currently not be
   traded on regulated carbon markets. Still, commercial interests in ocean
   iron fertilization already exist, which underlines the need to
   investigate a possible regulatory framework for it. To this end, I first
   discuss important basic aspects of ocean iron fertilization, namely its
   scientific background, quantitative potential, side effects, and costs.
   In a second step, I review regulatory aspects connected to ocean iron
   fertilization, like its legal status and open access issues. Moreover, I
   analyze how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation
   activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism
   (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization. Main findings are
   that the quantitative potential of ocean iron fertilization is limited,
   that costs are higher than initially hoped, and that potential adverse
   side effects are severe. Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron
   fertilization is currently not well defined, open access might cause
   inefficiencies, and the CDM regulations could not be easily applied to
   ocean iron fertilization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of Pneumatophore Density on Methane Emissions in Mangroves},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mangroves play an important role in carbon sequestration. However,
   mangroves can be sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this
   study, methane (CH4) emissions and related soil properties were
   determined in multiple mangroves in Taiwan, including Kandelia obovata
   and Avicennia marina mangroves. K. obovata possess prop roots, whereas
   pneumatophores are found in A. marina. Our results showed that mangrove
   soils were significant sources of CH4 emissions, which should be
   accounted for in mangrove carbon budgets. In particular, CH4 emissions
   in the A. marina mangroves were approximately 50- to 100-fold those of
   the K. obovata mangroves and the adjoining mudflats. Multiple regression
   analyses indicated that the soil salinity and pH in K. obovata mangroves
   and the soil redox potential and organic content in the mudflats were
   the key factors affecting CH4 emissions. However, the pneumatophore
   density alone explained approximately 48\% of the variation in CH4
   emissions in the A. marina mangroves. More pneumatophores resulted in
   higher CH4 emissions in the A. marina mangroves. Thus, compared with the
   assessed soil properties, the contribution of pneumatophores to the
   transportation of CH4 from soil was more significant. In addition to
   soil properties, our results demonstrated that the root structure may
   also affect GHG emissions from mangroves.},

Abstract = {Taiwan has not been able to join the existing global climate regime
   because of its ambiguous international status. The Kyoto Protocol and
   the restrictive accession rules of the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) preclude Taiwan's membership. The
   government of Taiwan is preparing to join the post-2012 multilateral
   climate regime by building its capacity to regulate greenhouse gases and
   by setting reduction targets. Taiwan currently contributes about 1\% of
   the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the world. It has
   its share of responsibility in global warming and should be included as
   part of the solution. Taiwan's participation in the World Health
   Assembly in 2009 suggests that the People's Republic of China might be
   willing to accept Taiwan's participation in international treaties as
   long as membership does not imply statehood. If the post-2012
   architecture is designed with flexible accession rules, Taiwan might be
   able to join despite the unresolved political issues regarding its
   statehood. The accession rules of the World Trade Organization and the
   Convention for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish
   Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean may provide useful
   precedents on how to design such flexibility.},

Abstract = {The popular picture of the greenhouse effect emphasises the radiation
   transfer but fails to explain the observed climate change. An old
   conceptual model for the greenhouse effect is revisited and presented as
   a useful resource in climate change communication. It is validated
   against state-of-the-art data, and nontraditional diagnostics show a
   physically consistent picture. The earth's climate is constrained by
   well-known and elementary physical principles, such as energy balance,
   flow, and conservation. Greenhouse gases affect the atmospheric optical
   depth for infrared radiation, and increased opacity implies higher
   altitude from which earth's equivalent bulk heat loss takes place. Such
   an increase is seen in the reanalyses, and the outgoing long-wave
   radiation has become more diffuse over time, consistent with an
   increased influence of greenhouse gases on the vertical energy flow from
   the surface to the top of the atmosphere. The reanalyses further imply
   increases in the overturning in the troposphere, consistent with a
   constant and continuous vertical energy flow. The increased overturning
   can explain a slowdown in the global warming, and the association
   between these aspects can be interpreted as an entanglement between the
   greenhouse effect and the hydrological cycle, where reduced energy
   transfer associated with increased opacity is compensated by
   tropospheric overturning activity.},

Title = {Designing Coastal Adaptation Strategies to Tackle Sea Level Rise},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Faced with sea level rise and the intensification of extreme events,
   human populations living on the coasts are developing responses to
   address local situations. A synthesis of the literature on responses to
   coastal adaptation allows us to highlight different adaptation
   strategies. Here, we analyze these strategies according to the
   complexity of their implementation, both institutionally and
   technically. First, we distinguish two opposing paradigms - fighting
   against rising sea levels or adapting to new climatic conditions; and
   second, we observe the level of integrated management of the strategies.
   This typology allows a distinction between four archetypes with the most
   commonly associated governance modalities for each. We then underline
   the need for hybrid approaches and adaptation trajectories over time to
   take into account local socio-cultural, geographical, and climatic
   conditions as well as to integrate stakeholders in the design and
   implementation of responses. We show that dynamic and participatory
   policies can foster collective learning processes and enable the
   evolution of social values and behaviors. Finally, adaptation policies
   rely on knowledge and participatory engagement, multi-scalar governance,
   policy monitoring, and territorial solidarity. These conditions are
   especially relevant for densely populated areas that will be confronted
   with sea level rise, thus for coastal cities in particular.},

Title = {Impact of an extreme monsoon on CO2 and CH4 fluxes from mangrove soils
   of the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {760},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems can be both significant sources and sinks of
   greenhouse gases (GHGs). Understanding variability in flux and the key
   factors controlling emissions in these ecosystems are therefore
   important in the context of accounting for GHG emissions. The current
   study is the first to quantify GHG emissions using static chamber
   measurements from soils in disused aquaculture ponds, planted mangroves,
   and mature mangroves from the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar. Soil
   properties, biomass and estimated net primary productivity were also
   assessed. Field assessmentswere conducted at the same sites during
   themiddle of the dry season in February and end of the wet season in
   October 2019. Rates of soil CO2 efflux were among the highest yet
   recorded from mangrove ecosystems, with CO2 efflux from the 8 year old
   site reaching 86.8 +/- 17Mg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) during February, an
   average of 862\% more than all other sites assessed during this period.
   In October, all sites had significant rates of soil CO2 efflux, with
   rates ranging from 31.9 +/- 4.4 Mg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) in a disused pond
   to 118.9 +/- 24.3 Mg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 8 year old site. High soil
   CO2 efflux from the 8 year old site in February is most likely
   attributable to high rates of primary production and belowground carbon
   allocation. Elevated CO2 efflux from all sites during October was likely
   associated with the extreme 2019 South Asian monsoon season which
   lowered soil pore salinity and deposited new alluvium, stimulating both
   autotrophic and heterotrophic activity. Methane efflux increased
   significantly (50-400\%) during the wet season from all sites with
   mangrove cover, although was a small overall component of soil GHG
   effluxes during both measurement periods. Our results highlight the
   critical importance of assessing GHG flux in-situ in order to quantify
   variability in carbon dynamics over time. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Deconstructing vulnerability and adaptation in a coastal river basin
   ecosystem: a participatory analysis of flood risk in Nadi, Fiji Islands},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {256-269},
Abstract = {Despite the growing discussion on vulnerability and adaptation in urban
   areas, there is limited research on how smaller towns and cities in
   Small Island Developing States are being affected by and responding to
   climate change impacts. This study uses fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM),
   field visits and semi-structured interviews with 40 stakeholders across
   6 different stakeholder groups in the Nadi River Basin, Fiji Islands to
   identify, analyse and deconstruct climate change vulnerability and
   adaptation options to manage increasing flood risks. The research
   evidence suggests that vulnerability to floods in the basin is on the
   rise due to a complex mesh of three intersecting factors. Firstly,
   non-climatic pressures such as development, drainage, social change,
   agriculture, tourism growth and deforestation combine, juxtapose and
   interact in a rather unique way with global climate variability
   (interdependent systems) to increase the stress on the river and coastal
   ecosystems. Secondly, the most vulnerable or at-risk populations like
   the farmers, squatter households and in particular women within the
   community have weak coping capacity due to a combination of demographic
   and social characteristics. Thirdly, vulnerability is on the rise due to
   climate factors as well as the flurry of unplanned development,
   redevelopment and degradation of catchment resources. The research
   findings have implications for adaptation policies. In particular, the
   basin stakeholders should integrate climate change within sectorial
   planning processes, actively engage the vulnerable groups, promote
   knowledge, awareness and social learning, and invest in adaptive
   management across all levels of decision-making. Structural policy
   changes to land-use planning and insurance financing schemes are also
   necessary to address growing risks. These have the potential to enhance
   local capacities of communities to adapt to climate-induced floods and
   improve ecosystem integrity for resilience building.},

Title = {Vulnerability to coastal erosion in The Gambia: Empirical experience
   from Gunjur},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion is a major challenge along the coast of The Gambia
   besides the increasing pressure from climate change. This poses
   tremendous influences on physical and the socio-economic vulnerability
   of the coastal communities, in the form of negative impacts on lives and
   livelihoods. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the vulnerability
   of households to the impacts of coastal erosion. As a result, this study
   focused on the assessment and mapping of the social vulnerability of
   households to coastal erosion in Gunjur village. An interdisciplinary
   and mixed-method approaches were used in the study. The MOVE
   system-thinking framework was used to develop and select social
   vulnerability indicators. Geographic Information Systems technique was
   employed in data integration and mapping of the vulnerability of
   households. The outcome of the study revealed that 90\% of the
   households were highly vulnerable to coastal erosion, however, women
   were perceived to be relatively more vulnerable. The study found high
   levels of exposure and susceptibility of the households to coastal
   erosion, given the limited adaptation capacity. It was found that 74\%
   of the households do not have sustainable adaptation strategies to the
   impacts of coastal erosion. Integrating coastal protection measures into
   climate change adaptation and mitigation policy framework was a key
   recommendation towards reducing the impacts of human factors on coastal
   erosion. Alternative sources of livelihoods and mind building are
   required to build the resilience of households and enhance human
   security in the coastal communities of The Gambia.},

Abstract = {While the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, provides guidelines
   for flood risk management, it is local governments' responsibility to
   delineate their own flood vulnerability, assess their risk, and
   integrate these with planning policies to implement adaptive action.
   However, barriers such as the lack of locally specific data and public
   perceptions about adaptation options mean that local governments must
   address the need for adaptation planning within a context of scientific
   uncertainty, while building public support for difficult choices on
   flood-related climate policy and action. This research demonstrates a
   process to model, visualize and evaluate potential flood impacts and
   adaptation options for the community of Delta, in Metro Vancouver,
   across economic, social and environmental perspectives. Visualizations
   in 2D and 3D, based on hydrological modeling of breach events for
   existing dike infrastructure, future sea level rise and storm surges,
   are generated collaboratively, together with future adaptation scenarios
   assessed against quantitative and qualitative indicators. This
   `visioning package' is being used with staff and a citizens' Working
   Group to assess the performance, policy implications and social
   acceptability of the adaptation strategies. Recommendations based on the
   experience of the initiative are provided that can facilitate
   sustainable future adaptation actions and decision-making in Delta and

Abstract = {Adaptation is a key strategy to reduce the severe impacts of climate
   change on the fishery. Adaptation strategies are unlikely to be
   effective without an understanding of the fishermen's perception on
   climate change. This paper explores fishermen's knowledge on climate
   change perceptions and their climate change adaptation in response to
   the perceived impacts of climate change. A survey by interviewing
   randomly selected 90 marine capture fishermen was conducted in Bengkulu
   from March to June 2018. The results indicate that most fishermen
   understand climate change as a change of east and west monsoon that
   directly affect their fishing activities. In terms of climate change
   defined as a continuous change of temperature, humidity, and rainfall,
   most fishermen have no sufficient knowledge on climate change. The
   important adaptation strategies include diversification of household
   economic activities, augmenting of fishing gear, change the fishing
   ground, mobilization of family members to work, and fishing time
   adjustment.},

Title = {Building climate change resilience through bottom-up adaptation to flood
   risk in Warri, Nigeria},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {139-160},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The problem of flooding in Warri, Nigeria is as old as the city itself.
   What has changed in recent years is the rapidly increasing magnitude and
   frequency of floodwater retention pools on urban streets as urban
   development expanded into low-lying swamplands within the city. Through
   the process of community urban risk assessments, urban flood zone
   occupants acknowledge the growing problem of on-street flood retention
   pools in a city once dominated by problems with off-street flood
   retention pools. A factor analysis of the perceived causes of flooding
   shows that Warri residents believe that human activities that reduced
   the floodwater storage capacity of its natural drainage sinks (i.e., its
   swamplands), violated building codes, changed local water levels,
   altered low-lying mangrove swamp terrain, and eliminated drainage
   facilities are responsible for the increasing retention of floodwater
   pools on city streets in the last few decades. Such local stock of flood
   knowledge has implications for a local participatory approach to
   community adaptations and mitigation methods to reduce urban flood risks
   from climate change and uncontrolled urban expansion. Local community
   adaptation choices guide how flood-affected residents cope with urban
   floods, especially how they use and alter their living space and respond
   to emergencies. However, such community views are often ignored by
   experts seeking solutions to flooding. If the views of flood zone
   occupants begin to inform flood adaptation choices, proposed solutions
   to flooding problems would be more likely to receive local support and
   acceptance, thus making the bottom-up solutions developed in this paper
   easier to implement and sustain. Once a well-formulated grassroots
   adaptation strategy for urban flood risk management for resiliency
   becomes the base for action, a more resilient national policy is sure to
   succeed, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries
   where informal settlement is the case and the role of government in
   flood management is still minimal.},

Title = {Building Community Resilience to Disasters: A Review of Interventions to
   Improve and Measure Public Health Outcomes in the Northeastern United

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Climate change-related natural disasters, including wildfires and
   extreme weather events, such as intense storms, floods, and heatwaves,
   are increasing in frequency and intensity. These events are already
   profoundly affecting human health in the United States and globally,
   challenging the ability of communities to prepare, respond, and recover.
   The purpose of this research was to examine the peer-reviewed literature
   on community resilience initiatives in one of the most densely populated
   and economically important regions, the Northeastern United States, and
   to identify evidence-based interventions and metrics that had been
   field-tested and evaluated. This paper addresses two critical gaps in
   the literature: (1) what strategies or interventions have been
   implemented to build or enhance community resilience against climate
   change-related natural disasters; and (2) what metrics were used to
   measure community resilience as an outcome of those strategies or
   interventions? This review provides a succinct list of effective
   interventions with specific health outcomes. Community or state-level
   health officials can use the results to prioritize public health
   interventions. This review used existing database search tools to
   discover 205 studies related to community resilience and health
   outcomes. Methods set criteria to assess if interventions were able to
   measure and change levels of community resilience to the health impacts
   associated with a changing climate. Criteria included: (a) alignment
   with the United States' National Preparedness Goal for reducing risks to
   human health and for recovering quickly from disasters; (b) derived from
   publicly available data sources; (c) developed for use by communities at
   a local scale; and (d) accessible to modestly resourced municipalities
   and county health agencies. Five (5) peer-reviewed, evidence-based
   studies met all of the selection criteria. Three of these articles
   described intervention frameworks and two reported on the use of
   standardized tools. Health-related outcomes included mental health
   impacts (PTSD/depression), mental stress, emergency preparedness
   knowledge, social capital skills, and emergency planning skills. The
   paper recommends the COAST project, COPEWELL Rubric for self-assessment,
   and Ready CDC intervention as examples of strategies that could be
   adapted by any community engaged in building community resilience.},

Title = {Deploying Spatial Data for Coastal Community Resilience: A Review from
   the Managerial Perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The use of spatial data for coastal community resilience applications
   has diversified as a consequence of the increasing availability of data,
   and extensive development in data processing. However, the true value of
   spatial data is not fully exploited as a result of lacking scientific
   managerial models that incorporate spatial data into decision-making.
   This article synthesizes the cross-disciplinary literature review on
   deploying spatial data for coastal community resilience from the
   managerial perspective. It systematically reviews research addressing
   the topic of deploying spatial data for coastal resilience operations
   from the earliest available to 1999. The review uses 142 studies to
   address three research questions: (1) What kind of data can be obtained
   for coastal resilience situational awareness? (2) What outcomes have
   spatial data attributed to coastal resilience applications? and (3) What
   are the missing pieces (gaps) in connecting the spatial data with
   coastal resilience applications? In addressing these research questions,
   the authors review articles based on three dimensions including the
   availability of spatial data, the availability of applications, and
   limitations. Based on the findings of the analysis, the authors conclude
   that the managerial perspective of deploying spatial data in coastal
   hazards are understudies, and outline problem formulation, mission
   prioritization, and information salience as an agenda for future
   research.},

Abstract = {Arctic amplification (AA)-the greater warming of the Arctic near-surface
   temperature relative to its global mean value-is a prominent feature of
   the climate response to increasing greenhouse gases. Recent work has
   revealed the importance of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in
   contributing to Arctic warming and sea-ice loss. Here, using ensembles
   of climate model integrations, we expand on that work and directly
   contrast Arctic warming from ODS to that from carbon dioxide (CO2), over
   the 1955-2005 period when ODS loading peaked. We find that the Arctic
   warming and sea-ice loss from ODS are slightly more than half
   (52\%-59\%) those from CO2. We further show that the strength of AA for
   ODS is 1.44 times larger than that for CO2, and that this mainly stems
   from more positive Planck, albedo, lapse-rate, and cloud feedbacks. Our
   results suggest that AA would be considerably stronger than presently
   observed had the Montreal Protocol not been signed.},

Title = {Quantifying the geomorphologic and urbanization influence on coastal
   retreat under sea level rise},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {230},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {In response to increasing greenhouse gases emissions, the global climate
   is undoubtedly changing. As a consequence of rising temperatures, mean
   sea level also shows an increasing tendency globally, still,
   uncertainties in relation to its regional specific trends can be
   identified. Besides that, uncertainties also remain regarding regional
   and local coastal response to sea level rise. Coastal geomorphology
   (topography, bathymetry, and sediment texture) plays a relevant role,
   especially in defining how sediment exchanges occur in the active zone,
   thus inducing different morphodynamic readjustments. In this context,
   this study is focused on projecting the future coastline position for
   the years 2040 and 2100 along three sectors at Hennenegildo Beach, and
   on investigating the influence of site-specific geomorphological
   characteristics, urbanization and the presence of hard coastal
   protection structures on the coastal response under accelerated rates of
   sea level rise using a stochastic morphokinematic model, the Random
   Shoreface Translation Model. Model outputs as coastal recession
   distances were submitted to a Kruskal-Wallis test to verify if there
   were significant differences in coastal recession 1) amongst the three
   sectors (standard own topography and bathymetry); 2) due to changes in
   dune topography only; and 3) due to the presence or absence of hard
   coastal protection structures at the urbanized sector. Overall, the
   results indicate that the urbanized area presented the highest recession
   distance amongst the sectors. Differences in dune heights between the
   northern and southern dune field sectors at Hermenegildo Beach do not
   significantly influence the mean coastal retreat. On analyzing mean
   coastal recession results for the urbanized sector, with and without
   hard coastal protection structures, we conclude that the presence of
   urbanization and hard structures on the active dune and beach
   contributed to a maximum increase of 13.52\% in mean coastal recession
   distance and that it significantly (P < 0.01) affects coastline
   recession in comparison to that in the case of a non-structured dune
   field for both the time horizons considered (2040, 2100). The results
   presented here provide a basis for future planning and management at the
   area, pointing out to the increased erosion risk caused by the existence
   of an artificially structured shoreline.},

Abstract = {The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) published in 2007 presents the
   most complete and authoritative assessment of the status of scientific
   knowledge on all aspects of climate change. This paper presents an
   updated assessment of the risks from anthropogenic climate change, based
   on a comprehensive review of the pertinent scientific literature
   published since finalisation of the AR4. Many risks are now assessed as
   stronger than in the AR4, including the risk of large sea-level rise
   already in the current century, the amplification of global warming due
   to biological and geological carbon-cycle feedbacks, a large magnitude
   of ``committed warming{''} currently concealed by a strong aerosol mask,
   substantial increases in climate variability and extreme weather events,
   and the risks to marine ecosystems from climate change and ocean
   acidification. Some topics remain the subject of intense scientific
   debate, such as past and future changes in tropical cyclone activity and
   the risk of large-scale Amazon forest dieback. The rise in greenhouse
   gas emissions and concentrations has accelerated recently, and it is
   expected to accelerate further in the absence of targeted policy
   interventions. Taken together, these findings point to an increased
   urgency of implementing mitigation policies as well as comprehensive and
   equitable adaptation policies.},

Abstract = {This article describes a climate change adaptation planning process
   triggered by a group of researchers and stakeholders in a context where
   no collective responses or long-term plans for protecting a vulnerable
   coastal system had been initiated, despite local perceptions of
   vulnerability and risk. The case study shows the application of two
   methods: scenario workshops and adaptation pathways in the context of a
   participatory action research methodological design. Participatory
   action research and qualitative scenario methods are highlighted as
   accelerators of climate change adaptation processes by calling to
   action, facilitating and connecting diverse social groups with a stake
   in a long-term plan towards a more adapted society. The experience leads
   to the conclusion that planning climate change adaptation has to go far
   beyond the technical dimension and take into account those affected (in
   the present and the future) by decisions made. A holistic approach to
   climate change adaptation planning will depend on the interrelations of
   managerial and top-down approaches with localized initiatives driven
   through an inclusive and collective action research process.},

Abstract = {Geological storage of carbon dioxide represents a viable solution to
   reduce the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Romania has initiatives
   to build a large-scale integrated CO2 capture and storage demonstration

   These simulators are required to be capable to represent the complex
   thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical and biological phenomena accompanying
   the geological CO2 storage such as, multi-phase flow, compositional
   effects due to dissolution of CO2 into the brine, non-isothermal effects
   due to cold CO2 injection, geomechanical effects, mineralization at the
   reservoir-scale. These processes can be simulated accurately and
   efficiently with DuMu(x) (www.dumux.org), a free-and open-source

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Climate change is among the greatest environmental threats facing the
   globe today and the abatement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is
   concerning all the industrial sectors contributing to the problem. The
   maritime transport sector has already implemented several measures for
   energy efficiency for the reduction of its GHG emissions, including both
   vessels and ports. This paper focuses on the prospects and challenges
   facing the development of a port energy management system. It analyzes
   the main factors which exert an impact on such a plan and that need to
   be taken into account for its successful implementation. A SWOT/PESTLE
   analysis is utilized for the identification of the political, economic,
   social, technological, legal and environmental factors that have a
   positive or negative effect on the adoption and successful
   implementation of a port energy management system. This analysis is
   based on empirical data from two leading North-European port
   authorities. Given the fact that ports are currently focusing on the
   reduction of their energy consumption, this paper's results have
   particular significance in that they could enlighten and inform the
   adoption of a port energy management plan within ports.},

Abstract = {Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) constitute an important migratory
   species that contributes significantly to the economy and the global
   fishery industry. Skipjack tuna play a vital role in the marine
   ecosystem, particularly in tropical waters of the western and central
   Pacific Ocean (WCPO). However, climate change may affect the
   characteristics of fishery resources, leading to substantial
   reallocation and reduction of the biomass of this species in the WCPO.
   In this study, catch and effort data for skipjack tuna were collected
   from a purse seine fishery and subsequently analyzed in combination with
   remote-sensing environmental variables and simulation data from climate
   models under various scenarios. Generalized additive models were
   developed to examine the relationships between environmental variations
   and the species' catch per unit effort and thus evaluate the potential
   effects of climate change. The catch potential of this stock was
   estimated under various greenhouse gas emission scenarios (2015-2050)
   currently under consideration by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC). The highest catch potential was associated with the
   highest greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the catch potential remained
   relatively stable under the scenario with lower emissions. To
   sustainably utilize skipjack tuna as a resource, the impact of climate
   change on the stock under various global warming scenarios should be
   considered in the assessment and management of fisheries for this
   species.},

Abstract = {There has not been a nuclear power plant licensed since 1979 due to the
   radioactive releases at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant and an
   accident at Chrenoble. The public and federal government opinion
   regarding nuclear power has since changed because the nuclear power
   plants are operating with unprecedented reliability and economy. Nuclear
   has again become the focus of attention as the natural gas prices
   increase coupled with capacity shortages in California in 2000-2001.
   Sulfur dioxide produced by burning coal causes acid rain. Green house
   gases such as carbon dioxide and five others come from burning fossil
   fuel in the power plants. The. amount of heat trapping carbon dioxide in
   the atmosphere causes global warming and serious disruptions to
   agriculture and other ecosystems. In December 1997, delegates from 159
   countries gathered in Kyoto, Japan, and adopted a treaty that could
   limit the greenhouse gases. In order to reduce the greenhouse gases, the
   accord encouraged the fossil fuel dependent countries to develop
   renewable and alternative technologies. Nuclear power is an alternative
   technology. With the modular type construction, standardization, and
   one-step approval, the nuclear power can be revived. The new reactors
   are safer and more efficient than plants built in the past. Nuclear
   energy is clean, affordable and reliable and offers a potential and
   promise for this country and the rest of the world. The paper discusses
   different ways of reviving nuclear powers(1).},

Title = {Comparisons of two methods of removing anthropogenically related

Abstract = {Assessments of the veracity of model-generated variability are difficult
   because variability in observed climate data during the 20th century is
   composed of natural and anthropogenic (greenhouse gas and sulfate
   aerosol) factors in addition to internal climate fluctuations.
   Comparisons should be improved if some of these factors could either be
   extracted from real world data or additions be made to model-generated
   variability. Both options involve several assumptions, the most
   important of which is that the climate system is linear to a first
   approximation. We discuss this and other assumptions and present results
   from two different methods of removing variability related to
   anthropogenic factors using energy balance models (EBMs) and
   atmosphere/ocean general circulation models (A/OGCMs). At a global
   scale, the pattern of the trend of surface temperature over the
   1966-1995 period, after removing the anthropogenic effect, shows some
   strong similarities between the two methods, with the strongest residual
   warming evident over much of northern Asia and northern North America.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal quantification of resilience at the community scale},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {95-107},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Indicators of natural disaster resilience are factors that impact the
   ability to cope with and adapt to a natural disaster and climate change
   events. They can either contribute to or detract from resilience.
   Existing research has emphasized the importance of quantifying
   resilience in order to estimate baseline resilience and measure progress
   toward resilience enhancement. Previous attempts at quantification of
   resilience have not incorporated place-specific indicators or
   differential weighting of indicators for prioritization of resilience
   enhancement actions. Previous research efforts have also not
   incorporated spatial and temporal contexts when attempting to quantify
   resilience indicators. This research demonstrates the importance for
   quantifying resilience place-specific indicators, differential weighting
   of indicators, and the spatial and temporal contexts of indicators for
   resilience estimation and quantification through a case study of
   Sarasota County, Florida. This case study was conducted in four phases:
   preliminary interviews, plan review, focus group, and spatial analysis.
   Preliminary interviews were intended to contribute to development of
   research goals. The plan review process served to identify Sarasota
   County's planning priorities to determine possible indicators of
   resilience unique to Sarasota County as well as existing and planned
   county hazard mitigation strategies. The focus group was concerned with
   identifying resilience indicators through a workshop with officials from
   Sarasota County. The spatial analysis portion used findings from all
   three previous phases to demonstrate spatial patterns of resilience.
   This research demonstrates that although national resilience
   quantification metrics are useful, local scale resilience estimates
   appear more useful if community hazard mitigation and climate change
   adaptation is the primary goal. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Evaluating the environmental impacts of bio-hydrogenated diesel
   production from palm oil and fatty acid methyl ester through life cycle

Abstract = {Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) produced from two different raw materials
   palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester-was compared
   in terms of environmental impacts using the life cycle assessment (LCA)
   technique with the SimaPro 7.3 software. The energy consumption,
   greenhouse gas emission, and environmental impacts reported in unit
   points (Pt.) were assessed using the Eco-indicator 95, IPCC 2007, and
   CML 2 Baseline 2000 methodologies, respectively. The functional unit was
   1 kg of biofuel product. The system boundary defined included three main
   processes in the bio-hydrogenated diesel production phase catalytic
   hydroprocessing, separation, and upgrading. The results indicated that
   the energy consumption of bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm
   oil fatty acid distillate was 1.26 times (or 9.69 x 10(-3) MJ higher)
   that of the bio-hydrogenated diesel production from fatty acid methyl
   ester. On the other hand, the greenhouse gas emission from
   bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate
   was 2.29 times lower than that from fatty acid methyl ester due to the
   palm trees absorption of CO2 for photosynthesis being greater than the
   amount released into the atmosphere during the oil palm cultivation
   stage. The major contributor was crude palm oil as a feedstock to
   produce either palm oil fatty acid distillate (physical refining) or
   fatty acid methyl ester (transesterification), which were about 93\% and
   84\% of the total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission,
   respectively. The results of environmental impacts showed that the
   bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate
   was 1.37 times (2.05 x 10(-12) Pt) greater than that from fatty acid
   methyl ester. Consumption of palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty
   acid methyl ester in both processes made the largest contribution to
   most environmental impacts (99\% of the total impact score was from both
   processes). The main impacts of both bio-hydrogenated diesel production
   from palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester were the
   terrestrial ecotoxicity potential, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity
   potential, and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential. An essential factor
   which caused these impacts was the use of crude palm oil during the
   production of palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl
   ester. Therefore, fatty acid methyl ester was found to be a suitable raw
   material for biohydrogenated diesel production based on the economic
   evaluation and the lower environmental impacts during the production
   stage. This present work highlights the benefit of by-products as
   feedstock for alternative fuel production in order to increase the
   by-product marketing value. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The global population during the last 100 years has increased from 2 to
   7.7 billion, causing an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
   In order to see how population increase is directly related to physical
   variables of the climate, this Perspective article places observations
   and scenarios of climate change into context and puts forth a
   statistical modeling study on how the sensitive Arctic climate responds
   to the increasing population. The relationships between population,
   Arctic sea-ice extent (SIE), and surface air temperature (SAT) are very
   strong, with the increasing population explaining 96\% of the decreasing
   SIE and about 80\% of the increasing SAT in the Arctic. Our projection
   for the SIE using the population as a ``proxy predictor{''} for a
   projected population of 10 billion people on the Earth in 2100, yields a
   SIE of 9.30 and 8.21 million km 2 for a linear and squared relationship,
   respectively, indicating no ``tipping point{''} for the annual ice
   extent in this century. This adds another dimension to climate
   understanding for the public at large using population as a proxy
   variable, instead of the more abstract CO2 parameter. This also
   indicates that it is important to attempt to limit the ongoing increase
   in population, which is the main cause of the greenhouse gas emissions,
   in addition to reducing per capita emissions by an exponential increase
   in implementing renewable energy, a formidable challenge in this
   century.},

Abstract = {A large number of coastal structures have been constructed along the
   Indian coast for ports, harbors, shore protection, houses, industries
   etc for various human requirements, which are often found to result in
   major erosion/accretion issues along the coast making them
   counter-productive to the objective of coastal protection. Erosion
   results in loss of valuable land and property while accretion results in
   closure of river mouths resulting in floods in the upstream locations
   due to negligible exchange with the seawater. This is largely due to
   inadequate understanding of the morphological changes along the coast
   and shoreline response to introduction of structures and / or natural
   changes. More often coastal protection structures are built as an
   emergency response to shoreline changes from human and / or natural
   impacts which result in aggravating the situation. Detailed analysis of
   shoreline response several times indicate that a `Non-interference'
   might have been a better solution.
   It is therefore essential to design and develop, site specific coastal
   and estuarine infrastructure using the state-of-the-art analysis tools
   available for sustainable and effective performance. This study proposes
   to include the impact of coastal structures on the shoreline morphology
   through proven scientific techniques and identification of
   environmentally sustainable mitigation measures / resilient solutions.
   For meeting this objective, it is essential to create a database of
   morphological changes along the coastline of India based on NIOT's long
   term experience in coastal engineering. This data base shall enable the
   planning and design of sustainable infrastructure and shore protection
   schemes based on secondary and field data.
   In this paper two case studies along the Indian coast are discussed.
   From the analysis of historical data on the behavior of shorelines, it
   has been possible to evaluate the root cause of erosion/accretion. This
   is followed by use of numerical models for prediction of response
   considering site specific issues. The development of database of
   shoreline changes and the response of shoreline to various manmade /
   natural changes (ShoRES) enables incorporation of resilience in the
   mitigation measures thereby enabling creation of solutions that are
   sustainable.},

Title = {N2O fluxes from the littoral zone of a Chinese reservoir},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Pages = {4711-4723},
Abstract = {There have been few studies of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs,
   despite the remarkable growth in the number of reservoirs in developing
   countries. We report a case study that focuses on the littoral zone of a
   major Chinese reservoir, where we established measurements of N2O fluxes
   using the static chamber technique at five different water levels (deep
   water, shallow water, seasonally flooded, control for seasonally
   flooded, and non-flooded). The ``control for seasonal flooded{''} had
   similar vegetation to the ``seasonally flooded{''} but was not actually
   flooded as it was on a higher piece of land. Seasonal, diurnal and
   spatial variations of N2O flux and environmental factors were monitored
   throughout the growing season which included a flood event during summer
   rains. The N2O flux ranged from 136.6 to 381.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1)
   averaging 6.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1). Seasonal and spatial variation was
   significant but diurnal variation was not. Non-flooded dry land emitted
   more N2O than flooded land, no matter whether it was permanently or
   seasonally flooded. Piecewise correlation was found between N2O flux,
   air temperature and soil nitrate concentration. Positive correlation was
   shown between N2O flux and dissolved oxygen in water. There were
   significantly higher emissions from farmland. We compared these results
   with our recently published study of CH4 emissions, carried out
   simultaneously at the same site as those in the present study.
   Completely different patterns between the two gases are demonstrated. We
   conclude that the littoral zone is a hotspot for N2O emissions in the
   summer, especially when the shores of the lake are used for the farming
   of maize. But in terms of the overall greenhouse gas budget, the fluxes
   of N2O are not as important as those of CH4.},

   emissions-based transport chain comparisons have estimated high levels
   of nitrogen and sulfur oxide emissions in maritime transportation,
   decreasing its competitiveness. However, the consequences of regulatory
   and technological developments and the integration of maritime transport
   in intermodal transport chains have not yet been considered in detail.
   In order to address this research gap, a numerical model for computing
   emissions from different transport modes in an intermodal transport
   network, under the effect of these developments, is presented that is
   based on bottom-up emission factors that depend on the fuel type, engine
   type, and operational profile of each vehicle. Different emissions
   scenarios are chosen for specific unimodal and intermodal routes (short
   sea shipping-based) between Portugal and northwestern Europe.
   Conclusions are drawn on estimated values of air pollutant emissions and
   greenhouse emissions, in CO2-eq per unit of cargo, in each scenario.
   These results allow the identification of the most environmentally
   friendly transport chains, thus supporting the development of adequate
   transport policies.},

Abstract = {Pipeline transportation of carbon dioxide (CO2) dates back to the early
   1970's with the construction of the Canyon Reef Carriers \& Val Verde
   pipeline in Texas USA. Since that time about 7200 kilometers of CO2
   pipeline have been built in North America (mostly in the USA), some in
   Asia (Turkey) and Africa and one offshore Europe. The experience of such
   pipelines is predominantly for the transportation of naturally occurring
   and relatively pure CO2 for the purpose of enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
   With international concern over global wanning and concerns over
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, various carbon capture and sequestration
   (CCS) initiatives are becoming viable options for managing manmade
   industrial greenhouse gases, forecasted to rise to about 44,000 million
   metric tonnes by 2030, Mohitpour 2008.
   The impurities can significantly affect the CO2 phase diagram,
   influencing pipeline capacity, fracture control properties and most
   importantly pipeline operation and emergency response related to release
   and dispersion of CO2 and toxic impurities such as H2S. This paper will
   provide a first hand view of salient design features of pipeline
   transportation of CO2 containing impurities typical of those captured
   from flue stacks. It will provide general guidance and a basis for
   design, construction and operation of pipelines transporting CO2 with
   impurities for sequestration and EOR.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal areas globally suffer from serious erosion and sedimentation
   problems. The assessment of coastal erosion risk is fundamental for
   better coastal management. The main goal of the current study was to
   enhance coastal management by identifying the coastal erosion risk and
   suggest possible mitigation measures. The study was developed for the
   Egyptian Northern Coast. MIKE 21 was used to evaluate the erosion and
   test the proposed measures. First, a bathymetric survey of the study
   area was conducted. Then the tidal data, storm surge, and global sea
   rise data were collected. The offshore wave data, shoreline data were
   compiled. And then, the different nearshore wave modeling and wave
   propagation were modeled. The model was calibrated using measured data
   in 2014 and validated using measured data in 2016. Future shoreline
   changes for the years 2029, 2039, and 2049 were depicted. A suitable
   mitigation measure was used and tested for the same years. The groins
   with a specific size and arrangement were tested. The main goal of the
   study is to find a suitable solution to protect the coast and
   investigate its impact on the shoreline in the next 30 years. The
   proposed mitigation measure minimized the coastal erosion of the study
   area rigorously. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on

Title = {Overview of Green Energy as a Real Strategic Option for Sustainable
   Development},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The global renewable energy landscape is changing rapidly. Green
   energies reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diversify the energy supply,
   and lower dependence on volatile and uncertain fossil fuel markets. The
   future looks promising for green energy sources, which are taking on an
   increasingly important role, especially in the current context, as
   governments are trying to identify viable solutions to the energy crisis
   and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Worldwide, there is a growing
   interest in and support for green energy sources, a factor that could
   help accelerate the current energy transition. Despite these positive
   developments, much remains to be done globally to make the energy
   transition a reality. In this respect, the European Union member states
   have committed to a wide neutrality target by establishing an increase
   in the total share of energy from renewable sources to 55\% (by 2030)
   and, at the same time, reducing the net greenhouse gas effect emissions
   by at least 55\% until 2030 to reach the neutrality target by 2050.
   Green energy sources are essential for long-term efforts to mitigate
   climate change and will play an important role in improving energy
   security and accessibility. The efforts of every country to strengthen
   the energy sector through the development of green energies will reduce
   geopolitical risks and disproportionate external costs for society. The
   large-scale use of green energies will contribute to sustainable
   development. The objective of our research is to review the literature
   on green energy in the context of sustainable development by analyzing
   research conducted by various authors and international organizations on
   these topics. The period considered for this study is 2011-2020. Our
   research focused on the EU 27, but the review also took into account the
   results obtained by other countries worldwide, such as China, the USA,
   Norway, and Iceland. The main research method used was the analysis of
   scientific papers, studies developed by international organizations, and
   a wide set of agreements and political commitments assumed by different
   states for developing green energy as a solution for sustainable
   development. The obtained results show an interesting international
   debate about green energies and how they can contribute to sustainable
   development. This paper's results also show that in 2019 at the global
   level, low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power and renewable
   energy, accounted for 15.7\% of primary energy (solar, wind, hydropower,
   bioenergy, geothermal and wave and tidal), while in 2021, for the EU 27,
   the share of energy from renewable sources reached 22\%. According to
   international statistics, more than 90\% of the governments of many
   countries are making investments to efficiently capitalize on green
   energy sources and to design new models of sustainable economic and
   social development, in order to lower pollution levels, reduce the
   dependence on fossil fuel imports and limit the climate change impact.},

Abstract = {Transport processes at gas-liquid interfaces play a central role in many
   industrial and environmental systems. For example, such processes at the
   air-water interface impact evaporation of water from reservoirs, control
   of regional climate, evasion of carbon in tropical river systems, and
   the aeration of hypoxic water, to name a few. There has also been recent
   intense interest in this area associated with the transport of
   greenhouse gases and moisture between the atmosphere and terrestrial
   water bodies. But despite all this activity, recent estimates of oceanic
   carbon dioxide uptake still vary by factors similar to 2. Since carbon
   dioxide is thought to be sequestered in the oceans at a rate equivalent
   to similar to 40\% of its generation rate from man-made sources, such
   uncertainties have obvious policy implications.},

Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Marine ecosystems are a known net source of greenhouse gases emissions
   but the atmospheric gas fluxes, particularly from the mangrove swamps
   occupying inter-tidal zones, are characterized poorly. Spatial and
   seasonal fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from
   soil in Mai Po mangrove swamp in Hong Kong, South China and their
   relationships with soil characteristics were investigated. The N2O
   fluxes averaged from 32.1 to 533.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and the CO2 fluxes
   were between 10.6 and 1374.1 mg m(-2) h(-1). Both N2O and CO2 fluxes in
   this swamp showed large spatial and seasonal variations. The fluxes were
   higher at the landward site than the foreshore bare mudflat, and higher
   fluxes were recorded in warm, rather than cold, seasons. The landward
   site had the highest content of soil organic carbon (DC), total Kjeldahl
   nitrogen (TKN), nitrate (NO3--N) and total phosphorus (TP), while the
   bare mudflat had the highest ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration
   and soil denitrification potential activity. The N2O flux was related,
   positively, to CO2 flux. Soil NO3--N and TP increased N2O flux, while
   soil OC and TP concentrations contributed to the CO2 flux. The results
   indicated that the Mai Po mangrove swamp emitted significant amounts of
   greenhouse gases, and the N2O emission was probably due to soil
   denitrifcation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exploring Pattern of Green Spaces (GSs) and Their Impact on Climatic
   Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies: Evidence from a Saudi
   Arabian City},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Green spaces (GSs) are significant, nature-based solutions to climate
   change and have immense potential to reduce vulnerability to heat waves
   while enhancing the resilience of urban areas in the light of climate
   change. However, in the Saudi context, the availability of GSs across
   cities and their perceived role in climate change mitigations and
   adaptation strategies remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine the
   per capita availability of GSs in the Jeddah megacity in Saudi Arabia,
   and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.
   This study assessed the per capita availability of GS in Jeddah city
   using GIS techniques, and a questionnaire survey (online and an onsite)
   was conducted to assess the GSs users' perception of the role of GSs on
   climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Non-parametric
   tests were also used to find differences in roles based on
   socio-demographic attributes. The findings of the study revealed that:
   (i) the per capita availability of GS in Jeddah is relatively low in
   comparison to international organization recommendations (such as World
   Health Organization and European Union). As per the survey result, it
   was reported that GSs play crucial role for climate change mitigation
   such as temperature regulation, reduction in heat stress, enhancement
   outdoor thermal comfort, and the maintenance of air quality. More than
   85\% of the total respondents agreed with the very high importance of
   GSs for climate change mitigation. More than 80\% of respondents in the
   city highly agreed with climate change adaptation strategies such as the
   enhancement of accessibility to GSs, ecosystem-based protection of GSs,
   and the improvement of per capita availability of GSs. The findings of
   the study will be very helpful to planners and policymakers in
   implementing nature-based solutions to reduce vulnerability to climate
   change in Jeddah city, and particularly other cities in a desert
   environment.},

Title = {System dynamics evaluation of household water use behavior and
   associated greenhouse gas emissions and environmental costs: A case
   study of Taipei city},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Taiwan is an island surrounded by sea and only 19 \% of its freshwater
   usage is for domestic applications. A system dynamic model was developed
   to investigate interactions between household water use behaviors
   (toilet flushing, clothes washing, bathing/showering, and cleaning) and
   associated greenhouse gas emissions and environmental costs. Six hundred
   and fifty face-to-face interviews were conducted in 12 districts of
   Taipei. The results showed that the respondents' individual attributes
   were not significantly related to water use behaviors. The highest
   volume of water was used for cleaning (27.7 \%), followed by clothes
   washing (26.2 \%), bathing/ showering (26.1 \%), and toilet flushing
   (20.0 \%). Five water management scenarios with 5 \%-20 \% reductions in
   water volume from different water use behaviors were simulated. The
   maximum reduction in water use (6.27 t) was found in the fifth scenario
   (20 \% reduction), which reflected the priority the respondents gave to
   save water if its price increased. 27.2 \% of respondents had water
   saving appliances; 20.5 \% and 16.4 \% of the appliances were toilets
   and shower heads, respectively. The environmental cost of GHG emissions
   associated with water use behavior was US\$0.001/t, causing an 8\%
   increase in water price. A better understanding of household water use
   behaviors is needed to develop bottom-up strategies or measures for
   sustainable water management. Water saving measures or strategies would
   lead to targets being met in a short time.},

Title = {Energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions from the use of
   alternative water sources in South East Queensland},
Journal = {WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {281-287},
Abstract = {Between 1999 and 2007, several successive years of severe drought put
   South East Queensland's water supply under immense pressure. The
   decision was taken in 2005 to build a seawater desalination plant and
   three water recycling advanced treatment plants as part of a large
   investment plan to secure the region's potable water supply. The
   infrastructure built and commissioned in the past 3 years has a combined
   capacity producing more than 350,000 m(3) per day of very high quality
   water that can be used either directly (seawater desalination) or
   indirectly (recycled water) for supplying drinking water. All the plants
   primarily rely on reverse osmosis membranes for water purification which
   is an effective and reliable barrier to contaminants, but also requires
   high energy consumption and a high level of pre-treatment and chemicals.
   In this paper, the actual energy consumption of two of the plants (the
   seawater desalination plant and one water recycling plant) was
   investigated with the perspective of drinking water production over the
   July 2009-June 2010 period. Eolia (TM) Potable Water, a Life Cycle
   Analysis tool developed by Veolia Environnement Research \& Innovation,
   was used to model the processes and estimate the greenhouse gases (GHG)
   emissions from both plants. As expected, the energy requirement of the
   desalination was higher (approximately 2.2 times) than the water
   recycling plant. The plants were found to be significantly more energy
   efficient when operated at higher flow. In both cases, the purchase of
   electrical energy represented by far the major contribution to GHG
   emissions. Indirect GHG emissions from chemical consumption could be
   reduced at the water recycling plant by optimising the dose of ferric
   chloride used at the plant and sourcing the chemical from a less distant
   supplier.},

Title = {Variation and Change of Upwelling Dynamics Detected in the World's
   Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {Global increases in temperature are altering land-sea temperature
   gradients. Bakun (1990) hypothesized that changes within these gradients
   will directly affect atmospheric pressure cells associated with the
   development of winds and will consequently impact upwelling patterns
   within ecologically important Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS).
   In this study we used daily time series of NOAA Optimally Interpolated
   sea surface temperature (SST) and ERA 5 reanalysis wind products to
   calculate a series novel of metrics related to upwelling dynamics. We
   then use these to objectively describe upwelling signals in terms of
   their frequency, intensity and duration throughout the four EBUS during
   summer months over the last 37 years (1982-2019). We found that a
   decrease (increase) in SST is associated with an increase (decrease) in
   the number of upwelling ``events,{''} a decrease (increase) in the
   intensity of upwelling, and an increase (decrease) in the cumulative
   intensity of upwelling, with differences between EBUS and regions within
   EBUS. The Humboldt Current is the only EBUS that shows a consistent
   response from north to south with a general intensification of
   upwelling. However, we could not provide clear evidence for associated
   changes in the wind dynamics hypothesized to drive the upwelling
   dynamics.},

Title = {Methane Emissions From Nordic Seagrass Meadow Sediments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 18},
Abstract = {Shallow coastal soft bottoms are important carbon sinks. Submerged
   vegetation has been shown to sequester carbon, increase sedimentary
   organic carbon (C-org) and thus suppress greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   The ongoing regression of seagrass cover in many areas of the world can
   therefore lead to accelerated emission of GHGs. In Nordic waters,
   seagrass meadows have a high capacity for carbon storage, with some
   areas being recognized as blue carbon hotspots. To what extent these
   carbon stocks lead to emission of methane (CH4) is not yet known. We
   investigated benthic CH4 emission (i.e., net release from the sediment)
   in relation to seagrass (i.e. Zostera marina) cover and sedimentary
   C-org content (\%) during the warm summer period (when emissions are
   likely to be highest). Methane exchange was measured in situ with
   benthic chambers at nine sites distributed in three regions along a
   salinity gradient from similar to 6 in the Baltic Sea (Finland) to
   similar to 20 in Kattegat (Denmark) and similar to 26 in Skagerrak
   (Sweden). The net release of CH4 from seagrass sediments and adjacent
   unvegetated areas was generally low compared to other coastal habitats
   in the region (such as mussel banks and wetlands) and to other seagrass
   areas worldwide. The lowest net release was found in Finland. We found a
   positive relationship between CH4 net release and sedimentary C-org
   content in both seagrass meadows and unvegetated areas, whereas no clear
   relationship between seagrass cover and CH4 net release was observed.
   Overall, the data suggest that Nordic Zostera marina meadows release
   average levels of CH4 ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1),
   which is at least 12-78 times lower (CO2 equivalents) than their carbon
   accumulation rates previously estimated from seagrass meadows in the
   region, thereby not hampering their role as carbon sinks. Thus, the
   relatively weak CH4 emissions from Nordic Z. marina meadows will not
   outweigh their importance as carbon sinks under present environmental
   conditions.},

Title = {Climate change perceptions, impacts and adaptation practices of fishers

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {191-211},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Purpose The small-scale artisanal fishers in coastal Bangladesh are
   comparatively more vulnerable to climate risks than any other
   communities in Bangladesh. Based on practicality, this paper aims to
   explain the local level climate change perception, its impact and
   adaptation strategies of the fisher in southeast coastal villages in
   Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the above objective,
   this study used structural, semi-structured interviews and focus group
   discussion in two coastal communities, namely, at Salimpur in the
   Sitakund coast and Sarikait Sandwip Island, Bangladesh. It reviews and
   applies secondary data sources to compare and contrast the findings
   presented in this study. Findings Results show that the fishers
   perceived an increase in temperature, frequency of tropical cyclones and
   an increase in sea level. They also perceived a decrease in monsoon
   rainfall. Such changes impact the decreasing amount of fish in the Bay
   of Bengal and the fishers' livelihood options. Analysing seasonal
   calendar of fishing, findings suggest that fishers' well-being is highly
   associated with the amount of fish yield, rather than climatic stress,
   certain non-climatic factors (such as the governmental rules, less
   profit, bank erosion and commercial fishing) also affected their
   livelihood. The major adaptation strategies undertaken include, but are
   not limited to, installation of tube well or rainwater harvesting plant
   for safe drinking water, raising plinth of the house to cope with
   inundation and use of solar panel/biogas for electricity.
   Originality/value Despite experiencing social stress and extreme
   climatic events and disasters, the majority of the fishing community
   expressed that they would not change their profession in future. The
   research suggests implementing risk reduction strategies in the coastal
   region of Bangladesh that supports the small-scale fishers to sustain
   their livelihood despite climate change consequences.},

Title = {Strategies for governments to help close the coastal adaptation funding
   gap},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {198},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Coastal protection refers to measures that seek to reduce damage to
   coastal land and assets from natural hazards such as erosion and
   inundation. Coastal population growth and projected climate change
   impacts will expose more people, land and assets to erosion and
   inundation increasing demand for coastal protection. Established coastal
   protection funding approaches, such as general taxation,
   intergovernmental transfers (grants with no obligation for repayment),
   and private investment to protect private property are constrained in
   meeting the funding required for future coastal protection needs in many
   areas. The coastal adaptation funding gap is the difference between
   current funding and future demand, a problem for governments that
   requires the identification of alternative approaches to funding coastal
   protection.
   This article presents four case studies of alternative funding
   approaches used to deliver coastal protection projects in Australia.
   These cases we analysed to identify strategies governments can adopt to
   reduce the coastal adaptation funding gap: i) use statutory powers to
   coerce funding from private beneficiaries thereby ensuring that public
   funds are focused on public goods, where opportunities for private
   funding is limited; ii) seek standardisation of design of coastal
   protection and adopt a coordinating role to reduce costs for coastal
   protection across the project lifecycle; iii) include opportunities for
   income generation within the design stage of coastal protection projects
   to extend public funds; and; iv) use debt finance to align the timing of
   project costs to local benefits and reduce the time to obtain the
   required capital.
   In each of the cases, the combination of political imperative to act and
   the absence of access to established funding approaches appear to have
   motivated the use of alternative approaches. The findings provide
   important lessons for climate adaptation finance and coastal protection
   governance where identification of alternative funding approaches is
   necessary.},

Abstract = {Climate change will pose new challenges to conserving Earth's natural
   ecosystems, due to incremental changes in temperature and weather
   patterns, and to increased frequency and intensity of extreme climate
   events. Addressing these challenges will require pragmatic conservation
   actions informed by site-specific understanding of susceptibility to
   climate change and capacity of societies to cope with and adapt to
   change. Depending on a location's environmental susceptibility and
   social adaptive capacity, appropriate conservation actions will require
   some combination of: (1) large-scale protection of ecosystems; (2)
   actively transforming and adapting social-ecological systems; (3)
   building the capacity of communities to cope with change; and (4)
   government assistance focused on de-coupling communities from dependence
   on natural resources. We apply a novel analytical framework to examine
   conservation actions in five western Indian Ocean countries, where
   climate-mediated disturbance has impacted coral reefs and where adaptive
   capacity differs markedly. We find that current conservation strategies
   do not reflect adaptive capacity and are, therefore, ill prepared for
   climate change. We provide a vision for conservation policies that
   considers social adaptive capacity that copes with complexities of
   climate change better than the singular emphasis on government control
   and the creation of no-take areas.},

Title = {Analyzing temporo-spatial changes and the distribution of the CO2
   concentration in Australia from 2009 to 2016 by greenhouse gas
   monitoring satellites},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {We comprehensively analyzed the temporo-spatial changes in the CO2
   concentrations in Australia from June 2009 to December 2016 using
   greenhouse gas monitoring satellites, Greenhouse Gases Observing
   Satellite (GOSAT) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). Regarding
   the spatial distribution, the CO2 concentration in central Australia was
   always higher than that of other regions, and the lack of precipitation
   in this region is thought to be one of the main causes of this increased
   concentration. By combining the results with the Koppen-Geiger climate
   classification, a subtle relationship between the spatial distribution
   of CO2 and various climate types were found. Precipitation, Sea Surface
   Temperature (SST), phytoplankton around the coastal region, vegetation
   cover and other factors jointly affected the spatial CO2 concentration
   in Australia. Moreover, the results indicated that the abnormal SST in
   the 4 Nino zones would affect the precipitation and vegetation growth in
   Australia and the total chlorophyll in the equatorial Eastern Central
   Pacific Ocean, which would in turn influence carbon cycling in
   Australia. According to the Ni (n) over tildeo-3 and Ni (n) over
   tildeo-3.4 indices, two El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events
   occurred during the study period. The CO2 increase rate decreased during
   the period of the 2011 La Nina, while the CO2 increase rate increased
   during the period of the 2015 El Nino. With the global CO2 concentration
   as the background, the abnormal change of CO2 in Australia was analyzed.
   Lastly, the results showed that SST around Australia, precipitation,
   vegetation, ENSO events, oceanic chemical processes and bushfires were
   assumed to directly or indirectly influence the temporal changes in CO2
   in this region.},

Title = {Adsorption properties of seaweed-based biochar with the greenhouse gases
   (CO2, CH4, N2O) through density functional theory (DFT)},
Journal = {BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {163},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Since the industrial revolution, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have
   increased dramatically, which has become a global concern. In this
   study, the interaction between biochar and GHG was calculated by
   building different models of seaweed-based biochar through density
   functional theory (DFT). The adsorption mechanism of biochar was then
   analyzed by structural parameters, adsorption energy, charge transfer,
   and surface electronic proper-ties. The results showed that the biochar
   with N and O heteroatom doping had better adsorption performance, and
   results also show that biochar is more sensitive to CO2 and N2O. In
   particular, the adsorption energies of CO2 and N(2)on N-doped biochar
   were increased by 58.1\% and 21.4\%, respectively. Finally, quantitative
   conformational relationships (QSAR) with GHG adsorption energy were
   constructed using representative electronic properties of biochar model
   surfaces as descriptors. The results showed that the electrostatic
   potential on the surface of biochar, E-LOMO and delta E-gap of alpha
   orbitals showed a good linear relationship with the adsorption energy,
   which can be used for the preliminary screening of GHG adsorbents. This
   contribution provides an insight into the mechanism of GHG adsorption at
   the molecular level and may help in the design of more efficient
   materials for environmental remediation.},

Title = {Environmental efficiency in the agricultural sector of Latin America and
   the Caribbean 1990-2015: Are greenhouse gas emissions reducing while
   agricultural production is increasing?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The paper explores the relationship between production and greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions in the agricultural sector of Latin America and the
   Caribbean (LAC) between 1990 and 2015. By appraising how GHG emissions
   have changed with respect to agricultural production (elasticity), we
   are able to classify countries into six decoupling states. While the
   decoupling elasticity provides information for assessing the evolution
   within countries, we introduce a performance ratio for country
   comparison by calculating GHG emissions over agricultural production for
   2015 and using the global distribution as benchmark. The information
   from both measurements serves to identify various country and sub
   regional situations. The findings illustrate that countries with
   performance ratios in the top 25\% and under the best-case elasticity
   scenario (of strong decoupling) are not necessarily the same as the ones
   usually identified under factor productivity analyses, suggesting that
   environment-specific policy incentives and tools play a key role in
   enhancing sustainable agricultural production. Another major finding is
   that very few countries in the region (and worldwide) are able to offset
   agriculture emissions with land use-related carbon sequestration
   practices. Lastly, the evidence on small Caribbean island-states
   reporting the worst-case elasticity scenario (of strong negative
   decoupling) and performance ratios close to the world median, further
   supports the need for development plans related to climate change
   mitigation and adaptation in this sub region.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a bi-level programming-based optimization method to
   determine the sizing of tidal current farm (TCF) and the arrangement of
   tidal current turbines reaching the minimized comprehensive generation
   cost of tidal power. Not only the characteristics of tidal current
   velocity and wake effects but also the economic costs and environmental
   benefits brought by TCF integration are all incorporated in the proposed
   method. The method includes a power output model of TCF that can capture
   the characteristics of tidal current velocity and turbine wake effects,
   and a bi-level optimization model that takes into account the penalty
   costs of greenhouse gas emissions, the operation costs of power system,
   and the investment cost of tidal current turbines. The bi-level model is
   solved using a genetic algorithm and a quadratic programming technique.
   The effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method are
   demonstrated using the measured data of tidal current velocity and the
   IEEE 30-bus test system.},

Title = {Sea-level rise and impacts projections under a future scenario with
   large greenhouse gas emission reductions},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Using projections from two coupled climate models (HadCM3C and
   HadGEM2-AO), we consider the effect on 21st century sea-level rise (SLR)
   of mitigation policies relative to a scenario of business-as-usual
   (BAU). Around a third of the global-mean SLR over the century is avoided
   by a mitigation scenario under which global-mean near surface air
   temperature stabilises close to the Copenhagen Accord limit of a 2 C
   increase. Under BAU (a variant of the A1B scenario) the model-averaged
   projected SLR for 2090-2099 relative to 1980-1999 is 0.29 m-0.51 m
   (5\%-95\% uncertainties from treatment of land-based ice melt); under
   mitigation (E1 scenario) it is 0.17 m-0.34 m. This reduction is
   primarily from reduced thermal expansion. The spatial patterns of
   regional SLR are fairly dissimilar between the models, but are
   qualitatively similar across scenarios for a particular model. An
   impacts model suggests that by the end of the 21st century and without
   upgrade in defences around 55\% of the 84 million additional people
   flooded per year globally under BAU (from SLR alone) could be avoided
   under such mitigation. The above projections of SLR follow the
   methodology of the IPCC Fourth Assessment. We have, however, also
   conducted a sensitivity study of SLR and its impacts where the
   possibility of accelerated ice sheet dynamics is accounted for.

   ha(-1) y(-1)) and intact, mature reference sites (43.8 +/- 4.5 Mg CO(2)e
   ha(-1) y(-1)) and a dry, exposed disused aquaculture pond (30.6 +/- 1.9
   Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1)). Emissions were negligible at low productivity
   rehabilitating sites with high hydroperiod ( mean 1.0 +/- 0.1 Mg CO(2)e
   ha(-1) y(-1)) and an impounded. operational aquaculture pond (1.1 +/-
   0.2 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1)). Heterogeneity in biophysical conditions and
   geomorphic position exerted a strong influence on GHG flux, with the
   longer hydroperiod and higher soil moisture content of seaward fringing
   mangroves correlated with decreased fluxes. A greater abundance of Mud
   lobster mounds and root structures in landward mangroves correlated to
   higher flux. When viewed across a landuse change continuum, our results
   suggest that the initial conversion of mangroves to aquaculture ponds
   releases extremely high rates of GHGs. Furthermore, the re-institution
   of hydrological regimes in diy, disused aquaculture ponds to facilitate
   tidal flushing is instrumental in rapidly mediating GHG flux, leading to
   a significant reduction in baseline emissions. This is an important
   consideration for forest carbon project proponents seeking to maximise
   creditable GHG emissions reductions and removals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {There is an exceptional opportunity of achieving simultaneous and
   complementary data from a multitude of geoscience and environmental
   near-earth orbiting artificial satellites to study phenomena related to
   the climate change. These satellite missions provide the information
   about the various phenomena, such as sea level change, ice melting, soil
   moisture variation, temperature changes and earth surface deformations.
   In this study, we focus on permafrost thawing and its associated gravity
   change (in terms of the groundwater storage), and organic material
   changes using the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) data
   and other satellite- and ground-based observations. The estimation of
   permafrost changes requires combining information from various sources,
   particularly using the gravity field change, surface temperature change,
   and glacial isostatic adjustment. The most significant factor for a
   careful monitoring of the permafrost thawing is the fact that this
   process could be responsible for releasing an additional enormous amount
   of greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere, most importantly to
   mention carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane that are currently stored in
   the frozen ground. The results of a preliminary numerical analysis
   reveal a possible existence of a high correlation between the secular
   trends of greenhouse gases (CO2), temperature and equivalent water
   thickness (in permafrost active layer) in the selected regions.
   Furthermore, according to our estimates based on processing the GRACE
   data, the groundwater storage attributed due to permafrost thawing
   increased at the annual rates of 3.4, 3.8, 4.4 and 4.0cm, respectively,
   in Siberia, North Alaska and Canada (Yukon and Hudson Bay). Despite a
   rather preliminary character of our results, these findings indicate
   that the methodology developed and applied in this study should be
   further improved by incorporating the in situ permafrost measurements.},

Title = {Emerging opportunities for developing a diversified land sector economy
   in Australia's northern savannas},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {315-330},
Abstract = {We explore sustainable land sector opportunities for Australia's 1.2
   million km(2) northern savanna rangelands where extensive beef cattle
   pastoralism is the predominant contemporary land use. Our focal region
   is characterised by mean annual rainfall exceeding 600 mm, ecologically
   bountiful wet season water availability followed by 6-8 months of
   surface water deficit, mostly nutrient-poor soils, internationally
   significant biodiversity and carbon stock values, very extensive dry
   season fires in pastorally unproductive settings, a sparse rural
   population (0.14 persons km(-2)) comprising a high proportion of
   Indigenous people, and associated limited infrastructure. Despite
   relatively high beef cattle prices in recent seasons and property values
   escalating at a spectacular similar to 6\% p. a. over the past two
   decades, long-term economics data show that, for most northern regions,
   typical pastoral enterprises are unprofitable and carry significant
   debt. Pastoral activities can also incur very significant environmental
   impacts on soil and scarce dry season water resources, and greenhouse
   gas emissions, which currently are not accounted for in economic
   sustainability assessments. Over the same period, the conservation
   sector (including National Parks, Indigenous Protected Areas) has been
   expanding rapidly andnow occupies 25\% of the region. Since 2012,
   market-based savanna burning projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions occur over a further 25\%. Returns from nature-based tourism
   focussed particularly on maintaining intact freshwater systems and
   associated recreational fishing opportunities dwarf returns from
   pastoralism. The growth of these latter industries illustrates the
   potential for further development of profitable ` ecosystem services'
   markets as part of a more environmentally and socially sustainable
   diversified regional land sector economy. We outline some of the
   imminent challenges involved with, and opportunities for developing,
   this new industry sector.},

Abstract = {The public concerns for a potential alternative power generation has
   been attributed to global warming, depletion of fossil fuels, greenhouse
   gas emissions that associated with the operation of conventional power
   plants, health hazards, soil degradation, ozone layer depletion and high
   cost of fossil fuels. The life span of reserved fossil fuel based on the
   global record is short and this has prompted many government agencies to
   put different strategic structures or platforms in place and adopt green
   technologies as the prospective means of satisfying the load demand.
   With renewable energy, electricity production can be distributed to
   various customers by using microgrid system to shorten transmission and
   distribution distances and losses as well as to save costs. This
   research work proposes the use of DC transmission on offshore wind farms
   to solve electricity shortage problems based on some technical and
   economic benefits. The power generated from the offshore wind farms is
   three times higher than power generated from onshore wind farms since
   offshore winds are stronger than onshore winds. Hence, offshore wind
   should be harnessed by the independent power providers for electrical
   power production. The simulation was carried out by using PSIM and the
   results were analyzed to show the impacts of offshore winds on the
   optimal operation of the power system.},

Title = {Patterns and environmental drivers of greenhouse gas fluxes in the
   coastal wetlands of China: A systematic review and synthesis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands play an increasingly important role in regulating
   greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus affecting climate change. However,
   the overall magnitude, trend, and environmental drivers of GHG fluxes in
   these wetlands of China remain uncertain. Herein, we synthesized data
   from 70 publications involving 187 field observations to identify
   patterns and drivers of GHG fluxes across coastal wetlands in China.
   Average methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and carbon dioxide
   (CO2) emissions (ecosystem respiration) across coastal wetlands were
   estimated as 2.20 +/- 0.31 mg.m(-2).h(-1), 16.44 +/- 2.96 mu
   g.m(-2).h(-1), and 388.76 +/- 42.28 mg.m(-2).h(-1), respectively. GHG
   emissions varied with tidal inundation, where CH4 and CO2 emissions
   during tidal inundation were lower than during ebbing. CH4 and CO2
   emissions from wetlands decreased linearly with increasing latitude,
   while N2O did not. CH4 fluxes were positively related to air temperature
   and aboveground biomass, and CO2 emissions were positively related to
   soil organic carbon. N2O fluxes were lower with increasing soil pH, and
   CH4 and CO2 emissions were greater with increasing soil moisture. Based
   on the results of sustained-flux global warming potential and
   sustained-flux global cooling potential models, our paper indicate that
   the fluxes of CH4 and N2O in coastal wetlands have a positive feedback
   to global warming, which is mainly driven by the CH4 emission. Our
   synthesis improved understanding of the roles of coastal wetlands in the
   ecosystem C cycle under global change. We suggest that long-term field
   observations of GHG fluxes across a wider range of spatiotemporal scales
   are urgently required to improve the prediction accuracy in GHG fluxes
   and the assessment of net GHG balance and its contribution to the GWP of
   coastal wetlands.},

Title = {More Environmental Sustainability Routing and Energy Management for All

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {With the popularity of the electrification of marine transportation,
   strategic energy-saving and environment-friendly management is gaining
   more attention recently. This paper proposes a novel coordinated
   navigation routing and power generation scheduling model, which aims at
   making a compromise between investment cost, operation cost, and
   greenhouse gas emissions under the distributional robust ambiguity of
   photovoltaic. A maritime hybrid energy configuration that combines
   diesel generator (DG), battery energy storage system (BESS), fuel cell
   (FC), photovoltaic (PV), and the cold-ironing connection is presented
   with a real-world navigation routine from Dalian to Singapore, and the
   optimization problem is solved through a bi-level tri-objective
   differential evolution algorithm, where navigation parameters, ESS and
   FC capacity and weight between operation cost and emission functions,
   are optimized in the upper level and specific power generation
   scheduling is settled in the lower level. Six case studies are conducted
   to verify its effectiveness and accuracy, and the simulation results
   demonstrate the proposed method can further reduce the operation cost
   while minimizing air contamination.},

   Seas},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {634-653},
Abstract = {The land-sea interface is a complex social-ecological system
   characterized by natural ecological processes and human-induced changes.
   Holistic management of the shoreline is a critical element of an
   ecosystem-based approach to the land-sea interface in coastal zone
   management (CZM) programs. Anthropogenic alteration of shoreline
   environments has resulted in significant loss of sandy beach ecosystems
   and eroded the resilience of these systems to disturbance. We tested the
   efficacy of CZM programs in managing the land-sea interface under
   current and future challenges by comparing alternative approaches to
   shoreline management in two U. S. states (Hawai'i and North Carolina).
   Our results show that explicit prohibition of shoreline armoring has
   been more effective in conserving dynamic coastal environments and
   communities by passing the risk associated with coastal development from
   the public trust to private landowners. Over the long-term, robust
   anti-armoring legislation will de-incentivize risky coastal development
   projects while preserving coastal environments and the ecological
   services they provide to society. Policy prescriptions for effective
   shoreline management and increased coastal resilience under persistent
   coastal erosion and future sea-level rise are proposed.},

   Carbon Capture for Negative Emissions},
Journal = {ENERGY TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Nearly every plausible emission scenario that limits climate change to
   less than 2 degrees C includes net negative global emissions in the late
   21st century. These negative emissions are achieved using negative
   emission technologies (NETs), a diverse class of currently theoretical
   technologies that use energy to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While a
   number of technological options are available, many of the most
   promising CO2 capture systems take advantage of biological systems and
   are thus driven by light energy. Sulfur offers an alternative energy
   source for biological carbon capture. Herein, system models are
   presented that use reduced sulfur to power marine chemosynthetic carbon
   capture, with four proposed alternatives for the management of the
   produced biomass and sulfate. These four alternatives differ in the
   energy and process used to reduce the sulfate produced by the growth of
   the microorganisms back to sulfur or sulfide and in sum, the four
   systems create direct air carbon capture systems that utilize either
   geologic reduced sulfur, electricity, or biomass as energy sources.
   Thus, three new energy sources for direct air carbon capture are
   identified.},

Title = {Committed warming inferred from observations},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Pages = {652+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Due to the lifetime of CO2, the thermal inertia of the oceans(1,2), and
   the temporary impacts of short-lived aerosols(3-5) and reactive
   greenhouse gases(6), the Earth's climate is not equilibrated with
   anthropogenic forcing. As a result, even if fossil-fuel emissions were
   to suddenly cease, some level of committed warming is expected due to
   past emissions as studied previously using climate models(6-11). Here,
   we provide an observational-based quantification of this committed
   warming using the instrument record of global-mean warming(12), recently
   improved estimates of Earth's energy imbalance(13), and estimates of
   radiative forcing from the Fifth Assessment Report of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(14). Compared with
   pre-industrial levels, we find a committed warming of 1.5 K (0.9-3.6,
   5th-95th percentile) at equilibrium, and of 1.3 K(0.9-2.3) within this
   century. However, when assuming that ocean carbon uptake cancels remnant
   greenhouse gas-induced warming on centennial timescales, committed
   warming is reduced to 1.1 K (0.7-1.8). In the latter case there is a
   13\% risk that committed warming already exceeds the 1.5 K target set in
   Paris(15). Regular updates of these observationally constrained
   committed warming estimates, although simplistic, can provide
   transparent guidance as uncertainty regarding transient climate
   sensitivity inevitably narrows(16) and the understanding of the
   limitations of the framework(11,17-21) is advanced.},

Title = {Can China reduce energy for water? A review of energy for urban water
   supply and wastewater treatment and suggestions for change},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {41-58},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Energy use represents one of the main costs in water supply and
   wastewater treatment in China and is also a major contributor to
   greenhouse gas emissions. This paper has two aims. Firstly, it presents
   the first complete review of the growing body of literature on energy
   for water in urban China. Secondly, it identifies the most feasible
   suggestions for reducing and recovering energy in China's urban water
   systems based on the literature. The review finds wastewater is the area
   with most potential for net energy and emissions reduction. Anaerobic
   sludge digestion is commonly used in thousands of plants across the
   world, but it is applied in fewer than 3\% of Chinese wastewater
   treatment plants. Many Chinese plants are large enough to make anaerobic
   digestion feasible and could potentially offset around 50\% of their
   energy use by using the heat and power produced by burning biogas.
   Energy recovery can be increased through co-digestion and increasing
   primary sludge collection, or by using heat pumps to transfer energy in
   wastewater to nearby buildings. Land application of sludge can be used
   to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with wastewater
   sludge, almost all of which is currently landfilled or dumped without
   stabilisation in China. In water supply, minimising water leakage and
   increasing the efficiency of water pumping in high-rise buildings are
   practical ways to reduce net energy use for conventional water supply.
   In cases when water is scarce and cannot be transferred between
   provinces using gravity, wastewater reclamation combined with energy
   recovery is the least energy-intensive alternative water source and
   should be supported by strong government policy.},

   current heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Here me devise new
   stabilization profiles that explicitly (albeit qualitatively)
   incorporate considerations of the global economic system, estimate the
   corresponding anthropogenic emissions requirements, and assess the
   significance of the profiles in terms of global-mean temperature and sea

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper uses an environmentally extended input-output model of the
   Irish economy to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic
   output multipliers in 2010 for two aquatic (aquaculture products and sea
   fisheries) and five land-based livestock products (beef and veal, sheep
   meat, pig meat, poultry meat, and dairy products). Moreover, the Global
   Value Chain (GVC) framework is adopted to qualitatively understand the
   structure of Irish food sectors and identify segments of the food value
   chains with the greatest emissions efficiency and economic potential.
   Aquaculture is found to have the highest output multiplier and a low to
   medium carbon footprint compared to pastoral livestock products (beef
   and veal, sheep meat, dairy). The direct and indirect economic benefits
   of the aquaculture sector along with the relatively low carbon footprint
   suggest that additional benefits from an expansion of Ireland's
   aquaculture sector can be gained. However, aquaculture is energy
   intensive, and therefore production requires the efficient use of energy
   and resources, and the employment of low carbon technologies that
   strengthen aquaculture' s sustainability.},

   infralittoral zone had a mean N2O flux close to zero. During a wet
   summer (13-14 samplings per site), the mean daytime N2O-N fluxes ranged
   from 4 +/- 1 to 15 +/- 5 mg m(-2) h(-1) at the three eulittoral sites
   and were negligible at the two infralittoral sites. The littoral zone
   occupied 26\% of the lake area but was estimated to account for most of
   the N2O emissions from the lake. The studied eulittoral zone, which did
   not have adjacent nitrogen fertilization, exhibited higher N2O emissions
   during the summer than seen in northern natural ecosystems in general,
   including peatlands, forests, and the pelagic regions of lakes. Thus in
   lake-rich landscapes the littoral zone and other lake-associated
   wetlands must be considered as potential sources of atmospheric N2O. An
   assessment of their atmospheric importance requires further data on the
   N2O fluxes and their regulation in different littoral areas and on the
   total littoral coverage, neither of which is yet available.},

   Accounting for Climate, Ecosystems, and People},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Climate change and population growth are degrading coastal ecosystems
   and increasing risks to communities and infrastructure. Reliance on
   seawalls and other types of hardened shorelines is unsustainable in an
   era of rising seas, given the costs to build and maintain these
   structures and their unintended consequences on ecosystems. This is
   especially true for communities that depend on coastal and marine
   ecosystems for livelihoods and sustenance. Protecting and restoring
   coral reefs and coastal forests can be lower cost, sustainable
   alternatives for shoreline protection. However, decision-makers often
   lack basic information about where and under what conditions ecosystems
   reduce risk to coastal hazards and who would benefit. To better
   understand where to prioritize ecosystems for coastal protection, we
   assessed risk reduction provided by coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass
   along the entire coast of The Bahamas, under current and future climate
   scenarios. Modeled results show that the population most exposed to
   coastal hazards would more than double with future sea-level rise and
   more than triple if ecosystems were lost or degraded. We also found that
   ecosystem-based risk reduction differs across islands due to variation
   in a suite of ecological, physical, and social variables. On some
   populated islands, like Grand Bahama and Abaco, habitats provide
   protection to disproportionately large numbers of people compared to the
   rest of the country. Risk reduction provided by ecosystems is also
   evident for several sparsely populated, remote coastal communities,
   which in some cases, have large elderly populations. The results from
   our analyses were critical for engaging policy-makers in discussions
   about employing natural and nature-based features for coastal
   resilience. After hurricanes Joaquin and Matthew hit The Bahamas in 2016
   and 2017, our assessment of coastal risk reduction and the multiple
   benefits provided by coastal ecosystems helped pave the way for an
   innovative loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to the
   Government of The Bahamas to invest in mangrove restoration for coastal
   resilience. This work serves as an example for other regions and
   investors aiming to use assessments of ecosystem services to inform
   financing of natural and nature-based approaches for coastal resilience
   and climate adaptation.},

Title = {Low-carbon electricity production through the implementation of
   photovoltaic panels in rooftops in urban environments: A case study for
   three cities in Peru},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {622},
Pages = {1448-1462},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Urban environments in Latin America must begin decarbonizing their
   activities to avoid increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions rates
   due to their reliance on fossil fuel-based energy to support economic
   growth. In this context, cities in Latin America have high potential to
   convert sunlight into energy. Hence, the main objective of this study
   was to determine the potential of electricity self-sufficiency
   production and mitigation of GHG emissions in three medium-sized cities
   in Peru through the revalorization of underutilized rooftop areas in
   urban environments. Each city represented a distinct natural area of
   Peru: Pacific coast, Andean region and Amazon basin. More specifically,
   photovoltaic solar systems were the technology selected for
   implementation in these rooftop areas. Data on incident solar energy,
   temperature and energy consumption were collected. Thereafter, ArcGis
   10.3 was used to quantify the total usable area in the cities. A series
   of correction factors, including tilt, orientation or roof profiles were
   applied to attain an accurate value of usable area. Finally, Life Cycle
   Assessment was the methodology chosen to calculate the reduction of
   environmental impacts as compared to the current context of using
   electricity from the regional grids. Results showed that the cities
   assessed have the potential to obtain their entire current electricity
   demand for residential, commercial and public lighting purposes,
   augmenting energy security and resilience to intermittent natural
   disasters, with the support of decentralized storage systems. This
   approach would also translate into substantial reductions in terms of
   GHG emissions. Annual reductions in GHG emissions ranged from 112 ton
   CO(2)eq in the city of Ayacucho to over 523 kton CO(2)eq in Pucallpa,
   showing that cities in the Amazon basin would be the ones that benefit
   the most in terms of climate change mitigation. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

   Ammonia: Environmental and Economic Assessments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The shipping industry is becoming increasingly aware of its
   environmental responsibilities in the long-term. In 2018, the
   International Maritime Organization (IMO) pledged to reduce greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50\% by the year 2050 as compared with a
   baseline value from 2008. Ammonia has been regarded as one of the
   potential carbon-free fuels for ships based on these environmental
   issues. In this paper, we propose four propulsion systems for a 2500
   Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) container feeder ship. All of the
   proposed systems are fueled by ammonia; however, different power systems
   are used: main engine, generators, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cell (PEMFC), and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Further, these systems
   are compared to the conventional main engine propulsion system that is
   fueled by heavy fuel oil, with a focus on the economic and environmental
   perspectives. By comparing the conventional and proposed systems, it is
   shown that ammonia can be a carbon-free fuel for ships. Moreover, among
   the proposed systems, the SOFC power system is the most eco-friendly
   alternative (up to 92.1\%), even though it requires a high lifecycle
   cost than the others. Although this study has some limitations and
   assumptions, the results indicate a meaningful approach toward solving
   GHG problems in the maritime industry.},

Abstract = {Due in part to the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme
   weather events in Australia, emergency management has recently
   transitioned from a command-and-control civil defence structure to one
   promoting `shared responsibility' between government, businesses,
   non-government, communities and individuals. The objective is to enable
   communities to become disaster resilient as opposed to fortified against
   risk. In this paper, using a case study approach, we examine whether
   this national resilience approach has been effectively institutionalised
   at the local scale. To do this, we draw upon the knowledge of those
   working within the traditional emergency management and community
   service sectors to identify which factors influence the resilience of a
   community in the case study location and determine which stakeholder
   classes are considered responsible for developing and enhancing each
   factor. The results indicate that all three tiers of government are
   still seen to be largely responsible for the case study's disaster
   resilience; however, local community groups comprised of volunteers are
   also perceived to be largely responsible for disaster resilience despite
   obvious capacity and resourcing limitations.},

Abstract = {A systemic approach on the elaboration of adaptation policy systems was
   begun in 2008 by the approval of the Report on Adaptation to Climate
   Change by the Latvian Government and a new task was put forward - to
   elaborate national strategy on adaptation. Several examples of sectoral
   adaptation policies and measures are already being implemented in Latvia
   (flood risk assessment and management, risk management and insurance in
   agriculture, coastal zone management, etc.) and research is being
   conducted on climate change impacts. A systemic approach is required for
   decision-making to solve such a huge, global, and unstructured problem
   as climate change impacts and risks. This involves facilitating work of
   different partners and stakeholders involved in decision-making to reach
   a common basis for efficient action, normative principles, and
   appropriate criteria (sustainability, and others subordinated to it -
   precautionary measures, solidarity and cooperation, dematerialization,
   sustainable resource use, triple bottom line, diversification,
   ``polluter pays{''}). This paper analyses some key aspects integral to
   the development of a national system of adaptation to climate change,
   discusses practical considerations (policies and measures) already being
   implemented in Latvia, and proposes a new policy design approach for
   more efficient elaboration and implementation of adaptation policy.},

   Percent saturations of CO2 in the main stem varied in both time and
   space and were under-saturated at some sites. CO2 percent saturations
   and NO3- concentrations in the more-developed West Branch were
   significantly higher than the main stem, likely because of the position
   of main-stem sites downstream of Sheepscot Pond where primary production
   and degassing could occur. We also measured CH4 and CO2 fluxes from
   wetland soil adjacent to the main stem, which averaged 710 (+/- 59) mu
   molCH(4)/m(2)/h and -51 (+/- 6.4) mmolCO(2)/m(2)/h. Our findings suggest
   that rivers and fringing wetlands in the formerly glaciated northeastern
   US contribute to the production of greenhouse gasses, and that dissolved
   methane shows spatial variations with channel morphology.},

Abstract = {The increase of concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
   gases in the atmosphere will certainly affect hydrological regimes.
   Global warning is thus expected to have major implications on water
   resources management. Our objective is to present a general approach to
   evaluate the effect of potential climate changes on groundwater
   resources. In the current stage of knowledge, large-scale global climate
   models are probably the best available tools to provide estimates of the
   effects of raising greenhouse gases on rainfall and evaporation patterns
   through a continuous, three dimensional simulation of atmospheric,
   oceanic and cryospheric processes. However their spatial resolution
   (generally some thousands of square kilometers) is not compatible with
   that of watershed hydrologic models. The main purpose of this study is
   to evaluate the impact of potential climate changes upon groundwater
   resources. A general methodology is proposed in order to disaggregate
   outputs of large-scale models and thus to make information directly
   usable by hydrologic models. As an illustration, this method is applied
   to a CO2-doubling scenario through the development of a local weather
   generator, although many uncertainties are not yet assessed about the
   results of climate models. Two important hydrological variables:
   rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are thus generated. They are
   then used by coupling with a physically based hydrological model to
   estimate the effects of climate changes on groundwater recharge and soil
   moisture in the root zone.},

Abstract = {Oregon's public beaches and adjacent developed and undeveloped dunes and
   bluffs experience erosion and other hazards due to winter storm waves,
   weathering, and geologic instability.  In privately owned developed
   areas, the typical hazard response is to install a hard shore protection
   structure, leading some to question the effectiveness of policies that
   were designed to discourage such structures.  An evaluation of shore
   protection and land use policy implementation was undertaken using a
   geographic information system to analyze outcomes of policy decisions
   within the Siletz littoral cell on the central Oregon coast.  Study
   results, detailed in this article, found that policies designed to
   mitigate hazards, control upland development, and protect the beach are
   often ineffective.  Based on this analysis, Oregon's ocean shore
   protection management regime needs an overhaul.  Such a process is now
   underway under the aegis of the 1990 amendments to the federal Coastal
   Zone Management Act.},

Title = {Coastal management, climate change adaptation and sustainability in
   small coastal communities: leatherback turtles and beach loss},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {441-453},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Beaches are frequently subjected to erosion and accretion that are
   influenced by coastal development interventions and natural variations
   due to storms and changes in river flow. Climate change may also
   exacerbate beach erosion and accretion. Natural scientists are concerned
   with the sustainability of species dependent on the beach ecosystem.
   Policymakers are pre-occupied with the economic sustainability of
   coastal communities should species decline and prolonged beach loss
   occur. The aim of this paper is to explore the linkage between science
   and policy by reporting the findings of a study of coastal change
   impacts on leatherback turtle nesting and analysing the socio-economic
   and adaptation implications of these changes for coastal communities.
   Grande Riviere, Trinidad, was used as a case study. Primary fieldwork
   investigated unsustainable coastal management practices. A questionnaire
   was administered to examine livelihoods, including ecotourism based on
   leatherback turtle nesting, and knowledge and awareness of climate
   change. One key finding of the study was that the community's
   livelihoods were natural resources dependent, and that natural beach
   dynamics and unsustainable coastal management practices posed major
   threats to natural resource and economic sustainability. Another key
   finding was that, despite these impacts, community knowledge and
   awareness of climate change in general was low, and there was a
   perception of state responsibility for climate change adaptation. The
   research findings have global applicability for coastal communities at
   risk of exposure and that are highly vulnerable to natural resources
   damage arising from anthropogenic stress and potential climate change.
   These communities require policy reforms to strengthen current coastal
   management practices and adaptation responses aimed at ensuring
   long-term sustainability.},

Abstract = {Climate change is presenting an ongoing and eminent threat to various
   regions, communities and infrastructure worldwide. In this study, the
   current and future climate impacts faced by Viet Nam due to Tropical
   Cyclones (TCs), specifically wind and surge, are evaluated, and
   different adaptation measures to manage this risk are appraised. The
   level of wind and storm surge risk was assessed focusing on three
   categories of assets: residential houses, agriculture, and people. The
   expected damage to these assets was then evaluated based on their
   exposure to the hazard under current and future climate scenarios.
   Physical adaptation measures such as mangroves, sea dykes, and gabions,
   and financial adaptation measures such as risk transfer via insurance
   were applied to the expected future risk and evaluated based on a
   socio-economic cost-benefit analysis. The output will give
   decision-makers the ability to make more informed decisions, prioritize
   the most cost-effective adaptation measures and increase physical and
   financial resilience. The results indicated significant TC exposure in
   future climate scenarios due to economic development and climate change
   that almost doubles the current expected damage. Surge-related damage
   was found to be many times higher than wind damage, and houses had more
   exposure (value in total) than agriculture on a national scale. The
   physical adaptation measures are successful in significantly reducing
   the future wind and especially surge risk and would form a resilient
   strategy along with risk transfer for managing TC risks in the region.},

Abstract = {Global seaweed carbon sequestration estimates are currently taken as the
   fraction of the net primary production (NPP) exported to the deep ocean.
   However, this perspective does not account for CO2 from the consumption
   of external subsidies. Here, we clarify: (i) the role of export relative
   to seaweed net ecosystem production (NEP) for a closed system and one
   more likely open to subsidies; (ii) the importance of subsidies by
   compiling published estimates of NEP from seaweed-dominated ecosystems;
   and (iii) discuss their impact on the global seaweed net carbon balance
   and other sequestration constraints as a mitigation service. Examples of
   seaweed NEP (n = 18) were sparse and variable. Nevertheless, the average
   NEP (-4.0 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) SE +/- 12.2) suggested that seaweed
   ecosystems are a C source, becoming increasingly heterotrophic as their
   export is consumed. Critically, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions
   was mixed relative to their replacement or baseline states, and where
   CO2 is supplied independently of organic metabolism and atmospheric
   exchange, we caution a sole reliance on NEP or NPP. This will ensure a
   more accurate seaweed mitigation assessment, one that does exceed their
   capacity and is effective within a compliance and carbon trading scheme.},

Abstract = {We carried out a 1.5-year study of the fate of organic carbon during
   experimental wetland loss using an herbicide at freshwater, brackish and
   saltwater emergent wetlands. Total carbon stocks in the upper 50 cm of
   the soil horizon were 15.0 +/- 0.5 kg C/m(2) (222.8 mt CO2e/ac) at the
   freshwater site, 11.1 +/- 0.9 kg C/m(2) (164.7 mt CO2e/ac) at the
   brackish site, and 8.5 +/- 1.4 kg C/m(2) (125.7 mt CO2e/ac) at the
   saltwater site. There were no significant differences detected in
   decomposition between the treatment and reference plots, which had 39.4
   to 41.5 \% material remaining by the end of the study at the three
   sites. The plots treated with herbicide had decreased elevation of -4.24
   cm, -1.56 cm and -1.48 cm at the freshwater, brackish and saltwater
   sites, respectively, which equate to a mass loss of soil organic carbon
   of 1273 g C/m(2), 389 g C/m(2) and 207 g C/m(2), respectively. Results
   indicate statistically greater greenhouse gasses were emitted at the
   brackish and saltwater plots treated with herbicide compared to the
   reference plots, with up to 4.2 mt CO2e/ac emitted at the brackish site
   and 3.1 mt CO2e/ac emitted at the saltwater site during the first 1.5

Abstract = {The environmental impact of textile supply chain of selected cotton,
   wool and polyester apparels consumed in Australia was accessed in this
   study using life cycle assessment methodology. The environmental impact
   category, climate change was used for this assessment. Climate change is
   related to the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and the
   reference unit of climate change impact category is kg CO2 equivalent.
   The environmental impact of these apparels was then scaled up based on
   their total consumption in Australia in 2015. The results highlight the
   differences in environmental impact between the three apparels. This
   study demonstrates that the main contributor to climate change is the
   consumer use stage for cotton and polyester apparel whereas wool apparel
   production process contributes more impact than consumer use stage.
   Energy use is the main factor of environmental impact. Sensitivity
   analysis was carried out based on the different parameters used to
   develop baseline model, such as change of transport from airfreight to
   sea freight; change of transport distance, change of consumer laundering
   behaviour. Around 10\% CO(2)equivalent emission can be reduced from base
   case by reducing washing machine energy up to 40\%. A high efficient
   washing machineandfull load machine wash can save energyand reduce
   carbonemission.},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that the increase of Southern Hemisphere sea ice
   extent since the 1970s can be explained by ozone depletion in the
   Southern Hemisphere stratosphere. In a previous study, the authors have
   shown that in a coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice model the ozone hole
   does not lead to an increase but to a decrease in sea ice extent. Here,
   the robustness of this result is established through the analysis of
   models from phases 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   (CMIP3 and CMIP5). Comparison of the mean sea ice trends in CMIP3 models
   with and without time-varying stratospheric ozone suggests that ozone
   depletion is associated with decreased sea ice extent, and ozone
   recovery acts to mitigate the future sea ice decrease associated with
   increasing greenhouse gases. All available historical simulations with
   CMIP5 models that were designed to isolate the effect of time-varying
   ozone concentrations show decreased sea ice extent in response to
   historical ozone trends. In most models, the historical sea ice extent
   trends are mainly driven by historical greenhouse gas forcing, with
   ozone forcing playing a secondary role.},

Title = {We Must Stop Fossil Fuel Emissions to Protect Permafrost Ecosystems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Climate change is an existential threat to the vast global permafrost
   domain. The diverse human cultures, ecological communities, and
   biogeochemical cycles of this tenth of the planet depend on the
   persistence of frozen conditions. The complexity, immensity, and
   remoteness of permafrost ecosystems make it difficult to grasp how
   quickly things are changing and what can be done about it. Here, we
   summarize terrestrial and marine changes in the permafrost domain with
   an eye toward global policy. While many questions remain, we know that
   continued fossil fuel burning is incompatible with the continued
   existence of the permafrost domain as we know it. If we fail to protect
   permafrost ecosystems, the consequences for human rights, biosphere
   integrity, and global climate will be severe. The policy implications
   are clear: the faster we reduce human emissions and draw down
   atmospheric CO2, the more of the permafrost domain we can save.
   Emissions reduction targets must be strengthened and accompanied by
   support for local peoples to protect intact ecological communities and
   natural carbon sinks within the permafrost domain. Some proposed
   geoengineering interventions such as solar shading, surface albedo
   modification, and vegetation manipulations are unproven and may
   exacerbate environmental injustice without providing lasting protection.
   Conversely, astounding advances in renewable energy have reopened viable
   pathways to halve human greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and effectively
   stop them well before 2050. We call on leaders, corporations,
   researchers, and citizens everywhere to acknowledge the global
   importance of the permafrost domain and work towards climate restoration
   and empowerment of Indigenous and immigrant communities in these
   regions.},

Title = {The state of the art in monitoring and verification-Ten years on},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {312-349},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the ten years since publication of the IPCC Special Report on CCS,
   there has been considerable progress in monitoring and verification
   (M\&V). Numerous injection projects, ranging from small injection pilots
   to much larger longer-term commercial operations, have been successfully
   monitored to the satisfaction of regulatory agencies, and technologies
   have been adapted and implemented to demonstrate containment,
   conformance, and no environmental impact. In this review we consider
   M\&V chiefly from the perspective of its ability to satisfy stakeholders
   that these three key requirements are being met. From selected project
   examples, we show how this was done, and reflect particularly on the
   nature of the verification process. It is clear that deep-focussed
   monitoring will deliver the primary requirement to demonstrate
   conformance and containment and to provide early warning of any
   deviations from predicted storage behaviour. Progress in seismic
   imaging, especially offshore, and the remarkable results with InSAR from
   In Salah are highlights of the past decade. A wide range of shallow
   monitoring techniques has been tested at many sites, focussing
   especially on the monitoring of soil gas and groundwater. Quantification
   of any detected emissions would be required in some jurisdictions to
   satisfy carbon mitigation targets in the event of leakage to surface:
   however, given the likely high security of foreseeable storage sites, we
   suggest that shallow monitoring should focus mainly on assuring against
   environmental impacts. This reflects the low risk profile of well
   selected and well operated storage sites and recognizes the over-arching
   need for monitoring to be directed to specific, measureable risks. In
   particular, regulatory compliance might usefully involve clearer
   articulation of leakage scenarios, with this specificity making it
   possible to demonstrate ``no leakage{''} in a more objective way than is
   currently the case. We also consider the monitoring issues for CO2-EOR,
   and argue that there are few technical problems in providing assurance
   that EOR sites are successfully sequestering CO2; the issues lie largely
   in linking existing oil and gas regulations to new greenhouse gas
   policy. We foresee that, overall, monitoring technologies will continue
   to benefit from synergies with oil and gas operations, but that the
   distinctive regulatory and certification environments for CCS may pose
   new questions. Overall, while there is clearly scope for technical
   improvements, more clearly posed requirements, and better communication
   of monitoring results, we reiterate that this has been a decade of
   significant achievement that leaves monitoring and verification well
   placed to serve the wider CCS enterprise. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {Recently two studies were published analyzing the Well-to-Wake (WtW)
   Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction by substituting conventional
   marine fuel by LNG (for the Netherlands by TNO; for the U.S. by ICCT).
   This paper summarizes these two studies, adds important aspects and
   finally evaluates the benefit of LNG considering these aspects. The
   added aspects are the recently postulated increased fugitive methane
   loss in the natural gas supply chain, the improved natural gas engine
   technology and the impact of new IMO sulphur emission legislation
   regarding the choice of an appropriate reference case. It is reasoned
   that if these additional aspects are included in the analyses, it is
   still likely that LNG has to be seen as a marine fuel with the potential
   to reduce WtW GHG emissions. This is true also while taking into account
   the possible higher fugitive methane losses in the gas supply system.},

Abstract = {Recent large-scale analyses suggest that local management actions may
   not protect coral reefs from climate change, yet most local
   threat-reduction strategies have not been tested experimentally. We show
   that removing coral predators is a common local action used by managers
   across the world, and that removing the corallivorous snail
   Coralliophila abbreviata from Caribbean brain corals (Pseudodiploria and
   Diploria species) before a major warming event increased coral
   resilience by reducing bleaching severity (resistance) and
   post-bleaching tissue mortality (recovery). Our results highlight the
   need for increased evaluation and identification of local interventions
   that improve coral reef resilience.},

Abstract = {The crustal Urey cycle of CO2 involving silicate weathering and
   metamorphism acts as a dynamic climate buffer. In this cycle, warmer
   temperatures speed silicate weathering and carbonate formation, reducing
   atmospheric CO2 and thereby inducing global cooling. Over long periods
   of time, cycling of CO2 into and out of the mantle also dynamically
   buffers CO2. In the mantle cycle, CO2 is outgassed at ridge axes and
   island arcs, while subduction of carbonatized oceanic basalt and pelagic
   sediments returns CO2 to the mantle. Negative feedback is provided
   because the amount of basalt carbonatization depends on CO2 in seawater
   and therefore on CO2 in the air. On the early Earth, processes involving
   tectonics were more vigorous than at present, and the dynamic mantle
   buffer dominated over the crustal one. The mantle cycle would have
   maintained atmospheric and oceanic CO2 reservoirs at levels where the
   climate was cold in the Archean unless another greenhouse gas was
   important. Reaction of CO2 with impact ejecta and its eventual
   subduction produce even lower levels of atmospheric CO2 and small
   crustal carbonate reservoirs in the Hadean. Despite its name, the Hadean
   climate would have been freezing unless tempered by other greenhouse
   gases.},

Abstract = {Studies of C cycle alterations are extremely important to identify
   changes due to climate change, especially in the polar ecosystem. The
   objectives of this study were to (i) examine patterns of soil CO2-C and
   N2O-Nemissions, and (ii) evaluate the quantity and quality of soil
   organic matter across a glacier retreat chronosequence in the Maritime
   Antarctica. Field measurements were carried out during January and
   February 2010 (summer season) along a retreating zone of the White Eagle
   Glacier, at King George Island, Maritime Antarctica. Soil samples (0-10
   cm) were collected along a 500-m transect at regular intervals to
   determine changes in soil organic matter. Field CO2-C emission
   measurements and soil temperature were carried out at regular intervals.
   In addition, greenhouse gas production potentials were assessed through
   100 days laboratory incubations. Soils exposed for a longer time tended
   to have greater concentrations of soluble salts and possess sandier
   textures. Total organic C (3.59 g kg(-1)), total N (2.31 g kg(-1)) and
   labile C (1.83 g kg(-1)) tended to be lower near the glacier front
   compared with sites away from it, which is correlated with decreasing
   degree of humification of the soil organic matter with exposure time.
   Soil CO2-C emissions tended to increase with distance from the glacier
   front. On average, the presence of vegetation increased CO2-C emissions
   by 440\%, or the equivalent of 0.633 g of CO2-C m(-2) h(-1). Results
   suggest that newly exposed landsurfaces undergo soil formation with
   increasing labile C input from vegetation, accompanied by increasing
   soil CO2-C emissions. Despite the importance of exposure time on CO2-C
   production and emissions, there was no similar trend in soil N2O-N
   production potentials as a function of glacial retreat. For N2O,
   instead, the maximum production occurred in sites with the first stages
   of vegetation growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss past climatic trends over India, greenhouse
   gas emissions due to energy consumption, forest and land-use changes,
   climate change scenarios for the year 2050, potential consequences for
   agriculture and cyclone activity and the possibility that India might
   limit the increasing trend in its emissions.
   India's mean surface air temperature has increased significantly by
   about 0.4 degrees C over the past century. Neither monsoon nor annual
   rainfall shows any significant trend. On average, there has been a rise
   in sea levels around India over recent decades, though considerable
   uncertainties exist in the accuracy and interpretation of the available
   data.
   Carbon emissions from the energy sector amount to 71 MT a year,
   equivalent to all other sectors combined. From land-use data, a marginal
   net sequestration of 5.25 million tonnes of carbon occurred during 1986.
   Following the IPCC guidelines, methane emissions from rice and livestock
   are estimated at 17.4 and 12.8 Tg/year, respectively.
   According to recent climate model projections, India may experience a
   further rise in temperature of 1 degrees C by the year 2050, about four
   times the rate of warming experienced over the past 100 years. A modest
   increase in precipitation amounts might occur. Cereals production is
   estimated to decrease and the nutrition security of the population-rich
   but land-hungry region of India might be hampered. An increase in local
   tropical cyclone activity may occur over the next century, posing added
   problems as large areas in the coastal regions have a dense population.
   About 70\% of the electricity generation in India is from coal-based
   power stations. Altering this dependence significantly to reduce
   emissions would imply a substantial change in the present energy policy
   of India. There is great potential for improving energy efficiency and
   conservation. The adoption of cleaner coal-technologies should be
   considered, as must the development of renewable, non-conventional
   energy sources. In all cases, serious institulional barriers and
   resource limitations need to be addressed. The scope for carbon
   sequestration is limiled by land availabilily and other factors. It is
   argued that any response to global warming must be located firmly in the
   framework of sustainable development.},

   Taiwan's building sector},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {261},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Service and residential sectors have become significant sources for
   reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-sions relevant to the electricity
   demand for heating, ventilation \& air conditioning (HVAC) in buildings.
   In Taiwan, the energy efficiency (or energy saving) in buildings is a
   very important issue because the service and residential sectors in this
   subtropical/tropical island region are the primary sources of GHG
   emis-sions. Therefore, the main purpose of this work was to present an
   interactive analysis of Taiwan's energy consumption, GHG emissions from
   the services and residential sectors, and the certified green building
   materials (GBM) during the period of 2005-2020 based on the official
   statistics. Furthermore, the policy for promoting the GBM products with
   high thermal insulation performance and their compulsory spec-ifications
   were also addressed. On average, the service and residential sectors
   accounted for about 15\% of total domestic energy consumption during
   this period. By contrast, the electricity consumption shared around 35\%
   in 2020, and also indicated a decreasing trend from 2005 to 2020 due to
   the governmental policy for improving energy saving and energy
   efficiency through the establishments of greenhouse buildings (GB) and
   GBM. In line with international trend of low-carbon buildings, the
   Taiwan government has promoted the GBM labeling system under the
   promulgation of relevant regulations since the early 2000s. A total of
   2668 GBM labels have been issued over the years of 2005-2020, showing
   that the num-ber of approved and issued GBM reached a record high in
   2020. In summary, the certified high-performance GBM products indicated
   significant increases since 2013 under the regulatory promotion. The new
   and/or retrofitted buildings will adopt the certified GBM with high
   insulation performance totally by 2030 under the sustainable development
   goals (SDGs).(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Pages = {184-210},
Abstract = {Deforestation in Latin America, especially in the Amazon basin, is a
   major source of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that contribute
   to global warming. Protected areas play a vital role in minimizing
   forest loss and in supplying key environmental services, including
   carbon sequestration and rainfall regulation, which mitigate the adverse
   impacts of climate change amid a rising tide of economic development in
   the region. The area of protected forest has expanded rapidly since 1980
   to cover one-fifth of Latin America and more than two-fifths of
   Amazonia, a region whose rain forest captures some 40 percent of Latin
   America's carbon emissions. The reserve sector has traditionally
   suffered from severe underfunding, but the possibility of new resources
   being generated through financial compensation for ``reduced emissions
   from deforestation and forest degradation{''} (REDD) or ``avoided
   deforestation{''} under a new Kyoto protocol after 2012 could help
   strengthen the environmental and social roles of protected areas.
   However, a number of major implementation and governance challenges will
   need to be addressed.},

Title = {The environmental impacts of pelagic fish caught by Scottish vessels},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {236},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Food production is estimated to emit between 20-30 \% of global
   anthropogenic carbon emissions. The need to achieve net zero emissions
   requires a transition to low carbon, sustainable food sources. Of the
   total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for food production, only 4 \% are
   attributed to wild capture fisheries. However, within seafood GHG
   studies a wide range of estimates can be found across different species,
   fishing methods and regions. This study assesses the environmental
   impact of fish capture, including the carbon footprint (CF), by the
   Scottish pelagic fleet, a highly modernised fleet targeting herring,
   mackerel and blue whiting in the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean. A life
   cycle assessment (LCA) was undertaken to provide a standardised
   comparison of pelagic fish with other seafood studies. One kg of whole
   round fish caught by the Scottish pelagic trawl fleet had a CF of 0.452
   kg CO2 eq. Fuel burned during fishing operations was the largest
   contributing factor, accounting for approximately 96\% of a CF. This
   figure was consistent with the expected results for a fishery for small
   pelagics, which are typically under 1 kg CO2 eq. per kg of whole fish
   landed. When contrasted with other seafood LCAs, the results were found

Abstract = {In the Anthropocene, in which we now live, climate change is impacting
   most life on Earth. Microorganisms support the existence of all higher
   trophic life forms. To understand how humans and other life forms on
   Earth (including those we are yet to discover) can withstand
   anthropogenic climate change, it is vital to incorporate knowledge of
   the microbial `unseen majority'. We must learn not just how
   microorganisms affect climate change (including production and
   consumption of greenhouse gases) but also how they will be affected by
   climate change and other human activities. This Consensus Statement
   documents the central role and global importance of microorganisms in
   climate change biology. It also puts humanity on notice that the impact
   of climate change will depend heavily on responses of microorganisms,
   which are essential for achieving an environmentally sustainable future.},

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation Priority Strategies in the Philippines:
   Differences Between Local Government Decision Makers and Marginalized
   Coastal Communities},

Abstract = {Consequences of climate inaction are already felt by many vulnerable
   populations, and adapting to these impacts is an increasingly important
   necessity for affected communities. This study assessed adaptation
   priority differences in the Philippines to determine if traditional
   climate change decision makers accurately represent the marginalized
   communities they serve. Specifically, this study gathered baseline data
   of climate change knowledge, compared resiliency priorities and proposed
   strategies between local government workers and village residents, and
   analyzed factors that contribute to identify differences. The study's
   target group (residents of small villages) has historically been
   marginalized in municipal environmental decision making. Data collected
   through focus group discussions and interviews demonstrated there was a
   statistical difference between local government officials who were more
   likely to propose abstract, systemic adaptation strategies to build
   social capacity (69\% of government officials' proposed strategies),
   while village residents focused on physical infrastructure (59\% of
   village residents' proposed strategies). A second study outcome was the
   identification of contributing factors in how Filipinos might propose
   climate change adaptation strategies: for example, education levels,
   social or economic class, accessibility to resources, sources of
   information, and past experience with hazards. The significance of this
   research is the evidence of climate change adaptation prioritization
   differences between the country's traditional decision-making group, the
   municipal government unit, and marginalized members of local villages.
   The differences show that local municipal government units in the
   Philippines may not be the most effective base group for bottom-up
   adaptation and support the need for effective collaboration and
   community engagement in future climate change planning.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric observations of greenhouse gases provide essential
   information on sources and sinks of these key atmospheric constituents.
   To quantify fluxes from atmospheric observations, representation of
   transport-especially vertical mixing-is a necessity and often a source
   of error. We report on remotely sensed profiles of vertical aerosol
   distribution taken over a 2 year period in Pasadena, California. Using
   an automated analysis system, we estimate daytime mixing layer depth,
   achieving high confidence in the afternoon maximum on 51\% of days with
   profiles from a Sigma Space Mini Micropulse LiDAR (MiniMPL) and on 36\%
   of days with a Vaisala CL51 ceilometer. We note that considering
   ceilometer data on a logarithmic scale, a standard method, introduces,
   an offset in mixing height retrievals. The mean afternoon maximum mixing
   height is 770 m Above Ground Level in summer and 670 m in winter, with
   significant day-to-day variance (within season sigma = 220 m approximate
   to 30\%). Taking advantage of the MiniMPL's portability, we demonstrate
   the feasibility of measuring the detailed horizontal structure of the
   mixing layer by automobile. We compare our observations to planetary
   boundary layer (PBL) heights from sonde launches, North American
   regional reanalysis (NARR), and a custom Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model developed for greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring in
   Los Angeles. NARR and WRF PBL heights at Pasadena are both
   systematically higher than measured, NARR by 2.5 times; these biases
   will cause proportional errors in GHG flux estimates using modeled
   transport. We discuss how sustained lidar observations can be used to
   reduce flux inversion error by selecting suitable analysis periods,
   calibrating models, or characterizing bias for correction in post
   processing.},

Title = {Global CO2 fluxes estimated from GOSAT retrievals of total column CO2},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Number = {17},
Pages = {8695-8717},
Abstract = {We present one of the first estimates of the global distribution of CO2
   surface fluxes using total column CO2 measurements retrieved by the
   SRON-KIT RemoTeC algorithm from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite
   (GOSAT). We derive optimized fluxes from June 2009 to December 2010. We
   estimate fluxes from surface CO2 measurements to use as baselines for
   comparing GOSAT data-derived fluxes. Assimilating only GOSAT data, we
   can reproduce the observed CO2 time series at surface and TC-CON sites
   in the tropics and the northern extra-tropics. In contrast, in the
   southern extra-tropics GOSAT X-CO2 leads to enhanced seasonal cycle
   amplitudes compared to independent measurements, and we identify it as
   the result of a land-sea bias in our GOSAT X-CO2 retrievals. A bias
   correction in the form of a global offset between GOSAT land and sea
   pixels in a joint inversion of satellite and surface measurements of CO2
   yields plausible global flux estimates which are more tightly
   constrained than in an inversion using surface CO2 data alone. We show
   that assimilating the biascorrected GOSAT data on top of surface CO2
   data (a) reduces the estimated global land sink of CO2, and (b) shifts
   the terrestrial net uptake of carbon from the tropics to the
   extratropics. It is concluded that while GOSAT total column CO2 provide
   useful constraints for source-sink inversions, small spatiotemporal
   biases -beyond what can be detected using current validation techniques
   - have serious consequences for optimized fluxes, even aggregated over
   continental scales.},

Abstract = {Comprehensive chemistry-climate model experiments and observational data
   are used to show that up to half of the satellite era early springtime
   cooling trend in the Arctic lower stratosphere was caused by changing
   sea surface temperatures (SSTs). An ensemble of experiments forced only
   by changing SSTs is compared to an ensemble of experiments in which both
   the observed SSTs and chemically and radiatively active trace species
   are changing. By comparing the two ensembles, it is shown that warming
   of Indian Ocean, North Pacific, and North Atlantic SSTs and cooling of
   the tropical Pacific have strongly contributed to recent polar
   stratospheric cooling in late winter and early spring. When
   concentrations of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases are
   fixed, polar ozone concentrations show a small but robust decline due to
   changing SSTs. Ozone loss is larger in the presence of changing
   concentrations of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases. The
   stratospheric changes can be understood by examining the tropospheric
   height and heat flux anomalies generated by the anomalous SSTs. Finally,
   recent SST changes have contributed to a decrease in the frequency of
   late winter stratospheric sudden warmings.},

Title = {Assessing the Economic Costs of Sea Level Rise and Benefits of Coastal
   Protection: A Spatiotemporal Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) is believed to be the most dangerous impact of
   climate change in coastal regions. Adapting to its impacts has become
   imperative since SLR is now considered inevitable. Lack of local
   economic analysis of SLR impacts is one of the major obstacles impeding
   adaptation. To address this gap, this study employs a spatiotemporal
   approach to estimate the economic costs of future SLR as well as the
   benefits of coastal protection, a principal adaptation strategy, under
   four local SLR projection scenarios in the mainland Miami-Dade County,
   Florida. Our findings indicate that SLR impacts are nonlinear and
   coastal protection, while costly, can significantly reduce future
   potential losses. A novel spatial fishnet approach is also proposed to
   help local decision makers identify areas that should be prioritized for
   protection. Findings of this study aim to support local adaptation
   planning, and call for integrating adaptation for SLR and its
   uncertainties into local planning frameworks to achieve long-term
   sustainability and well-being of our precious coastal communities.},

Abstract = {Dangerous climate change is best avoided by drastically and rapidly
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, geoengineering options
   are receiving attention on the basis that additional approaches may also
   be necessary. Here we review the state of knowledge on large-scale ocean
   fertilization by adding iron or other nutrients, either from external
   sources or via enhanced ocean mixing. On the basis of small-scale field
   experiments carried out to date and associated modelling, the maximum
   benefits of ocean fertilization as a negative emissions technique are
   likely to be modest in relation to anthropogenic climate forcing.
   Furthermore, it would be extremely challenging to quantify with
   acceptable accuracy the carbon removed from circulation on a long term
   basis, and to adequately monitor unintended impacts over large space and
   time-scales. These and other technical issues are particularly
   problematic for the region with greatest theoretical potential for the
   application of ocean fertilization, the Southern Ocean. Arrangements for
   the international governance of further field-based research on ocean
   fertilization are currently being developed, primarily under the London
   Convention/London Protocol. (C) 2012 The Institution of Chemical
