Abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a trend cluster analysis technique for
   identifying and analysing time series wave data. With this application,
   it can assist management to identify changes that occur in time series
   data as well as facilitate researchers evaluate this type of data. We
   use the technique to cluster and analyse the wave data in order to
   identify the wave heights and sea condition for generating renewable
   energy in Tioman Island coastal area. The application was developed
   using Self Organizing Map (SOM) Clustering technique.},

Abstract = {The characteristics of inorganic carbon assimilation by photosynthesis
   were investigated in male and female gametophytes and juvenile
   sporophytes of Undaria pinnatifida. Gametophytes and sporophytes have
   detectable extracellular and intracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA)
   activity, and the CA inhibitor, acetazolamide (AZ), significantly
   inhibited their photosynthesis O-2 evolution. In pH-drift experiments,
   it was found that gametophytes did not raise the final pH of seawater
   above 9.00 (CO2 concentrations of about 2.2 mu M), indicating a low
   ability to utilize inorganic carbon. In contrast, sporophytes rapidly
   raised pH to over 9.53 and depleted the free CO2 Concentration to less
   than 0.16 mu M. The apparent photosynthetic affinity for CO2 was almost
   the same for gametophytes and sporophytes, whereas gametophytes had a
   much lower affinity for HCO3- than sporophytes. Two inhibitors of band 3
   anion exchange protein (DIDS and SITS) inhibited the photosynthesis of
   gametophytes but not that of sporophytes. It was indicated that both
   gametophytes and sporophytes were capable of using HCO3-, which involved
   the external CA activity, and a direct HCO3- use also occurred in the
   former, but the latter showed a greater capacity of HCO3- use than the
   former. In addition, male and female gametophytes did not show great
   differences in the inorganic carbon uptake mechanism underlying
   photosynthesis.},

Abstract = {The limestones of the Calabozo Formation of early Callovian age, crop
   out in the Neuquen Basin, southwestern Mendoza Province, Argentina.
   Facies/microfacies analysis at Arroyo El Plomo, west of Malargue, shows
   that the limestones of the Calabozo Formation originated during a
   transgressive/regressive episode over the delta-margin facies of the
   Lajas Formation (late Bajocian-Callovian), with a change from
   siliciclastic to carbonate sedimentation. An extensive layer of
   floatstone marks the beginning of this stage. Within a ramp environment,
   a well represented mid-ramp subenvironment can be distinguished,
   consisting of a subtidal facies arrangement (wackestones,, packstones,
   packstones with channels and floatstones) and an inner ramp
   subenvironment, characterized by a system of ooidal bars (grainstones)
   with tidal channels (floatstones) and predominantly intertidal facies
   passing into peritidal, and supratidal facies (boundstones). Three
   shallowing-upward cycles were recognized, the lower and middle ones
   being characteristic of the mid-ramp. The upper cycle is the best
   developed and consists of a middle ramp lower hemicycle and an inner
   ramp upper hemicycle. The Calabozo Formation is capped by deposits
   corresponding to a supratidal environment with restricted circulation,
   on top of which the evaporitic succession of the early Callovian
   Tabanos; Formation is developed.},

Journal = {SOLA},

Abstract = {In this study, we use observational data and numerical models to reveal
   whether foehn wind affects the record-breaking high-temperature event
   (41.1 degrees C) at Kumagaya on July 23, 2018. On this day, the weather
   conditions at Kumagaya satisfied the conditions described in Takane et
   al. (2014) for a likely extreme high temperature (EHT) day: a
   ``whale-tail{''} pressure pattern, no precipitation for 6 days, a high
   potential temperature at 850 hPa, and northerly surface winds. Our
   back-trajectory analysis shows that the air parcels came to Kumagaya
   from heights up to 3.0 km above sea level over the Sea of Japan. The
   Lagrangian energy budget analysis shows that adiabatic heating accounts
   for about 87.5\% of the increase of the thermal energy given to the air
   parcel, with the rest from diabetic heating. The diabatic heating is
   caused by heating associated with surface sensible heat flux and the
   mixing by turbulent diffusion. The adiabatic and diabetic heating arc
   calculated to have raised the temperature of air parcel by 14 and 2.0 K,
   respectively, for this EHT event. We conclude that the dynamic foehn
   effect and diabetic heating from the surface, together with mixing in
   the atmospheric boundary layer, affected the formation of this EHT
   event.},

Title = {Photovoltaic penetration in isolated thermoelectric power plants in
   Brazil: Power regulation and specific consumption aspects},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Isolated large communities in the Amazon region of Brazil are power by
   Islanded grids powered by diesel generator systems. The costs of these
   systems are high due to the complex and unreliable fuel supply chain.
   Including large-scale photovoltaic installations in these isolated grids
   have the potential to increase the reliability and reduce the cost of
   electricity. This paper investigates the impact of PV generation
   insertion on the specific consumption of isolated thermoelectric power
   plants. A diesel thermoelectric power plant (DTPP) of 4 MW, supplying
   electric energy to an isolated grid, was used as a case study. Five
   Photovoltaic penetration levels are evaluated, considering the
   operational regulatory constraints, three diesel generators (A, B and
   C), two daily solar irradiance profiles and annual solar irradiance
   profiles, and two dispatch strategies. The power plant loading range is
   bounded by the Brazilian regulatory framework to comply with fuel
   consumption efficiency measures and to guarantee the reliable operation.
   In the evaluated scenarios, PV penetration was not subject to power
   curtailment measures controlled by the DTPP. However, the power plant
   loading range considers both variation of photovoltaic generation and
   load. The results presented in this paper indicate that maintaining a
   higher number of machines in operation can make the DTPP more reliable
   to absorb the PV generation variations, enabling the growth of the PV
   penetration on the electric system, reducing the DTPP?s fuel consumption
   and return on investment (payback) of the PV system without change
   significantly the DTPP?s specific consumption. The results also show
   that the quality of the diesel generator is more important to keep
   specific fuel consumption low than the dispatch strategy used for a
   given PV penetration. The replacement of Generator A (less efficient)
   for B (more efficient) together the PV penetration of 50\%, for example,
   can achieve a yearly fuel consumption reduction superior to 1 million
   liters. For the same PV penetration, an average annual reduction of 0.78
   million liters in DTPP?s fuel consumption can be reached, with PayBacks
   that could come close to 1.4 years.},

Abstract = {The effect of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain PTCC 1403 as a
   potential probiotic was investigated on the growth, hematobiochemical,
   immune responses, and resistance to Yersinia ruckeri infection in
   rainbow trout. A total of 240 fish were distributed into 12 fiberglass
   tanks representing four groups (x 3 replicates). Each tank was stocked
   with 20 fish (average initial weight: 11.81 +/- 0.32 g) and fed L.
   lactis subsp. lactis PTCC 1403 at 0 (control, T0), 1 x 10(9) (T1), 2 x
   10(9) (T2), and 3 x 10(9) (T3) CFU/g feed for 8 weeks. The results
   showed enhanced protein efficiency ratio and reduced feed conversion
   ratio in the fish-fed T2 diet. Further, fish-fed T2 and T3 diets showed
   a significantly higher survival rate than the control (p < 0.05).
   Trypsin, lipase, and protease activities were increased in fish-fed L.
   lactis subsp. lactis PTCC 1403 compared to the control (p < 0.05). Fish
   fed with a T2 diet showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower glucose content
   than other groups. The blood lysozyme activity and IgM showed
   significantly (p < 0.05) higher values in fish-fed T2 and T3 diets than
   in other groups. The antioxidative responses were increased in fish-fed
   T2 and T3 diets (p < 0.05). After 7 days post-Y. ruckeri challenge, the
   cumulative mortality rate showed the lowest value in fish fed with T1
   and T2 diets, while the highest value was recorded in the control group.
   In conclusion, the results revealed beneficial effects of L. lactis
   subsp. lactis PTCC 1403 on the feed efficiency, immune response, and
   resistance to Y. ruckeri infection in rainbow trout.},

Abstract = {Biofuels from algae are considered as promising alternatives of
   conventional fossil fuels, as they can eliminate most of the
   environmental problems. The present study focuses on all the possible
   avenues of biofuels production through biochemical and thermochemical
   conversion methods in one place, bringing together both microalgae and
   macroalgae on the same platform. It provides a brief overview on the
   mechanism of different biofuel production from algae. Factors affecting
   the biofuel process and the associated challenges have been highlighted
   alongwith analysis of techno-economic study available in literature.
   Undoubtly, biodiesel is the center of attraction among other biofuels.
   However, their routes and process need to be optimized in order to bring
   the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of biodiesel competitive.
   Technological challenges have not been overcome to make biofuel
   production process energetically and commercially viable. Macroalgae are
   low in lipid content. Therefore, the use of macro algae is restricted
   for gaseous fuels or fermentative methods of liquid biofuels production.
   Anaerobic digestion of algal biomass is easy and seems promising as the
   process is simple in terms of engineering and infrastructure
   requirement. Hydrogen production by microalgae through biophotolysis
   seems interesting as it directly converts the solar energy into
   hydrogen. However, the process has not been scaled-up till today.
   Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is more promising due to handling of wet
   biomass at moderate temperature and pressure and conversion of whole
   biomass into high quality oil. However, HTL process is energy intensive.

Abstract = {Climate-driven changes in the marine ecosystem largely influence the
   distribution, abundance, and the consequent availability of marine
   resources to the fishery. In this study, we examined the potential
   habitat distributions of the neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii)
   under the projected impacts of ocean warming. We used the sea surface
   temperature (SST) from the three CMIP5 climate scenarios (RCP4.5,
   RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) with the low to high future emissions. Based on the
   squid habitat models, SST showed the highest effect on the present
   potential squid habitat distribution that accounted for at least 60\% of
   the predicted spatial patterns from May to July 2000-2010. This result
   underpinned the species' high sensitivity to the temperature changes in
   its feeding environments. Moreover, the projected future potential squid
   habitats revealed pronounced differences in the spatial and temporal
   patterns relative to the present habitat distributions across the
   different regions of the western and central North Pacific. The future
   squid habitat predictions revealed a net reduction in the suitable squid
   habitat coupled with the corresponding northward habitat retreat.
   Moreover, the magnitude of the predicted habitat changes was
   proportional to the levels of warming for the representative periods
   from May to July 2025, 2050, and 2100. The highest decrease in the
   spatial extent and poleward retreat of the potential squid habitat were
   observed from May to July 2100 under the RCP 8.5 scenario. These trends
   could translate to shorter squid fishing periods and offshore shifts of
   the squid fishing grounds. Thus, insights into the future
   spatio-temporal patterns and trajectories of the potential squid
   habitats could lend important implications on the availability of squid
   resources to the fishery and subsequent evaluation of squid fishery
   management options under climate change.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic neurobehavioral
   disorder presenting hypothalamic dysfunction and adiposity. At rest, PWS
   exhibits hypoventilation with hypercapnia. We characterized ventilatory
   responses in children with PWS during exercise. Methods: Participants
   were children aged 7-12 years with PWS (n = 8) and without PWS with
   normal weight (NW; n = 9, body mass index <= 85th percentile) or obesity
   (n = 9, body mass index >= 95th percentile). Participants completed
   three 5-minute ambulatory bouts at 3.2, 4.0, and 4.8 km/h. Oxygen
   uptake, carbon dioxide output, ventilation, breathing frequency, and
   tidal volume were recorded. Results: PWS had slightly higher oxygen
   uptake (L/min) at 3.2 km/h {[}0.65 (0.46-1.01) vs 0.49 (0.34-0.83)] and
   at 4.8 km/h {[}0.89 (0.62-1.20) vs 0.63 (0.45-0.97)] than NW. PWS had
   higher ventilation (L/min) at 3.2 km/h {[}16.2 (13.0-26.5) vs 11.5
   (8.4-17.5)], at 4.0 km/h {[}16.4 (13.9-27.9) vs 12.7 (10.3-19.5)], and
   at 4.8 km/h {[}19.7 (17.4-31.8) vs 15.2 (9.5-21.6)] than NW. PWS had
   greater breathing frequency (breaths/min) at 3.2 km/h {[}38 (29-53) vs
   29 (22-35)], at 4.0 km/h {[}39 (29-58) vs 29 (23-39)], and at 4.8 km/h
   {[}39 (33-58) vs 32 (23-42)], but similar tidal volume and
   ventilation/carbon dioxide output to NW. Conclusion: PWS did not show
   impaired ventilatory responses to exercise. Hyperventilation in PWS may
   relate to excessive neural stimulation and metabolic cost.},

Abstract = {From 2002 to 2009, a morphosedimentary survey of trailing accumulations
   forming comet tails was conducted on Trielen and Lez ar Chrizienn
   Islands in the archipelago of Molene (Brittany, France). In addition, an
   analysis of hydrodynamics, based on tidal and wave data obtained from
   modelling and field measurements, was carried out. These trailing
   beaches are no longer actively supplied with sediments from the
   nearshore platform. Therefore, their morphosedimentary evolution
   consists in a reworking of the current stock mainly dependent on
   hydrodynamic conditions. When storm waves occur in conjunction with high
   spring tides, sediment is transported from east to west. Offshore waves
   blocked and refracted by Ouessant Island take a meridian direction and
   attack the north-eastern tip of the comet tails. Sediment transport in
   the direction of western incident waves occurs only during periods of
   low wave energy. From 2002 to 2009, for both accumulations, the net
   longshore transport of sediment has been heading in the opposite
   direction to the one that prevailed during their construction. This type
   of morphosedimentary dynamics corresponds to a process of
   `cannibalisation' peculiar to all trailing beaches that are no longer
   supplied with sediments. Analysis of hydrodynamic conditions shows a
   lack of relationship between the morphosedimentary changes and the North
   Atlantic Oscillation. The conjunction of storms and high spring tides
   seems to be much more relevant.},

Abstract = {This article reviews recent progress in semi-arid climate change
   research in China. Results indicate that the areas of semi-arid regions
   have increased rapidly during recent years in China, with an increase of
   33\% during 1994-2008 compared to 1948-62. Studies have found that the
   expansion rate of semi-arid areas over China is nearly 10 times higher
   than that of arid and sub-humid areas, and is mainly transformed from
   sub-humid/humid regions. Meanwhile, the greatest warming during the past
   100 years has been observed over semi-arid regions in China, and mainly
   induced by radiatively forced processes. The intensity of the regional
   temperature response over semi-arid regions has been amplified by
   land-atmosphere interactions and human activities. The decadal climate
   variation in semi-arid regions is modulated by oceanic oscillations,
   which induce land-sea and north-south thermal contrasts and affect the
   intensities of westerlies, planetary waves and blocking frequencies. In
   addition, the drier climates in semi-arid regions across China are also
   associated with the weakened East Asian summer monsoon in recent years.
   Moreover, dust aerosols in semi-arid regions may have altered
   precipitation by affecting the local energy and hydrological cycles.
   Finally, semi-arid regions in China are projected to continuously expand
   in the 21st century, which will increase the risk of desertification in
   the near future.},

Abstract = {Light variation in temporal and spatial domains is a key constraint on
   the photosynthetic performance of phytoplankton. The most obvious
   responses are the modification of cell pigment content either to improve
   photo capture or to mitigate photo-damage. Very few studies have
   analyzed whether light variation significantly alters carbon
   assimilation, especially in a fluctuating light environment as in the
   mixed layer of the ocean. We addressed the question using a modeling
   approach, which allows the reproduction of most of the possible
   scenarios, obtained with great difficulty from laboratory or field
   experiments. The complete model is based on the dynamic coupling of a
   photoacclimation and photodamage-repair responses. In this combined
   model the virtual phytoplankton is exposed to different light regimes
   (steady, square wave, sinusoidal light-dark cycles and fluctuating
   regimes). The results reconcile controversial results on different
   photacclimation states achieved during fluctuating light regimes. The
   model produces a depression of carbon assimilation in any light
   fluctuating scenario, as compared to steady light regimes, due to the
   temporal delay between light fluctuations and photo responses. These
   results suggest the possibility of selective pressure during evolution,
   more effective on photoprotective mechanisms than on optimization of
   light harvesting. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A Round Robin Tests program is being undertaken within the EC MaRINET2
   initiative. This programme studies the used facility influence can have
   on the performance evaluation of a horizontal axis tidal turbine
   prototype when it is operated under wave and current conditions. In this
   paper, we present the design of experiments that is used throughout the
   work programme and the results related to the flow characterisation
   obtained at the Ifremer wave and current circulating tank, the Cnr-Inm
   wave towing tank and the ocean research facility FloWave. These
   facilities have been identified to provide adequate geometric conditions
   to accommodate a 0.724 m diameter turbine operating at flow velocities
   of 0.8 and 1.0 m/s. The set-up is replicated in each of the facilities
   with exemption of the amount of flow measuring instruments. Intrinsic
   differences in creating wave and currents between facilities are found.
   Flow velocities are up to 10\% higher than the nominal values and wave
   amplitudes higher than the target values by up to a factor of 2. These
   discrepancies are related to the flow and wave generation methods used
   at each facility. When the flow velocity is measured besides the rotor,
   the velocity presents an increase of 8\% compared to the upstream
   measurements.},

Title = {Variations of soil profile characteristics due to varying time spans
   since ice retreat in the inner Nordfjord, western Norway},
Journal = {SOLID EARTH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {485-498},
Abstract = {In the Erdalen and Bodalen drainage basins located in the inner
   Nordfjord in western Norway the soils were formed after deglaciation.
   The climate in the uppermost valley areas is sub-arctic oceanic, and the
   lithology consists of Precambrian granitic orthogneisses on which
   Leptosols and Regosols are the most common soils. The Little Ice Age
   glacier advance affected parts of the valleys with the maximum glacier
   extent around AD 1750. In this study five sites on moraine and colluvium
   materials were selected to examine main soil properties, grain size
   distribution, soil organic carbon and pH to assess if soil profile
   characteristics and patterns of fallout radionuclides (FRNs) and
   environmental radionuclides (ERNs) are affected by different stages of
   ice retreat. The Leptosols on the moraines are shallow, poorly developed
   and vegetated with moss and small birches. The two selected profiles
   show different radionuclide activities and grain size distribution. The
   sampled soils on the colluviums outside the LIA glacier limit became
   ice-free during the Preboral. The Regosols present better-developed
   profiles, thicker organic horizons and are fully covered by grasses.
   Activity of Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) concentrate at the topsoil and
   decrease sharply with depth. The grain size distribution of these soils
   also reflects the difference in geomorphic processes that have affected
   the colluvium sites. Significantly lower mass activities of FRNs were
   found in soils on the moraines than on colluviums. Variations of ERN
   activities in the valleys were related to characteristics of soil
   mineralogical composition. These results indicate differences in soil
   development that are consistent with the age of ice retreat. In
   addition, the pattern distribution of Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) activities
   differs in the soils related to the LIA glacier limits in the drainage
   basins.},

Title = {Factors controlling the geochemical partitioning of trace metals in
   estuarine sediments},
Journal = {SOIL \& SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-276},
Abstract = {The geochemical partitioning of trace metals in sediments is of great
   importance in risk assessment and remedial investigation. Selected
   factors that may control the partitioning behavior of Cu, Pb and Zn in
   non-sulfidic, estuarine sediments were examined with the use of combined
   sorption curve-sequential extraction analysis. This approach, which has
   not been previously used to examine estuarine sediments, allowed
   determination of sorption parameters for Cu, Pb and Zn partitioning to
   individual geochemical fractions. Partitioning behavior in sulfidic
   sediments was also determined by sequentially extracting Cu, Pb, and Zn
   from synthetic sulfide minerals and from natural sediment and pure
   quartz sand after spiking with acid-volatile sulfide (AVS). Trace metal
   sorption to the ``carbonate ``fraction (pH5, NaOAc extraction) increased
   with metal loading due to saturation of sorption sites associated with
   the ``Fe-oxide{''} (NH(2) OH center dot HCl extraction) and
   ``organic{''} (H(2)O(2) extraction) fractions in non-sulfidic sediments.
   Freundlich parameters describing sorption to the ``Fe-oxide{''} and
   ``organic{''} fractions were controlled by the sediment Fe-oxide and
   organic carbon content, respectively. Sequential extraction of Cu from
   pure CuS, AVS-spiked sediment and AVS-spiked quartz sand showed that
   AVS-bound Cu was quantitatively recovered in association with the
   ``organic{''} fraction. However some AVS-bound Pb and Zn were recovered
   by the NH(2)OH center dot HCl step (which has been previously
   interpreted as ``Fe-oxide{''} bound metals) in the sequential extraction
   procedure used in this study. This indicates that the sequential
   extraction of Job and Zn in sulfidic sediments may lead to AVS-bound
   metals being mistaken as Fe-oxide bound species. Caution should
   therefore be exercised when interpreting sequential extraction results
   for Pb and Zn in anoxic sediments.},

Abstract = {In a community, ethics have a connection with religion. A person whose
   religion is vital would respect the ethics associated with that
   religion. Along with the current technology development, community
   ethics have begun to change, whether quickly or slowly. In a community,
   this change of ethics happens because it follows the development within
   modernism and globalization. This study explores the ethical
   identification of Muslim women in Mandangin Island, Madura Island, East
   Java. This study uses an ethnographic method that refers to Spradley's.
   Data obtained from interviews with female informants who are
   categorized: adolescents, mothers, and grandmothers. Based on this
   research data, it is known that there are three ethics of Muslim women
   in Mandangin Island. First, they uphold ethics, who into this group
   (from young to old) do not want to ride a motorbike and wear jeans that
   are respected on and off the island. Second, those who carry out an
   ethical transformation, in this group, they (teenagers) adhere to
   manners while on Mandangin Island; however, they ride motorbikes and
   wear jeans outside the island. On the one hand, those who fall into this
   category want to appreciate and uphold ethics in the people of Mandangin
   Island and want to follow modernism. They want to be able to ride
   motorbikes and wear jeans like most women. Third, those who violate
   ethics. It is most unusual for the third category because Muslim women
   consider themselves to adhere to religion and ethics.},

Abstract = {Urban design and local boundary conditions have been detected to
   significantly affect the local microclimate and, therefore, the
   environmental quality of urban areas. In this view, the purpose of the
   present work is to investigate the local microclimate variation in
   historic districts with respect to the surrounding areas situated in the
   same temperate climate zone. To this aim, four areas around a historical
   city center in Italy were monitored during surruner 2015 and
   investigated through microclimate simulation in summer and winter
   conditions. After the experimental monitoring, that allowed to
   characterize the main microclimate parameters of each case study area, a
   calibrated numerical analysis was performed in order to assess the Urban
   Heat Island (UHI) intensity of the historical district and the
   implementation passive mitigation techniques. Therefore, the
   effectiveness of thermal storage solutions as innovative UHI mitigation
   technique was studied by simulating the implementation of Phase Change
   Materials (PCMs) within (i) the buildings' walls and (ii) the outdoor
   pavement of the historic neighborhood. Thermal benefits due to the
   application of phase change materials were detected both in summer and
   winter. In surruner, the high-capacity PCMs integrated pavement is able
   to reduce the outdoor air temperature by a maximum of about-0.3 K. On
   the other hand, in winter, the increased thermal storage potential seems
   to mitigate the nighttime cooling.},

Title = {Moving beyond LCOE: impact of various financing methods on PV
   profitability for SIDS},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {749-758},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) have some of the highest
   electricity tariffs globally. Renewable energy (RE) technologies could
   thus have reached grid parity in various SIDS. Furthermore, the
   abundance of resources such as solar and wind provides ample potential
   for SIDS to switch from high cost diesel generators to renewables.
   Despite favourable conditions, RE remains a largely underinvested sector
   in these regions. This paper aims to undercover the reasons why grid
   parity does not necessary translate into private sector investments in
   RE. With a focus on SIDS, this paper presents an evidence that achieving
   grid parity based on LCOE estimates is an incomplete benchmark for
   decision making in the power generation industry. In particular, LCOE
   and grid parity do not take into account financing constraints of RE
   projects which are often more pronounced compared to conventional forms
   of power generation. This paper thus presents the business perspective
   of RE projects, by employing a discounted cashflow model that includes
   various profitability metrics and effects of taxation and depreciation.
   The study shows that financing conditions exert strong influence on the
   economic feasibility of solar projects, both in LCOE terms and
   profitability terms. Thus, key policies should be targeted at improving
   financing conditions to ensure mobilization of private sector finances
   in solar PV. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We report results of Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements at the
   Furnas and Pogo (Agua de Pan) Volcanoes, Sao Miguel island, Azores. GPS
   surveys were carried out in 1993, 1994, and 1997. The GPS network
   consists of 16 stations that are mainly distributed in the vicinity of
   the Furnas Volcano. The measurements indicate slow-progressing ground
   deformation of the Furnas Volcano in 1993-1997. We propose two
   alternative hypotheses to explain the observations. The first one
   assumes a source of inflation located northwest of the Furnas caldera,
   since there part of the GPS network seems to expand. The second
   hypothesis invokes a combination of two processes as being responsible
   for the observed deformation pattern; plate divergence between the
   Eurasian and African plates together with a deflation of the Furnas
   caldera. The inferred plate boundary deformation zone is narrow with
   75\% of the 4 mm/yr full plate spreading probably being accommodated
   over the 10-km width of Sao Miguel island. GPS stations at Fogo show
   displacements towards its caldera, indicating slight deflation of the
   volcano, possibly due to a pressure decrease in a shallow magma chamber
   or to extraction of water and steam from the ground by a nearby
   geothermal power plant. Further geodetic observations are needed,
   spanning a longer time interval, in order to distinguish between
   different hypotheses. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {The Influence of Storm Events on Metabolism and Water Quality of
   Riverine and Estuarine Segments of the James, Mattaponi, and Pamunkey
   Rivers},

Abstract = {The frequency and magnitude of storm events is expected to increase with
   climate warming. Tidal freshwaters may be particularly sensitive to
   these events owing to their proximity to riverine inputs. Continuous and
   synoptic water quality data from riverine and tidal freshwater segments
   of the James, Mattaponi, and Pamunkey Rivers (Virginia, USA) were
   analyzed to characterize their response to high discharge events. Water
   quality attributes subject to dilution effects (conductivity, pH) showed
   negative responses to increasing discharge, which were similar in
   magnitude among riverine and estuarine segments. Variables associated
   with sediment transport (turbidity, TSS,E. coli, TN, and TP) showed
   positive responses to discharge, stronger responses in riverine vs.
   estuarine segments, and relatively linear responses over the full range
   of discharge. Variables affected by internal biological processes (CHLa,
   DO) showed negative responses to increasing discharge, greater
   sensitivity in the low range of discharge, and stronger responses in
   estuarine segments. High discharge was associated with reduced
   chlorophyll-a (CHLa), lower dissolved oxygen, and more heterotrophic
   conditions (lower production relative to respiration). During unusually
   high discharge in 2018, annual GPP was reduced to 38\% (Pamunkey) and
   78\% (James) of long-term average values. Inter-estuarine differences in
   their sensitivity to high discharge reflect differences in forms of
   primary production, as the phytoplankton-dominated James exhibited rapid
   recovery in CHLa and GPP between storm events.},

Title = {The Power of Electricity: How Effective Is It in Promoting Sustainable
   Development in Rural Off-Grid Islands in the Philippines?},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Electrification plays a crucial role in the advancement of rural
   communities but establishing its impact to the communities' sustainable
   development remains a challenge. This paper presents a pragmatic
   framework for assessing how electrification affects sustainable
   development at the grassroots level with eight indicators in the
   economic, technical, social, and environmental dimensions highlighted.
   An exploratory factor analysis approach is applied to determine how
   these dimensions contribute to the community's overall sustainable
   development. The framework is applied in two islands in the Philippines
   of less than 500 households and varying electrification levels. Results
   indicate that Gilutongan Island, which has less than 24-h electricity
   access rarely find productive uses of electricity and still make use of
   conventional fuels for lighting. Meanwhile, Cobrador Island, which has
   24-h access see improvements in almost all aspects, although they are
   slightly burdened by the unaffordability of tariffs. This means that
   islands with limited hours for electricity access rarely experience
   positive impacts to their socioeconomic development while the opposite
   is true for islands with longer access. The framework can be a useful
   tool for decision- and policy-makers to assess electrification in rural
   off-grid communities and to streamline efforts in helping these
   communities achieve sustainable development.},

Title = {Organic geochemical and palynological evidence for terrigenous origin of
   the organic matter in Aegean Sea sapropel S1},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {153},
Number = {1-4},
Pages = {303-318},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Organic geochemistry and micropaleontology are used to determine the
   origin of sapropel S1 in the Aegean Sea. Low-molecular-weight (C-15,
   C-17 and C-19) n-alkane data show that net primary productivity (NPP)
   increased from similar to 14,000 to 10,000 yr BP at the glacial
   interglacial transition, but the onset of S1 at 9600 yr BP marks a sharp
   decline in NPP, which remained low until similar to 8200 yr BP. The
   start of sapropel deposition is marked by increased total organic carbon
   (TOC) and pollen-spore concentrations, together with increased
   high-molecular-weight (C-27, C-29, C-31 and C-33) n-alkanes. Pollen
   assemblages show large influx of tree pollen from central-northern
   European forests. Increases in high-molecular-weight n-alkanes suggest
   greater influx of fresh vascular plant material at the start of S1,
   although the amount is small compared to other insoluble organic matter.
   Palynological studies showed that most of this insoluble organic matter
   are flocks of dark-brown amorphous kerogen, typical of terrigenous humic
   compounds. From similar to 8200 yr BP to the top of S1 at similar to
   6400 yr BP, there is a decline in high-molecular-weight n-alkanes and
   terrigenous kerogen, and an increase in low-molecular-weight n-alkanes,
   suggesting that NPP recovered during the later deposition of S1 in the
   Aegean Sea. The increase in low-molecular-weight n-alkanes coincides
   with the recovery of coccolithophores and dinoflagellates, suggesting
   that these phytoplankton are primarily responsible for the
   low-molecular-weight n-alkane variations. These data from the Aegean Sea
   support the model for sapropel deposition resulting from increased
   influx of TOC during times of stagnant bottom water, but disagree with
   Mediterranean models prescribing a large increase in marine
   productivity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the displacement of coalbed methane by CO2 migration
   along a fault into the coal seam in the Yaojie coalfield. Coal and gas
   samples were collected continuously at various distances in NO.2 coal
   seam from F19 fault. Vitrinite reflectance, maceral, and pore
   distributions and proximate analysis of fourteen coal samples were
   performed. Gas components, concentrations, carbon isotopes of 28 gas
   samples were determined. We examined the coal-gas trace characteristics
   of coalbed methane displaced away from the fault by CO2 injection after
   geological ages. From east to west, away from the F19 fault, the CO2
   concentration decreased, whereas the CH4 concentration increased
   gradually. The C-13 values for CO2 varied between -9.94 parts per
   thousand and 1.12 parts per thousand, suggesting a metamorphic origin. A
   wider range of 13CCO2 values (from -9.94 parts per thousand to 20 parts
   per thousand) was associated with the mixing of microbial carbon
   dioxide, isotopic fractionation during CO2 migration through the
   microporous structures of coals, and/or carbon isotope fractionation
   during gas-water exchange and dissolution of CO2. Away from the F19
   fault, the volumes of micropores, mesopores and macropores decrease
   gradually. The Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) micropore volume decreased from
   0.0059 to 0.0037cm(3)g(-1), and the mesopore and macropore volumes
   decreased from 0.066 to 0.026cm(3)g(-1). The CO2 injection can mobilize
   aromatic hydrocarbons and mineral matter from coal matrix, resulting in
   the decrease in the absorption peak intensity for coal samples after
   supercritical CO2 treatment, which indicates that chemical reactions
   occur between coal and CO2, not only physical adsorption.},

Title = {Changes in prey fields increase the potential for spatial overlap

Abstract = {AIM: Management of competition with predators is an important
   consideration for fisheries, particularly within marine protected areas
   (MPAs) where conservation is a primary objective. We aimed to test
   whether static no-take zones within a large, sustainable-use MPA
   prevented overlap between gentoo penguins and a krill fishery during two
   winters with contrasting prey fields.
   LOCATION: South Georgia, Southwest Atlantic Ocean.
   METHOD: We used satellite tracking (N = 16, June-September 2018) to
   describe gentoo penguin movements and distribution and quantified their
   overlap with the MPA's no-take zone (NTZ) and the krill fishing grounds.
   DNA metabarcoding of scats (N = 220, April-September 2018) was used to
   quantify diet.
   RESULTS: When krill were at moderate densities and evenly distributed in
   2001, gentoo penguins would have spent all of their time within the 12
   NM NTZ, but when availability was low in 2018, they spent 46.3\% of
   their time outside the NTZ and 9.6\% within the krill fishing grounds.
   The extension of the NTZ to 30 km in response to this finding would have
   produced a 14.9\% increase in protection for penguins and displaced 4\%
   of fishery hauls. Gentoo penguin diet comprised 25.8\% krill, which is
   lower than in the late 1980s but more than in 2009.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Gentoo penguins extend their foraging range when krill
   is scarce, which increases the potential for spatial overlap with the
   krill fishery during periods of nutritional stress. Current regulations
   allow for expansion of both extent and catches by the krill fishery and,
   should this occur, gentoo penguins may face heightened risks from
   competition. A dynamic ocean management framework, that extends closed
   areas in response to near real-time data on penguin movements and krill
   density estimates, may reduce the potential for competition in this
   sustainable-use MPA while allowing a profitable krill fishery.},

Title = {Modeling of the anthropogenic heat flux and its effect on regional

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic heat (AH) emissions from human activities caused by
   urbanization can affect the city environment. Based on the energy
   consumption and the gridded demographic data, the spatial distribution
   of AH emission over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is estimated.
   Meanwhile, a new method for the AH parameterization is developed in the
   WRF/Chem model, which incorporates the gridded AH emission data with the
   seasonal and diurnal variations into the simulations. By running this
   upgraded WRF/Chem for 2 typical months in 2010, the impacts of AH on the
   meteorology and air quality over the YRD region are studied. The results
   show that the AH fluxes over the YRD have been growing in recent
   decades. In 2010, the annual-mean values of AH over Shanghai, Jiangsu
   and Zhejiang are 14.46, 2.61 and 1.63aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2), respectively,
   with the high value of 113.5aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2) occurring in the urban
   areas of Shanghai. These AH emissions can significantly change the urban
   heat island and urban-breeze circulations in the cities of the YRD
   region. In Shanghai, 2aEuro-m air temperature increases by 1.6aEuro-A
   degrees C in January and 1.4aEuro-A degrees C in July, the PBLH
   (planetary boundary layer height) rises up by 140aEuro-m in January and
   160aEuro-m in July, and 10aEuro-m wind speed is enhanced by
   0.7aEuro-maEuro-s(-1) in January and 0.5aEuro-maEuro-s(-1) in July, with
   a higher increment at night. The enhanced vertical movement can
   transport more moisture to higher levels, which causes the decrease in
   water vapor at ground level and the increase in the upper PBL (planetary
   boundary layer), and thereby induces the accumulative precipitation to
   increase by 15-30aEuro-\% over the megacities in July. The adding of AH
   can impact the spatial and vertical distributions of the simulated
   pollutants as well. The concentrations of primary air pollutants
   decrease near the surface and increase at the upper levels, due mainly
   to the increases in PBLH, surface wind speed and upward air vertical
   movement. But surface O-3 concentrations increase in the urban areas,
   with maximum changes of 2.5aEuro-ppb in January and 4aEuro-ppb in July.
   Chemical direct (the rising up of air temperature directly accelerates
   surface O-3 formation) and indirect (the decrease in NOx at the ground
   results in the increase in surface O-3) effects can play a significant
   role in O-3 changes over this region. The meteorology and air pollution
   predictions in and around large urban areas are highly sensitive to the
   anthropogenic heat inputs, suggesting that AH should be considered in
   the climate and air quality assessments.},

Abstract = {With the actual mean free path for radiation in air and a simplified
   nuclear device, a one-dimension simulation research on fireball
   phenomenon in a sea level atmosphere is carried out based on the
   multi-group radiation hydrodynamic codes (RDMG). It is shown that our
   theoretical calculations can describe the whole process of the fireball
   evolution for strong explosions from the early X-ray expansion stage to
   the shock wave propagation stage. The radius of the shock wave and the
   brightness of the fireball are in good agreement with the experimental
   results. The whole thermal radiation power curve of the fireball
   evolution for strong atmospheric explosion at sea level is plotted for
   the first time. The impact of radiation opacity of the nuclear device
   material on the early fireball phenomenon is also studied. It is found
   that trajectories of the radiation fronts and case shocks change with
   the opacity of equivalent device material. From our simulations, we find
   that only the early fireball depends on the details of the nuclear
   device, and after the formation of main shock, the evolution is
   determined by the properties of hot air for strong atmospheric
   explosion.},

Abstract = {The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ES-MValTool), a community
   diagnostics and performance metrics tool for evaluation and analysis of
   Earth system models (ESMs), is designed to facilitate a more
   comprehensive and rapid comparison of single or multiple models
   participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The
   ESM results can be compared against observations or reanalysis data as
   well as against other models including predecessor versions of the same
   model. The updated and extended version (v2.0) of the ESMValTool
   includes several new analysis scripts such as large-scale diagnostics
   for evaluation of ESMs as well as diagnostics for extreme events,
   regional model and impact evaluation. In this paper, the newly
   implemented climate metrics such as effective climate sensitivity (ECS)
   and transient climate response (TCR) as well as emergent constraints for
   various climate-relevant feedbacks and diagnostics for future
   projections from ESMs are described and illustrated with examples using
   results from the well-established model ensemble CMIP5. The emergent
   constraints implemented include constraints on ECS, snow-albedo effect,
   climate-carbon cycle feedback, hydrologic cycle intensification, future
   Indian summer monsoon precipitation and year of disappearance of summer
   Arctic sea ice. The diagnostics included in ESMValTool v2.0 to analyze
   future climate projections from ESMs further include analysis scripts to
   reproduce selected figures of chapter 12 of the Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and various
   multi-model statistics.},

Abstract = {A patchlike structure of low-salinity water detached from the Chanjiang
   ``Diluted Water{''} (CDW) is frequently observed in the East China Sea
   (ECS). In this study, the offshore detachment process of CDW into the
   ECS is examined using a three-dimensional numerical model. The model
   results show that low-salinity water is detached from the CDW plume by
   the intense tide-induced vertical mixing during the spring tide period
   when the tidal current becomes stronger. During the spring tide,
   thickness of the bottom mixed layer in the sloping bottom around
   Changjiang Bank reaches the mean water depth, implying that the
   stratification is completely destroyed in the entire water column. As a
   result, the offshore detachment of CDW occurs in the sloping side of the
   bank where the tidal energy dissipation is strong enough to overcome the
   buoyancy effect during this period. On the other hand, the surface
   stratification is retrieved during the neap tide period, because the
   tidal current becomes substantially weaker than that in the spring tide.
   Wind forcing over the ECS as well as tidal mixing is a critical factor
   for the detachment process because the surface wind primarily induces a
   northeastward CDW transport across the shelf region where tide-induced
   vertical mixing is strong. Moreover, the wind-enhanced cross-isobath
   transport of CDW causes a larger offshore low-salinity patch, indicating
   that the freshwater volume of the low-salinity patch closely depends on
   the wind magnitude.},

Title = {The impact of heterotrophic bacteria on recalcitrant dissolved organic
   carbon formation in a typical karstic river},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {815},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) resulting from microbial
   carbon (MCPs) holds promise as a relatively long-term natural carbon
   sink in marine environments. However, the RDOC formation mechanism
   remains uncertain in terrestrial aquatic systems. To determine the
   microbial impacts on autochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC), RDOC
   formation, and the critical influencing bacteria species, spatial
   changes in hydrochemistry, carbon isotopes, and microbial diversity were
   investigated in water samples from the karstic Lijiang River, southwest
   China. Samples were collected at various locations along the river
   system in May and July 2017. The biodegradable DOC (BDOC), RDOC, soil
   sourced DOC (SDOC), submerged aquatic vascular plant sourced DOC (PDOC)
   and microbial sourced DOC (MDOC) were calculated using the in-situ
   microbial incubation method, stable carbon isotopes and C/N ratio. RDOC
   accounted for 67\% to 93\% of DOC concentrations, measuring 1.3 mg/L and
   1.2 mg/L in May and July, respectively. In May, BDOC concentrations
   increased by 0.05 mg/L from 0.18 mg/L to 0.23 mg/L, but decreased by
   0.43 mg/L from 0.66 mg/L to 0.23 mg/L in July. The spatiotemporal
   variation of BDOC indicated photosynthesis was the main BDOC source and
   induced high autochthonous DOC formation, especially in May. However,
   RDOC was the dominant accumulation component in Lijiang River. MDOC
   increased by 0.86 mg/L from 0 to 0.86 mg/L in May and 0.78 mg/L from
   0.10 mg/L to 0.88 mg/L in July, which was the dominant accumulated DOC
   and RDOC component. The abundance of Sporichthyaceae accounted for
   3.4\%-22.6\% in May and Novosphingobium accounted for 3.5\%-34.0\% in
   July. These were the critical bacteria species induced MDOC formation,
   which were confirmed by their abundances in KEGG pathway modules
   determined by PICRUAST2. These results demonstrate that heterotrophic
   bacteria dominate autochthonous DOC and RDOC formation in the karst
   surface river, which is valuable for understanding organic carbon
   cycling in karstic aquatic systems.},

   change. In this study we assess the genetic structure and demographic
   history of the Pacific angel shark, Squatina californica, along the
   northwestern coast of Mexico using the mitochondrial control region.
   Results showed high levels of genetic diversity and reveal genetic
   differentiation between the samples from the Pacific coast of the Baja
   California Peninsula and those from the Gulf of California. These
   genetic differences are consistent with ontogenetic differences
   previously reported for S. californica off the northwestern coast of
   Mexico. Our findings can be explained by the low dispersal ability and
   habitat preference of the angel shark and by the complex geomorphology
   off the northwestern coast of Mexico. Contrasting historical demographic
   patterns were observed: population expansion in the gulf and population
   stability, with a declining trend, in the Pacific; however, more studies
   are required to corroborate demographic patterns in both populations.
   Our results point to 2 distinct management units of the Pacific angel
   shark in the study area, and this may have direct implications for the
   management and conservation of this species in Mexico.},

Abstract = {As a new clean energy resource in the 21st century, natural gas hydrate
   is considered as one of the most promising strategic resources in the
   future. This paper, based on the research progress in exploitation of
   natural gas hydrate (NGH) in China and the world, systematically
   reviewed and discussed the key issues in development of natural gas
   hydrate. From an exploitation point of view, it is recommended that the
   concepts of diagenetic hydrate and non-diagenetic hydrate be introduced.
   The main factors to be considered are whether diagenesis, stability of
   rock skeleton structure, particle size and cementation mode, thus NGHs
   are divided into 6 levels and used unused exploitation methods according
   to different types. The study of the description and quantitative
   characterization of abundance in hydrate enrichment zone, and looking
   for gas hydrate dessert areas with commercial exploitation value should
   be enhanced. The concept of dynamic permeability and characterization of
   the permeability of NGH by time-varying equations should be established.
   The `Three-gas co-production' (natural gas hydrate, shallow gas, and
   conventional gas) may be an effective way to achieve early commercial
   exploitation. Although great progress has been made in the exploitation
   of natural gas hydrate, there still exist enormous challenges in basic
   theory research, production methods, and equipment and operation modes.
   Only through hard and persistent exploration and innovation can natural
   gas hydrate be truly commercially developed on a large scale and
   contribute to sustainable energy supply.},

Title = {Polyoxometalates Facilitating Synthesis of Subnanometer Nanowires},
Journal = {ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {20},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Subnanometer nanowires (SNWs) refer to nanowires with diameters close to
   the size of a single crystal cell. SNWs show not only qualitative change
   in nature compared to the bulk materials or nanomaterials with larger
   size but also show several advantages in assembly and processing due to
   their polymer-analog properties. However, the synthesis of SNWs is still
   a great challenge. Herein, a synthesis method of SNWs assisted by
   polyoxometalates is developed. Based on this method, several kinds of
   SNWs are prepared successfully, and the properties of the SNWs can be
   regulated efficiently and effectively, demonstrating the extensibility
   of this synthesis method. Among these SNWs, Bi2O3-PMoO SNWs show good
   photothermal conversion performance and can be processed into
   freestanding and flexible films through the wet-spinning method. The
   Bi2O3-PMoO SNW films show good performance in solar steam generation and
   seawater desalination. The average stable evaporation rate can reach
   1.38 kg m(-2) h(-1), and the efficiency is approximate to 91.1\% under 1
   sun illumination. The concentration of ions in the desalted seawater
   with the Bi2O3-PMoO SNWs film are reduced by four orders of magnitude,
   meeting the quality standards of drinking water and potential for
   practical utilization of solar energy in the seawater desalination.},

Title = {Long-term changes on estuarine ciliates linked with modifications on
   wind patterns and water turbidity},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {46-55},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Planktonic ciliates constitute a fundamental component among
   microzooplankton and play a prominent role in carbon transport at the
   base of marine food webs. How these organisms respond to shifting
   environmental regimes is unclear and constitutes a current challenge
   under global ocean changes. Here we examine a multi-annual field survey
   covering 25 years in the Bahfa Blanca Estuary (Argentina), a shallow,
   flood-plain system dominated by wind and tidal energy. We found that the
   estuary experienced marked changes in wind dominant regimes and an
   increase in water turbidity driven from the joint effect of persistent
   long-fetch winds and the indirect effect of the Southern Annular Mode.
   Along with these changes, we found that zooplankton components, i.e.
   ciliates and the dominant estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa, showed a
   negative trend during the period 1986-2011. We showed that the combined
   effects of wind and turbidity with other environmental variables
   (chlorophyll, salinity and nutrients) consistently explained the
   variability of observed shifts. Tintinnids were more vulnerable to wind
   patterns and turbidity while showed a loss of synchrony with primary
   productivity. Water turbidity produced a dome-like pattern on
   tintinnids, oligotrichs and A. tonsa, implying that the highest
   abundance of organisms occurred under moderate values (similar to 50
   NTU) of turbidity. In contrast, the response to wind patterns was not
   generalizable probably owing to species-specific traits. Observed trends
   denote that wind induced processes in shallow ecosystems with internal
   sources of suspended sediments, are essential on ciliate dynamics and
   that such effects can propagate trough the interannual variability of
   copepods.},

Title = {Characteristics of modern carbonate contourite drifts},
Journal = {SEDIMENTOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {1163-1191},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Carbonate environments inhabit the realm of the surface, intermediate
   and deep currents of the ocean circulation where they produce and
   continuously deliver material which is potentially deposited into
   contourite drifts. In the tropical realm, fine-grained particles
   produced in shallow water and transported off-bank by tidal,
   wind-driven, and cascading density currents are a major source for
   transport and deposition by currents. Sediment production is especially
   high during interglacial times when sea level is high and is greatly
   reduced during glacial times of sea-level lowstands. Reduced
   sedimentation on carbonate contourite drifts leads to early marine
   cementation and hardened surfaces, which are often reworked when current
   strength increases. As a result, reworked lithoclasts are a common
   component in carbonate drifts. In areas of temperate and cool water
   carbonates, currents are able to flow across carbonate producing areas
   and incorporate sediment directly to the current. The entrained skeletal
   carbonate particles have variable bulk density and shapes that lower the
   prediction of transport rates in energy-based transport models, as well
   as prediction of current velocity based on grain size. All types of
   contourite drifts known in clastic environments are found in carbonate
   environments, but three additional drift types occur in carbonates
   because of local sources and current flow diversion in the complicated
   topography inherent to carbonate systems. The periplatform drift is a
   carbonate-specific plastered drift that is nearly exclusively made of
   periplatform ooze. Its geometry is built by the interaction of
   along-slope currents and downslope currents, which deliver sediment from
   the adjacent shallow-water carbonate realm to the contour current via a
   line source. Because the periplatform drift is plastered on the slopes
   of the platforms it is also subject to mass gravity flow and large slope
   failures. At platform edges, a special type of patch drift develops.
   These hemiconal platform-edge drifts also contain exclusively
   periplatform ooze but their geometry is controlled by the current around
   the corner of the platform. At the north-western end of Little and Great
   Bahama Bank are platform-edge drifts that are over 100 km long and up to
   600 m thick. A special type of channel-related drift forms when passages
   between carbonate buildups or channels within a platform open into
   deeper water. A current flowing in these channels will entrain material
   shed from the sediment producing areas. At the channel mouth, the
   sediment-charged current deposits its sediment load into the deeper
   basin. With continuous flow, a submarine delta drift is built that
   progrades into the deep water. The strongly focused current forming the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {229},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts are present on seamount summits
   throughout the northwestern Pacific at water depths of approximately
   1000 to 2500 m, where they are often associated with unconsolidated
   sediments. Sedimentation rates at the summits of seamounts calculated
   from ages C-14 were 0.61 to 2.05 cm kyr(-1), higher than those of the
   surrounding abyssal plain. Sediments at seamount summits consist almost
   entirely of carbonate, which may contribute to higher sedimentation
   rates at summits than at seamount feet, which are below the carbonate
   compensation depth. The shallowest mixing layer depth and the smallest
   particle mixing coefficient (estimated from Pb-210 data) at the summit
   areas than at the foot of seamounts; suggest a weak bioturbation
   activity in the peaks. The difference in bottom-water dissolved oxygen
   and particulate organic matter concentrations between the summits and
   feet of the seamounts in the northwestern Pacific may contribute to this
   difference in bioturbation activity.},

Title = {Demographic Mechanisms of Reef Coral Species Winnowing from Communities
   under Increased Environmental Stress},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Winnowing of poorly-adapted species from local communities causes
   shifts/declines in species richness, making ecosystems increasingly
   ecologically depauperate. Low diversity can be associated with
   marginality of environments, which is increasing as climate change
   impacts ecosystems globally. This paper demonstrates the demographic
   mechanisms (size specificmortality, growth, fertility; and
   metapopulation connectivity) associated with population-level changes
   due to thermal stress extremes for five zooxanthellate reef-coral
   species. Effects vary among species, leading to predictable changes in
   population size and, consequently, community structure. The
   Persian/Arabian Gulf (PAG) is an ecologically marginal reef environment
   with a subset of Indo-Pacific species, plus endemics. Local heating
   correlates with changes in coral population dynamics and community
   structure. Recent population dynamics of PAG corals were quantified in
   two phases (medium disturbed MD 1998-2010 and 2013-2017, severely
   disturbed SD 1996/8, 2010/11/12) with two stable states of declining
   coral frequency and cover. The strongest changes in life-dynamics, as
   expressed by transition matrices solved for MD and SD periods were in
   Acropora downingi and Porites harrisoni, which showed significant
   partial and whole-colony mortality (termed-shrinkers{''}). But in
   Dipsastrea pallida, Platygyra daedalea, Cyphastraea rnicrophthalrna the
   changes to life dynamics were more subtle, with only partial tissue
   mortality (termed ``persisters{''}). Metapopulation models suggested
   recovery predominantly in species experiencing partial rather than
   whole-colony mortality. Increased frequency of disturbance caused
   progressive reduction in coral size, cover, and population fecundity.
   Also, the greater the frequency of disturbance, the more larval
   connectivity is required to maintain the metapopulation. An
   oceanographic model revealed important local larval retention and
   connectivity primarily between adjacent populations, suggesting that
   correlated disturbances across populations will lead to winnowing of
   species due to colony, tissue, and fertility losses, with resultant
   insufficient dispersal potential to make up for losses especially if
   disturbances increase under climate change. Variable extinction
   thresholds exist based on the susceptibility of species to disturbance
   ({''}shrinkers{''} vs. ``persisters{''}), determining which species will
   be winnowed from the community. Besides projected changes in coral
   community and population structure, no species are projected to increase
   in cover. Increased marginality due to climate change will lead to a net
   loss of coral cover and novel communities in PAG.},

Title = {The Madden-Julian Oscillation Simulated in the NCEP Climate Forecast
   System Model: The Importance of Stratiform Heating},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {This study investigates the capability for simulating the Madden-Julian
   oscillation (MJO) in a series of atmosphere-ocean coupled and uncoupled
   simulations using NCEP operational general circulation models. The
   effect of air-sea coupling on the MJO is examined by comparing long-term
   simulations from the coupled Climate Forecast System (CFS T62) and the
   atmospheric Global Forecast System (GFS T62) models. Another coupled
   simulation with a higher horizontal resolution model (CFS T126) is
   performed to investigate the impact of model horizontal resolution.
   Furthermore, to examine the impact on a deep convection scheme, an
   additional coupled T126 run (CFS T126RAS) is conducted with the relaxed
   Arakawa-Schubert (RAS) scheme. The most important factors for the proper
   simulation of the MJO are investigated from these runs.
   The empirical orthogonal function, lagged regression, and spectral
   analyses indicated that the interactive air-sea coupling greatly
   improved the coherence between convection, circulation, and other
   surface fields on the intraseasonal time scale. A higher horizontal
   resolution run (CFS T126) did not show significant improvements in the
   intensity and structure. However, GFS T62, CFS T62, and CFS T126 all
   yielded the 30-60-day variances that were not statistically
   distinguishable from the background red noise spectrum. Their eastward
   propagation was stalled over the Maritime Continent and far western
   Pacific. In contrast to the model simulations using the simplified
   Arakawa-Schubert (SAS) cumulus scheme, CFS T126RAS produced
   statistically significant spectral peaks in the MJO frequency band, and
   greatly improved the strength of the MJO convection and circulation.
   Most importantly, the ability of MJO convection signal to penetrate into
   the Maritime Continent and western Pacific was demonstrated. In this
   simulation, an early-stage shallow heating and moistening preconditioned
   the atmosphere for subsequent intense MJO convection and a top-heavy
   vertical heating profile was formed by stratiform heating in the upper
   and middle troposphere, working to increase temperature anomalies and
   hence eddy available potential energy that sustains the MJO. The
   stratiform heating arose from convective detrainment of moisture to the
   environment and stratiform anvil clouds. Therefore, the following
   factors were analyzed to be most important for the proper simulation of
   the MJO rather than the correct simulations of basic-state
   precipitation, sea surface temperature, intertropical convergence zone,
   vertical zonal wind shear, and lower-level zonal winds: 1) an elevated
   vertical heating structure (by stratiform heating), 2) a
   moisture-stratiform instability process (a positive feedback process
   between moisture and convective-stratiform clouds), and 3) the low-level
   moisture convergence to the east of MJO convection (through the
   appropriate moisture and convective-stratiform cloud
   processes-circulation interactions). The improved MJO simulation did
   improve the global circulation response to the tropical heating and may
   extend the predictability of weather and climate over Asia and North
   America.},

Abstract = {Dragon is a cooperation Programme between the European Space Agency
   (ESA) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of the P.R.
   China. The Programme, initiated in 2004, focuses on the exploitation of
   ESA, Third Party Missions (TPM) and Chinese Earth Observation (EO) data
   for geo-science and applications development in land, ocean and
   atmospheric applications. In particular, the Programme brings together
   joint Sino-European teams to investigate 50 thematic projects. In this
   paper, the results of the research projects(1) in the thematic field
   ``Land and Environment{''} will be briefly presented, whereas emphasis
   will be given in the assessment of the usefulness of the results for an
   integrated assessment of the state of the environment in the respective
   study areas. Furthermore new knowledge gained in such fields as
   desertification assessment, drought and epidemics' monitoring, forest
   modeling, cropwatch monitoring, climate change vulnerability (including
   climate change adaptation and mitigation plans), urbanization monitoring
   and land use/cover change assessment and monitoring, will be presented.
   Such knowledge will be also linked to the capacities of Earth
   Observation systems (and of the respective EO data) to support the
   temporal, spatial and spectral requirements of the research studies. The
   potential of DRAGON to support such targets as ``technology and
   knowledge transfer at the bilateral level{''}, ``common EO database for
   exploitation{''} and ``data sharing and open access data policy{''} will
   be also presented. Finally special consideration will be given in
   highlighting the replication potential of the techniques as developed in
   the course of the projects, as well as on the importance of the
   scientific results for environmental policy drafting and decision
   making.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a concept of deployable Pipe-Z (dPZ): a modular
   structural system which takes advantage of the robustness of rigid-panel
   mechanism and allows to create free-form links which are also
   reconfigurable and deployable. The concept presented can be applied for
   building habitats and infrastructures for human exploration of oceans
   and outer space. dPZ structures can adapt to changing requirements e.g.
   mission objectives, crew condition and technological developments.
   Furthermore, such lightweight and adaptable structural concept can
   assist in sustainable exploration development. After brief introduction,
   the concept of Pipe-Z (PZ) is presented. Next, the reconfigurability of
   PZ is explained and illustrated with continuous and collision-free
   transition from a PZ forming a Trefoil knot to a Figure eight knot. The
   following sections introduce, explain and illustrate the folding
   mechanism of a single foldable Pipe-Z module (fPZM) and entire dPZ
   structure. The latter is illustrated with asynchronous (delayed)
   unfolding of a relatively complex Unknot. Several applications of PZ are
   suggested, namely for underwater and deep-space and surface habitats,
   for permanent, but in particular, temporary or emergency passages. As an
   example, a scenario of a failure of one of the modules of the
   International Space Station is presented where a rigid structure of 40
   fPZMs bypasses the ``dead link{''}. A low-fidelity prototype of a
   6-module octagonal dPZ is presented; several folding schemes including
   concentric toric rings are demonstrated. Practical issues of
   pressurization and packing are briefly discussed. (C) 2016 IAA.

Title = {Addressing unresolved tensions to build effective partnerships: lessons
   from an Aboriginal cancer support network},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Background: Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Aboriginal
   and Torres Strait Islander people and their survival once diagnosed with
   cancer is lower compared to that of other Australians. This highlights
   the need to improve cancer-related health services for Indigenous
   Australians although how to achieve this remains unclear. Cancer support
   groups provide emotional and practical support, foster a sense of
   community and belonging and can improve health outcomes. However,
   despite evidence on their positive effects on people affected by cancer,
   there is scarce information on the function and effectiveness of
   Indigenous-specific cancer peer-support programs in Australia. Using
   qualitative data from an evaluation study, this paper explores different
   understandings of how a cancer support group should operate and the
   impact of unresolved tensions following the establishment of an
   Indigenous women cancer peer-support network in a regional town in
   Western Australia.
   Methods: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 24
   participants purposively selected among Indigenous and mainstream
   healthcare service providers, and group members and clients. Interviews
   were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were subjected to
   inductive thematic analysis. NVivo was used to manage the data and
   assist in the data analysis. Rigour was enhanced through team member
   checking, coding validation and peer debriefing.
   Results: Flexibility and a resistance to formal structuring were at the
   core of how the group operated. It was acknowledged that the network
   partly owned its success to its fluid approach; however, most mainstream
   healthcare service providers believed that a more structured approach
   was needed for the group to be sustainable. This was seen as acting in
   opposition to the flexible, organic approach considered necessary to
   adequately respond to Indigenous women's needs. At the core of these
   tensions were opposing perspectives on the constructs of `structure' and
   `flexibility' between Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants.
   Conclusions: Despite the group's achievements, unresolved tensions
   between opposing perspectives on how a support group should operate
   negatively impacted on the working relationship between the group and
   mainstream service providers, and posed a threat to the Network's
   sustainability. Our results support the need to acknowledge and address
   different perspectives and world views in order to build strong,
   effective partnerships between service providers and Indigenous
   communities.},

Title = {Sand and rhodolith-gravel entrainment on the mid- to outer-shelf under a

   Australia},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},

Volume = {129},

Pages = {313-330},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Carbonate sediments on the east Australian continental shelf off Eraser
   Island represent a transition from the warm-water, tropical, carbonate
   deposits in the north (i.e. the Great Barrier Reef) to cool-water,
   temperate, carbonate deposits in the south. On the outer shelf in 40-140
   m water depth, these deposits are characterised by pebble- to
   cobble-sized rhodoliths. Current meter data obtained from this area
   demonstrates that near-bed, southward-flowing currents of up to 130 cm/s
   occur episodically to depths of over 70 m. These current events may last
   for several days and are probably related to intrusions of the East
   Australian Current, a western boundary current, onto the shelf. Flume
   experiments on different size classes of rhodoliths suggests that the
   threshold speed referenced to 100 cm above the bed (U-100cr) for 10 mm
   diameter rhodoliths is of the order of 45 cm/s, whereas U-100cr for 50
   mm diameter rhodoliths is of the order of 80 cm/s. Therefore, the shelf
   currents measured are competent to initiate rhodolith movement.
   Percentage exceedence of these threshold speeds ranges from 1 to 10\%.
   Surface waves also generate near-bed oscillatory flows which, when
   combined with the steady current, are considered to be important in
   initiating movement of the rhodoliths.},

Pages = {181-199},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Coal properties are inherently variable even within a single coal seam
   due to reasons such as coalification history and mining method. Since
   nonconsistent coal characteristics negatively affect the efficiency and
   production cost of power plants as well as the profitability of the coal
   producer, special attention should be paid to control the variability of
   coal quality. In this paper, variations in coal properties delivered to
   the Tuncbilek Power Plant have been investigated by means of control
   charts. The control charts have mostly indicated that the variations in
   the properties of coal are significantly high. The considerable amount
   of off-design coal relative to coal contract specifications has been
   determined. Finally, the revenue of the coal producer has been examined
   by taking into account the blending operation; the aim of which is to
   minimize the variance of coal properties.},

   ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {18-27},
Abstract = {Satellite data are a relevant part of information, required for
   sustainable environmental management, assessment of the impact of
   economic activity of ecosystems, determination of risks, related to
   global climate changes, desertification processes, loss of landscape and
   biotic diversity. Aim. To substantiate the reasonability and prove the
   efficiency of using satellite data in the agroecologic monitoring system
   regarding the impact of climate changes on vegetation, processes of soil
   erosion degradation, and assessment of landscape diversity. Methods. The
   study was conducted in the territory of Ukraine. It involved the
   application of SWOT and Gap-analysis methodology, materials of NOAA
   satellite observations, Sentinel, different spatial resolution,
   methodological and regulatory provision of the Institute of Agroecology
   and Environmental Economics of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences
   regarding satellite monitoring of the structure of agrolandscapes, norms
   of establishing a network of testing agrarian grounds, list of
   vegetation state indicators, in particular, ``Remote sensing of the
   Earth from space. Land data about controlling the condition of plantings
   and performance of agricultural crops. General requirements: DSTU
   7307:2013{''}, ``Remote sensing of the Earth from space. Ground
   inspection of plantings. Classifier of objects and functions: SUC
   01.1-37-907:2011{''}, ``Methodological recommendations on establishing
   the network of testing agrarian grounds in the system of monitoring of
   plantings using the materials of cosmic information{''}. The
   investigation on the impact of climate changes on vegetation state was
   conducted on the territory of three natural-climatic zones which were
   geographically represented by Chernihiv, Poltava and Zaporizhzhia
   regions respectively. The determination of the threat of erosion
   degradation of arable lands and landscape diversity was performed on the
   territory of two administrative districts with high level of ploughness
   of agrolandscapes, intense agrarian production and manifestation of
   erosion degradation of lands. Results. Inadequacy of the traditional
   system of agroecological monitoring was determined. It was proven that
   it was reasonable to have comprehensive application of satellite data
   regarding climate warming within the natural climatic zones and its
   impact on vegetation according to the normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI), erosion degradation of soils and landscape diversity.
   According to satellite data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA), the correlation analysis was performed on the
   connection between the dynamics of the sum of effective temperatures and
   the sum of NDVI values for the vegetation period. There was positive
   impact of climate warming on vegetation state according to NDVI index in
   the zone of Polissia and Forest-Steppe. The correlation coefficients
   were R = 0.64 and R = 0.77 respectively. In the Steppe zone the
   correlation coefficient dropped down to R = 0.35 which demonstrated the
   elevated risk of droughts. Conclusions. Satellite data of Sentinel-1
   were used to determine critical zones of erosion degradation of amble
   lands, requiring preservation and their inclusion to the natural fields,
   which had a positive impact on the optimization of agrolandscape
   diversity.},

Year = {2004},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the effect of diurnal variations of sea surface
   temperature (SST) and wind speed on the surface ocean CO2 partial
   pressure (pCO(2)(sw)) and sea-air CO2 flux. This is carried out using a
   combination of climatological and remote sensing data. The calculations
   show that the diurnal heating cycle can drive a diurnal pCO(2)(sw)
   variability which may cause the global ocean uptake of CO2 to be more
   than twice as large during night than during day. The effect of diurnal
   wind speed variations on the sea-air CO2 flux is restricted to the
   tropics. The concurrent variations of SST and wind speed on diurnal time
   scales bring around covariance terms that may contribute to the monthly
   mean flux. These were estimated and found to be negligible. Thus, this
   study validates the use of diurnally averaged fields for computation of
   sea-air CO2 fluxes.},

Abstract = {Synthetic jet actuators have shown promise to control drag and lift for
   a bluff body in cross-flow. Using unsteady RANS CFD modelling, a
   significant modification of the drag coefficient for a circular cylinder
   in cross-flow at Re = 3900 is achieved by varying the actuation
   frequency. The variation in actuation frequency corresponds to a range
   in Stokes number of 2.4 < St(0) < 6.4. The trends in drag coefficient
   modification largely agree with the findings of past publications,
   achieving a maximum drag reduction at St(0) = 4.9 for a fixed jet
   Reynolds number of the synthetic jet of Re (u) over bar (0) = 12. A
   decrease in the adverse pressure gradient near the jet orifice
   correlated with a momentum increase in the viscous sublayer and stronger
   vortical structures at the rear of the cylinder. In these same
   conditions, a decrease in turbulence intensity was observed in the far
   field wake, which is a relevant finding in the context of wind and tidal
   turbine arrays.},

Title = {Geomatic freshwater discharge estimations and their effect on saltwater
   intrusion in alluvial systems: a case study in Shatt Al-Arab estuary},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},

Abstract = {Field measurements in complex estuarine systems are not always adequate
   to characterise the hydrodynamic behaviour of these systems and the
   degree to which they are affected by seawater intrusion. The model
   MIKE21 was used to examine the hydrodynamic regime and degree of
   seawater intrusion in the Shatt Al-Arab estuary under three scenarios.
   The model was calibrated using field measurements of vertical salinity
   distribution and flow that were obtained in 2013, 2014 and 2016 from a
   boat at six stations along the main channel. These parameters were
   utilised to simulate the relationship between freshwater discharge and
   saltwater intrusion. Results show that river flows and tidal energy are
   the two main factors that influence the Shatt Al-Arab estuary in terms
   of stratification extent and circulation pattern. Tidal range
   fluctuations, particularly the semidiurnal tide, are another influencing
   factor on the saltwater spatial patterns along the Shatt Al-Arab
   channel. Nowadays, seawater intrusion extends 86 km upstream from the
   channel mouth. Within two decades, hydrodynamic behaviour is predicted
   to increase salinity for more than 100 km upstream from Faw city. The
   modelling clarified the minimum freshwater discharge required at the Abu
   Flus channel measurement station to maintain an acceptable salinity
   level along the channel. Understanding the relationship between
   freshwater discharge and salinity allows informed decisions to be made
   regarding water usage and flows in the region for sustainable water
   governance that limits environmental degradation. Such an approach is
   applicable worldwide within similar coastal conditions.},

Abstract = {We present time-resolved electron-energy-loss-spectroscopy results for

   saturation of the first monolayer, the desorption is characterized by
   pseudo-zero-order kinetics resulting from the formation of
   two-dimensional CO2 islands on the surface.  Deviation from precisely
   zero-order behavior is attributed to a slightly larger sticking
   coefficient on the adsorbate-covered portions of the surface than on the
   clean surface.  The energetics of the desorption process are analyzed in
   terms of the interaction of the molecules with the surface and with
   themselves.},

Abstract = {Seedling recruitment is a critical life history stage for trees, and
   successful recruitment is tightly linked to both abiotic factors and
   biotic interactions. In order to better understand how tree species'
   distributions may change in response to anticipated climate change, more
   knowledge of the effects of complex climate and biotic interactions is
   needed. We conducted a seed-sowing experiment to investigate how
   temperature, precipitation and biotic interactions impact recruitment of
   Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings
   in southern Norway. Seeds were sown into intact vegetation and
   experimentally created gaps. To study the combined effects of
   temperature and precipitation, the experiment was replicated across 12
   sites, spanning a natural climate gradient from boreal to alpine and
   from sub-continental to oceanic. Seedling emergence and survival were
   assessed 12 and 16 months after sowing, respectively, and above-ground
   biomass and height were determined at the end of the experiment.
   Interestingly, very few seedlings were detected in the boreal sites, and
   the highest number of seedlings emerged and established in the alpine
   sites, indicating that low temperature did not limit seedling
   recruitment. Site precipitation had an overall positive effect on
   seedling recruitment, especially at intermediate precipitation levels.
   Seedling emergence, establishment and biomass were higher in gap plots
   compared to intact vegetation at all temperature levels. These results
   suggest that biotic interactions in the form of competition may be more
   important than temperature as a limiting factor for tree seedling
   recruitment in the sub- and low-alpine zone of southern Norway.},

Abstract = {In April 2006, diurnal variations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen
   (O-2) in the surface water east of Gotland in the Baltic Sea were
   investigated with a unique multitechnology approach. Several parameters
   were measured simultaneously providing an overview of the CO2 system.
   Moored instruments were continuously recording partial pressure of CO2
   in the surface water (pCO(2)(w)), currents, mixing, waves, salinity,
   temperature and O-2. Measurements of total alkalinity (A(T)) and
   dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T) were taken from R/V Skagerak. These
   measurements were converted to pCO(2)(w) to support the continuous
   pCO(2)(w) data and also calculate the air-sea exchange of CO2.
   Additionally, the time derivatives of O-2 and CT concentrations in the
   water were determined using incubations and a Productivity Autosampler
   (PA). O-2 and pCO(2)(w) were significantly anti-correlated and periods
   dominated of either biological processes, mixing, air-sea exchange or a
   combination of these were detected. O-2 and pCO(2)(w) had a daily cycle
   and variations occurred on the 1 h time scale. In April 2006, the sea
   was a CO2 sink and the averaged parameterized air-sea exchange was
   -1.0+/-0.6 mmol m(-2) h(-1). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Floating wind turbine is the core of offshore floating power generation
   and an important way to develop offshore wind resources. In recent
   years, artificial intelligence technology has made great achievements in
   many fields, and equipment fault diagnosis is also very prominent. As
   the working environment of the floating fan unit is bad and far away
   from the land, once the floating fan unit generator fails, it may have
   very serious consequences. Based on the research results of artificial
   intelligence technology, this paper focuses on the application of
   artificial intelligence technology in the fault diagnosis of floating
   wind turbine generator, and proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis
   system framework. According to the research of expert system and
   artificial neural network, the fault diagnosis technology of floating
   fan generator is put forward, and the artificial neural network model
   and reasonable fault diagnosis reasoning flow are given.},

Title = {Coccolith dissolution within copepod guts affects fecal pellet density
   and sinking rate},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {The most common biomineral produced in the contemporary ocean is calcium
   carbonate, including the polymorph calcite produced by coccolithophores.
   The surface waters of the ocean are supersaturated with respect to
   calcium carbonate. As a result, particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), such
   as calcite coccoliths, is not expected thermodynamically to dissolve in
   waters above the lysocline (similar to 4500-6000 m). However,
   observations indicate that up to 60-80\% of calcium carbonate is lost in
   the upper 500-1000 m of the ocean. This is hypothesized to occur in
   microenvironments with reduced saturation states, such as zooplankton
   guts. Using a new application of the highly precise C-14 microdiffusion
   technique, we show that following a period of starvation, up to 38\% of
   ingested calcite dissolves in copepod guts. After continued feeding, our
   data show the gut becomes increasingly buffered, which limits further
   dissolution; this has been termed the Tums hypothesis (after the
   drugstore remedy for stomach acid). As less calcite dissolves in the gut
   and is instead egested in fecal pellets, the fecal pellet sinking rates
   double, with corresponding increases in pellet density. Our results
   empirically demonstrate that zooplankton guts can facilitate calcite
   dissolution above the chemical lysocline, and that carbon export through
   fecal pellet production is variable, based on the feeding history of the
   copepod.},

Title = {Lateral Carbon Exports From Drained Peatlands: An Understudied Carbon

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Degradation of peatlands via drainage is increasing globally and
   destabilizing peat carbon (C) stores. The effects of drainage on the
   timing and magnitude of lateral C losses from degraded peatlands remains
   understudied. We measured spatial and temporal variability in lateral C
   exports from three drained peat islands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
   Delta in California across the 2017 and 2018 water years using
   measurements of dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC),
   and suspended particulate organic C (POC) concentration combined with
   discharge. These measurements were supplemented with stable isotope data
   (delta C-13-DIC, delta C-13-POC, delta N-15-PON, and delta H-2-H2O
   values) to provide insight into hydrological and biogeochemical controls
   on lateral C exports from drained peatlands. Drainage DOC and DIC
   concentrations were seasonally variable with the highest values in the
   winter rainy season, when discharge was also elevated. Seasonal
   differences in the mobilization of dissolved C appeared to result from
   changing water sources and water table levels. Peat island drainage C
   contributions to surrounding waterways were also greatest during the
   winter. Although temporal variability in C cycling processes and trends
   were generally similar across islands, baseline drainage DIC, DOC, and
   POC concentrations were spatially variable, likely a result of
   sub-island-scale differences in soil organic matter content and
   hydrology. This spatial variability complicates system-wide assessments
   of C budgets. Net lateral C exports were water year dependent and
   comparable to previously published vertical C emission rates for this
   system. This work highlights the importance of including lateral C
   exports from drained peatlands in local and regional C budgets.},

Title = {Marine Predators Algorithm Optimized Reduced Sensor Fuzzy-Logic Based
   Maximum Power Point Tracking of Fuel Cell-Battery Standalone
   Applications},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Fuel cell (FC) represents one of the promising efficient solutions for
   future energy supply. Improving performance and integration methods of
   FCs via maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and high boosting factor
   inverters are key requirements for research in renewable energy fields.
   Recently, hybrid FC-battery structures have shown wide applications in
   several areas. Accordingly, marine predators algorithm (MPA) is proposed
   in this article for optimizing the design of reduced sensor fuzzy-logic
   based MPPT scheme. The proposed scheme inherits the following benefits:
   reduced sensors and hence reduced costs, more flexibility and smooth
   performance due to fuzzy-logic based MPPT, and optimized design method
   of fuzzy-logic based MPPT through MPA method. Moreover, a high boosting
   ratio inverter is introduced in this article based on using the switched
   capacitor multilevel inverter (SCMLI). The proposed system achieves self
   capacitor voltage control without complex control or extra sensors. The
   proposed hybrid FC-battery system has been validated at various
   operating points. In addition, comprehensive comparisons with existing
   schemes in the literature are provided in the paper. The superiority of
   the proposed scheme has been verified with robust, fast and accurate
   tracking, reduced cost, flexible, simple, and smooth output waveforms.
   The proposed method achieves the lowest output power fluctuations with
   fast tracking speed compared to the studied classical methods.},

Abstract = {The River Thames tidal defences have provided protection against the
   increasing threat of tidal flooding from the North Sea for more than
   2000 years. The flood of 1953 was the catalyst for the construction of
   the current system of River Thames tidal defences, which includes the
   Thames Barrier, and has provided one of the best standards of flood
   defence in the UK for over 20 years.
   Substantial growth is planned through `Thames Gateway', a regeneration
   initiative of the United Kingdom government. These new developments will
   fundamentally change the developed footprint in the Thames Estuary
   flood-plain, and will be in place for at least the next 100 years. This
   presents a challenge of planning future defence against a background of
   uncertainty over climate and other environmental change, while ensuring
   that correct decisions are made concerning the nature and location of
   new building in the tidal flood-plain.
   Through its `Thames Estuary 2100' project, the Environment Agency is
   developing a long-term strategy for flood risk management in the
   estuary. Implementation of major construction works on the River Thames
   could commence from around 2015. Alternatively, it may be decided that
   minimum works are undertaken to provide security and major investment is
   delayed until uncertainties over climate change have abated. Whatever
   long-term option is chosen, this must be preceded by a period of
   collaboration with the Thames Gateway developments to ensure appropriate
   and sustainable flood defences are incorporated in new riverside
   construction.},

Title = {AATTENUATION-The Atmospheric Attenuation Model for CSP Tower Plants: A
   Look-Up Table for Operational Implementation},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Attenuation of solar radiation between the receiver and the heliostat
   field in concentrated solar power (CSP) tower plants can reduce the
   overall system performance significantly. The attenuation varies
   strongly with time and the average attenuation at different sites might
   also vary strongly from each other. If no site specific attenuation data
   is available, the optimal plant design cannot be determined and rough
   estimations of the attenuation effect are required leading to high
   uncertainties of yield analysis calculations. The attenuation is caused
   mainly by water vapor content and aerosol particles in the lower
   atmospheric layer above ground. Although several on-site measurement
   systems have been developed during recent years, attenuation data sets
   are usually not available to be included during the plant project
   development. An Atmospheric Attenuation (AATTENUATION) model to derive
   the atmospheric transmittance between a heliostat and receiver on the
   basis of common direct normal irradiance (DNI), temperature, relative
   humidity, and barometric pressure measurements was developed and
   validated by the authors earlier. The model allows the accurate
   estimation of attenuation for sites with low attenuation and gives an
   estimation of the attenuation for less clear sites. However, the
   site-dependent coefficients of the AATTENUATION model had to be
   developed individually for each site of interest, which required
   time-consuming radiative transfer simulations, considering the exact
   location and altitude, as well as the pre-dominant aerosol type at the
   location. This strongly limited the application of the model despite its
   typically available input data. In this manuscript, a look-up table
   (LUT) is presented which enables the application of the AATTENUATION
   model at the site of interest without the necessity to perform the
   according complex radiative transfer calculations for each site
   individually. This enables the application of the AATTENUATION model for
   virtually all resource assessments for tower plants and in an
   operational mode in real time within plant monitoring systems around the
   world. The LUT also facilitates the generation of solar attenuation maps
   on the basis of long-term meteorological data sets which can be
   considered during resource assessment for CSP tower plant projects. The
   LUTs are provided together with this manuscript as supplementary files.
   The LUT for the AATTENUATION model was developed for a solar zenith
   angle (SZA) grid of 1 degrees, an altitude grid of 100 m, 7 different
   standard aerosol types and the standard AFGL atmospheres for
   mid-latitudes and the tropics. The LUT was tested against the original
   version of the AATTENUATION model at 4 sites in Morocco and Spain, and
   it was found that the additional uncertainty introduced by the
   application of the LUT is negligible. With the information of latitude,
   longitude, altitude above mean sea level, DNI, relative humidity (RH),
   ambient temperature (Tair), and barometric pressure (bp), the
   attenuation can be now derived easily for each site of interest.},

   protected areas: Contributions for its evaluation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {311},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Over the past few decades, the literature has pointed out pathways to
   success in co-management processes based on key conditions. Rather than
   offering prescriptive conclusions for successful co-management in
   protected areas, in this article, we highlight the importance of the
   ``process `` and certain elements that contribute to advancements of
   formal and informal co-management. We analyzed the trajectory of two
   protected areas for sustainable use in coastal Brazil -Extractive
   Reserves of Prainha do Canto Verde and Sao Joao da Ponta. Advancements
   of co-management were understood as processes of shared environmental
   and territorial governance, with levels of community participation
   and/or social control. Advancements were observed in both formal
   co-management arenas, such as deliberative boards for protected area
   management, and informal spheres, such as the implementation of projects
   and other actions involving traditional populations and partners.
   Drawing on Grounded Theory, the advancements were explained based on two
   categories of inter-related factors: (i) catalytic factors - crises,
   threats and other factors of social mobilization, emancipatory
   partnerships, and political identity, and (ii) structural factors, based
   on resources of community power and citizenship. Beyond diagnoses or
   rankings of success, the explanatory dimension of these phenomena
   highlights their inherent complexity.},

   where ferromagnetic intraplanar exchange interactions are dominant
   within each island in the magnetic intercalate layers, the
   zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization of these compounds deviates
   downward from the field-cooled (FC) magnetization below a critical
   temperature T(c), and shows a broad peak at a temperature T(max) (<
   T(c)). This irreversible effect of magnetization indicates that a
   cluster glass phase appears below T(c). The ferromagnetic spin order is
   established within each island, forming a ferromagnetic cluster. The
   spin directions of these ferromagnetic clusters are frozen because of
   frustrated interisland interactions consisting of both the dipole-dipole
   interaction between ferromagnetic clusters and antiferromagnetic
   interplanar exchange interaction between different intercalate layers.
   The broad peak of ZFC arises as a result of a competition between
   thermal energy and these frustrated interisland interactions.},

Abstract = {Improving vehicle fuel efficiency is critical to tackle climate change.
   This requires understanding the drivers of efficiency improvements in
   both the powertrain and vehicle body. This paper uses US coast down data
   to estimate the powertrain efficiencies of new British models in 2010
   showing the differences between available models for the first time.
   Powertrain efficiency decreases with increasing engine capacity, and
   increases in vehicle mass are found to be more detrimental to vehicle
   efficiency than aerodynamic area. Finally, it is concluded that the
   difference between diesel and petrol powertrain efficiency grows with
   increasing vehicle size. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Despite its high capacity to take up nitrate from soil, winter rapeseed
   (Brassica napus) is characterized by a low N recovery in seeds. Thus, to
   maintain yield, rapeseed requires a high fertilization rate. Increasing
   nutrient use efficiency in rapeseed by addition of a biostimulant could
   help improve its agroenvironmental balance. The effects of marine brown
   seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum on plant growth have been well described
   physiologically. However, to our knowledge, no study has focused on
   transcriptomic analyses to determine metabolic targets of these
   extracts. A preliminary screening of different extracts revealed a
   significant effect of one of them (AZAL5) on rapeseed root (+102 \%) and
   shoot ( 23 \%) growth. Microarray analysis was then used on
   AZAL5-treated or nontreated plants to characterize changes in gene
   expression that were further supported by physiological evidence.
   Stimulation of nitrogen uptake (+21 and +115 \% in shoots and roots,
   respectively) and assimilation was increased in a similar manner to
   growth, whereas sulfate content (+63 and +133 \% in shoots and roots,
   respectively) was more strongly stimulated leading to sulfate
   accumulation. Among the identified genes whose expression was affected
   by AZAL5, MinE, a plastid division regulator, was the most strongly
   affected. Its effect was supported by microscopic analysis showing an
   enhancement of chloroplast number per cell and starch content but
   without a significant difference in net photosynthetic rate. In
   conclusion, it is suggested that AZAL5, which promotes plant growth and
   nutrient uptake, could be used as a supplementary tool to improve
   rapeseed agroenvironmental balance.},

Volume = {57},
Number = {9-10},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between East
   Siberian-Chukchi-Beaufort (EsCB) sea ice concentration (SIC) anomaly in
   the early autumn (September-October, SO) and northern Eurasian surface
   temperature (Ts) variability in the early spring (March-April, MA).
   Results reveal that the early autumn sea ice decrease in the EsCB Seas
   excites an Arctic anticyclonic anomaly in the lower troposphere in the
   early spring, leading to cold anomalies over central Russia. The mean
   temperature over central Russia drops by nearly 0.8 degrees C, and the
   probability of cold anomalies increases by about 30\% when the EsCB SIC
   reduces by one standard deviation. As responses to SO EsCB sea ice loss,
   atmospheric anomalies of the planetary wave 2 dominate the Arctic since
   October-November (ON) and are in phase with the climatological mean in
   the troposphere. This in-phase resonance produces much more wave energy
   propagating into the lower stratosphere and generates an EP flux
   convergence anomaly in December-January (DJ), then decelerating the
   zonal westerly winds. One month later (January-February, JF), the
   attenuation of the polar vortex reaches the peak and propagates downward
   into the troposphere in the next 2 months with two major branches. One
   branch is located in Greenland and induces a zonal wave train from the
   North Atlantic to eastern Eurasia. Another branch is to maintain the
   anticyclonic anomaly in low-level over the Arctic. This configuration of
   atmospheric circulation anomalies provides favorable conditions for the
   southward invasion of Arctic cold air and makes northern Eurasia
   experience a colder early spring.},

Title = {Palaeoshorelines on the Australian continental shelf: Morphology,
   sea-level relationship and applications to environmental management and
   archaeology},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {26-38},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Palaeoshorelines that lie submerged on stable continental shelves are
   relict coastal depositional and erosional structures formed during
   periods of lower sea level. An analysis of the well-dated Late
   Quaternary (0-128 ka) sea-level record indicates that the most
   persistent (modal) lower sea levels were at 30 \textbackslash{}- 40 m
   below present, which occurred between 97 and 116 ka and at approximately
   85 ka and 10 ka. A secondary modal position was at 70 - 90 m that
   occurred mostly during a period of fluctuating sea level between 30 and
   60 ka, as well as at around 87 ka (70 - 80 m only) and 12-15 ka. For the
   tectonically stable Australian continental shelf, we show that a range
   of shorelines formed at each of these sea level modal positions and
   their morphology and degree of preservation depends on composition
   (carbonate vs siliciclastic) and oceanographic setting (wave, tide and
   wind energy). These ancient coasts record a range of oceanographic and
   geological regimes that existed during relatively long periods of lower
   sea level and provide a guide to the general depth zones in which
   similar features likely occur on other shelves globally. Australian
   palaeoshorelines represent distinctive benthic habitats that strongly
   influence the distribution of biodiversity across the shelf. Accurate
   mapping of these features provides a robust geospatial framework for
   investigations of marine species distributions and environmental change
   monitoring. These data also enable the better targeting of relict
   coastal areas that potentially include sand resources and sites of human
   occupation during periods of lower sea level.},

Title = {Observations of Breaking Internal Tides on the Australian North West
   Shelf Edge},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {A comprehensive observational data set was used to examine shoreward
   propagating semidiurnal internal tides as they shoal, break and run-up
   as turbulent boluses across the edge of the Australian North West Shelf
   (NWS), offshore Dampier, during late winter 2013. The measured waveforms
   and wavefields supported the grouping of events into two distinct
   categories: (1) pre-; and, (2) post- wave breaking. It was found that
   the transition from (1) to (2) was marked by the rise of nonlinear
   steepening (alpha) and reduction in dispersion (beta), both coefficients
   that parameterize nonlinear wave effects on the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
   equation. We introduced a criterion for wave breaking from the
   dimensionless parameter (delta) that relates these two terms: wave
   breaking occurs when delta < 1. In the first group, dispersive effects
   were dominant to spread energy out of the semidiurnal wave to a
   dispersive wave packet of short-period internal solitary waves (ISWs).
   In the second, dispersion was considered small compared to the
   cumulative effect of nonlinear steepening. Here, the semidiurnal wave
   built sufficient energy at its rear face to generate wave breaking,
   which has been known to produce multiple turbulent boluses. Similar
   observations have not been described for this region during winter
   months and highlight that the nonlinear internal wave field is an
   important feature on the NWS throughout the year. Additionally,
   measurements obtained through autonomous ocean glider profiles revealed
   some of the post-breaking characteristics that included intensive
   vertical mixing and transport of dense water and suspended material
   onshore of the shelf break.},

Title = {Genetic Manipulation of Competition for Nitrate between Heterotrophic
   Bacteria and Diatoms},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Diatoms are a dominant group of eukaryotic phytoplankton that contribute
   substantially to global primary production and the cycling of important
   elements such as carbon and nitrogen. Heterotrophic bacteria, including
   members of the gammaproteobacteria, are commonly associated with diatom
   populations and may rely on them for organic carbon while potentially
   competing with them for other essential nutrients. Considering that
   bacterioplankton drive oceanic release of CO2 (i.e., bacterial
   respiration) while diatoms drive ocean carbon sequestration vial the
   biological pump, the outcome of such competition could influence the
   direction and magnitude of carbon flux in the upper ocean. Nitrate
   availability is commonly a determining factor for the growth of diatom
   populations, particularly in coastal and upwelling regions. Diatoms as
   well as many bacterial species can utilize nitrate, however the ability
   of bacteria to compete for nitrate may be hindered by carbon limitation.
   Here we have developed a genetically tractable model system using the
   pennate diatom Phaeodactylurn tricomuturn and the widespread
   heterotrophic bacteria Alterornonas macleodii to examine carbon-nitrogen
   dynamics. While subsisting solely on P tricomutum derived carbon. A.
   macleodii does not appear to be an effective competitor for nitrate, and
   may in fact benefit the diatom; particularly in stationary phase.
   However, allochthonous dissolved organic carbon addition in the form of
   pyruvate triggers A. macleodir proliferation and nitrate uptake, leading
   to reduced P tricornutum growth. Nitrate reductase deficient mutants of
   A, macleodii (AnasA) do not exhibit such explosive growth and associated
   competitive ability in response to allochthonous carbon when nitrate is
   the sole nitrogen source, but could survive by utilizing solely P
   tricomutum-derived nitrogen. Furthermore, allocthonous carbon addition
   enables wild-type A. macleodil to rescue nitrate reductase deficient P
   tricomutum populations from nitrogen starvation, and RNA-seq
   transcriptomic evidence supports nitrogen-based interactions between
   diatoms and bacteria at the molecular level. This study provides key
   insights into the roles of carbon and nitrogen in phytoplankton-bacteria
   dynamics and lays the foundation for developing a mechanistic
   understanding of these interactions using co-culturing and genetic
   manipulation.},

Abstract = {Changes in river discharge and river water quality, due to climate
   change and other drivers such as land cover change, pose both societal
   and ecosystem threats. Analyses of measured terrestrial river fluxes are
   key for identifying the drivers and quantifying the magnitudes of such
   riverine changes. In this paper, we develop and apply a data-driven
   regionalization approach using the dense network of discharge
   measurements in Sweden. The developed regionalization approach
   facilitates detailed mapping of discharges (Q) and change trends in Q
   across Sweden. Combining these with estimates of precipitation (P) and
   change trends in P, we estimated actual evapotranspiration (AET) and
   change trends in AET via catchment-scale water balance constraints. We
   identified characteristic land cover-evapotranspiration relationships by
   plotting water use efficiency (AET/P) against energy use efficiency
   (AET/potential ET) for areas with unique land cover across Sweden. Our
   results show that wetlands have clearly lower water and energy use
   efficiencies compared to open waters, forests, and agriculture, and that
   agriculture has water and energy use efficiencies closest to those of
   open waters. We further compared the data-driven regionalization
   estimates of different water balance components with estimates of
   regional climate models (RCMs). The RCMs do not describe well the
   observed change trends in Sweden. In particular, for evapotranspiration,
   the observed change trends are not reproduced by any of the investigated
   24 RCMs. Citation: van der Velde, Y., S. W. Lyon, and G. Destouni

Title = {Baroclinic Rossby Wave Forcing and Barotropic Rossby Wave Response to

Abstract = {An analysis is performed on the dynamical coupling between the
   variability of the extratropical stratospheric and tropospheric
   circulations during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Obtained results
   provide evidence that in addition to the well-known Charney and Drazin
   mechanism by which vertical propagation of baroclinic Rossby waves is
   nonlinearly influenced by the zonal mean zonal wind, topographic forcing
   constitutes another important mechanism by which nonlinearity is
   introduced in the troposphere-stratosphere wave-driven coupled
   variability. On the one hand, vortex variability is forced by baroclinic
   Rossby wave bursts, with positive (negative) peaks of baroclinic Rossby
   wave energy occurring during rapid vortex decelerations (accelerations).
   On the other hand, barotropic Rossby waves of zonal wavenumbers s = 1
   and 3 respond to the vortex state, and strong evidence is presented that
   such a response is mediated by changes of the topographic forcing due to
   zonal mean zonal wind anomalies progressing downward from the
   stratosphere. It is shown that wavenumbers s = 1 and 3 are the dominant
   Fourier components of the topography in the high-latitude belt where the
   zonal mean zonal wind anomalies are stronger; moreover, obtained results
   are in qualitative agreement with the analytical solution provided by
   the simple topographic wave model of Charney and Eliassen. Finally,
   evidence is provided that changes of barotropic long (s <= 3) Rossby
   waves associated with vortex variability reproduce a NAO-like dipole
   over the Atlantic Ocean but no dipole is formed over the Pacific Ocean.
   Moreover, results suggest that the nonlinear wave response to
   topographic forcing may explain the spatial changes of the NAO
   correlation patterns that have been found in previous studies.},

Abstract = {The oceans absorb anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere, lowering
   surface ocean pH, a concern for calcifying marine organisms. The impact
   of ocean acidification is challenging to predict as each species appears
   to respond differently and because our knowledge of natural changes to
   ocean pH is limited in both time and space. Here we reconstruct 222years
   of biennial seawater pH variability in the Sargasso Sea from a brain
   coral, Diploria labyrinthiformis. Using hydrographic data from the
   Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study and the coral-derived pH record, we
   are able to differentiate pH changes due to surface temperature versus
   those from ocean circulation and biogeochemical changes. We find that
   ocean pH does not simply reflect atmospheric CO2 trends but rather that
   circulation/biogeochemical changes account for >90\% of pH variability
   in the Sargasso Sea and more variability in the last century than would
   be predicted from anthropogenic uptake of CO2 alone.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a grid-connected inverter for photovoltaic
   (PV)-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The significant
   function of the proposed inverter is to enhance the stability of a
   microgrid. The proposed inverter can stabilize its grid voltage and
   frequency by supplying or absorbing active or reactive power to or from
   a microgrid using EVs and PV generation. Moreover, the proposed inverter
   can automatically detect an abnormal condition of the grid, such as a
   blackout, and operate in the islanding mode, which can provide
   continuous power to local loads using EV vehicle-to-grid service and PV
   generation. These inverter functions can satisfy the requirements of the
   grid codes, such as IEEE Standard 1547-2018 and UL 1741 SA. In addition,
   the proposed inverter can not only enhance the microgrid stability but
   also charge EVs in an appropriate mode according to the condition of the
   PV array and EVs. The proposed inverter was verified through
   experimental results with four scenarios in a lab-scale testbed. These
   four scenarios include grid normal conditions, grid voltage
   fluctuations, grid frequency fluctuations, and a power blackout. The
   experimental results demonstrated that the proposed inverter could
   enhance the microgrid stability against grid abnormal conditions,
   fluctuations of grid frequency and voltage, and charge EVs in an
   appropriate mode.},

Title = {Correlations Between Extreme Atmospheric Hazards and Global
   Teleconnections: Implications for Multihazard Resilience},
Journal = {REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-78},

Abstract = {Occurrences of concurrent extreme atmospheric hazards represent a
   significant area of uncertainty for organizations involved in disaster
   mitigation and risk management. Understanding risks posed by natural
   disasters and their relationship with global climate drivers is crucial
   in preparing for extreme events. In this review we quantify the strength
   of the physical mechanisms linking hazards and atmosphere-ocean
   processes. We demonstrate how research from the science community may be
   used to support disaster risk reduction and global sustainable
   development efforts. We examine peer-reviewed literature connecting 16
   regions affected by extreme atmospheric hazards and eight key global
   drivers of weather and climate. We summarize current understanding of
   multihazard disaster risk in each of these regions and identify aspects
   of the global climate system that require further investigation to
   strengthen our resilience in these areas. We show that some drivers can
   increase the risk of concurrent hazards across different regions.
   Organizations that support disaster risk reduction, or underwrite
   exposure, in multiple regions may have a heightened risk of facing
   multihazard losses. We find that 15 regional hazards share connections
   via the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, with the Indian Ocean Dipole,
   North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Southern Annular Mode being
   secondary sources of significant regional interconnectivity. From a
   hazard perspective, rainfall over China shares the most connections with
   global drivers and has links to both Northern and Southern Hemisphere
   modes of variability. We use these connections to assess the global
   likelihood of concurrent hazard occurrence in support of multihazard
   resilience and disaster risk reduction goals.
   Plain Language Summary
   The likelihood of global extreme weather events occurring at the same
   time represents a significant source of uncertainty for organizations
   involved in responding to natural disasters. Understanding the risks
   posed by natural disasters is important in preparing for extreme events.
   Many public and private sector organizations play key roles in managing
   the impacts in the aftermath of natural disasters. However, to ensure
   that sufficient disaster resilience is in place, in the event of single
   or simultaneous extreme events, we need to understand the ways they
   connect with processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.
   This review summarizes the connections between 16 regional extreme
   weather events and 10 key drivers of global weather and climate.
   Focusing on annual time scales, El Nino-Southern Oscillation has
   connections with 15 regional hazards, linking rainfall in China, the
   United States, Australia, South Asia, and South Africa. The Indian Ocean
   Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode provide additional significant
   sources of connections between hazards across North and South
   Hemispheres. We show how this understanding can be used to develop
   early-warning systems for multihazard disasters at a global scale, in
   support of sustainable development goals, and inform a coordinated
   response to multiple hazard occurrence.},

Title = {Environmental impacts of electricity generation for Graciosa Island,
   Azores},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {292-303},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Graciosa project combines a large scale battery energy storage
   system with renewable electricity generation from wind power and
   photovoltaics in a hybrid power plant to reduce the environmental
   impacts caused by the previous electricity generation by 100 \% Diesel
   combustion on Graciosa Island, Azores. The goal of this contribution is
   to assess and compare the selected environmental impacts related to the
   electricity generation of the previous and the new system by using Life
   Cycle Assessment. To accomplish this goal, all energy and material flows
   that occur during production, use and recycling/disposal of the
   electricity generating systems are quantified and evaluated. The results
   of the Life Cycle Assessment show a reduction of environmental impacts
   of approx. 43\% due to the transformation to the hybrid electricity
   supply system with high shares of renewable energies (65\%). In the new
   electricity supply system, the majority of environmental impacts (>60\%)
   is still caused by the remaining Diesel based electricity generation.
   Environmental impacts, which are associated with the construction of the
   large scale battery energy storage system, account for only 6\% of total
   impacts. Wind power and photovoltaics account for 18\% and 14\%,
   respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the framework of the European research project PV2GO, a new AC-module
   inverter was developed, taking into account all relevant aspects from a
   European market's point of view (standards, market, application, and
   research and development goals). The project goal was to achieve the
   overall system costs of 3 Euro per Wp for a modular plug-and-play
   photovoltaic system. For the photovoltaic-module, a standard 130-Wp
   Eurosolare module was chosen. The research and development (R\&D) goal
   was to develop an advanced DC-control system consisting of a
   state-of-the-art programmable digital device and an Application Specific
   Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for the AC-control of the inverter. According
   to the topology concept, thermal and magnetic designs were optimized
   with regard to production technology and packaging for large-scale
   production. The new AC-modules were tested in a number of field-test
   sites in various parts of Europe-and their reliability was assessed
   through Highly Accelerated Stress Tests. Efficiency and power quality
   have been tested in the laboratory. Further in the PV2GO project an
   optimization study of the manufacturing process of the new generation of
   AC-modules for high volume output was done. Another task was the
   pre-certification procedure to assure compliance with the European
   guidelines and standards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The effects of ant nests on soil fertility and plant performance: a
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {86},
Number = {4},
Pages = {866-877},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Ants are recognized as one of the major sources of soil disturbance
   world-wide. However, this view is largely based on isolated studies and
   qualitative reviews. Here, for the first time, we quantitatively
   determined whether ant nests affect soil fertility and plant
   performance, and identified the possible sources of variation of these
   effects.
   2. Using Bayesian mixed-models meta-analysis, we tested the hypotheses
   that ant effects on soil fertility and plant performance depend on the
   substrate sampled, ant feeding type, latitude, habitat and the plant
   response variable measured.
   3. Ant nests showed higher nutrient and cation content than adjacent
   non-nest soil samples, but similar pH. Nutrient content was higher in
   ant refuse materials than in nest soils. The fertilizer effect of ant
   nests was also higher in dry habitats than in grasslands or savannas.
   Cation content was higher in nests of plant-feeding ants than in nests
   of omnivorous species, and lower in nests from agro-ecosystems than in
   nests from any other habitat.
   4. Plants showed higher green/root biomass and fitness on ant nests
   soils than in adjacent, non-nest sites; but plant density and diversity
   were unaffected by the presence of ant nests. Root growth was
   particularly higher in refuse materials than in ant nest soils, in
   leaf-cutting ant nests and in deserts habitats.
   5. Our results confirm the major role of ant nests in influencing soil
   fertility and vegetation patterns and provide information about the
   factors that mediate these effects. First, ant nests improve soil
   fertility mainly through the accumulation of refuse materials. Thus,
   different refuse dump locations (external or in underground nest
   chambers) could benefit different vegetation life-forms. Second, ant
   nests could increase plant diversity at larger spatial scales only if
   the identity of favoured plants changes along environmental gradients
   (i.e. enhancing beta-diversity). Third, ant species that feed on plants
   play a relevant role fertilizing soils, which may balance their known
   influence as primary consumers. Fourth, the effects of ant nests as
   fertility islands are larger in arid lands, possibly because fertility
   is intrinsically lower in these habitats. Overall, this study provide
   novel and quantitative evidence confirming that ant nests are key soil
   modifiers, emphasizing their role as ecological engineers.},

Abstract = {Solar-driven interfacial evaporation has received increasing research
   attention for clean water generation, but freshwater harvesting often
   occurs only during daytime. Herein, we report a strategy for all-day
   freshwater harvesting through combining solar-driven interfacial
   desalination and dew water generation. Through spray-coating carbon
   nanotubes onto a flexible substrate that has high-infrared emittance in
   the atmosphere window, a dual functional film was prepared to
   efficiently absorb solar energy for desalination at daytime and
   passively cool down the surface temperature to collect dew water at
   night. By integrating the dual functional film within a three-stage
   membrane distillation device, the home-made system achieved a drinkable
   freshwater collection efficiency of 71.1\% when desalinating seawater
   under 1 sun illumination and achieved a dew water collection rate of 0.1
   L m(-2) day(-1) at night. The readily available low-cost raw materials,
   simple fabrication process of the dual functional films, and the
   resultant all-day freshwater collection systems make the combined
   solar-thermal interfacial desalination and dew water collection a
   promising solution to alleviate the freshwater shortage in many
   underdeveloped regions, arid areas, and islands.},

Title = {Impact of Hurricane Sandy on salt marshes of New jersey},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {183},
Number = {A},
Pages = {235-248},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Hurricane Sandy, one of the largest Atlantic hurricanes on record, made
   landfall as an extratropical cyclone on the coast of New jersey (29
   October 2012) along a track almost perpendicular to the coast. Ten days
   later a northeaster caused heavy precipitation and elevated water levels
   along the coast. Two years of pre-storm monitoring and research in
   marshes of Barnegat Bay and the Delaware Estuary provided an opportunity
   to evaluate the impacts of Hurricane Sandy and the succeeding
   northeaster across the region. Peak water levels during Sandy ranged
   from 111 to 184 cm above the marsh surface in Barnegat Bay and 75-135 cm
   above the marsh surface in the Delaware Estuary. Despite widespread
   flooding and damage to coastal communities, the storm had modest and
   localized impacts on coastal marshes of New jersey. Measurements made on
   the marsh platform illustrated localized responses to the storms
   including standing biomass removal, and changes in peak biomass the
   following summer. Marsh surface and elevation changes were variable
   within marshes and across the region. Localized elevation changes over
   the storm period were temporary and associated with subsurface
   processes. Over the long-term, there was no apparent impact of the 2012
   storms, as elevations and regression slopes pre- and several months
   post-storm were not significant. Vegetation changes in the summer
   following the fall 2012 storms were also variable and localized within
   and among marshes. These results suggest that Hurricane Sandy and the
   succeeding northeaster did not have a widespread long-term impact on
   saline marshes in this region. Possible explanations are the dissipation
   of surge and wave energy from the barrier island in Barnegat Bay and the
   extreme water levels buffering the low-lying marsh surface from waves,
   winds, and currents, and carrying suspended loads past the
   short-statured marsh grasses to areas of taller vegetation and/or
   structure. These findings demonstrate that major storms that have
   substantial impacts on infrastructure and communities can have
   short-term localized effects on coastal marshes in the vicinity of the
   storm track. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mild winter temperatures are facilitating the expansion of black
   mangrove (Avicennia germinans) into smooth cordgrass (Spartina
   alterniflora) marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico. These
   expansions have the potential to alter soil development because of
   differences in productivity and tissue chemistry between Spartina and
   Avicennia. Here, we examined changes in soil-nutrient chemistry at 2-cm
   intervals in 30-cm soil cores collected from Spartina and Avicennia
   habitats at two different sites in Fourchon, Louisiana. Beginning in
   1959 and continuing through 2009, our chronology shows that the species
   shift had no effect on bulk density (mean +/- standard error {[}SE]:
   0.68 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3)), organic matter (mean +/- SE: 8.36 +/- 0.29 \%),
   or nitrogen content (mean +/- SE: 1.15 +/- 0.03 mg cm(-3)). Phosphorus
   densities were significantly greater in Avicennia habitats (mean +/- SE:
   0.32 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)) than they were in Spartina habitats (mean +/-
   SE: 0.28 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)), which we attributed to Avicennia occurring
   at higher elevations in more oxidizing soils. We observed significant
   variability with depth (proxy for time) and between sites in all soil
   properties measured. This variability can be attributed to the dominance
   of allochthonous sediment deposition from natural and anthropogenic
   disturbances compared with the lesser influence of vegetation on
   autochthonous soil development. In the highly disturbed region of
   Fourchon, Louisiana, the shift from Spartina marshes to scrub Avicennia
   stands does not appear to affect the chemistry of soil development.},

Abstract = {Interest in national carbon (C) budgets has increased following the
   signing of the Kyoto Protocol as countries begin to develop source/sink
   C inventories. In this study, specific-site measurements, regional
   databases, satellite observations, and models were used to test the
   hypothesis that New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems are C neutral
   because C uptake by planted forests and scrub is roughly balanced by C
   losses from indigenous forests and soils.
   Net ecosystem C balance was estimated from the difference between net
   primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic soil respiration The
   productivity portion of the CASA model and NOAA-AVHRR imagery were used
   to estimate national NPP (128 +/- 14 Mt C per year). Main sources of
   uncertainty were the coarse spatial scale (1 x 1 km(2) grid cells), and
   the general lack of information on photosynthetically active radiation,
   light-use efficiency, and below-ground C allocation for the major
   vegetation types: indigenous and exotic forests, scrub, and grasslands
   (improved, unimproved and tussock). Total soil CO2-C production
   predicted from an Arrhenius-type function coupled to climate and
   land-cover data was 380 +/- 30 Mt C per year, suggesting that New
   Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems may be either (a) a net source of
   atmospheric CO2 or (b) roughly in C balance if ca. 252 Mt CO2-C per year
   (66\%) can be attributed to roots. Soil moisture limitations on
   respiration were small, reducing the national value to 365 +/- 28 Mt C
   per year. Differences between NPP and heterotrophic soil respiration
   were -29 Mt C per year for improved pastures, -8 Mt C per year for
   indigenous forests, and +4 Mt C per year for planted forests; the large
   negative value for improved grasslands may be due to under-estimation of
   NPP and root respiration. Soil C losses to coastal waters, as estimated
   from a consideration of all the major erosion processes, were ca. 3-11
   Mt C per year.
   These national-scale estimates of ecosystem C balance were in general
   agreement with those based on plot-scale data for some major ecosystems
   including planted forests (4 hit C per year vs 3.7 Mt C per year,
   respectively) and indigenous forest (-8 Mt C per year vs ca. -2.8 Mt C
   per year, respectively). Poor agreement for forest regenerating after
   land abandonment (-17 hit C per year vs +3 hit C per year) was probably
   due to an underestimate of NPP at the national scale,
   Overall, the results suggest that New Zealand is a net C source, despite
   the fact that some ecosystems are accumulating C. For some land-use
   types, using the balance between NPP and soil respiration at the
   national scale to estimate the net ecosystem C balance may be too
   coarse, and studies of land-use changes at finer spatial scales are
   needed to reduce uncertainties in national-scale C balance estimates.

Abstract = {The study presents the economic efficiency of direct electrolysis of
   natural waters in comparison with the waters artificially prepared by
   electrolysis of the 3\% sodium salt solution. The study used sea water
   (Black sea water); mineral water (underground water of the Melikhovskaya
   station, ``Ognennaya{''} hole); brackish water (underground water from
   the Grushevskaya station of the Aksai district); 3\% solution of sodium
   salt. As a result, the dependences characterizing the direct
   electrolysis of natural waters with different mineralization, economic,
   and energy parties are shown. The rational area of the electrolysis for
   each of the investigated solution is determined. The cost of a kilogram
   of active chlorine obtained by the direct water electrolysis: Black sea
   from 17.2 to 18.3 RUB/kg; the Melikhovskaya station ``Ognennaya{''} hole

Title = {Onset and end of the summer melt season over sea ice: thermal structure
   and surface energy perspective from SHEBA},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Various measurements from the Surface Heat Flux of the Arctic Ocean
   (SHEBA) experiment have been combined to study structures and processes
   producing the onset and end of summer melt over Arctic sea ice. The
   analysis links the surface energy budget to free-troposphere synoptic
   variables, clouds, precipitation, and in-ice temperatures. The key
   results are (1) SHEBA melt-season transitions are associated with
   atmospheric synoptic events (2) onset of melt clearly occurs on May 28,
   while the end of melt is produced by a sequence of three atmospheric
   storm events over a 28-day period producing step-like reductions in the
   net surface energy flux. The last one occurs on August 22.; (3) melt
   onset is primarily due to large increases in the downwelling longwave
   radiation and modest decreases in the surface albedo; (4) decreases in
   the downwelling longwave radiation occur for all end-of-melt transition
   steps, while increases in surface albedo occur for the first two; (5)
   decreases in downwelling shortwave radiation contribute only to the
   first end-of-melt transition step; (6) springtime free-tropospheric
   warming preconditions the atmosphere-ice system for the subsequent melt
   onset; and (7) melt-season transitions also mark transitions in system
   responses to radiative energy flux changes because of invariant
   melt-season surface temperatures. The extensive SHEBA observations
   enable an understanding of the complex processes not available from
   other field program data. The analysis provides a basis for future
   testing of the generality of the results, and contributes to better
   physical understanding of multi-year analyses of melt-season trends from
   less extensive data sets.},

Abstract = {An overview of the results of the search for small solar transient
   events, in association with muon enhancements (deficits) registered at
   ground-level by the Tupi muon telescopes, is presented. Among the
   events, there are three interplanetary shocks and two solar flares of
   small scale whose X-ray emission flux is much smaller than 10(-5) W
   m(-2) at 1 AU (GOES-Tupi connection). Two of the interplanetary shocks
   are cataloged as corotating interaction region and the third shock is
   due to the passage of a CME (coronal mass ejection) ejecta (ACE and
   SOHO-Tupi connection) in the Earth's proximities. In most cases, the
   particles excess (deficit) coming from these events have only been
   observed with spacecraft instruments. However, the Tupi telescopes are
   located at sea level and within the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), a
   region where the shielding effect of the magnetosphere is not perfectly
   spherical and shows a `dip'. This fact enables the muon telescopes to
   achieve a low rigidity of response to primary and secondary charged
   particles (>= 0.1 GV). Muon excesses (deficits) with significances above
   4 sigma have been found. These events observed at ground admit a
   temporal correlation with solar transient events observed by
   spacecrafts, which suggests strongly a real connection between them.
   Details of these observations are reported.},

Title = {Dissolved organic carbon and major and trace elements in peat porewater
   of sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost zones of western
   Siberia},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},

Abstract = {Mobilization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and related trace
   elements (TEs) from the frozen peat to surface waters in the permafrost
   zone is expected to enhance under ongoing permafrost thaw and active
   layer thickness (ALT) deepening in high-latitude regions. The
   interstitial soil solutions are efficient tracers of ongoing
   bio-geochemical processes in the critical zone and can help to decipher
   the intensity of carbon and metals migration from the soil to the rivers
   and further to the ocean. To this end, we collected, across a 640 km
   latitudinal transect of the sporadic to continuous permafrost zone of
   western Siberia peatlands, soil porewaters from 30 cm depth using
   suction cups and we analyzed DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and
   40 major elements and TEs in 0.45 mu m filtered fraction of 80 soil
   porewaters.
   Despite an expected decrease in the intensity of DOC and TE mobilization
   from the soil and vegetation litter to the interstitial fluids with the
   increase in the permafrost coverage and a decrease in the annual
   temperature and ALT, the DOC and many major and trace elements did not
   exhibit any distinct decrease in concentration along the latitudinal
   transect from 62.2 to 67.4 degrees N. The DOC demonstrated a maximum of
   concentration at 66 degrees N, on the border of the
   discontinuous/continuous permafrost zone, whereas the DOC concentration
   in peat soil solutions from the continuous permafrost zone was equal to
   or higher than that in the sporadic/discontinuous permafrost zone.
   Moreover, a number of major (Ca, Mg) and trace (Al, Ti, Sr, Ga, rare
   earth elements (REEs), Zr, Hf, Th) elements exhibited an increasing, not
   decreasing, northward concentration trend. We hypothesize that the
   effects of temperature and thickness of the ALT are of secondary
   importance relative to the leaching capacity of peat, which is in turn
   controlled by the water saturation of the peat core. The water residence
   time in peat pores also plays a role in enriching the fluids in some
   elements: the DOC, V, Cu, Pb, REEs, and Th were a factor of 1.5 to 2.0
   higher in mounds relative to hollows. As such, it is possible that the
   time of reaction between the peat and downward infiltrating waters
   essentially controls the degree of peat porewater enrichments in DOC and
   other solutes. A 2 degrees northward shift in the position of the
   permafrost boundaries may bring about a factor of 1.3 +/- 0.2 decrease
   in Ca, Mg, Sr, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, Ni, Co, V, Zr, Hf, Th, and REE porewater
   concentration in continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, and a
   possible decrease in DOC, specific ultraviolet absorbency (SUVA), Ca,
   Mg, Fe, and Sr will not exceed 20\% of their current values. The
   projected increase in ALT and vegetation density, northward migration of
   the permafrost boundary, or the change of hydrological regime is
   unlikely to modify chemical composition of peat porewater fluids larger
   than their natural variations within different micro-landscapes, i.e.,
   within a factor of 2. The decrease in DOC and metal delivery to small
   rivers and lakes by peat soil leachate may also decrease the overall
   export of dissolved components from the continuous permafrost zone to
   the Arctic Ocean. This challenges the current paradigm on the increase
   in DOC export from the land to the ocean under climate warming in high
   latitudes.},

Title = {Distribution and inventory of anthropogenic CO2 in the Southern Ocean:
   Comparison of three data-based methods},

Year = {2005},

Abstract = {The Southern Ocean is thought to play an important role in the context
   of global warming and anthropogenic emissions of CO2 due to its high
   sensitivity to both climate change and changes in the carbon cycle.
   Assessing the penetration of anthropogenic CO2 (C-ant) into the Southern
   Ocean is therefore highly relevant to reduce the uncertainties attached
   to both the present knowledge of anthropogenic carbon inventories and
   predictions made by current ocean carbon models. This study compares
   different data-based approaches for estimating the distribution of C-ant
   in the ocean: a recently developed method based on the composite Tracer
   Combining Oxygen, Inorganic Carbon, and Total Alkalinity (TrOCA) and the
   ``historical'' back-calculation methods (the so-called Delta C{*} and
   preformed dissolved inorganic carbon methods). Note that the
   back-calculation technique requires special care when used in the
   Southern Ocean, where surface oxygen can significantly deviate from
   equilibrium with the atmosphere. All three methods were applied to data
   collected at the Indian-Atlantic boundary (WOCE line I6), where
   significant transient tracer concentrations were observed in deep and
   bottom waters. North of 50 degrees S, distribution and inventories of
   C-ant are coherent with previous data-based and model estimates, but we
   found larger storage of C-ant south of 50 degrees S as compared to the
   midlatitude region. In that, our results disagree with most previous
   estimates and suggest that the global inventory of anthropogenic CO2 in
   the Southern Ocean could be much larger than what is currently believed.},

Abstract = {Acetoin is a natural flavor and mainly used as a food additive and
   important intermediate to synthesize novel optically active compounds.
   In this work a new acetoin producer, Bacillus subtilis DL01 was isolated
   from samples of sea sediment, and its growth properties and acetoin
   productivity were explored. The experiments showed that the new strain
   can grow well in a simple fermentation medium only containing sugarcane
   molasses, (NH4)(2)HPO4 and MnSO4. When the initial concentration of
   sugar was 200 g/l in molasses, 61.15 g/l acetoin (58.2 g/l D-acetoin)
   was obtained with a productivity of 0.807 g/(1 h) by a batch
   fermentation under stage-enhanced agitation and constant aeration of 0.4
   vvm. By contrast, 76 g/l acetoin (60.9 g/l D-acetoin) could be obtained
   with a productivity of 1.00 g/(1 h) and a yield of 0.421 g/g if 210 g/l
   glucose was used. The strain DL01 demonstrated high sugar tolerance,
   high acetoin production, and low oxygen requirement. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {On offshore operations many accidents have occurred in the case of
   extreme sea state conditions. Therefore, the offshore systems have to be
   evaluated by seakeeping criteria, for specific sea areas, from the
   preliminary design steps. This study is focused on the assessment of an
   offshore barge design concept, as support platform for drill operations
   in the Caspian Sea. The barge has a total length of 96 m and 33 m
   breadth, with oblique bow shape at 40 deg. and a low free side height of
   1.85 m. The environmental irregular sea waves are modeled by JONSWAP
   wave power density spectrum, with gamma peak factor of 3.3, for the
   significant waves' height and peak period selected from the Caspian Sea
   waves' scattering diagram. The short-term dynamic responses of the
   offshore barge motions are obtained by own developed software DYN\_OSC.
   The seakeeping criteria are limiting the maximum values of the motions
   amplitudes, in order to ensure the operational safety conditions for the
   onboard personal of the offshore barge support platform. The study
   results are pointing out the effective seakeeping capabilities of the
   offshore barge design concept, preserving the operations safety in the
   Caspian Sea environment.},

Abstract = {Squalidus argentatus is a small-sized cyprinid fish and widely
   distributed in mainland China. A total of nine polymorphic
   microsatellite markers were employed to study 216 individuals collected
   from nine populations. The average number of alleles among nine
   populations was 8.0 with a range from 6.5 to 9.7. The mean observed
   (H-O) and expected (H-E) heterozygosity ranged from 0.56 to 0.68 and
   from 0.74 to 0.86, respectively. The analysis of molecular variance
   (AMOVA) showed that most genetic variation was maintained within
   individual component, rather than shaped according to geographical
   regions. Small but highly significant values of pairwise F-ST values
   were detected among nine populations. The genetic homoplasy and
   overfishing are supposed to be major factors responsible for the current
   genetic structure. This study can be not only helpful for sustainable
   management of genetic resources, but also valuable to demonstrate
   genetically how freshwater species is vulnerable to human activity. (C)

Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-38},
Abstract = {Flat evacuated glazing with very good insulating properties requires: 
   (i) a leak-free edge seal around the periphery of two glass sheets; (ii)
   a low, and stable pressure within the space between the sheets; (iii) a
   low thermal conductance array of support pillars to maintain the
   separation of the glass sheets under the influence of atmospheric
   pressure forces; and (iv) transparent, low emittance coatings on the
   inner surface of one, or both glass sheets.  Experimental samples of
   evacuated glazing up to 200 mm x 250 mm have been produced which
   incorporate the first three features.  It has been shown that an array
   of pillar supports having thermal conductance less than 0.3 W m-2 K-1
   can be produced which is quite unobtrusive and which results in
   tolerably low levels of mechanical stress within the glass sheets.  The
   optical properties of windows incorporating such supports are very
   similar to conventional windows.  Levels of vacuum have been achieved
   without getters in several devices for which contributions to thermal
   conductance due to heat flow through the gas are less than the limit of
   resolution of the measuring device (0.2 W m-2 K-1).  Durable, vacuum
   compatible low emittance coatings exist which should result in a thermal
   conductance due to radiative heat flow of less than 0.3 W m-2 K-1.  The
   overall thermal conductance of a window incorporating such coatings
   should be less than 0.6 W m-2 K-1.  The ability of these windows to
   withstand mechanical load and temperature differentials appears to be
   adequate for most architectural applications.},

Abstract = {The dispersal of Amazon mud reaches from the mouth of the Amazon river
   to the Orinoco delta and to the eastern Caribbean, a distance of more
   than 1500 km. The present dispersal system has been in existence for at
   least 10(3) years, but the deposition of mud from this system has not
   been constant during that period. A change from net erosion to net
   deposition along the Suriname coast between 1947 and 1981 was found to
   coincide with a shift of the trade winds from a dominantly NE to a more
   ENE direction from 1959 onward, accompanied by an increase in mean wind
   velocity. The change to net-deposition can be explained by enhanced
   longshore transport of suspended matter with simultaneous reduction of
   erosion by reduction of the onshore wave energy component. The sequence
   of a recent mud deposit 100-200 years old off the Amazon river mouth
   separated by a period of non-deposition from an older mud deposit less
   than 1000 years old, agrees well with indications for a wetter period in
   the Amazon basin and in the Colombian Andes since about 200 years BP and
   a wetter period between 500 and 900 y BP. This implies that during
   wetter periods the suspended-sediment supply from the Amazon (and the
   Orinoco) was (is) higher.},

   resources (LMRs) and the people, businesses, and economies that depend
   on them. As a result, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
   has developed a Climate Science Strategy (CSS) to increase the
   production and use of the climate related information necessary to
   fulfill its LMR stewardship mission for fisheries management and
   protected species conservation. The CSS establishes seven objectives:
   (1) determine appropriate, climate-informed reference points; (2)
   identify robust strategies for managing LMRs under changing climate
   conditions; (3) design decision, processes that are robust to
   climate-change scenarios; (4) predict future states of ecosystems, LMRs,
   and LMR-dependent human communities; (5) determine the mechanisms of
   climate-change related effects on ecosystems, LMRs, and LMR-dependent
   human communities; (6) track trends in ecosystems, LMRs, and
   LMR-dependent human communities and provide early warning of change; and
   (7) build and, maintain the science infrastructure required to fulfill
   NMFS mandates under changing climate conditions. These objectives
   provide a nationally consistent approach to addressing climate-LMR
   science needs that supports informed decision-making and effective
   implementation of the NMFS legislative mandates in each region. Near
   term actions that will address all objectives include: (1) conducting
   climate vulnerability analyses in each region for all LMRs; (2)
   establishing and strengthening ecosystem indicators and status reports
   in all regions; and (3) developing a capacity to conduct management
   strategy evaluations of climate-related impacts on management targets,
   priorities, and goals. Implementation of the Strategy over the next few
   years and beyond is critical for effective fulfillment of the NMFS
   mission and mandates in a changing climate. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Queen's University Belfast and Wave Barrier Ltd have developed a tidal
   testing platform to test hydro-kinetic turbines at medium scale.
   Multiple turbines can be pushed through still water conditions, in
   steady-state pushing tests. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the
   interactions between two identical, mono-strut, horizontal axis tidal
   turbines (HATTs) of 1.5 m diameter (13) rotor. Their relative
   performance when located individually, in-plane and in-line are
   investigated. The data shows a high consistency in the power curves at
   different flow speeds, which indicates high repeatability in this
   Reynolds range. For an individual turbine, there is no performance
   difference when the rotor is mounted either upstream or downstream of
   the supporting structure. When placed in-plane, the turbines have no
   adverse effect on one another. When spaced in-line with 2D separation,
   there is a 63\% reduction in the performance of the downstream turbine.
   At 6D downstream this performance reduction is still 59\%, indicating
   some wake recovery between 2D and 6D, though the influence from the
   upstream rotor persists to at least 6D downstream of the first device.
   In contrast the performance of the downstream turbine when placed at
   1.5D offset of the upstream device at 6D downstream is approximately
   recovered to the individual turbine performance. (C) 2015 Published by

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {A lot of sand was deposited at river mouth of the gentle flow river and
   the sandbar was formed. The river mouth sandbar topography was affected
   by combined forces, such as river discharge, sea waves, and wave
   direction, etc. River mouth sandbar interrupts salt and wave intrusion
   and affects the navigation of cruisers and fishing vessels. A field
   investigation was carried out for change of a river mouth sandbar in
   Omono River which was located in Akita Prefecture in Japan. The
   topographic surveys using UAV were conducted. Then, analysis of the
   sandbar change process was conducted on how sandbar area and river mouth
   width were calculated from reconstructed topography by the SfM
   technique. Moreover, an investigation of a relationship between sandbar
   area and river mouth width and river discharge, cross-shore, and
   longshore direction waves was carried out. As a result, the following
   results were confirmed from this study. (1) Right side sandbar has the
   sand spit which faced the south or left side sandbar was developed very
   much in winter. (2) Sandbar area and river mouth width have a positive
   interrelation between river discharge and cross-shore waves. (3) Sandbar
   area has a strong negative interrelation between river mouth width.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {85},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {56-61},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The slope of the expired alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide
   profile increases during exercise. Its relationship to metabolic rate,
   however, remains to be determined at high exercise intensities. We
   therefore determined the slope of alveolar partial pressures of carbon
   dioxide and oxygen ((P)over dot(A)CO(2), (P)over dot(A)O(2),
   respectively) during incremental cycle ergometer exercise (an increment
   of 40 W each minute) to exhaustion in 11 normal subjects. The (P)over
   dot(A)CO(2) and (P)over dot(A)O(2) increased as linear functions of
   carbon dioxide production and oxygen uptake ((V)over dotO(2)),
   respectively, up to the estimated lactate threshold (theta (-)(La)). At
   Higher intensities (P)over dot(A)CO(2), increased disproportionately but
   (P)over dot(A)O(2) continued to increase at the same rate in 7 subjects
   but increased more rapidly in the remainder. The rate of change in
   (P)over dot(A)CO(2) per unit rate of change in PO, averaged 3.15 (SD
   1.05) (mmHg.s(-1)). (l.min(-1))(-1) while the rate of change in (P)over
   dot(A)O(2) per unit rate of change in (V)over dotO(2) averaged -3.53 (SD
   0.79) (mmHg.s(-1)).(l-min(-1))(-1) over this range. The more rapid
   increase in (P)over dotCO(2) above theta (-)(La) was consistent with an
   accelerated CO, exchange, whereas the more rapid rate of change in
   (P)over dot(A)O(2) in 3 of the subjects may have reflected the
   development of an increased distribution of the ventilation perfusion
   ratio in addition to the effects of hyperventilation.},

Abstract = {Using a decade of satellite ocean-colour observations and a model that
   links chlorophyll-a to the size of the phytoplankton cells,
   parameterised using pigment data from the Indian Ocean, we examine the
   implications of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) for phytoplankton size
   structure. The inferred interannual anomalies in phytoplankton size
   structure are related to those in sea-surface temperature (SST) and
   sea-surface height (SSH), derived using satellite radiometry and
   altimetry, and stratification, derived using the Simple Ocean Data
   Assimilation (SODA) database. In regions influenced by the Indian Ocean
   Dipole, we observe a tight correlation between phytoplankton size
   structure and the physical variables, such that interannual variations
   in the physical variables accounts for up to 70\% of the total variance
   in phytoplankton size structure. For much of the Indian Ocean, low
   temperature. low SSH and low stratification (indicative of a turbulent
   environment) are correlated with larger size classes, consistent with
   theories on coupling between physical-chemical processes and ecosystem
   structure. To the extent that phytoplankton function is related to its
   size structure, changes in physical forcing are likely to influence
   biogeochemical cycles in the region and the pelagic food web. The
   limitations of our approach are discussed and we highlight future
   challenges in satellite ocean-colour monitoring, should climate change
   lead to any modification in our marine ecosystem. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Since time immemorial, surface water waves and their subsequent breaking
   have been studied. Herein we concentrate on breaking surface waves in
   deep and intermediate water depths. Progress has been made in several
   areas, including the prediction of their geometry, breaking onset, and
   especially energy dissipation. Recent progress in the study of geometric
   properties has evolved such that we can identify possible connections
   between crest geometry and energy dissipation and its rate. Onset
   prediction based on the local wave-energy growth rate appears robust,
   consistent with experiments, although the application of criteria in
   phase-resolving, deterministic prediction may be limited as calculation
   of the diagnostic parameter is nontrivial. Parameterization of the
   dissipation rate has benefited greatly from synergistic field and
   laboratory investigations, and relationships among the dynamics,
   kinematics, and the parameterization of the dynamics using geometric
   properties are now available. Field efforts continue, and although
   progress has been made, consensus among researchers is limited, in part
   because of the relatively few studies. Although direct numerical
   simulations of breaking waves are not yet a viable option, simpler
   models (e.g., implementation of an eddy viscosity model) have yielded
   positive results, particularly with regard to energy dissipation.},

Title = {Clarifying some assumptions of coastal management: Analysis of values

Abstract = {For the first time, this research addresses the assessment of the
   quality of knowledge embedded in beach quality indexes from a
   socioecological perspective. We took the most widespread beach quality
   indexes and identified, selected and assessed the most important
   existing assumptions. We scored the robustness of these assumptions,
   using an inclusive methodology (stakeholder meeting, four focus groups
   and an online questionnaire). The NUSAP criteria for assessing the
   value-ladenness of scientific studies (Influence of resource
   limitations, (Im) Plausibility, Choice space, Agreement among peers,
   Analysts' subjectivity and Influence on global results) were contrasted
   and discussed. A final list of the 10 weakest assumptions was presented
   and discussed. Most of these assumptions are fairly robust, but
   attention should mainly focus on their influence on global outcomes and
   (im) plausibility, as the weakest scored criteria. The choice space
   scores revealed the possibility of including new alternatives to the
   assumptions, when necessary. Assumptions loaded with framing concepts
   are weaker than those linked to more concrete objectives. We detected
   dissociation between the discourse and the operational development of
   the indexes, in which the narratives prioritizing user satisfaction are
   predominant and scientific data analysis is often decontextualized. We
   therefore suggest that science should be opened up throughout the
   building process of indexes: from the identification of problems to the
   reporting of results and related uncertainties. The NUSAP method proved
   to be useful for identifying weak points in beach quality indexes.},

   nickel for water purification},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Solar water evaporation is a promising method for water purification.
   However, the current photothermal conversion efficiency requires further
   improvement. Herein, a novel structure (Ni-G-MoO3-x) consisting of
   graphene (G) and MoO3-x coated porous nickel (Ni) is developed by
   combining facile chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with hydrothermal
   methods. The optical absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency
   of the materials were improved by oxygen vacancies (OVs). The
   as-prepared solar evaporator exhibits excellent light absorption (96\%),
   good wettability and high conversion efficiency (95\%) under 1 sun
   illumination. In particular, the super hydrophilicity of the evaporator
   can spontaneously transfer the surface salt back to the bulk seawater in
   the dark conditions. As a result, a stable evaporation rate can be
   achieved with the self-driven salt-resistant material in the evaporation
   cycle of more than three days. Furthermore, the evaporator has an
   excellent desalination ability and can extract fresh water resources
   from a variety of water sources (seawater, industrial waste water and
   organic dye wastewater) through light-to-heat conversion water
   evaporation technology. This work provides a fundamental guidance and
   insights on practical applications, thus helping to develop a highly
   efficient solar evaporator for clean water production.},

Abstract = {The performance of an array of closely spaced point absorbers is
   numerically assessed in a frequency domain model Each point absorber is
   restricted to the heave mode and is assumed to have its own linear power
   take-off (PTO) system Unidirectional irregular incident waves are
   considered, representing the wave climate at Westhinder on the Belgian
   Continental Shelf The impact of slamming, stroke and force restrictions
   on the power absorption is evaluated and optimal PTO parameters are
   determined For multiple bodies optimal control parameters (CP) are not
   only dependent on the incoming waves, but also on the position and
   behaviour of the other buoys Applying the optimal control values for a
   single buoy to multiple closely spaced buoys results in a suboptimal
   solution for the array Other ways to determine the PTO parameters are
   diagonal optimisation (DO) and individual optimisation These methods are
   applied to two array layouts consisting of 12 buoys in a staggered grid
   and 21 buoys in an aligned grid Compared to DO, it was found that
   individually optimising the CP increased the energy absorption at
   Westhinder with about 16-18\% for the two layouts, respectively},

Year = {1992},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A method for characterizing wave systems from temporal sequences and
   spatial arrays of directional ocean surface gravity-wave spectral
   estimates is presented. The method is structured in two major stages. In
   the first data-intensive stage, individual spectra are parameterized in
   terms of the directions, periods, and significant wave heights of wave
   systems represented in that spectrum. In the second stage, wave systems
   from spectra are associated with similar wave systems in neighboring
   spectra, and `'large-scale wave systems'' representing activity
   occurring continuously over groups of contiguous spectra are determined.
   This high-level description of the ocean surface wave field represents a
   considerable data reduction that preserves directional information in a
   more meaningful way than either average wave directions computed over
   the entire spectrum or wind sea-swell decompositions. Each large-scale
   wave system is normally caused by a distinct meteorological event. Data
   from the Labrador Sea Extreme Waves Experiment (LEWEX) are used to
   illustrate applications to numerical wave model and buoy spectra, and
   these methods should be useful in other spectral data comparison
   experiments. Other potential applications include the interpretation and
   archival of global wave-model analyses and the compression of wave
   spectra in a manner sufficient to preserve information necessary for
   numerical wave model data-assimilation schemes.},

Abstract = {The scientific goals of the planetary part of the multi-encounter fly-by
   mission to Mercury combined with a solar observatory (INTERHELIOS) are
   presented. Mercury represents the last frontier of the knowledge of the
   Solar System and a challenge for our understanding of the physics of the
   terrestrial planets. The origin of Mercury is puzzling because of
   impact/accretion problems. The existence of a magnetic field remains
   unexplained because Mercury's core lacks the high temperatures necessary
   to keep the massive core liquid. Similarly, the role of tidal energy
   dissipation due to the high eccentricity of Hermean orbit remains
   unknown. One of the most important experiments on the internal structure
   will be determination of the polar dimensionless moment of inertia. The
   mantle and crust of the planet are unusually thin. Despite a similarity
   in reflectivity of their surfaces, the compositions of Mercury and the
   Lunar regolith must differ, reflecting completely different total
   composition. The Morphology of the surface, only 30\% of which is known,
   will provide clues to the history of the planet. The rarefied Mercury
   atmosphere is enriched with helium, potassium and sodium. The latter are
   of unknown origin. The absence of a dense atmosphere combined with an
   intrinsic magnetic field provides a unique possibility to study the
   direct interaction of the solar wind with a magnetized planet
   unobservable at any other terrestrial planet. (C) 1997 COSPAR. Published

Title = {Quantification of Multiple Climate Change and Human Activity Impact
   Factors on Flood Regimes in the Pearl River Delta of China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Coastal flood regimes have been irreversibly altered by both climate
   change and human activities. This paper aims to quantify the impacts of
   multiple factors on delta flood. The Pearl River Delta (PRD), with dense
   river network and population, is one of the most developed coastal areas
   in China. The recorded extreme water level (m.s.l.) in flood season has
   been heavily interfered with by varied income flood flow, sea-level
   rise, and dredged riverbeds. A methodology, composed of a numerical
   model and the index R, has been developed to quantify the impacts of
   these driving factors in the the PRD. Results show that the flood level
   varied 4.29\%-53.49\% from the change of fluvial discharge,
   3.35\%-38.73\% from riverbed dredging, and 0.12\%-16.81\% from sea-level
   rise. The variation of flood flow apparently takes the most effect and
   sea-level rise the least. In particular, dense river network intensifies
   the impact of income flood change and sea-level rise. Findings from this
   study help understand the causes of the the PRD flood regimes and
   provide theoretical support for flood protection in the delta region.},

Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {259-262},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Fraunhofer ISE is running outdoor testing facilities for the
   investigation of the long-term durability of components and materials
   used for solar energy conversion. PV-modules play an important role
   amongst the test samples. The performance of the modules over time is
   assessed by monitoring the characteristic IV-curve every 10 min. The
   electronic set-up of the monitoring system consists of individual
   electronic loads for each module which is switching into an
   maximum-power-point-tracking mode between the IV-measurements. Soiling
   of exposed modules could be observed by accident because of building
   constructions nearby at one test site located on the Gran Canary island,
   west of Morocco in the Atlantic Ocean. It was decided not to clean the
   modules, but to clean the irradiation sensors. The decrease of the power
   output and the efficiency over time were recorded in order to
   investigate the soiling effect. The efficiencies dropped to 20\% of the
   initial values within 5 months.
   A minor rain event in between washed the dust partly away and
   accumulated it at the lower part of the module. This was reflected by
   the shape of the IV-curves. The curves showed similar changes as partial
   shading by partial snow cover as was observed at our alpine test site.
   Finally, a major rain event cleaned the modules and the efficiency was
   completely restored. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Relative sea-level change, climate, and sequence boundaries: insights
   from the Kimmeridgian to Berriasian platform carbonates of Mount Saleve
   (E France)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {102},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The present study analyses the stratal architecture of the Late Jurassic
   (Kimmeridgian) to Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) sedimentary succession
   of Mount SalSve (E France), and four Berriasian stratigraphic intervals
   containing four sequence-boundary zones reflecting lowering trends of
   the relative sea-level evolution. Massive Kimmeridgian limestones
   characterized by the presence of colonial corals appear to be stacked in
   an aggrading pattern. These non-bedded thick deposits, which are
   interpreted to have formed in balance between relative sea-level rise
   and carbonate accumulation, suggest a keep-up transgressive system.
   Above, well-bedded Tithonian-to-Berriasian peritidal carbonates reflect
   a general loss of accommodation. These strata are interpreted as a
   highstand normal-regressive unit. During the early phase of this major
   normal regression, the vertical repetition of upper intertidal/lower
   supratidal lithofacies indicates an aggrading depositional system. This
   is in agreement with an early stage of a highstand phase of relative sea
   level. The Berriasian sequence-boundary zones investigated (up to 4 m
   thick) developed under different climatic conditions and correspond to
   higher-frequency, forced- and normal-regressive stages of relative
   sea-level changes. According to the classical sequence-stratigraphic
   principles, these sequence-boundary zones comprise more than one
   candidate surface for a sequence boundary. Three sequence-boundary zones
   studied in Early Berriasian rocks lack coarse siliciclastic grains,
   contain a calcrete crust, as well as marly levels with higher abundances
   of illite with respect to kaolinite, and exhibit fossilized
   algal-microbial laminites with desiccation polygons. These sedimentary
   features are consistent with more arid conditions. A sequence-boundary
   zone interpreted for the Late Berriasian corresponds to a coal horizon.
   The strata above and below this coal contain abundant quartz and marly
   intervals with a higher kaolinite content when compared to the illite
   content. Accordingly, this Late Berriasian sequence-boundary zone was
   formed under a more humid climate. The major transgressive-regressive
   cycle of relative sea level identified and the climate change from more
   arid to more humid conditions recognized during the Late Berriasian have
   been reported also from other European basins. Therefore, the
   Kimmeridgian to Berriasian carbonate succession of Mount SalSve reflects
   major oceanographic and climatic changes affecting the northern margin
   of the Alpine Tethys ocean and thus constitutes a reliable comparative
   example for the analysis of other coeval sedimentary records. In
   addition, the stratigraphic intervals including sequence-boundary zones
   characterized in this study constitute potential outcrop analogues for
   sequence-boundary reflectors mapped on seismic profiles of subsurface
   peritidal carbonate successions. The detailed sedimentological analyses
   provided here highlight that on occasions the classical principles of
   sequence stratigraphy developed on seismic data are difficult to apply
   in outcrop. A sequence-boundary reflector when seen in outcrop may
   present successive subaerial exposure surfaces, which formed due to
   high-frequency sea-level changes that were superimposed on the
   longer-term trend of relative sea-level fall.},

Title = {Diel Patterns in Marine Microbial Metatranscriptomes Reflect Differences
   in Community Metabolic Activity Over Depth on the Continental Shelf of
   the North Atlantic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {Microbial community dynamics are influenced not only by biological but
   also physical and chemical phenomena (e.g., temperature, sunlight, pH,
   wave energy) that vary on both short and long-time scales. In this
   study, samples of continental shelf waters of the northwest Atlantic
   Ocean were periodically collected from pre-sunrise to post-sunset and at
   multiple depths over summers of 2016 and 2017. Metatranscriptomic
   analyses revealed expression of photosynthetic genes in surface water
   samples corresponding to a diel relationship with sunlight.
   Photosynthetic genes originated from known phototrophs including
   Aureococcus, Ostreococcous, Synechocococus, and Prochlorococcus.
   Photosynthetic gene expression occurred pre-sunrise, suggesting the
   community initiates transcription before sunlight exposure, ostensibly
   to harvest energy more efficiently when the anticipated increase in
   light occurs. Transcripts from photoheterotrophic members of the SAR11
   clade were also documented in surface samples, with rhodopsin expression
   being more abundant pre-sunrise and post-sunrise. Conversely, samples
   taken from the aphotic layer exhibited expression of transcripts related
   to nitrification that did not vary over the diel cycle. Nitrification
   gene transcripts, specifically amoA, nirK, hao, and norAB, were
   taxonomically related to well-known genera of ammonia oxidizers, such as
   Nitrospira, Candidatus Nitrosomarinus, Nitrosospira, and Nitrosopumilus.
   Overall, this study documents the role of light (varying with time and
   depth) in shaping the photosynthetic microbial community activity in the
   surface ocean, and further demonstrates that this diel regulation of
   photosynthesis is decoupled from the activity of the nitrifying
   microbial community in deeper and darker waters.},

Abstract = {The tiger puffer Takifugu rubripes (puffer) and the red sea bream Pagrus
   major (bream) were fasted or fed 1/4, 1/2, and 1 satiation of an
   artificial diet for 20 days, and digestive and absorptive ability and
   energy flow were composed. The puffer fed 1/2 and 1 satiation of the
   diet showed higher feeding rate, growth rate, feed efficiency, protein
   efficiency ratio, and protein retention than those of the bream fed
   under the same feeding protocols. Higher fat retention and protein
   digestibilities were obtained in the bream, however, no marked
   difference between the fishes was found in sugar and fat
   digestibilities, excepting the lowest fat digestibility of the puffer
   fed 1 satiation. Although the bream tended to show better digestable,
   metabolizable, and retention energy than the puffer, higher standard
   metabolizable energy was obtained in the puffer. Energy expenditure for
   heat increment plus voluntary activity was less in the puffer. These
   suggest that low energy expenditure for heat increment plus voluntary
   activity in the puffer, which do not have a stomach, compensates for
   poorer protein digestibilities than those in the bream, which have a

Abstract = {An innovative multi-effect heat pipes desalination system with falling
   him evaporation is presented, in which the evaporation and the
   condensation is in the negative pressure. The system makes use of the
   heat pipe to insulate heat source and cold source, has high heat
   transfer efficiency and effectively avoids producing salt on the surface
   of pipe because the system operates in the negative pressure and the
   seawater saturated temperature of evaporation or condensation is at
   40-70 degrees C. The Multiple effect desalination system can use
   low-quality energy sources such as discharged smoke heat, cooling water,
   solar energy, and etc. The system can utilize the latent heat properly
   in which on one side the heat pipe is heated by condensing vapor
   generated in the previous stage, whereas on the other side, seawater is
   distributed by a falling film to evaporate. In conditions of similar
   water yield, compared with a nine-stage desalination system, MED with
   heat pipes has small heat transfer area which is reduced by 25\%. It
   indicates that heat pipe multi-effect desalination technology has a good
   potential for practical applications.},

Abstract = {The baroclinic tides play a significant role in the energy budget of the
   abyssal ocean. Although the basic principles of generation and
   propagation are known, a clear understanding of these phenomena in the
   complex ocean environment is only now emerging. To advance this effort,
   a ray model is developed that quantifies the effects of spatially
   variable topography, stratification, and planetary vorticity on the
   horizontal propagation of internal gravity modes. The objective is to
   identify ``baroclinic shoals{''} where wave energy is spatially
   concentrated and enhanced dissipation might be expected. The model is
   then extended to investigate the propagation of internal waves through a
   barotropic mesoscale current field. The refraction of tidally generated
   internal waves at the Hawaiian Ridge is examined using an ensemble of
   mesoscale background realizations derived from weekly Ocean Topography
   Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon altimetric measurements. The path of mode 1
   is only slightly affected by typical currents, although its phase
   becomes increasingly random as the propagation distance from the source
   increases. The effect of the currents becomes more dramatic as mode
   number increases. For modes 3 and higher, wave phase can vary between
   realizations by +/-pi only a few wavelengths from the source. This phase
   variability reduces the magnitude of the baroclinic signal seen in
   altimetric data, creating a fictitious energy loss along the propagation
   path. In the TOPEX/Poseidon observations, the mode-1 M-2 internal tide
   does appear to lose significant energy as it propagates southwestward
   from the Hawaiian Ridge. The simulations suggest that phase modulation
   by mesoscale flows could be responsible for a large fraction of this
   apparent loss. In contrast, northeast-propagating internal tides
   encounter a less energetic mesoscale and should experience limited
   refraction. The apparent energy loss seen in the altimetric data on the
   north side of the ridge might indeed be real.},

Abstract = {The Oligocene to Miocene Heytesbury Group of the Otway Basin,
   southeastern Australia, is a non-tropical carbonate shelf succession.
   This subsurface stratigraphic succession consists of bioclastic
   grainstones to mudstones containing bryozoa, benthonic and planktonic
   foraminifera, echinoderms, brachiopods, and molluscs. The basal
   bryozoa-dominated Clifton Formation was deposited in relatively shallow
   waters. The overlying Gellibrand Marl, rich in planktonic foraminifera
   and bryozoa, formed under deep waters. The uppermost unit, benthonic
   foraminifera-dominated Port Campbell Limestone, was deposited in a
   moderately deep, middle shelf environment.
   Cementation is limited and includes: (1) scalenohedral calcite
   (non-luminescent to bright, Mn- and Fe-poor, in inter- and intraparticle
   porosity); (2) blocky equant calcite (dull, Mn- and Fe-rich, in
   interparticle porosity); (3) syntaxial calcite overgrowths on echinoderm
   particles (non/bright/dull-zoned); (4) euhedral dolomite (in the
   interparticle pore space of the Port Campbell Limestone); (5)
   bladed-prismatic calcite (ferroan, in planktonic foraminifera); (6)
   fibrous calcite (non-luminescent, in intraparticle porosity); and (7)
   glauconite and iron-oxides (only in intraparticle porosity). All CaCO3
   cements are low-Mg calcites(< 4 mol\% MgCO3).
   The cements observed in the Heytesbury Group appear to have formed in
   three successive diagenetic environments: (1) early shallow burial
   (early Fe- and Mn-poor, non-luminescent syntaxial overgrowths and
   non-luminescent scalenohedral calcite, under oxidising conditions); (2)
   late shallow burial (bright, more Mn-rich syntaxial overgrowth zone,
   i.e., more than the initial non-luminescent one, and bright
   scalenohedral calcite, under moderately reducing pore water conditions);
   and (3) moderate burial (ferroan, dull blocky calcite and dull syntaxial
   overgrowth zone, under reducing conditions). Pressure solution was the
   main cement-producing mechanism, although seawater and aragonite
   dissolution could account for the precipitation of the early
   non-luminescent cements. Scarcity of early interparticle cements may
   have been caused by the calcite-rich character of the original
   sediments.
   The ferroan duly luminescent blocky equant calcite and syntaxial
   overgrowths, typically interpreted to represent products of deep burial
   in ancient carbonate successions, are observed in the shallow-buried
   Port Campbell Limestone.},

   validity of the data. First, the two factors that influencing typhoon
   wind disasters, namely, typhoon intensity and spatial scale, were
   analyzed. The intensity of typhoons and the overall spatial scale were
   found to weaken and decrease, respec-tively, after landfall. Second, the
   applicability of the radial integral typhoon wind disaster assessment
   method to scenarios involving actual typhoons was verified for the first
   time using existing typhoon wind disaster mea-surement data.
   Furthermore, the radial integral method was used to study the change
   regularity of typhoon wind disasters before and after landfall in
   different regions of China. The wind disaster weakening of landfalls in
   the mainland was significant compared to that in islands. After a
   landfall on an island, wind disaster attenuated to 73.91\% and 75.50\%
   of the value before landfall. This result is consistent with the results
   obtained for hurricanes in the Northwest Pacific in previous years.
   Landfalls in mainland typhoon wind disasters attenuated to 54.38\%. This
   result is consistent with the current results of hurricanes in the
   Northwest Pacific. This is because of the reduction in the attenuation
   rate after typhoons or hurricanes landfall due to changes in global
   climate and urbanization. However, the impact on island regions is
   smaller. The results of this study can facilitate the rapid assessment
   of typhoon wind disasters and can serve as guidelines for preventing
   typhoon wind disasters in inland impacted regions. Thus, this study
   contributes toward disaster prevention and mitigation in coastal areas,
   urban areas, and offshore wind farms.},

Title = {Linking Direct Measurements of Turbidity Currents to Submarine
   Canyon-Floor Deposits},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Submarine canyons are conduits for episodic and powerful sediment
   density flows (commonly called turbidity currents) that move globally
   significant amounts of terrestrial sediment and organic carbon into the
   deep sea, forming some of the largest sedimentary deposits on Earth. The
   only record available for most turbidity currents is the deposit they
   leave behind. Therefore, to understand turbidity current processes, we
   need to determine the degree to which these flows are represented by
   their deposits. However, linking flows and deposits is a major
   long-standing scientific challenge. There are few detailed measurements
   from submarine turbidity currents in action, and even fewer direct
   measurements that can be compared to resulting seabed deposits.
   Recently, an extensive array of moorings along Monterey Canyon, offshore
   California, took measurements and samples during sediment density flow
   events, providing the most comprehensive dataset to date of turbidity
   current flows and their deposits. Here, we use sediment trap samples,
   velocity measurements, and seafloor cores to document how sand is
   transported through a submarine canyon, and how the transported sediment
   is represented in seafloor deposits. Sediment trap samples from events
   contain primarily fine to medium-grained sand with sharp bases, normal
   grading, and muddy tops. Sediment captured from the water column during
   the flow shows normal grading, which is broadly consistent with the
   initial peak and waning of flow velocities measured at a single height
   within the flow, and may be enhanced by collapsing flows. Flow events
   contain coarser sand concentrated toward the seafloor and larger grain
   sizes on the seafloor or in the dense near-bed layer, possibly
   representative of stratified flows. Although flow velocity varies, sand
   grain sizes in sediment traps are similar over distances of 50 km
   down-canyon, suggesting that grain size is an unfaithful record of
   down-canyon changes in maximum flow speeds. Sand transported within flow
   events and sampled in sediment traps is similar to sand sampled from the
   seafloor shortly after the events, but traps do not contain pebbles and
   gravel common in seabed deposits. Seabed deposits thus appear to
   faithfully record the sand component that is transported in the water
   column during sub-annual turbidity currents.},

Abstract = {Summer conditions in the Mediterranean Sea are characterized by high
   temperatures and low food availability. This leads to ``summer
   dormancy'' in many benthic suspension feeders due to energetic
   constraints. Analysis of the most recent 33-year temperature time series
   demonstrated enhanced stratification due to global warming, which
   produced a approximate to 40\% lengthening of summer conditions. Many
   biological processes are expected to be affected by this trend,
   culminating in such events as mass mortality of invertebrates. Climatic
   anomalies concomitant with the occurrence of these events represent
   prolonged exposure to warmer summer conditions coupled with reduced food
   resources. Simulation of the effects of these conditions on a model
   organism demonstrated a biomass loss of > 35\%. Losses of this magnitude
   result in mortality similar to that noted in field observations during
   mass mortality events. These results indicate that temperature anomalies
   are the underlying cause of the events, with energetic constraints
   serving as the main triggering mechanism.},

Abstract = {Short barbeled grunter, Hapalogenys nitens, is an important fishery
   resource and it has been regarded as a target marine fish species for
   prospective aquaculture diversification in Korea, but sustainable fry

   need for genetic information about this species. Furthermore, it is
   necessary to conserve the wild stocks for the sustainable use of the
   species. In this study, we report 26 novel polymorphic microsatellites
   with a mean of 4.9 alleles per locus. The mean observed and expected
   heterozygosity per locus was 0.45 and 0.50, respectively.
   Cross-amplification revealed variability in others two Haemulidae

Abstract = {The effects of feeding rate and feeding frequency on the growth of
   laboratory-reared common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) were evaluated.
   Juveniles with mean +/- SD weight of 2.55 +/- 0.48 g and total length of
   6.81 +/- 0.48 cm were divided into groups of 20 fish and reared in 30
   polyethylene tanks of 50 L for 60 days. The experimental design was a 3
   x 3 factorial with three feeding frequencies (F2, F4, and F6: two, four,
   and six daily meals, respectively), three feeding rates (R1, R2.5, and
   R4: 1.0, 2.5, and 4.0\%/day of fish biomass, respectively), and three
   replicates, totaling nine treatments (F2R1, F2R2.5, F2R4; F4R1, F4R2.5,
   F4R4; F6R1, F6R2.5, and F6R4). The external control consisted of four
   meals a day offered to apparent satiety (F4S). Every 15 days, weight and
   length of all fish were measured to adjust the amount of feed offered.
   Water quality variables remained within adequate levels for this
   species. Feeding rate had a greater influence on performance than
   frequency. Survival, condition factor, and the initial and final
   coefficients of weight variation had no significant effect among
   treatments. Feeding frequency and rate directly influenced length and
   weight gains, feed efficiency, specific growth rate, and apparent feed
   conversion rate. For common snook juveniles weighing between 1 and 16 g,
   it is recommended to offer four to six daily meals at a feeding rate
   between 3.31 and 1.86\% per day, which should decrease according to fish
   size.},

Abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) radio occultation (RO) observations,
   first made of Earth's atmosphere in 1995, have contributed in new ways
   to the understanding of the thermal structure and variability of the
   tropical upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS), an important
   component of the climate system. The UTLS plays an essential role in the
   global radiative balance, the exchange of water vapor, ozone, and other
   chemical constituents between the troposphere and stratosphere, and the
   transfer of energy from the troposphere to the stratosphere. With their
   high accuracy, precision, vertical resolution, and global coverage, RO
   observations are uniquely suited for studying the UTLS and a broad range
   of equatorial waves, including gravity waves, Kelvin waves, Rossby and
   mixed Rossby-gravity waves, and thermal tides. Because RO measurements
   are nearly unaffected by clouds, they also resolve the upper-level
   thermal structure of deep convection and tropical cyclones as well as
   volcanic clouds. Their low biases and stability from mission to mission
   make RO observations powerful tools for studying climate variability and
   trends, including the annual cycle and intraseasonal-to-interannual
   atmospheric modes of variability such as the quasi-biennial oscillation
   (QBO), Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), and El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO). These properties also make them useful for evaluating climate
   models and detection of small trends in the UTLS temperature, key
   indicators of climate change. This paper reviews the contributions of RO
   observations to the understanding of the three-dimensional structure of
   tropical UTLS phenomena and their variability over time scales ranging
   from hours to decades and longer.},

Abstract = {Uptake rates of C-14 (filtration and the acidification-bubbling
   method-ABM) were measured weekly in a shallow region of the Patos Lagoon
   estuary (32-degrees-07'S, 52-degrees-06'W) between March 1989 and March
   1990. Phytoplankton production varied seasonally, the lowest values
   occurring in the austral winter (June-August 1989) and the highest rates
   during spring and summer (March 1989; September 1989-March 1990).
   Particulate carbon production varied between 0.65 and 70.6 mg C m-3 h-1
   and was mostly associated with organisms <20 mum (mean = 73.4\%).
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released by phytoplankton varied between
   0.1 and 89.3     Mg C M-3   h-1, representing approximately 22\% of
   total (particulate + dissolved) carbon uptake. Production rates
   estimated by the ABM ranged from 2.2 to 159.4  Mg C M-3  h-1 and were
   equivalent to the sum of particulate and dissolved carbon production,
   simultaneously determined by the filtration technique. In general,
   primary production rates related to incident irradiance and water
   temperature, whilst high seston loads and low nitrate concentrations
   appeared to limit photosynthetic activity. High rates of absolute DOC
   excretion were positively related to the particulate carbon production,
   although increased excretion percentages were found under high levels of
   both salinity and mean irradiance in the water column.},

Abstract = {It is proposed that liquid CO2 is mixed with pulverized limestone
   (CaCO3) and seawater in a pressure vessel. An emulsion is created which
   is piped to intermediate depth in the ocean, where the emulsion is
   released through a diffuser. The emulsion plume has a bulk density of
   1.4 kg m(-3), thus it will sink as a gravity current to greater depth
   from the release point. Several kinetic processes occur simultaneously:
   (a) the entrainment of seawater by the emulsion plume, (b) the
   dissolution of CaCO3, (c) the dissolution of CO2, and (d) the reaction
   of dissolved CO2 with CaCO3 to form bicarbonate. In the presence of
   CaCO3, the plume around the release point has a pH 5 instead of 3 around
   the release point of liquid CO2. Subsequent entrainment of seawater
   brings rapidly the pH to near ambient values. The resulting calcium and
   bicarbonate ions are available nutrients for marine organisms. The
   bicarbonate solution will stay in the ocean indefinitely as contrasted
   with carbonic acid which eventually would resurface and equilibrate with
   the atmosphere. Most importantly, the emulsion can be released slightly
   below 500 in, as the emulsified CO2 will not phase-separate and ascend
   to a depth where it would flash into vapor. This makes the release depth
   accessible to many more coastal power plants than the previously thought
   minimum depth of 1000 in for the release of pure liquid CO2.},

Title = {Temporal variability in emission category influence on organic matter
   aerosols in the Indian region},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {The dependence of carbonaceous aerosol properties, like radiation
   absorption and hygroscopicity, on the emission source of origin motivate
   this work. The influence of emission categories, including crop residue
   and forest burning, biofuel combustion, brick kilns, thermal power
   plants, diesel transport and ``other industry'', is estimated on organic
   matter (OM) surface concentrations in the Indian ocean region. The
   approach uses general circulation model predicted OM surface
   concentrations during a ship cruise, identifies probable source regions
   for high concentration episodes using the potential source contribution
   function, and estimates collocated OM emissions resolved by category.
   Distinct source regions identified, are the Indo-Gangetic Plain during
   20-30th January, 1999, and central/south India during 1-11th March,
   1999. Contributing emission categories are primarily biofuel combustion
   (18 Gg) during 20-30th January, but a combination of forest burning (8
   Gg), biofuel combustion (7 Gg) and crop residue (5 Gg) during 1-11th
   March. The magnitude of emission flux rather than spatial extent of an
   emission category, was seen to increase its influence on the receptor.
   This approach can be used to investigate seasonal and inter-annual
   variability in emission category influence on atmospheric pollutants.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {255},
Pages = {341-354},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Hybrid power systems with dc distribution are being considered for
   commercial marine vessels to comply with new stringent environmental
   regulations, and to achieve higher fuel economy. In this paper, detailed
   efficiency analysis of a shipboard dc hybrid power system is carried
   out. An optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize fuel consumption
   under various loading conditions. The studied system includes diesel
   engines, synchronous generator-rectifier units, a full-bridge
   bidirectional converter, and a Li-Ion battery bank as energy storage. In
   order to evaluate potential fuel saving provided by such a system, an
   online optimization strategy for fuel consumption is implemented. An
   Offshore Support Vessel (OSV) is simulated over different operating
   modes using the online control strategy. The resulted consumed fuel in
   the simulation is compared to that of a conventional ac power system,
   and also a dc power system without energy storage. The results show that
   while the dc system without energy storage provides noticeable fuel
   saving compared to the conventional ac system, optimal utilization of
   the energy storage in the dc system results in twice as much fuel
   saving. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Bayesian network to predict coastal vulnerability to sea level rise},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {Sea level rise during the 21st century will have a wide range of effects
   on coastal environments, human development, and infrastructure in
   coastal areas. The broad range of complex factors influencing coastal
   systems contributes to large uncertainties in predicting long-term sea
   level rise impacts. Here we explore and demonstrate the capabilities of
   a Bayesian network (BN) to predict long-term shoreline change associated
   with sea level rise and make quantitative assessments of prediction
   uncertainty. A BN is used to define relationships between driving
   forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response for the U. S.
   Atlantic coast that include observations of local rates of relative sea
   level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal
   slope, and shoreline change rate. The BN is used to make probabilistic
   predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea
   level rise rates. Results demonstrate that the probability of shoreline
   retreat increases with higher rates of sea level rise. Where more
   specific information is included, the probability of shoreline change
   increases in a number of cases, indicating more confident predictions. A
   hindcast evaluation of the BN indicates that the network correctly
   predicts 71\% of the cases. Evaluation of the results using Brier skill
   and log likelihood ratio scores indicates that the network provides
   shoreline change predictions that are better than the prior probability.
   Shoreline change outcomes indicating stability (-1 < rate < 1 m/yr) or
   erosion (rate < -1 m/yr) tend to occur for two sets of input scenarios.
   Stable shoreline change rates occur mainly for low rates of relative sea
   level rise and occur in low-vulnerability geomorphic settings. Rates
   indicating erosion result for cases where the rate of relative sea level
   rise is high and moderate-to-high vulnerability geomorphic settings
   occur. In contrast, accretion (rate > 1 m/yr) was not well predicted. We
   find that BNs can assimilate important factors contributing to coastal
   change in response to sea level rise and can make quantitative,
   probabilistic predictions that can be applied to coastal management
   decisions.},

Title = {A novel forecasting model for wind speed assessment using sentinel
   family satellites images and machine learning method},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {179},
Pages = {2198-2211},

Abstract = {Wind energy produced in near and offshore farms is constantly
   increasing, mainly thanks to the use of new technologies and the
   economic costs decrease. Data coming from satellites recently launched
   can be effectively used in near and offshore areas for wind speed
   mapping, and long and short-term analyses of wind regimes. Furthermore,
   the use of artificial intelligence methods is constantly increasing for
   predicting wind energy production. In this framework, a new forecasting
   model for wind speed assessment is presented integrating Sentinel
   satellite imagery analysis, in two phases using multi-sensor satellites,
   and machine learning methods. In the first step, wind speed and
   bathymetry have been analysed by means of sentinel-1 (S-1) and
   sentinel-2 (S-2) satellites images, respectively. Furthermore, a hybrid
   forecasting model has been proposed to assess and predict wind speed.
   The machine learning model consists of an integrated model using
   generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and the whale optimization
   algorithm (WOA). The new developed method has been then applied to
   assess wind energy potential around the Favignana island in Sicily,
   Italy. The results show that all the important primary parameters for a
   wind farm installations potential analysis, such as wind speed, water
   depth, and distance to the shoreline can be successfully analysed in a
   possible short time and freely. The following results have been obtained
   testing the new method: i) S-1 and S-2 satellite images have good
   potential for near and offshore wind speed assessment and bathymetry
   detection around Favignana island, ii) the root mean square error
   (RMSE), mean square error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error
   (MAPE) of the proposed forecasting model using the whole dataset are
   0.0205, 0.0159, and 6.8385 respectively, iii) the proposed forecasting
   model for wind speed has higher accuracy than other valid models. (c)

Abstract = {The sensitivity of tropical cyclone (TC) projection results to different
   models and the detection and tracking scheme used is well established.
   In this study, future climate projections of TC activity in the North
   Indian Ocean (NIO) are assessed with a model- and basin-independent
   detection and tracking scheme. The scheme is applied to selected models
   from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5)
   experiments forced under the historical and representative concentration
   pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) conditions. Most models underestimated the
   frequency of early season (April-June) TCs and contained genesis biases
   equatorward of similar to 7.5 degrees N in comparison to the historical
   records. TC tracks detected in reanalysis and model data were input to a
   clustering algorithm simultaneously, with two clusters in the Arabian
   Sea and two in the Bay of Bengal (k = 4). Projection results indicated a
   slight decrease of overall TC genesis frequency in the NIO, with an
   increase of TC genesis frequency in the Arabian Sea (30-64\%) and a
   decrease in the Bay of Bengal (22-43\%), consistent between clusters in
   each of these sub-regions. These changes were largely due to changes in
   the pre-monsoon season (April-June) where Bay of Bengal TCs
   significantly decreased, consistent with changes in vertical ascent.
   Northern Arabian Sea TCs significantly increased during the pre-monsoon
   season, consistent with changes in vertical wind shear and relative
   humidity. There was a projected increase of TC frequency in the
   postmonsoon season (October-December), consistent with changes in
   relative humidity and vertical ascent, although not all clusters
   followed this trend; noting a different response in the southern Bay of
   Bengal. In turn, these projections caused changes to the climate
   averaged TC track density, including a decrease (up to 2 TCs per decade)
   affecting the eastern coast of India and a small increase (up to 0.5 TCs
   per decade) affecting eastern Africa, Oman and Yemen.},

Title = {Ultrastructure, morphology and flux of microzooplankton faecal pellets
   in an east Antarctic fjord},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {245},
Pages = {133-148},
Abstract = {Small copepods and protozoa are major contributors to heterotrophic
   biomass in Antarctic waters. They produce small (< 300 mum) faecal
   pellets, the fates of which are largely unknown. We examined the
   distribution and abundance of microzooplankton and small faecal pellets
   in Ellis Fjord, east Antarctica. We determined statistical relationships
   between the abundance of microzooplankton and pellets, and examined
   pellet morphology and ultrastructure using light and scanning electron
   microscopy. Our results indicate species-specific differences in the
   morphology and fate of pellets produced by small copepods: Oithona
   similis and harpacticoid pellets were retained in upper waters, while
   Oncaea curvata and Paralabidocera antarctica pellets sank to depth.
   Protozoan pellets did not sink to depth irrespective of their source or
   morphology and despite the fact they can be larger than those produced
   by small copepods. The majority of microzooplankton pellets, composed of
   phytoplankton that otherwise may have directly sedimented to depth, was
   retained in near surface waters and probably recycled and remineralised.
   Despite producing faecal aggregates, heterotrophic activity of most
   microzooplankton do not contribute to vertical flux but instead support
   respiration of matter in upper waters. This may reduce the vertical flux
   of particulate matter to depth, thereby reducing the capacity of
   Antarctic waters to act as a carbon sink, with implications for global
   climate.},

Title = {Improvement of Geomechanical Properties of Bio-remediated Aeolian Sand},
Journal = {GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {132-140},
Abstract = {Aeolian sand is widely distributed in the desert. It is susceptible to
   wind erosion because it consists of fine particles that lack cohesion
   between them. Wind erosion of Aeolian sand, dune migration, and dust
   storms in deserts affect the environment and infrastructure severely.
   Conventional chemical methods for lessening the effect of wind erosion
   are environmentally unfriendly. This paper examines Aeolian sand
   bio-remediated by microbially induced calcite precipitations (MICPs).
   The geomechanical properties of the Aeolian sand remediated by MICP were
   tested to explore its behavior as a desert bio-crust. The results
   indicated that a bio-crust of Aeolian sand with suitable strength
   required 7 days for formation. The remediated Aeolian sand had an
   average unconfined compression strength of 0.66 MPa and an average inner
   friction angle of 36 degrees at a bacterial concentration in the OD600
   range of 0.5-0.8. These findings indicate that formation of bio-crust
   could serve as protection against desert erosion. The particle
   characteristics and the porosity of Aeolian sand play an important role
   in the formation of the bio-crust. Crust from bio-remediated
   well-graded, high-porosity soil is stronger than crust from
   bio-remediated, poorly graded, low-porosity soil, given that both soils
   have the same bacteria concentration.},

Title = {Navigating the Complexity of Regional Ocean Governance Through the Large
   Marine Ecosystems Approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Governance is a multifaceted and complex process, involving a wide range
   of stakeholders from numerous institutions and individuals with
   different interests, agendas and sets of skills. A number of barriers
   exist for states to work together on securing their shared coastal and
   marine ecosystems, with discussions often becoming clouded when disputes
   arise over Exclusive Economic Zones, borders, oil and gas resources,
   continental shelves, maritime transport, and fisheries. Over the last
   twenty-six years, the Global Environment Facility's (GEF) International
   Waters focal area has utilized the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) approach
   to navigate the complex problems related to transboundary issues
   affecting the world's marine ecosystems, of which forty-one out of
   sixty-six are shared (62\%) by one or more countries. To overcome the
   disputes and assumptions about the intentions of neighboring states, the
   GEF developed the Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis-Strategic Action
   Programme (TDASAP) assessment and strategic planning processes to help
   countries learn how to work together and build trust. This formal and
   inclusive process analyses all pertinent factual and scientific
   information to set priorities for action. This practical method for
   integrating science into management has provided an effective approach
   to inform and advance sustainable LME management and governance regimes;
   however, there is not a one size fits all approach. This review presents
   six examples from the GEF International Waters portfolio that
   demonstrate how the LME Approach and TDA-SAP process have helped
   countries find the best way to mainstream ecosystem-based management
   approaches into existing contexts and politics. While these examples
   span a wide range of different settings (geographic, political,
   socio-economic, temporal), they have all applied the LME Approach and
   TDA-SAP process to tackle complex regional ocean governance issues. Each
   example provides a historical perspective, the key results achieved, and
   their unique lessons learned/best practices. Furthermore, the review
   identifies some of the overall shortcomings of the process and the
   common lessons learned, underscoring the complex and daunting challenge
   of achieving effective governance for multi-country LMEs. The experience
   provided by these examples shows that practical ecosystem-based
   management of the ocean and its coasts not only requires flexibility and
   adaptability, but also time, associated long-term vision and commitment.},

Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {A train operation optimization by minimizing its traction energy subject
   to various constraints is carried out using nature-inspired evolutionary
   algorithms. The optimization process results in switching points that
   initiate cruising and coasting phases of the driving. Due to nonlinear
   optimization formulation of the problem, nature-inspired evolutionary
   search methods, Genetic Simulated Annealing, Firefly, and Big Bang-Big
   Crunch algorithms were employed in this study. As a case study a
   real-like train and test track from a part of Eskisehir light rail
   network were modeled. Speed limitations, various track alignments,
   maximum allowable trip time, and changes in train mass were considered,
   and punctuality was put into objective function as a penalty factor.
   Results have shown that all three evolutionary methods generated
   effective and consistent solutions. However, it has also been shown that
   each one has different accuracy and convergence characteristics.},

Title = {Improved Management Effectiveness of a Marine Protected Area through
   Prioritizing Performance Indicators},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-115},
Abstract = {The management success of a marine protected area (MPA) is essentially a
   social construct because people have differing views on what defines
   success. Conflicting opinions between stakeholders need to be identified
   and resolved to ensure these factors do not interfere with successful
   functioning of MPAs. This study looked at developing and prioritizing
   performance indicators for Maria Island Marine Nature Reserve (MIMNR),
   Australia. Performance indicators were developed for MIMNR based on an
   expert-led, structured framework and then prioritized using the Analytic
   Hierarchy Process (AHP), with respect to input from key informants of
   stakeholder groups. Results showed that all stakeholder groups agreed
   that management of MIMNR should first focus on abundance and size of
   native species, and that managers, fishers, and environmental
   nongovernmental organizations place a significantly higher priority on
   ecological over socioeconomic and governance performance indicators.
   Researchers placed even emphasis across all priorities. Results suggest
   that MIMNR should first focus on monitoring abundance and size of native

Abstract = {The storage method under a perfectly controlled atmosphere (PCA), in
   which not only O2, CO2 and relative humidity (RH) were controlled but
   also metabolic volatiles such as ethylene, acetaldehyde and others were
   automatically removed, was applied to mature-green mume fruit (Japanese
   apricot cv. Ohshuku). The fruits were stored under conditions of 2
   approximately 3 \% O2 and 3\%, 8\%, 13\% and 18\% CO2 at 20-degrees-C
   and 100\% RH, and the effects of environmental gases on the shelf-life
   were investigated and compared with seal-packaging method (using both
   linear low density polyethylene film with 30-mu-m thickness and an
   ethylene-acetaldehyde removing agent). (1) C2H4 evolution was detected
   at the 19th day for seal-packaging and at the 15th, 19th, 23rd and 23rd
   day for PCA storage of 3\%, 8\%, 13\% and 18\% CO2, respectively, while
   it was detected at the 3rd day in air. (2) Surface yellowing and flesh
   softening were delayed remarkably at higher CO2 levels than at lower
   levels, (3) Pitting like injury occurred in the fruits stored in air,
   and internal browning which was caused by low O2 (< 2\%) or high
   acetaldehyde (> 90 ppm) occurred in seal-packaged fruits. No injury was
   observed up to the 23rd day during PCA storage of 3 approximately 13\%
   CO2, while two types of CO2 injury were caused at 18\% CO2. (4) Adding
   two days for distribution, the shelf-life were 12 days for
   seal-packaging and 15, 15, 19 and 12 days for PCA storage of 3\%, 8\%,
   13\% and 18\% CO2, respectively.},

Abstract = {Ireland is working to double the economic contribution of its (sic)2.2bn
   marine sector by 2030 by focusing on expanding offshore energy,
   shipping, commercial fishing, and tourism sectors. This growth will be
   sensitive to environmental considerations, with a stated goal of
   achieving healthy ecosystems `that provide monetary and non-monetary
   goods and services'. Such a goal may prove challenging if short-term
   economic priorities threaten long-term ecosystem functions and
   resilience. This study determines the intrinsic value of the marine
   realm via attitudinal data of stakeholders by employing a grounded
   theory approach utilizing Q-methodology. Stakeholders were sorted into
   three categorical factors (Nature Collaborators, Sustainability Seekers,
   and Nature Technicians), each representing a significantly distinct
   ecological thought. It is evident within the scope of this study that
   stakeholders value and understand intrinsic value, despite it not being
   adequately represented in policy decisions to date. This research seeks
   to demonstrate how stakeholder engagement and Q-methodology can be
   utilized to address current policy shortcomings in the EU and Irish
   context, specifically when attempting to modernize policy approaches to
   be holistic and integrated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Microgrids and smart grids are the future of the conventional grids. It
   will be an immense need to integrate the Distributed Generators (DGs)
   with smart grids and microgrids. DGs are mostly the solar energy, wind
   energy and small hydel power. These DGs has several advantages as high
   penetration of power will reduce the power loss, reduce the voltage drop
   and maintain the terminal voltage. These DGs are difficult to integrate
   with the microgrids in islanded mode as these causes severe fluctuation
   which disturbs the supply-demand balance. Renewable generators (RGs)
   working in MPPT mode cause high fluctuations when the RGs are working on
   islanded mode and generating more power than demand. Therefore, a
   control system is required to manage this issue and to maintain the
   balance of the system. Sub-gradient based distributed coordination
   technique is utilized for the control of renewable generators in which
   the supply-demand balance is maintained by coordinating the system with
   the utilization level. Simulation results will exhibit the operation of
   the controlled microgrid, its integrated DGs and will prove the
   efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2020

Abstract = {In this article we present two logics of water efficiency: that of the
   Water Footprint and that of mango smallholder farmers on the desert
   coast of Peru (in Motupe). We do so in order to explore how both can
   learn from each other and to discuss what happens when the two logics
   meet. Rather than treating the Water Footprint as scientific, in the
   sense that it is separate from traditions or politics, and Motupe poza
   irrigation as cultural and, therefore, thick with local beliefs and
   superstitions, we describe both as consisting of intricate entanglements
   of knowledge and culture. This produces a more or less level playing
   field for the two water logics to meet and for proponents of each to
   enter into a conversation with one another; allowing furthermore for the
   identification of what Water Footprint inventors and promotors can learn
   from poza irrigators, and vice versa. The article concludes that
   important water wisdom may get lost when the Water Footprint logic
   becomes dominant, as is currently about to happen in Peru.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of studies on the effects of the slope
   gradient of a fully permeable submerged breakwater. A newly developed
   numerical model is used, which is able to consider the flow through a
   porous medium with inertial, linear and nonlinear resistance terms. The
   model is therefore able to directly simulate the interaction between the
   wave-structure and the sand-seabed for a submerged breakwater. The model
   can also determine the eddy viscosity with the LES turbulence model in a
   2-dimensional wave field. The developed model was validated by
   comparison with existing experimental data for wave deformations caused
   by the rectangular permeable submerged breakwater. It was later used for
   various numerical experiments which investigated the complicated
   hydrodynamics associated with the varying slope gradient of a permeable
   submerged breakwater. Numerical results revealed that the reflection and
   transmission coefficients decrease simultaneously with a decrease in
   slope gradient and the wave breaking over the crown of the submerged
   breakwater tends to move towards the offshore side with the steep slope
   gradient of the breakwater. In addition, clockwise circulation flow is
   generated behind the submerged breakwater, and its magnitude increases
   with the slope of the structure.},

Abstract = {Ocean warming under climate change threatens coral reefs directly,
   through fatal heat stress to corals and indirectly, by boosting the
   energy of cyclones that cause coral destruction and loss of associated
   organisms. Although cyclone frequency is unlikely to rise, cyclone
   intensity is predicted to increase globally, causing more frequent
   occurrences of the most destructive cyclones with potentially severe
   consequences for coral reef ecosystems. While increasing heat stress is
   considered a pervasive risk to coral reefs, quantitative estimates of
   threats from cyclone intensification are lacking due to limited data on
   cyclone impacts to inform projections. Here, using extensive data from
   Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), we show that increases in cyclone
   intensity predicted for this century are sufficient to greatly
   accelerate coral reef degradation. Coral losses on the outer GBR were
   small, localized and offset by gains on undisturbed reefs for more than
   a decade, despite numerous cyclones and periods of record heat stress,
   until three unusually intense cyclones over 5 years drove coral cover to
   record lows over > 1500 km. Ecological damage was particularly severe in
   the central-southern region where 68\% of coral cover was destroyed over
   > 1000 km, forcing record declines in the species richness and abundance
   of associated fish communities, with many local extirpations. Four years
   later, recovery of average coral cover was relatively slow and there
   were further declines in fish species richness and abundance. Slow
   recovery of community diversity appears likely from such a degraded
   starting point. Highly unusual characteristics of two of the cyclones,
   aside from high intensity, inflated the extent of severe ecological
   damage that would more typically have occurred over 100s of km.
   Modelling published predictions of future cyclone activity, the
   likelihood of more intense cyclones within time frames of coral recovery
   by mid-century poses a global threat to coral reefs and dependent
   societies.},

Title = {Effect of Different Mineralogical Proportions on the Electrical

   and Pressures},
Journal = {MINERALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Electrical conductivities of the dry hot-pressed sintering gabbro with
   various mineralogical proportions (Cpx(X)Pl(100-X), X = 0, 10, 20, 30,
   40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 vol\% (the signals of Cpx and Pl denote
   clinopyroxene and plagioclase, respectively) were measured in the
   YJ-3000t multi-anvil pressure and Solartron-1260 impedance spectroscopy
   analyzer at temperatures of 773-1073 K and pressures of 1.0-3.0 GPa. At
   the given pressure conditions, the electrical conductivity and
   temperature conformed to an Arrhenius relation. For the fixed
   mineralogical composition of Cpx(50)Pl(50), the electrical
   conductivities of the samples significantly increased with the rise of
   temperature, but slightly decreased with increasing pressure.
   Furthermore, the activation energy and activation volume were determined
   as 1.06 +/- 0.12 eV and 6.00 +/- 2.00 cm(3)/mole, respectively. As for
   the various mineralogical compositions of dry gabbro, the electrical
   conductivities of the samples increased with the rise of volume
   percentage of clinopyroxene (Cpx) at 1.0 GPa. It is proposed that the
   main conduction mechanism is the small polaron, owing to the positive
   relation between the electrical conductivity and the iron content in
   samples. On the basis of these obtained conductivity results,
   laboratory-based electrical conductivity-depth profiles for the
   hot-pressed sintering gabbro with various mineralogical proportions and
   temperature gradients were successfully established. In conclusion,
   although the present acquired electrical conductivity results on the dry
   hot-pressed sintering gabbro with various mineralogical proportions
   cannot explain the high conductivity anomaly in the oceanic crust and
   West African craton, it can provide one reasonable constraint on the

Abstract = {Management of invasive species is integral to, the maintenance of
   freshwater environments. Habitat protection alone will not protect the
   full range of indigenous communities or ecosystem services. It is also
   contentious as it may involve. removal of valued introduced sport
   fishes. An invasive fish can be defined as any species that
   significantly adversely affects the long-term survival or genetic
   variation of native species, or the integrity or sustainability of
   natural communities. Implications for sport fish, particularly trout,
   must be considered within the context that they are valued by the
   public, have statutory protection, and their presence contributes to
   conservation of New Zealand's fresh waters. Standard pest management
   criteria also demonstrates that widespread management of some sport fish
   species is likely to be neither socially acceptable, nor technically or
   fiscally feasible. Nevertheless there will be circumstances under which
   management will be required. Invasive fish may also include exotic fish
   that threaten valued introduced species, or impact upon waterway
   condition and services. The continued spread. of introduced species
   indicates that management of invasive fish requires urgent attention and
   a coordinated multi-agency approach. Any response should draw upon
   established terrestrial pest management frameworks, and the experience
   of terrestrial pest operations (national and international), island
   eradications and international fishery restoration programmes.},

Abstract = {The need to reduce the carbon footprint has paved the way for harnessing
   electricity generation from the renewable energy resource i.e. wind.
   However, its intermittency leads to a wide gap between supply and demand
   of the user. The battery energy storage in conjunction with the wind
   generation system controls the energy flow and curb the variability
   issues hampering the power quality of the grid. Here, in this work, wind
   power based microgrid is interfaced to a 3-phase AC distribution network
   with seamless transfer between the grid to standalone/standalone to the
   grid operating mode. In the case of the grid failure, the control
   seamlessly transits from the current control to the voltage control. The
   grid connected mode and standalone mode of operation are enabled
   according to the signal provided to the static transfer switches (STS).
   The power quality (PQ) improvement along with energy surety and
   sufficiency are perceived by managing the local load support. The
   self-correcting sign-sign (SCSS) adaptive filter is used to control the
   microgrid in the grid connected mode of operation, while the enhanced
   proportional resonant (EPR) controller with binary generalized
   integrator based phase locked loop (BGI-PLL) is utilized in the voltage
   control mode. The improved encoderless scheme adopted to estimate the
   speed and rotor position of the wind generator, reduces the cost of the
   mechanical sensors. The co-operational behavior of the microgrid is
   obtained.},

Abstract = {Conventional (one-dimensional) chemostratigraphy of marine carbonates
   assesses the chemical archive of individual stratigraphic sections and
   their correlation in space and time. Whereas this approach has shown to
   be of value when linking isobathymetric domains, usually characterised
   by similar facies, more caution is needed when correlations are extended
   across different physiographic settings and hence different facies
   belts. Here, the spatial geochemical record of Pennsylvanian
   platform-margin-to-basin transects across a bathymetric range of about
   800 m is documented and discussed in a process-oriented context.
   Particularly, the presence of layered palaeo-water masses and their
   potential control on slope facies distribution and geochemical
   properties requires attention. Whereas Carboniferous thermo- and/or
   chemo-clines most likely affected depth-related slope facies zonation,
   it was facies change and hence, variances in porosity-permeability
   properties, that controlled differential early burial diagenetic
   alteration. Specifically, the lower-slope related breccia facies is
   characterised by higher volumes of early burial carbonate cements. This
   implies that these sediments entered the shallow-burial domain with a
   considerable open pore space and gave way to an increased rock:fluid
   ratio. Whereas the delta C-13 record is invariant with bathymetry, the
   more diagenesis-sensitive delta O-18 proxy, records pronounced shifts
   observed across major facies boundaries. From this it is concluded that
   although the primary controlling factor of slope facies distribution
   with depth is probably palaeoceanographic in nature, it is differential
   rock:fluid ratios that control the first-order, spatial shifts in delta
   O-18 composition. These findings show that one-dimensional
   chemostratigraphy will severely underestimate the complexity of
   three-dimensional (bathymetric) data sets across platform margins. This
   is of relevance for the interpretation of the geochemical archive of
   fossil carbonate platforms in general. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Nd isotopic variations and its implications in the recent sediments from

Abstract = {The chondrite-normalized REE distribution patterns in recent sediments
   from the northern South China Sea and surrounding areas are similar,
   with the HREE values being almost equal to or slightly higher, and the
   La-N/Lu-N ratio being lower, than PAAS standards. However, samples from
   the Xijiang River, a major branch of the Pearl River system, show
   opposite trends, i.e., with slightly lower HREE values and higher
   La-N/Lu-N ratio than PAAS. The distribution of Nd isotopes in sediments
   from the northern South China Sea was controlled by the Pearl River and
   the inshore area of South China, respectively. The volume of
   epsilon(Nd)(0) from inshore areas of southern China is apparently higher
   than that from the Pearl River, and epsilon(Nd)(0) values in offshore
   sediments and Taiwan Island are between these values. The results
   clearly show that epsilon(Nd)(0) volume in the northeastern South China
   Sea is higher than in the southwest part of the northern South China
   Sea, indicating different source rock types. The main source rock of the
   Pearl River sediment is carbonate types and affects sediment deposition
   in the southwest of the northern South China Sea, while the source rock
   in the inshore area of southern China, mainly Mesozoic and Cenozoic
   granites, contributes to sediments in the northeastern area of the
   northern South China Sea. Due to different source rock types, the HREE
   values and the volume of epsilon(Nd)(0) in recent sediments supplied by
   the inshore area of southern China are higher than those from the Pearl
   River. Over 80\% of the rapidly accumulated sediments on the northern
   slope of the South China Sea in the southeast of Dongsha Islands area
   were derived from Taiwan Island and from inshore areas of South China,
   with only less than 20\% from the Pearl River.},

Abstract = {Management models are developed and solved that are based on the

   solution results demonstrate potential feasibility of using the
   embedding technique for the development of multiple-objective coastal
   aquifer management models. In general, a planned, spatially and
   temporally, varying pumping strategy, obtained as solutions of an
   embedded optimization model, is shown to be a viable management method
   for beneficial exploitation and salinity control of a coastal aquifer.
   The potential feasibility of these management models for evolving a

   exploitation of the aquifer and to control or remediate contamination
   due to seawater intrusion is also demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of ecosystem service value
   (ESV) and the driving mechanisms of spatial differentiation are
   fundamental to exploring the sustainable development of regional
   ecosystems. This article selected a coastal region in southeastern China
   with rapid economic development as the study object. Based on the five
   land-use remote sensing data sets from 2000 to 2019, the benefit
   transfer method was used to evaluate the ESV in the coastal zone of
   Jiangsu Province, revealing the spatial and temporal evolution
   characteristics of ESV more accurately. Meanwhile, using the panel data
   regression model delved into the driving mechanisms of ESV spatial
   heterogeneity. The results showed the following: (1) There was a marked
   change in land use types from 2000 to 2019, with significant reductions
   in cropland and water areas and continued urban land expansion. The
   overall ESV in the study area exhibited a downward trend (8.41\%), with
   regulation and support services being its core functions. (2) The ESV
   distribution had a distinct spatial differentiation, with hotspots
   mainly located near the coastal zone and cold spots in towns and
   surrounding areas. (3) There were considerable differences in the degree
   of impact of each influencing factor on different types of ESVs. On the
   whole, land use intensity had the most significant impact and was the
   first driver, followed by climate change and socioeconomic factors. The
   findings indicate that future ecosystem management decision-making
   should involve the conservation and intensive use of land resources and
   guide human livelihood and production activities toward ESV preservation

Abstract = {{[}1] The Matuyama Diatom Maximum (MDM) is a time of peak opal
   accumulation from 2.6 to similar to2.0 Ma within the Benguela Current
   upwelling system that was initiated by increased influence of Southern
   Ocean water on the eastern South Atlantic. We measured opal, total
   organic carbon (TOC), and CaCO3 fluxes and C and N stable isotopes in
   sediments deposited from 2.4 to 1.95 Ma at Sites 1082 and 1084 to
   explore the biogeochemical dynamics within the Benguela region. The
   infusion of Southern Ocean water delivered dissolved nutrients and
   Southern Ocean flora and fauna, resulting in local opal accumulation
   increasing up to 8 g/cm(2)ky and the production of diatom mats. Some
   delta(15)N measurements of diatom-bound organic matter indicate that the
   mats grew within the Benguela region. The bulk sediment delta(15)N
   records are taken to reflect changes in the delta(15)N of nitrate in the
   incoming water, where lower values at 2.4 Ma reflect less nitrate
   utilization in the Antarctic. A long-term increase in relative nitrate
   uptake in the Southern Ocean is evidenced by the gradual increase in
   delta(15)N toward 1.9 Ma.},

Abstract = {Sand flies are important vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis, especially
   along coastal towns of northwestern Libya where an estimated 20,000
   cases have occurred from 2004 to 2009. Host-seeking traps are an
   important tool for sampling sand fly populations and surveying the
   incidence of Leishmania major and L. tropica within a given population.
   We evaluated the capture efficiency of CO2-baited BG-Sentinel, Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light, CDC ultraviolet light,
   and nonbaited CO2 CDC light traps in 3 coastal townships during June,
   August, September, and November 2010. A total of 3,248 sand flies,
   representing 8 species from 2 genera, were collected; most sand flies
   were identified as either Phlebotomus papatasi or P. longicuspis. Three
   of the traps captured significantly more sand flies compared to the
   BG-Sentinel baited with CO2 (P < 0.001). Three of 456 DNA pools
   extracted from sand flies were positive for Leishmania DNA, indicating a
   minimum estimated infection rate of 0.83\% and 0.47\% for P. papatasi
   and P. longicuspis, respectively.},

Abstract = {Marine heatwaves can cause coral bleaching and reduce coral cover on
   reefs, yet few studies have identified ``bright spots,{''} where corals
   have recently shown a capacity to survive such pressures. We analyzed
   7714 worldwide surveys from 1997 to 2018 along with 14 environmental and
   temperature metrics in a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify
   conditions that contribute to present-day coral cover. We also
   identified locations with significantly higher (i.e., ``bright
   spots{''}) and lower coral cover (i.e., ``dark spots{''}) than
   regionally expected. In addition, using 4-km downscaled data of
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, we projected
   coral cover on reefs for the years 2050 and 2100. Coral cover on modern
   reefs was positively associated with historically high maximum
   sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), and negatively associated with high
   contemporary SSTs, tropical-cyclone frequencies, and human-population
   densities. By 2100, under RCP8.5, we projected relative decreases in
   coral cover of >40\% on most reefs globally but projected less decline
   on reefs in Indonesia, Malaysia, the central Philippines, New Caledonia,
   Fiji, and French Polynesia, which should be focal localities for
   multinational networks of protected areas.},

Title = {Delineating metabolomic changes in native isolate Aurantiochytrium for
   production of docosahexaenoic acid in presence of varying carbon
   substrates},
Journal = {ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {55},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic
   acid (DHA) have industrial significance due to their benefits in human
   nutrition and health. In this context, our preliminary screening with
   glucose (i.e., 2\%, 3\%, 4\%, 6\%, 8\% and 10\% w/v), in a marine
   indigenous thraustochytrid Aurantiochytrium sp., revealed that a
   concentration of 3\% (w/v) was the optimal for further study.
   Henceforth, the impact of complementation to improve the biomass and DHA
   production were assessed with other alternative carbon substrates like
   galactose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, and glycerol. Our results
   demonstrate that the overall biomass and DHA productivities were maximal
   in 3\% (w/v) glycerol, i.e. 1.91 g L-1 D-1, and 134.76 mg L-1 D-1,
   respectively. Also, utilization profiles of different carbon substrates
   demonstrate that although glycerol (0.174 g h-1) has a lower consumption
   rate than glucose (0.209 g h-1), galactose and fructose (0.208 g h-1),
   it results in higher biomass (Yx/s) yield of 0.5 g g- 1 of the
   substrate. Further the investigation was done by qualitative
   metabolomics through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
   identified 34 metabolites comprised of fatty acids, sugars, and organic
   acids which were found to be significantly regulated. This led to our
   hypothesis that glycerol can induce cell growth with improved fatty acid
   yields via., upregulation of pentose phosphate pathway. In conclusion,
   this study demonstrates efficient valorization of biorefinery
   by-products (such as crude glycerol) as a cost-effective alternative for
   the production of high-value added PUFAs from heterotrophic
   thraustochytrids, the essential ingredients for food, nutraceutical and
   pharmaceutical industries.},

Title = {Major and Trace Element Geochemistry of the Permian-Triassic Boundary
   Section at Meishan, South China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {We report extensive major and trace element data for the
   Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) at Meishan, China. Analyses of 64
   samples from a 2.5 m section span the last 75 kyr of the Permian and the
   first 335 kyr of the Triassic, from beds 24 to 34. We also report data
   for 20 acetic acid extracts that characterize the carbonate fraction.
   Whole rock major element data reflect the change of lithology from
   carbonate in the Permian to mudstone and marl in the Triassic, indicate
   an increase of siliciclastic input and MgO in and above the extinction
   interval (beds 24f-28), and silica diagenesis in carbonates below the
   extinction horizon. Above bed 27, enrichment factors calculated with
   respect to Al and Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) are similar to 1
   for most trace elements, confirming that siliciclastic input dominates
   trace element distributions in the Triassic. Within the extinction
   interval, beds 24f and 26 show increases in As, Mo, U and some
   transition metals. V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ba are variably
   enriched, particularly in bed 26. Below the extinction interval, the top
   of bed 24d shows enrichment of V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ba in a
   zone of diagenetic silicification. Trace elements thus reflect
   siliciclastic input, diagenetic redistribution, and responses to redox
   conditions. Trace element patterns suggest either a change in provenance
   of the detrital component, or a change in the proportion of mechanical
   to chemical weathering that is coincident with the beginning of the
   extinction in bed 24f. Ba, Zr, and Zn behave anomalously. Ba shows
   little variation, despite changes in biological activity and redox
   conditions. The enrichment factor for Zr is variable in the carbonates
   below bed 24f, suggesting diagenetic Zr mobility. Zn shows a sharp drop
   in the extinction horizon, suggesting that its distribution was related
   to phytoplankton productivity. Rare earth element content is controlled
   by the siliciclastic fraction, and carbonate extracts show middle rare
   earth enrichment due to diagenesis. Ce and Eu anomalies are not reliable
   indicators of the redox environment at Meishan.},

Abstract = {In this study, we provide a method to quantify the uncertainty
   associated with sampling particle size distributions (PSD), using a
   global compilation of Underwater Vision Profiler observations (UVP,
   version 5). The UVP provides abundant in situ data of the marine PSD on
   global scales and has been used for a diversity of applications, but the
   uncertainty associated with its measurements has not been quantified,
   including how this uncertainty propagates into derived products of
   interest. We model UVP sampling uncertainty using Bayesian Poisson
   statistics and provide formulae for the uncertainty associated with a
   given sampling volume and observed particle count. We also model PSD
   observations using a truncated power law to better match the low
   concentration associated with rare large particles as seen by the UVP.
   We use the two shape parameters from this statistical model to describe
   changes in the PSD shape across latitude band, season, and depth. The
   UVP sampling uncertainty propagates into an uncertainty for modeled
   carbon flux exceeding 50\%. The statistical model is used to extend the
   size interval used in a PSD-derived carbon flux model, revealing a high
   sensitivity of the PSD-derived flux model to the inclusion of small
   particles (80-128 mu m). We provide avenues to address additional
   uncertainties associated with UVP-derived carbon flux calculations.},

Abstract = {People spend most of their time indoors. A comfortable indoor
   environment is thus essential for the occupants' good health and
   productivity. Buildings are responsible for about half of a modern
   society's total energy consumption. HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and
   Air-Conditioning) which is often used to provide thermal comfort to the
   occupants, in turn accounts for a major proportion of this energy
   demand. Minimising HVAC energy consumption will thus result in great
   economic benefits. It also contributes beneficially to the issue of
   sustainable future and climate change, by reducing fuel burning. Natural
   ventilation can be used to help reduce significantly HVAC energy demand.
   Solar chimney (thermal chimney) is a device which absorbs solar
   radiation to heat the air. The heated air, becoming buoyant, rises
   through the chimney's passage and induces further air currents. When
   fitted to a building, solar chimney can thus induce fresh outside air to
   flow through it for ventilation. As a very useful ventilation device,
   solar chimney has been the subject of many studies. However, due to the
   complex non-laminar, non-isothermal flow and heat transfer involved,
   there are still many factors affecting a solar chimney's performance
   (measured by the induced flow rate of air, for instance) not yet
   considered, especially regarding 3-dimensional computational modelling
   in real-sized building settings. This work thus investigates
   computationally natural ventilation induced by a roof-mounted solar
   chimney through a real-sized 3-dimensional room, using a commercial CFD
   (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software package which employs the Finite
   Volume Method. Chien's turbulence model of low-Reynolds-number K-s is
   used in a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) formulation. Thus, the
   full set of Reynolds-Averaged governing equations pertaining to non
   isothermal, buoyancy induced, incompressible, steady, turbulent flow of
   air near standard conditions at sea level, coupled with equations
   describing the Chien's turbulence model, are solved, with appropriate
   boundary conditions. No further simplifying assumptions are made. Grid
   convergence tests are conducted to make sure that the grid patterns used
   are appropriate. Adequate numerical convergence is allowed; this often
   requires that relative changes in the successive iterated solutions be
   less than 0.0001. Accumulation errors resulting from massive or lengthy
   computation are also carefully monitored and minimized. 64-bits
   precision is used throughout. It is found that entrance geometry to the
   chimney's channel affects significantly the ventilation rate, especially
   at higher solar heat flux, with rounded entrance resulting in higher
   rate. But these entrance-geometry effects also vary significantly with
   location of the room's inlet-opening which in its turn affects the flow
   path before the chimney's entrance.},

Abstract = {Submerged plates are widely used as breakwater device and wave energy
   convertor in costal and ocean engineering. It is of practical importance
   to account for the effects of plate on wave transformation and nonlinear
   wave loads on the plate. In this paper, a 2D fully nonlinear numerical
   wave flume is developed to investigate the nonlinear interactions
   between a regular wave and a submerged horizontal plate by use of a
   higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM) based on potential theory.
   An acceleration potential method is adopted to calculate the transient
   wave loads on the plate. The proposed model is verified against the
   published experimental and numerical data for nonlinear wave scattering
   by a submerged plate. Then numerical tests are performed to investigate
   the high free harmonics induced by the submerged plate and nonlinear
   wave loads on it. The second-order analysis shows a resonant behavior
   which is related to the ratio of the plate length to the second beat
   length. The wave-load analysis shows that the pressure on the upper
   surface oscillates more frequently than that on the lower surface. (C)

Abstract = {In this paper, an energy flow management algorithm for a
   grid-connected-photovoltaic system with battery storage devoted to
   supply a home is presented. This algorithm favours the fulfilment of the
   home energy demand by the energy produced by the photovoltaic generator
   or stored in the batteries than that got from the grid. This algorithm
   manages the flow of energy in the house through the combination of four
   switches. It was applied to the case of a home installed in a coastal
   region of Bou-Ismail (Algeria). The efficiency of the algorithm was
   tested for two weeks, a favourable week in summer and an unfavourable
   week in winter regarding the weather conditions. The simulation of the
   on grid PV system was done using real data of the irradiation and the
   temperature acquired by the meteorological station of the Bou-Ismail
   site and a home load profile for each season.
   The results obtained revealed that the energy demand satisfaction for
   the house is high in the favourable summer week and is only 33\% in the
   winter unfavourable week. To meet a high rate of self-consumption a Home
   Energy Management is required. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},

Abstract = {Ocean waves incident on coasts generate seismic surface waves in three
   frequency bands via three pathways: direct pressure on the seafloor
   (primary microseisms, PM), standing waves from interaction of incident
   and reflected waves (double-frequency microseisms, DF), and
   swell-transformed infragravity wave interactions (the Earth's seismic
   hum). Beamforming of USArray seismic data shows that the source azimuths
   of the generation regions of hum, PM and DF microseisms vary seasonally,
   consistent with hemispheric storm patterns. The correlation of beam
   power with wave height over all azimuths is highest in near-coastal
   waters. Seismic signals generated by waves from Hurricane Irene and from
   a storm in the Southern Ocean have good spatial and temporal correlation
   with nearshore wave height and peak period for all three wave-induced
   seismic signals, suggesting that ocean waves in shallow water commonly
   excite hum (via infragravity waves), PM, and DF microseisms
   concurrently.},

Title = {Evaluation of Abandoned Huanghe Delta as an Important Carbon Source for

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Increasing organic carbon (OC) inputs from coastal erosion contribute to
   large uncertainties in carbon cycling in coastal seas. The abandoned
   Huanghe Delta (AHD) is a typical coastal erosion region, which
   transports large amounts of eroded sediments to the Chinese marginal
   seas (CMS, not including the South China Sea). Here we investigated the
   organic geochemical characteristics of sedimentary organic matter (OM)
   from the heavily eroded region of the AHD and estimated the OC and
   lignin fluxes caused by coastal erosion. The eroded sedimentary OM was
   characterized by low carbon loading and low lignin content with high
   degradation and was influenced by the Changjiang. Owing to the sharp
   decline in the sediment fluxes from large rivers (the Changjiang and
   Huanghe) since the 1990s, the total fluxes to the CMS decreased from
   11.5 to 5.0 Mt/yr for OC and from 11.5 x 10(-2) to 4.7 x 10(-2) Mt/yr
   for lignin; therefore, the contribution from the coastal erosion of the
   AHD increased from 24\% +/- 8\% to 56\% +/- 10\% for OC and from 21\%
   +/- 9\% to 52\% +/- 15\% for lignin. The high proportion contributed by
   the AHD to the Central Yellow Sea mud area (74\% +/- 11\%) also
   accounted for the high terrestrial OC burial efficiency there (69\%).
   Considering the different nature of OM and its increasing contribution,
   as in this case, the significance of OC input from coastal erosion to
   the coastal seas is expected to overwhelm that from rivers, thereby
   influencing regional and even global carbon budgets and cycles,
   especially under the scenarios of global warming and sea level rise.},

Title = {The upper thermal limit of epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is
   conserved across three life history stages, sex and body size},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Owing to climate change, most notably the increasing frequency of marine
   heatwaves and long-term ocean warming, better elucidating the upper
   thermal limits of marine fishes is important for predicting the future
   of species and populations. The critical thermal maximum (CTmax), or the
   highest temperature a species can tolerate, is a physiological metric
   that is used to establish upper thermal limits. Among marine organisms,
   this metric is commonly assessed in bony fishes but less so in other
   taxonomic groups, such as elasmobranchs (subclass of sharks, rays and
   skates), where only thermal acclimation effects on CTmax have been
   assessed. Herein, we tested whether three life history stages, sex and
   body size affected CTmax in a tropical elasmobranch, the epaulette shark
   (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), collected from the reef flats surrounding
   Heron Island, Australia. Overall, we found no difference in CTmax
   between life history stages, sexes or across a range of body sizes.
   Findings from this research suggest that the energetically costly
   processes (i.e. growth, maturation and reproduction) associated with the
   life history stages occupying these tropical reef flats do not change
   overall acute thermal tolerance. However, it is important to note that
   neither embryos developing in ovo, neonates, nor females actively
   encapsulating egg cases were observed in or collected from the reef
   flats. Overall, our findings provide the first evidence in an
   elasmobranch that upper thermal tolerance is not impacted by life
   history stage or size. This information will help to improve our
   understanding of how anthropogenic climate change may (or may not)
   disproportionally affect particular life stages and, as such, where
   additional conservation and management actions may be required.},

Abstract = {Factors influencing reactive Fe cycling and its protection of organic
   carbon (OC) in sediments are poorly understood. Here we comparatively
   study Fe speciation and Fe-associated OC (Fe-OC) in surface sediments of
   the Bohai Sea (BHS) and southern Yellow Sea (SYS), two seas with common
   sediment sources but different depositional regimes. Though significant
   sequestration of highly reactive Fe (Fe-HR) is expected in the estuarine
   system stream from the river-dominated BHS, this pool is, however,
   slightly enriched in the BHS sediments relative to their source
   material. This reconfirms a previous speculation of sedimentary Fe-HR
   enrichment in semi-protected settings. Relative to the BHS, the SYS
   sediments are depleted of Fe-HR, despite common sediment sources of
   these two areas. Estuarine pre-enrichment and subsequent redistribution
   of Fe-HR in the BHS, and aging of Fe-bearing authigenic clays during
   transport from the BHS to the SYS are potential mechanisms for the
   depletion. The fractions (f(Fe-OC)) of Fe-OC in total OC in sediments of
   the two seas are at the lower end for soils and sediments, indicating Fe
   being a minor ``rusty sink.{''} C-13(Fe-OC) fractionations indicate
   preferential sequestration of terrestrial OC by Fe oxides in the BHS, in
   contrast with preferential retention of marine OC in the SYS. Different
   fractionations of C-13(Fe-OC) in the two seas are a net result of
   selective adsorption of OC by Fe oxides and selective stabilization of
   OC during Fe reductive dissolution. Preferential sequestration of
   terrestrial OC may exert an important influence on distribution and
   compositions of OC buried in the river-dominated system.},

Abstract = {Marine turtles are vulnerable to climate change because their life
   history and reproduction are tied to environmental temperatures. The egg
   incubation stage is arguably the most vulnerable stage, because marine
   turtle eggs require a narrow range of temperatures for successful
   incubation. Additionally, incubation temperature affects sex, emergence
   success, morphology and locomotor performance of hatchlings. Hatchlings
   often experience high rates of predation in the first few hours of their
   life, and increased size or locomotor ability may improve their chances
   of survival. Between 2010 and 2013 we monitored the temperature of
   loggerhead (Caretta caretta; Linnaeus 1758) turtle nests at Mon Repos
   Rookery, and used these data to calculate a mean three day maximum
   temperature (T3dm) for each nest. We calculated the hatching and
   emergence success for each nest, then measured the mass, size and
   locomotor performance of hatchlings that emerged from those nests. Nests
   with a T3dm greater than 34 degrees C experienced a lower emergence
   success and produced smaller hatchlings than nests with a T3dm lower
   than 34 degrees C. Hatchlings from nests with a T3dm below 34 degrees C
   performed better in crawling and swimming trials than hatchlings from
   nests with a T3dm above 34 degrees C. Thus even non-lethal increases in
   global temperatures have the potential to detrimentally affect fitness
   and survival of marine turtle hatchlings.},

   Upper Carboniferous and permian of central Spitsbergen (Svalbard)},
Journal = {FACIES},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {93-135},
Abstract = {Carbonate-dominated successions of the Gipsdalen and Tempelfjorden
   Groups from Svalbard record a significant shift from Photozoan to
   Heterozoan particle associations in neritic settings during the late
   Palaeozoic. During the Bashkirian, benthic particle associations which
   included photoautotrophs such as phylloid algae (Chloroforam
   Association) characterised shallow subtidal environments. Most
   depositional settings which endured siliciclastic terrestrial input
   exhibited poorly diversified associations dominated by brachiopods,
   bryozoans and siliceous sponges (Bryonoderm Association). During the
   Moscovian to Asselian, highly diversified associations typified by
   various calcareous green algae, Palaeoaplysina, Tubiphytes, fusulinids,
   smaller and encrusting foraminifers (Chloroforam Association) prevailed
   in carbonate sediments from supratidal to shallow subtidal environments.
   During the Sakmarian and Early Artinskian, oolitic carbonate sands
   (Chloroforam Association) typified intertidal flats, whereas shallow
   subtidal environments were occupied by moderately diversified
   associations with fusulinids, smaller foraminifers, echinoderms and
   bryozoans (Bryonoderm-extended Association) and poorly diversified
   associations with echinoderms, brachiopods and bryozoans (Bryonoderm
   Association). During the Late Artinskian to Kazanian, poorly diversified
   associations characterised by brachiopods, echinoderms and bryozoans
   (Bryonoderm Association), and sponge-dominated associations (Hyalosponge
   Association) reigned within siliceous carbonates of intertidal and
   shallow subtidal environments.
   This trend is interpreted as a result of climatic cooling and
   fluctuations of prevailing levels of trophic resources within
   shallow-water settings during the studied time period. While raised
   nutrient levels were restricted to near-shore settings during the
   Bashkirian, steady mesotrophic conditions arose from the Sakmarian
   onward and increased to late Permian times.},

Volume = {158},
Pages = {29-37},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Waves were generated in a numerical wave tank (NWT) using a piston type
   wave-maker. Firstly, the performance of a 1.8 m diameter Savonius rotor
   was tested at a mean wave height (H) and a mean wave period (7) of 2.00
   m and 12.68 s respectively. The Savonius rotor performed the best at a
   submergence depth of 1.0 D when compared to greater depths. The power
   produced by the rotor decreased by 37\% at 1.25 D compared to 1.0 D. In
   addition to this, the blade entry angle also affected the rotor
   performance. The 20 degrees rotor at 42.5 rpm was found to have the best
   performance. The maximum power and efficiency at the mean sea state were
   15.01 kW and 16.7\% respectively. Secondly, simulations were performed
   at the minimum sea state (H = 1.37 m, T = 10.00 s) and the maximum sea
   state (H = 2.34 m, T = 14.39 s). It is observed that the peak power at
   the maximum sea state is lower than the peak power at the mean sea
   state. The maximum power that the rotor produced was 15.01 kW at 42.5
   rpm which gave an efficiency of 16.7\% at the mean sea state.},

Title = {Using GRACE Data to Estimate Climate Change Impacts on the Earth's
   Moment of Inertia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {The widely used 15-year Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)
   measured mass redistribution shows an increasing trend in the nontidal
   Earth's moment of inertia (MOI). Various contributing components are
   independently evaluated using five high-quality atmospheric reanalysis
   datasets and a novelty numerical modeling system. We found a steady,
   statistically robust (passed a two-tailed t-test at p = 0.04 for dof =
   15) rate of MOI increase reaching similar to 11.0 x 10(27) kg m(2)/yr,
   equivalent to a 11.45 s mu /yr increase in the length of day, during
   2002-2017. Further analysis suggests that the Antarctic ice sheet
   contributes the most, followed by the Greenland ice sheet, the
   precipitation-driven land hydrological cycle, mountain glaciers, and the
   fluctuation of atmosphere, in this order. Short-term MOI spikes from the
   GRACE measurements are mostly associated with major low/mid-latitude
   earthquakes, fitting closely with the MOI variations from the
   hydrological cycle. Atmospheric fluctuation contributes the least but
   has a steady trend of 0.5 s mu /yr, with horizontal mass distribution
   contributing twice as much as the vertical expansion and associated lift
   of the atmosphere's center of mass. The latter is a previously
   overlooked term affecting MOI fluctuation. The contribution to the
   observed MOI trend from a warming climate likely will persist in the
   future, largely due to the continuous mass loss from the Earth's ice
   sheets.},

Abstract = {The oceans probably remained well-oxygenated for millions of years after
   the Palaeoproterozoic Lomagundi-Jatuli Event, according to high
   concentrations and isotope signatures of redox-sensitive metals in the
   2-billion-year-old Zaonega Formation, Russia.
   The approximately 2,220-2,060 million years old Lomagundi-Jatuli Event
   was the longest positive carbon isotope excursion in Earth history and
   is traditionally interpreted to reflect an increased organic carbon
   burial and a transient rise in atmospheric O-2. However, it is widely
   held that O-2 levels collapsed for more than a billion years after this.
   Here we show that black shales postdating the Lomagundi-Jatuli Event
   from the approximately 2,000 million years old Zaonega Formation contain
   the highest redox-sensitive trace metal concentrations reported in
   sediments deposited before the Neoproterozoic (maximum concentrations of
   Mo = 1,009 mu g g(-1), U = 238 mu g g(-1) and Re = 516 ng g(-1)). This
   unit also contains the most positive Precambrian shale U isotope values
   measured to date (maximum U-238/U-235 ratio of 0.79 parts per thousand),
   which provides novel evidence that there was a transition to modern-like
   biogeochemical cycling during the Palaeoproterozoic. Although these
   records do not preclude a return to anoxia during the Palaeoproterozoic,
   they uniquely suggest that the oceans remained well-oxygenated millions
   of years after the termination of the Lomagundi-Jatuli Event.},

Abstract = {A numerical method based on the movable cellular automata (MCA) is
   presented. The proposed method aims to investigate the tribological
   characteristics of polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimide, and
   polyetheretherketone sealing polymer materials in the microscale. The
   microscale frictional behavior and wear processes of four sealing
   materials are vividly shown through this grid method. The formation of a
   mechanically mixed layer is visualized, and the rotation angles of the
   automata and number of worn cellular automata are obtained. Friction
   coefficients of the four sealing materials are calculated and compared
   on a microscale mesh. Tests are conducted on a special test rig of the
   seal. Scanning electron microscopy investigations reveal the wear
   patterns of the four sealing composites. Results indicate that the MCA
   simulations are consistent with the scanning electron microscopy
   investigations in terms of the wear mechanism. The proposed MCA method
   can be used to investigate and compare the tribological characteristics
   of different sealing materials, which will significantly improve the
   efficiency of sealing material selection. Copyright (C) 2016 JohnWiley

Title = {Difference in the stable nitrogen isotope ratio of Sargassum piluliferum

Abstract = {In order to estimate the nitrogen loading from fish aquaculture
   facilities, we studied the nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios
   (delta N-15 and delta C-13, respectively) in the brown macroalga
   Sargassum piluliferum and small amphipod crustaceans Caprella spp., both
   of which are lower trophic level biota found at fish and pearl oyster
   aquaculture facilities situated along the eastern coast of the Uwa Sea,
   Japan. This coastal region is one of the least populated areas along the
   Japanese coast. The mean concentrations of chlorophyll a, dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic phosphate, and dissolved
   silicate-Si were 1.5- to 2-fold higher in samples from the fish
   aquaculture facilities than in those from the pearl oyster aquaculture
   facilities, indicating that the fish aquaculture facilities were
   associated with nitrogen loading. The delta N-15 abundance level in S.
   piluliferum collected from the fish aquaculture facilities was
   significantly higher (1.3aEuro degrees) than that in macroalga collected
   at the pearl oyster aquaculture facilities, whereas that in Caprella
   spp., primary consumers, was only slightly higher (0.3aEuro degrees).
   The feeding style of Caprella spp., which depends on suspended
   particulate organic matter and attached microalgae, is considered to the
   primary causal factor for the lack of a significant difference in delta
   N-15 abundance level between the two types of aquaculture facilities.
   Based on these results, we conclude that S. piluliferum found in close
   proximity of aquaculture facilities is a suitable organism for
   monitoring nitrogen loading from fish aquaculture facilities, through
   the analysis of delta N-15.},

Abstract = {We measured the mercury (Hg) in groundwater, aquifer sediments, and
   surface water in Waquoit Bay (Massachusetts) and found that this toxic
   metal (range: < 3.2-262 pM) was being released within the subterranean
   estuary, with similarly high levels (range: 18-256 pM) found in the
   surface waters of the bay. None of the dissolved species (DOC, chloride,
   and Fe) normally observed to influence Hg partitioning correlated well
   with the observed Hg concentrations. It was hypothesized that this was
   in part due to the variable loading in time and space of Hg onto the
   aquifer sands in combination with the seasonality of groundwater flow
   through the aquifer. Aquifer sediment samples from the study site ranged
   from < 1 to 12.5 pmol of Hg/g of sediment, suggesting log K-d values on
   the order of 1. We hypothesize that this was due to the low organic
   carbon content typical of the aquifer sediments. Last, it was estimated
   that submarine groundwater discharge supplied 0.47-1.9 nmol of Hg m(-2)
   day(-1) to the bay, which is an order of magnitude higher than the
   atmospheric deposition rate for the northeastern U.S.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Government intervention in the form of financial incentives is crucial
   for translating customer choice into a larger market share for solar
   thermal applications. The lengthy subsidy programs for solar water
   heaters in Taiwan have expanded the local market. On a remote island
   (Kinmen County), the area of solar collectors that are installed per
   1000 inhabitants is 192.9 square meters. This study investigates a
   market-driven mechanism in terms of disposable income, household
   structure, building type and financial viability. The dual subsidy
   programs appear to have distorted the local market. The cumulative
   energy savings for solar water heaters that are installed is misleading
   because the systems are over-designed and there is a high replacement
   rate (or shorter service period).},

Title = {Phosphate Scavenging During Lava-Seawater Interaction Offshore of
   Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii},
Journal = {GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The 2018, subaerial eruption of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, resulted in a
   5-km-long stretch of coastline that actively drained lava into the
   ocean. Nutrients were added to the surrounding ocean through the
   dissolution of basaltic rock and thermal upwelling of deep water,
   thereby fueling a large phytoplankton bloom. Lava-impacted, surface
   seawater had high suspended particle loads, and concentrations of
   chlorophyll, silicic acid, phosphate (P-i), nitrate, and iron that were
   elevated up to 12, 36, 5, 960, and 1,400 times, respectively, above the
   background oligotrophic levels. Widespread precipitation of iron
   oxyhydroxides (Fe-ox) led to extensive scavenging of the dissolved P-i
   pool, similar to what occurs along mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems.
   This scavenging transformed a ``fertilization{''} event into a P-i sink
   near the coast of the ocean entry; however, nutrient data from outside
   the bloom suggest that P-i could also desorb from the Fe-ox as it is
   dispersed into the open ocean. From lava quench experiments, we estimate
   that the hydration state of the Fe-ox precipitate (H2O/Fe) was 5.2-5.7,
   and that the equilibrium partition coefficient of P-i into Fe-ox
   (solid/liquid) was 10(6). In addition, P-33(i) radiotracer incubations
   were used to differentiate between biotic and abiotic uptake of P-i at
   Kilauea's ocean entry. These findings are important for understanding
   modern-day volcanic fertilization events, modeling nutrient dynamics
   during major events in Earth history (such as oxygenation of the
   atmosphere and the formation of large igneous provinces), and predicting
   the marine response to greater continental weathering in a warming
   climate.},

   and biogeochemical conditions and on marine ecosystems. Although
   long-term trends in sea surface temperature (SST) have long been
   attributed to trends in air temperature, there are however, strong
   seasonal and sub-basin scale heterogeneities of similar magnitude than
   the average trend which are not fully explained. Here, using
   reconstructed atmospheric forcing fields for the period 1850-2008,
   oceanic climate simulations were performed and analyzed to identify
   areas of homogenous SST trends using spatial clustering. Our results
   show that the Baltic Sea can be divided into five different areas of
   homogeneous SST trends: the Bothnian Bay, the Bothnian Sea, the eastern
   and western Baltic proper, and the southwestern Baltic Sea. A
   classification tree and sensitivity experiments were carried out to
   analyze the main drivers behind the trends. While ice cover explains the
   seasonal north/south warming contrast, the changes in surface winds and
   air-sea temperature anomalies (along with changes in upwelling
   frequencies and heat fluxes) explain the SST trends differences between
   the sub-basins of the southern part of the Baltic Sea. To investigate
   future warming trends climate simulations were performed for the period
   1976-2099 using two RCP scenarios. It was found that the seasonal
   north/south gradient of SST trends should be reduced in the future due
   to the vanishing of sea ice, while changes in the frequency of upwelling
   and heat fluxes explained the lower future east/west gradient of SST
   trend in fall. Finally, an ensemble of 48 climate change simulations has
   revealed that for a given RCP scenario the atmospheric forcing is the
   main source of uncertainty. Our results are useful to better understand
   the historical and future changes of SST in the Baltic Sea, but also in
   terms of marine ecosystem and public management, and could thus be used
   for planning sustainable coastal development.},

Title = {Geochemistry of Surface Sediments From the Emperor Seamount Chain, North
   Pacific},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Investigating the composition and distribution of pelagic marine
   sediments is fundamental in the field of marine sedimentology. The
   spatial distributions of surface sediment are unclear due to limited
   investigation along the Emperor Seamount Chain of the North Pacific. In
   this study, a suite of sedimentological and geochemical proxies were
   analyzed, including the sediment grain size, organic carbon, CaCO3,
   major and rare earth elements of 50 surface sediment samples from the
   Emperor Seamount Chain, spanning from similar to 33 degrees N to similar
   to 52 degrees N. On the basis of sedimentary components, we divide them
   into three Zones (I, II, and III) spatially with distinct features.
   Sediments in Zone I (similar to 33 degrees N-44 degrees N) and Zone III
   (49.8 degrees N-53 degrees N) are dominated by clayey silt, and mainly
   consist of sand and silty sand in Zone II. The mean grain size of the
   sortable silt shows that the hydrodynamic condition in the study area is
   significantly stronger than that of the abyssal plain, especially at the
   water depth of 1,000-2,500 m. The CaCO3 contents in sediments above
   4,000 m range from 20 to 84\% but decrease sharply to less than 1.5\%
   below 4,000 m, confirming that the water depth of 4,000 m is the
   carbonate compensation depth of the study area. Strong positive
   correlations between Al2O3 and Fe2O3, TiO2, MgO, and K2O (R > 0.9) in
   the bulk sediments indicate pronounced contributions of terrigenous
   materials from surrounding continent mass to the study area.
   Furthermore, the eolian dust makes contributions to the composition of
   bulk sediments as confirmed by rare earth elements. There is no
   significant correlation between grain size and major and minor elements,
   which indicates that the sedimentary grain size does not exert important
   effects on terrigenous components. There is significant negative delta
   Ce and positive delta Eu anomalies at all stations. The negative Ce
   anomaly mainly exists in carbonate-rich sediments, inheriting the signal
   of seawater. The positive Eu anomaly indicates widespread volcanism
   contributions to the study area from active volcanic islands arcs around
   the North Pacific. The relative contributions of terrestrial, volcanic,
   and biogenic materials vary with latitude and water depth in the study
   area.},

Title = {The relationship between increasing sea-surface temperature and the
   northward spread of Perkinsus marinus (Dermo) disease epizootics in
   oysters},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {From its initial discovery in the Gulf of Mexico in the late 1940s until
   1990, Perkinsus marinus, the parasite responsible for Dermo disease in
   the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica was rarely found north of
   Chesapeake Bay. In 1990-92, an apparent range extension of the parasite
   led to epizootic outbreaks of the disease over a 500 km range north of
   Chesapeake Bay. One of the hypotheses for the range extension argues
   that small, undetected numbers of parasites were already present in
   northern oysters as the result of repeated historical introductions, and
   that a sharp warming trend in 1990-92 stimulated the disease outbreak.
   This argument was based on trends in air temperature. The present study
   examined this hypothesis by analysing water temperatures, rather than
   air temperatures, for five stations located in areas affected by the
   recent epizootics. At all five stations, there was a strong increasing
   trend in winter sea-surface temperature (SST) between 1986 and 1991. At
   four of the five stations, there was a smaller increasing trend in
   winter temperatures after 1960. There were no consistent or obvious
   trends in summer (August) temperatures. In Delaware Bay, which has a 40
   year history of monitoring for oyster diseases, occasional findings of
   P. marinus in oysters were correlated with warming episodes that were
   especially notable in the winter (February) record. Empirical orthogonal
   function (EOF) analysis showed that winter temperatures varied
   consistently at the stations examined and were associated with
   variations in P. marinus prevalence. Associations using EOF analysis
   with August temperatures were much weaker. The SST record is consistent
   with the hypothesis that increasing winter water temperatures have been
   important in the recent outbreak of P. marinus epizootics in the
   north-eastern U.S.A. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.},

Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Pages = {195-203},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Renewable energy sources have been increasingly deployed as distributed
   generators in remote areas. Meanwhile, fluctuating power generation from
   renewable energy sources, together with variable power demand, poses
   challenges in stable and reliable power supply. In this paper, a
   microgrid with solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage (BES)
   is studied. A state of charge (SOC)-oriented charging scheme is
   developed to control the BES to smooth the PV output. Most importantly,
   a sophisticated control algorithm, consisting of a model predictive
   voltage control (MPVC) and a model predictive power control (MPPC), is
   proposed for the interlinking converter. It enables stable voltage in
   islanded mode. Also, in grid-connected mode, flexible reactive power can
   be injected into the main grid for grid support according to the voltage
   variation level. Finally, by considering the intermittent nature of the
   PV and the load profile, an energy management system (EMS) is designed
   to ensure power balance within the system. Case studies are provided to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Abstract = {The growing worldwide trend in urbanization leading to the development
   of mega cities is likely to have a strong impact on local weather and
   climate through a variety of effects like Urban Heat Island (UHI),
   increased surface heat f ux and atmospheric air temperature. These
   changes, in turn, can have a significant impact on energy demands for
   cooling or warming. It is, therefore, necessary to study these effects
   through models that comprehensively describe the local atmospheric
   dynamics in a large-scale environment. In this work we examine the
   impact of urbanization on the evolution and dynamics of three heavy
   rainfall events that occurred over Indian cities (Mumbai, Bangalore and
   Chennai) in different seasons using the mesoscale atmospheric model MM5,
   version-3. Numerical experiments were carried out for each of the events
   using a 3-nest configuration with a 2 km resolution for the innermost
   domain. Simulations were carried out for two scenarios; partially urban
   and fully urban. It was found that urbanization drastically increases
   maximum surface temperature (ground temperature) for both Mumbai and
   Chennai event, while for the Bangalore event, the change is mostly in
   the minimum temperature. In general it was found that urbanization
   increases the Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR). These differences in
   temperature, prominent in the pre-rainfall period, dissipate during the
   event window. Urbanization was also found to increase the temperature
   throughout the depth of the atmospheric column. Of primary concern is
   the change in the intensity and duration of extreme weather events. Our
   results show that increased urbanization affects both intensity and
   spatial distribution of rain. Partial urbanization was found to be
   associated with more total rain, larger spatial extend of distribution
   and less intensity, while the converse is true for the fully urban
   scenario. The impact of the spatial extant of urbanization (large city
   vs. megacity) was also examined through an additional set of numerical
   experiments; the size of the city was found to have a marked influence
   on both the intensity and distribution of rainfall.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Understanding how and why coral reefs have changed over the last twenty
   to thirty years is crucial for sustaining coral-reef resilience. We used
   a historical baseline from Kosrae, a typical small island in Micronesia,
   to examine changes in fish and coral assemblages since 1986. We found
   that natural gradients in the spatial distribution of fish and coral
   assemblages have become amplified, as island geography is now a stronger
   determinant of species abundance patterns, and habitat forming Acropora
   corals and large-bodied fishes that were once common on the leeward side
   of the island have become scarce. A proxy for fishing access best
   predicted the relative change in fish assemblage condition over time,
   and in turn, declining fish condition was the only factor correlated
   with declining coral condition, suggesting overfishing may have reduced
   ecosystem resilience. Additionally, a proxy for watershed pollution
   predicted modern coral assemblage condition, suggesting pollution is
   also reducing resilience in densely populated areas. Altogether, it
   appears that unsustainable fishing reduced ecosystem resilience, as fish
   composition has shifted to smaller species in lower trophic levels,
   driven by losses of large predators and herbivores. While prior
   literature and anecdotal reports indicate that major disturbance events
   have been rare in Kosrae, small localized disturbances coupled with
   reduced resilience may have slowly degraded reef condition through time.
   Improving coral-reef resilience in the face of climate change will
   therefore require improved understanding and management of growing
   artisanal fishing pressure and watershed pollution.},

Abstract = {Algeria aspires to protect its water resources and to provide a
   sustainable answer to water supply and management issues by carrying out
   a national water plan. This program is in line with all projects the
   Algerian Government is implementing to improve its water sector
   performance. The water strategy focuses on desalination for the coastal
   cities, medium-sized dams to irrigate the inland mountains and high
   plateau, and ambitious water transfer projects interconnecting Algeria's
   65 dams to bring water to water scarce parts of the country. Waste water
   treatment and water reclamation technologies are also highly sought
   after. The main objective of the country's water policy consists on
   providing sufficient potable water for the population supply. This
   objective is undertaken by increasing the water resources and
   availability.},

Title = {A study of thermal comfort enhancement using three energy-efficient

Abstract = {There is great potential to apply personalized heating for saving energy
   and enhancing individual thermal comfort in buildings during cold
   weather. This study investigated the enhancement of thermal comfort of
   occupants using personalized heating systems at low indoor temperatures.
   Three personalized heating systems are chosen for this work, i.e., a
   radiant heating panel with a heated table pad (denoted as HB1), a heated
   chair with a heated floor mattress (denoted as HB2), and electrical
   heating clothing (a heated jacket and trousers, denoted as EHC). The
   effectiveness of three selected heating systems on overall/local body
   thermal comfort of female occupants under two indoor temperatures of 15
   and 18 degrees C has been investigated. Total energy consumption of
   these heating systems has also been examined and compared. Thermal
   acceptability of EHC was better than HB1 and HB2 at both two
   temperatures. Overall thermal sensation vote (TSV) in EHC was
   significantly better than that in HB1. Mean skin temperature remained
   within the thermal comfort range (32-34 degrees C). In order to achieve
   thermal comfort on 70\% and 80\% of the inhabitants at various body
   parts, local body TSVs should be within - 0.43 to 1.87 and - 0.36 to
   1.87, respectively. Further, EHC consumed < 15 W power, which accounts
   for only 4.4\% and 14.8\% of the total power consumed by HB1 and HB2,
   respectively. Based on the evidenced thermal comfort improvement
   potential and low power consumption in EHC, it is thus recommended to
   use EHC for the thermal comfort enhancement of inhabitants under low
   indoor temperatures.},

Title = {Full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in forest
   monitoring for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest
   degradation (REDD plus ): trial in Panama's Darien},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},

Abstract = {A primary technical requirement of the climate change mitigation
   mechanism, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation
   (REDD+), is to calculate emissions factors, that is, the amount of CO2
   emissions or removals per hectare from land use and land-use change.
   Emissions factors are calculated from baseline estimates of the
   aboveground biomass (AGB) stored in different vegetation types.
   Ground-based methods for estimating AGB, such as forest inventories,
   despite being relatively accurate and necessary for calibrating remotely
   sensed data such as satellite or airborne Light Detection and Ranging,
   tend to be expensive and time-consuming. Thus, calls have been made to
   improve the cost-efficiency of these methods within the context of
   REDD+. Also as part of REDD+, there have been calls for the legitimate
   inclusion of indigenous peoples and rural communities in various aspects
   of the mechanism. To address both of these issues, we devised a
   participatory, rapid, forest inventorying method and tested it across
   the heterogeneous forest landscape of Darien, Panama. This effort took
   place within a project that was administratively and logistically
   managed entirely by an indigenous organization working in collaboration
   with indigenous authorities in Darien, with funding from the World Bank.
   A group of 24 indigenous technicians were trained on forest inventorying
   methods. They established and measured thirty 1-ha plots under our
   direct supervision. We tested for various sources of error in tree
   diameter and height measurements. We also tested the scalability of our
   tree-level biomass estimates to the plot level by comparing our results
   with simulations conducted on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha permanent
   plot data. Results indicate that our rapid, participatory, forest
   inventorying method effectively captures plot-level AGB, while
   guaranteeing the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples.
   The benefits of our method in terms of cost-efficiency and access to
   remote forest areas are discussed, as well as those accrued by
   indigenous peoples.},

Abstract = {Heterogeneous catalysis at mineral surfaces, or geocatalysis, may be
   important in natural systems. This contribution reviews how catalyst may
   influence reactions and several examples, mostly taken from the
   geochemical literature, are presented to illustrate the most important
   concepts. Two key characteristics that define a catalyst are activity
   and selectivity. Activity is the extent to which the catalyst can
   facilitate the rate of conversion of reactant to product. The
   selectivity of the catalyst refers to the ability of a catalyst to
   facilitate a specific reaction pathway where a reaction may proceed via
   multiple pathways. Photocatalysis is presented as a separate class of
   catalysis because reactions are only catalyzed when the system is
   illuminated with light of suitable wavelength. Three mechanisms of
   photocatalysis (photolysis, photoelectrochemical reaction, and charge
   injection) are discussed.
   Geocatalysis is particularly important for reactions with high
   activation energies, such as isotopic exchange reactions involving
   SO4-H2S, H2O-SO4, H2O-PO4, CO2-CH4 and transformations of humic acids
   and kerogen. While photocatalysis is limited to surficial aquatic
   environments, it may be of great importance in regulating the
   concentrations of redox-sensitive elements in the photic zones of lakes,
   streams, hot spring, and oceans. Photoelectrochemical reactions, such as
   the reduction of dinitrogen and carbon dioxide are thought to have been
   important in the origin of life on Earth. Geocatalysis may also prove to
   be useful in designing new environmental remediation technologies. For
   example, it is shown that sphalerite and ilmenite are capable of
   degrading chlorinated carbon compounds via a photocatalytic mechanism.

Abstract = {As shown by Maniar \& Newman in 1997, for a long array of bottom-mounted
   cylinders in the open sea, resonant modes occur as ``near-trapping{''}
   and large diffraction forces are excited on the cylinders. The mechanism
   of such a resonant phenomenon was subsequently explained by the present
   authors in connection with the Dirichlet trapped modes for an array of
   cylinders aligned perpendicular to the walls in a wave channel. This
   paper examines similar resonant phenomena for radiation problems.
   Considered is an array of elastically connected cylinders in a wave
   channel. The cylinders are surface-piercing and extend to the
   sea-bottom. They constitute an array in a line, and each cylinder is
   allowed to oscillate only in the direction parallel to the line.
   Nonradiating wave modes, which cause only added mass force and no
   hydrodynamic damping are demonstrated to exist for an array of cylinders
   across the wave channel. Each mode corresponds to a ``dry-mode{''} for
   the periodic array of elastically connected cylinders. This result leads
   to the existence of pure-resonant modes fora periodic array of
   elastically connected cylinders across the channel. Trapped modes for
   the corresponding diffraction problem are obtained as the limiting case
   when the stiffness of the springs has an infinite value. (C) 2000

Abstract = {It has been increasingly recognized that only distal lower order roots
   turn over actively within the < 2 mm fine root system of trees. This
   study aimed to estimate fine root production and turnover rate based on
   lower order fine roots and their relations to soil variables in
   mangroves.
   We conducted sequential coring in five natural mangrove forests at
   Dongzhai Bay, China. Annual fine root production and turnover rate were
   calculated based on the seasonal variations of the biomass and necromass
   of lower order roots or the whole fine root system.
   Annual fine root production and turnover rate ranged between 571 and
   2838 g m(-2) and 1.46-5.96 yr(-1), respectively, estimated with lower
   order roots, and they were increased by 0-30 \% and reduced by 13-48 \%,
   respectively, estimated with the whole fine root system. Annual fine
   root production was 1-3.5 times higher than aboveground litter
   production and was positively related to soil carbon, nitrogen and
   phosphorus concentrations. Fine root turnover rate was negatively
   related to soil salinity.
   Mangrove fine root turnover plays a more important role than aboveground
   litter production in soil C accumulation. Sites with higher soil
   nutrients and lower salinity favor fine root production and turnover,
   and thus favor soil C accumulation.},

Title = {Internal Wave Imprints on Temperature Fluctuations as Revealed by
   Rapid-Sampling Deep Profiling Floats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Internal waves play important roles in modulating the temperature
   variations and heat transfers in stratified oceans. However, due to the
   deep ocean measuring approach limitations, it is still challengeable to
   characterize the temperature fluctuations induced by internal waves in
   the deep oceans below 2,000 m. In this study, a fleet of rapid-sampling
   deep profiling floats with an approximately daily sampling rate was
   deployed in the northeastern South China Sea (SCS), Philippine Basin
   (PB), Mariana Arc (MA), and Kuroshio Extension (KE). Results show that
   the internal waves, internal tides or near-inertial waves, have
   considerable imprints on local temperature fluctuations. Geographically,
   the internal wave induced temperature fluctuations are generally larger
   in the PB and MA, indicative of a strong deep signature of internal
   tides generated by local energetic tide-topography interactions or
   radiation from remote sources. The temperature fluctuations at 4,000 m
   can reach up to 7 m degrees C in most regions, which may cover up real
   signals of temperature change, posing challenges to assess the deep
   ocean warming rate through currently insufficient deep profiling floats.
   Besides, the amplitude of isopycnal displacement in the PB and MA is
   evidently larger than in KE at 4,000 m, which implies enhanced diapycnal
   diffusivity and mixing in the deep layers of open oceans with rough
   topography.},

   solar distiller: A review},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {527},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Owing to the rapid growth of the world's population and water
   contamination due to industrialization, water scarcity is becoming
   increasingly worse. Solar desalination is a promising technique to
   obtain freshwater without carbon generation. A vertical multiple-effect
   diffusion solar distiller (VMED), among solar desalination systems, has
   a simple structure and small size, and its production is higher than a
   conventional solar still. VMED comprises a series of closely spaced
   parallel plates and can efficiently get the freshwater by repeatedly
   using the input solar energy. Researchers have gradually tried to
   improve the performance of various VMEDs. This paper reviews the
   detailed design and performance of eight types of VMEDs; classic VMED,
   VMED with a solar collector, VMED with an external heat source, VMED
   with a reflector, VMED with a basin, VMED with a curved plate, VMED with
   a tilted wick still, and a horizontal VMED. Additionally, the
   performance effect and optimum values are analyzed according to critical
   parameters, including environmental, design, and operating parameters.
   This review determined the design characteristics of VMEDs, optimal
   variables and their effects on production, and the best VMED design.
   This review will help the researchers develop novel VMEDs with high
   performance.},

Abstract = {In a global context of climate change affecting the marine environment,
   it is important to consider the effect of extreme events in driving
   ecological change and to gain a better understanding of conditions to be
   expected under future scenarios. In this study we focus on monthly
   oceanographic data collected off Barcelona city during the period
   2002-2012, in which extreme air temperatures and exceptional
   oceanographic events were reported in the western Mediterranean basin.
   These included two extreme heat waves and major episodes of dense water
   formation that produced unusually large deep-water contributions,
   induced oceanographic changes in the coastal zone and caused significant
   alterations to the marine ecosystem. To determine whether routine
   monitoring of oceanographic variables in a coastal zone can provide
   information for recognizing such large-scale events, temperature,
   salinity, turbidity and fluorescence were analysed to identify their
   signatures. The results provide an additional tool for monitoring
   oceanographic events and improving forecasts and future projections.},

Abstract = {The development of cheap and efficient electrodes for water splitting is
   an ongoing challenge. Herein, a nickel foam-based monolithic electrode
   is reported with high performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution
   reactions in neutral media. The karst landform-featured electrode
   consists of metallic Ni in the valley areas and Ni/alpha-Ni(OH)(2)
   heterostructures as towers on the surface. Remarkably, the electrode can
   switch between HER and OER reversibly and flexibly with long-term
   viability. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) analysis and
   computational studies proved the vital roles of the karst landform
   structure and the interface of the heterostructure in its efficient
   bifunctionality. Combined with a common photovoltaic cell, a water
   electrolysis cell with the bifunctional electrode can implement
   splitting of natural seawater (pH similar to 8.0) with a high
   solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 16.5\%. This cheap,
   flexible, robust, easily obtained and bifunctional electrode has
   potential applications for water splitting in the hydrogen economy.},

Abstract = {The VIIIth Mediterranean Games held in Split, Croatia in 1979 sparked an
   architectural and infrastructural renaissance, unique in the city's
   history, with little chance of ever being surpassed in its near future,
   leaving behind economic, cultural, and environmental legacies to the
   host city and its Dalmatian region. However, at its most fundamental
   level, the MG (Mediterranean Games) is a sporting event. One of the most
   important sports legacies was the general change in people's perception
   of sports and recreation as a part of a healthy everyday life. Other
   tangible legacies included planning, design and construction of sports
   and other public facilities. For the needs and requirements of sports
   events such as the MG, building sports infrastructure meant
   reconstruction and refurbishment of many existing and construction of a
   smaller number of new sports facilities, such as the City Stadium with a
   swimming pool complex, and a new sports hall at the Sports-Trade Center
   ``Koteks-Gripe{''} in Split. At the time, Split was still expanding to
   the east and most of the MG sports facilities were located in its
   western part, around its historic city area. The MG local urban
   development plan ``Integralni Plan MIS-79{''} planned continuity of
   sports and recreational zones along the coast and outside the city's
   ring road, as well as protective green zones between the city in the
   south and its industry in the north. Despite clearly demonstrating
   lasting social and health benefits through sports planning and design,
   the legacy of MG hasn't been addressed in research work so far. The aim
   of this work is to historically analyze the tangible sports and health
   legacy of the Mediterranean Games held in Split in 1979 to indicate its
   significance for building a healthier, more sustainable, and resilient
   city and urban community.},

Abstract = {Climate change is expected to significantly alter low-lying coastal and
   intertidal areas, which provide significant seasonal habitats for a
   variety of shoreline-dependent organisms. Many coastal military
   installations in Florida have significant coastal habitats and
   shoreline-dependent bird data strongly illustrate their seasonal
   importance for birds. Potential land use changes and population
   increases, coupled with uncertain predictions for sea level rise, storm
   frequency, and intensity have created a significant planning challenge
   for natural resource managers. This paper provides a framework to
   integrate multiscale climate, land cover, land use, and ecosystem
   information into a systematic tool to explore climate variability and
   change effects on habitat and population dynamics for the
   state-threatened residential Snowy Plover, and the migratory Piping
   Plover and Red Knot, on selected coastal Florida military sites in

Title = {The Temporal Dynamics of Coastal Phytoplankton and Bacterioplankton in
   the Eastern Mediterranean Sea},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {10},

Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {This study considers variability in phytoplankton and heterotrophic
   bacterial abundances and production rates, in one of the most
   oligotrophic marine regions in the world-the Levantine Basin. The
   temporal dynamics of these planktonic groups were studied in the coastal
   waters of the southeastern Mediterranean Sea approximately every two
   weeks for a total of two years. Heterotrophic bacteria were abundant
   mostly during late summer and midwinter, and were positively correlated
   with bacterial production and with N-2 fixation. Based on size
   fractionating, picophytoplankton was abundant during the summer, whereas
   nano-microphytoplankton predominated during the winter and early spring,
   which were also evident in the size-fractionated primary production
   rates. Autotrophic abundance and production correlated negatively with
   temperature, but did not correlate with inorganic nutrients.
   Furthermore, a comparison of our results with results from the open
   Levantine Basin demonstrates that autotrophic and heterotrophic
   production, as well as N-2 fixation rates, are considerably higher in
   the coastal habitat than in the open sea, while nutrient levels or cell
   abundance are not different. These findings have important ecological
   implications for food web dynamics and for biological carbon
   sequestration in this understudied region.},

Abstract = {The results of semi-quantitative and qualitative studies of nannofossil
   assemblages in dark to light grey, rhythmically bedded, calcareous
   mudstones of the Upper Cieszyn Beds, Silesian Nappe of the Outer
   Carpathians are presented. The vertical variation in the carbonate
   content of these mudstones and changes in the composition of nannofossil
   assemblages, as well as the Shannon diversity index (SI), result from
   humid-arid climate changes, driving the trophic conditions of surface
   waters and nannoplankton biocalcification. These changes were controlled
   by the variable influences of both the Tethyan and Boreal provinces. The
   light grey mudstones were deposited during the dominance of warm waters
   from the Tethyan realm and some nannoconids, typical of the warm,
   stratified water of lower palaeolatitudes, occur here. The dark grey
   mudstones represent influences of the Boreal province, indicated by the
   appearance of Crucibiscutum sp. and a generally higher biodiversity
   demonstrated by SI. Climatic changes affected the stratification of
   surface water, expressed also by different linear fits for pairs of SI,
   Watznaueria barnesiae and Rhagodiscus asper. On the basis of the
   presence of Eiffellithus striatus, E. windii and signals of both Tethyan
   and Boreal influences. the section studied represents the uppermost
   Valanginian-lowermost Hauterivian boundary interval, i.e., the upper
   part of the BC5/BC6 nannofossil zones, related to the
   furcillata-radiatus ammonite zones.},

Title = {Factors affecting vegetation and soil recovery in the Mediterranean
   woodland of the Canary Islands (Spain)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {58-66},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We investigated whether human-induced soil degradation may hinder the
   regeneration of a semiarid Mediterranean-type ecosystem with high
   biodiversity and conservation interest on the Canary Islands. To further
   this aim, the replacement of plant species and life-forms and the
   variation in soil quality were studied during the process of succession
   in old fields abandoned at different times and in relicts of the
   original thermophilous woodland by means of multivariate techniques of
   ordination (RDA, DCA, CCA) and clustering (k-means + IndVal). The
   studied ecosystem showed a limited capacity for recovery, which appears
   to be lower than in other similar semiarid Mediterranean ecosystems.
   Soil parent material exerted a considerable influence on plant
   reestablishment, and this process was more efficient with pumice-type
   rocks. Human activities have given rise to a loss of soil organic matter
   and an enrichment of certain nutrients, which revert to their normal
   levels once disturbance ceases. However, the erosion resulting from
   ploughing, farming and subsequent land abandonment has resulted in
   irreversible degradation of the soil water regime, thus severely
   limiting the restoration of the original ecosystem. We concluded that
   aridification due to soil degradation may, in certain cases, prevent the
   complete regeneration of thermophilous woodlands of the Canary Islands,
   and it must be taken into account when performing restoration
   activities. Pumice mulch can be useful for restoration, as it provides a
   suitable substrate in key stages of the plant recolonisation process.

Title = {Identification of `energetic' swell waves in a tidal strait},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {203-215},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Energetic swell waves present a significant coastal hazard. Overtopping
   is particularly sensitive to these longer period waves, potentially
   resulting in coastal flooding. In narrow tidal seas which are linked to
   large oceans, such as the English Channel, the importance of swell for
   design considerations is not immediately obvious. However, historical
   experience shows occasional severe impacts from long period waves, such
   as on 6th February 1904, 13th February 1979 and most recently two events
   in February 2014. When wave buoy measurements are analyzed using
   spectral partitioning methods, it is possible to identify swell wave
   systems with significant energy within the overall spectrum. This often
   coincides with the occurrence of storm waves, which might mask the
   presence of the swell component without such analysis. Two case studies
   where flooding occurred during storm events are examined in this paper.
   It has been possible to associate individual spectral components with
   the occurrence of overtopping of coastal defences at a particular
   location. Further investigation of the characteristics and frequency of
   energetic swell waves are recommended to enhance prediction and the
   design of coastal defences, and hence reduce their consequences. Crown

Title = {Observations and predictions of Arctic climatic change: Potential
   effects on marine mammals},
Journal = {ARCTIC},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {308-322},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent analyses have revealed trends over the past 20-30 years of
   decreasing sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean coincident with warming
   trends. Such trends may be indicative of the polar amplification of
   warning predicted for the next several decades in response to increasing
   atmospheric CO,, We have summarized these predictions and nonuniform
   patterns of arctic climate change in order to address their potential
   effects on marine mammals. Since recent trends in sea ice extent are
   nonuniform, the direct and indirect effects on marine mammals are
   expected to vary geographically. Changes in the extent and concentration
   of sea ice may alter the seasonal distributions, geographic ranges,
   patterns of mi,migration, nutritional status, reproductive success, and
   ultimately the abundance and stock structure of some species.
   Ice-associated seals, which rely on suitable ice substrate for resting,
   pupping, and molting, may be especially vulnerable to such changes. As
   recent decreases in ice coverage have been more extensive in the
   Siberian Arctic (60 degrees E-180 degrees E) than in the Beaufort Sea
   and western sectors, we speculate that marine mammal populations in the
   Siberian Arctic may be among the first to experience climate-induced
   geographic shifts or altered reproductive capacity due to persistent
   changes in ice extent. Alteration in the extent and productivity of
   ice-edge systems may affect the density and distribution of important
   ice-associated prey elf marine mammals, such as arctic cod Boreogadus
   saida and sympagic,aic ({''}with ice{''}) amphipods. Present climate
   models, however, are insufficient to predict regional ice dynamics,
   winds, mesoscale features, and mechanisms of nutrient resupply, which
   must be known to predict productivity and trophic response. Therefore,
   it is critical that mesoscale process-oriented studies identify the
   biophysical coupling required to maintain suitable prey availability and
   ice-associated habitat fur marine mammals on regional arctic scales,
   Only an integrated ecosystems approach can address the complexity of
   factors determining productivity and cascading trophic dynamics in a
   warmer Arctic. This approach, integrated with monitoring of key
   indicator species (e.g., bowhead whale, ringed seal, and beluga). should
   be a high priority.},

Title = {Irish Serpukhovian revisited},
Journal = {GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1403-1423},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this study of Mississippian rocks in Ireland, it is now recognized,
   based on faunal evidence, that several upper Visean limestone formations
   which were previously excluded from the Serpukhovian now belong, in
   part, to the lower two substages of the Serpukhovian. A reassessment of
   previous foraminiferal determinations, together with new foraminiferal
   data, has confirmed that rocks equivalent to the Tarusian and Steshevian
   substages are present in several sections. In the Slievenaglasha
   Formation and Magowna Formation (County Clare) and Deer Park Formation
   (County Meath), Tarusian and Steshevian foraminiferal assemblages are
   thus recorded. In the Clogrenan Formation (County Carlow), Carganamuck
   Limestone Formation (County Armagh) and Rockdale Limestone Formation
   (County Tyrone), Tarusian foraminiferal assemblages are recorded in the
   upper beds of thick limestone successions. Key foraminiferal and algal
   taxa characterize each assemblage, which have been correlated with
   equivalent Serpukhovian strata in the north of England and Scotland. A
   three-stage evolution is recognized in archaediscid foraminifers:
   fromNeoarchaediscus gregorii, followed byNeoarchaediscus postrugosusform
   1, andN. postrugosusform 2, withNeoarchaediscus postrugosusform 1 used
   to define the base of the Serpukhovian. The recognition of Tarusian and
   Steshevian foraminiferal assemblages implies that areas of shallow-water
   platform carbonate sedimentation in Ireland during the upper Visean
   (Brigantian) persisted into the Early Serpukhovian.},

Abstract = {Over the last 20 years, development in China has followed a positive
   trend. However, the high energy consumption has impacted the environment
   negatively. About 239 cities fell short of the national air quality
   standard in 2017 and the groundwater fell from quality 31.9\% to 10.9\%
   in 2018. In this study, the use of solar PV and onshore wind turbines
   for electricity generation in a particular area in China is analyzed.
   The integration of hydrogen production and Electric Vehicles (EVs) into
   the energy mix is dynamically modeled. Three storage mechanisms namely;
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G), V2G + batteries, and V2G + pumped hydro storage
   was considered. EnergyPLAN computer program is used to perform a dynamic
   simulation in this research to analyze the potential carbon emission
   reduction of the proposed methodology. The optimal PV and on-shore wind
   turbine capacity required for a 1 TWh/yr electricity demand and 0.02
   TW/yr EVs charge demand is 400 MW and 350 MW respectively. The storage
   capacities are 30 GWh of V2G, 55 GWh of V2G + Batteries, and 60 GWh of
   V2G + pumped hydro storage with various charge/discharge hourly
   profiles. The proposed methodology in this research will reduce the
   yearly coal consumption by 495.3 kton and yearly carbon emission by
   368.2 kton.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to ocean warming
   and acidification, and it is important to determine the role of reef
   building species in this environment in order to obtain insight into
   their susceptibility to expected impacts of global changes. Aspects of
   the life history of a coral population, such as reproduction, growth and
   size-frequency can contribute to the production of models that are used
   to estimate impacts and potential recovery of the population, acting as
   a powerful tool for the conservation and management of those ecosystems.
   Here, we present the first evidence of Siderastrea stellata planulation,
   its early growth, population size-frequency distribution and growth rate
   of adult colonies in Rocas Atoll. Our results, together with the
   environmental protection policies and the absence of anthropogenic
   pressures, suggest that S. stellata population may have a good potential
   in the maintenance and recovery in the atoll. However, our results also
   indicate an impact on corals' recruitment, probably as a consequence of
   the positive temperature anomaly that occurred in 2010. Thus, despite
   the pristine status of Rocas Atoll, the preservation of its coral
   community seems to be threatened by current global changes, such as more
   frequent thermal stress events.},

   Planar Light Concentrator},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Energy consumption of buildings is increasing at a rapid pace due to
   urbanization, while net-zero energy buildings offer a green and
   sustainable solution. However, limited rooftop availability on
   multi-story buildings poses a challenge for large-scale integration of
   photovoltaics. Conventional silicon solar panels block visible light
   making them unfeasible to cover all the surfaces of a building. Here, we
   demonstrate a novel dielectric grating based planar light concentrator.
   We integrate this functional device onto a window glass transmitting
   visible light while simultaneously guiding near infrared (NIR) portion
   of sunlight to edges of the glass window where it is converted to
   electricity by a photovoltaic cell. Gratings are designed to guide NIR
   region and realize polarization independent performance. Experimentally,
   we observe 0.72\% optical guiding efficiency in the NIR region (700-1000
   nm), transmitting majority of the visible portion for natural room
   lighting. Integrating solar cell at the window edge, we find an
   electrical conversion efficiency of about 0.65\% of NIR light with a 25
   mm(2) prototype. Major losses are coupling and guiding losses arising
   from non-uniformity in fabrication over a large area. Such a functional
   window combining energy generation, natural room lighting and heat load
   reduction could mitigate urban heat island effect in modern cities.},

Title = {Hydrodynamic performance analysis of flapping hydrofoil for single-body
   architecture wave glider},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {261},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Wave energy is directly converted into the propulsion of wave gliders by
   using the flapping hydrofoils. The propulsive performance of the wave
   glider has relationships with some parameters, especially spring
   constant of the submerged flapping hydrofoil mechanism and wave
   frequency. A numerical model of the submerged passive flapping hydrofoil
   based on the float response of the single-body architecture wave glider
   was established to analyze its propulsion in this paper. The float
   response was analyzed by using Advanced Quantitative Wave Analysis
   (AQWA) software under different wave frequencies in time domain and
   frequency domain. The nu-merical model of the hydrofoil was established,
   and the forward speed under different wave frequencies and spring
   constants were analyzed by using ANSYS-FLUENT software. By means of the
   polynomial curve fit, the corresponding equation describing the response
   of average forward speed was established. Tank experiment and sea trial
   were carried out to verify the accuracy of the model and the propulsive
   performance of the single-body architecture wave glider. The results
   showed that the speed fluctuation of the flapping hydrofoil was smaller
   as wave frequency increased under four wave frequencies. At the same
   time, wave frequency had a close rela-tionship with spring constant, and
   there was an optimal spring constant under different wave frequencies to
   maximize the navigation speed of the whole system.},

Abstract = {Dense regional array recordings of 377 teleseismic events are used to
   map geographic variability in upper crustal P to S scattering in
   southern California. Scattered-wave energy is sensitive to
   short-wavelength heterogeneity and maps of scattering potential offer a
   powerful complement to travel time tomography in characterizing seismic
   crustal heterogeneity. The scale length of resolved scattering
   variability is commensurate with the scale lengths of surface
   fault-trace length and microseismicity variations, and both mapped
   faults and seismicity are concentrated in regions of strong scattering.
   Fault-proximal scattering averaged across-strike of predominately
   strike-slip fault zones is highly correlated with microseismicity levels
   and is predictive of the pattern of microseismicity variation but not of
   absolute scale. North-south profiles through the Transverse Ranges
   reveal coincident strong gradients in microseismicity and scattering,
   whereas mapped segment bounds along the San Andreas fault zone from San
   Francisco to the Salton Sea coincide with strong along-strike gradients
   in the level of scattering. The overall correlation of microseismicity
   and scattering potential is consistent with structural control of
   aftershock and background microseismicity production, strain energy
   control of scattering, or both. Prior evidence for fault offset in the
   pattern of scattering intensity {[}Revenaugh and Reasoner, 1997] favors
   the former.},

Abstract = {The Earth's atmosphere is an extremely large and sparse environment
   which is quite challenging for the survival of microorganisms. We have
   long wondered about the limits to life in the atmosphere, starting with
   Leeuwenhoek's observation of ``animalcules{''} collected from the air.
   In the past century, significant progress has been made to capture and
   identify biological material from varying elevations, from a few meters
   above ground level, to the clouds near mountaintops, and the jet
   streams, the ozone layer, and even higher up in the stratosphere.
   Collection and detection techniques have been developed and advanced in
   order to assess the potential diversity of life from very high
   altitudes. Studies of microbial life in the stratosphere with its
   multiple stressors (cold, dry, irradiated, with low pressure and limited
   nutrients), have recently garnered considerable attention. Here, we
   review studies of Earth's atmosphere, with emphasis on the stratosphere,
   addressing implications for astrobiology, the dispersal of microbes
   around our planet, planetary protection, and climate change.},

Abstract = {Integration of renewable energy with desalination technologies has
   emerged as an attractive solution to augment fresh water supply
   sustainably. Fouling and scaling are still considered as limiting
   factors in membrane desalination processes. For brackish water
   treatment, pre-treatment of reverse osmosis (RO) feed water is a key
   step in designing RO plants avoiding membrane fouling. This study aims
   to compare at pilot scale the rejection efficiency of RO membranes with
   multiple pre-treatment options at different water recoveries (30, 35,
   40, 45 and 50\%) and TDS concentrations (3500,4000, and 4500 mg/L).
   Synthetic brackish water was prepared and performance evaluation were
   carried out using brackish water reverse osmosis (BVVRO) membranes
   (Filmtec LC-LE-4040 and Hydranautics CPA5-LD-4040) preceded by 5 and 1
   mu m cartridge filters, 0.02 pm ultra-filtration (UF) membrane, and
   forward osmosis (FO) membrane using 0.25 M NaCl and MgCl2 as draw
   solutions (DS). It was revealed that FO membrane with 0.25 M MgCl2 used
   as a draw solution (DS) and Ultra-filtration (UF) membrane followed by
   Filmtec membrane gave overall 98\% rejection but UF facing high fouling
   potential due to high applied pressure. Use of 5 and 1 mu m cartridge
   filter prior to Filmtec membrane also showed effective results with 95\%
   salt rejection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Open top chamber design and function are reviewed. All of the chambers
   described maintain CO2 concentrations measured at a central location
   within +/- 30 ppm of a desired target when averaged over the growing
   season, but the spatial and temporal range within any chamber may be
   closer to 100 ppm. Compared with unchambered companion plots, open top
   chambers modify the microenvironment in the following ways: temperatures
   are increased up to 3-degrees-C depending on the chamber design and
   location of the measurement; light intensity is typically diminished by
   as much as 20\%; wind velocity is lower and constant; and relative
   humidity is higher. The chamber environment may significantly alter
   plant growth when compared with unchambered controls, but the chamber
   effect on growth has not been clearly attributed to a single or even a
   few environmental factors.
   A method for modifying an open top chamber for tracking gas exchange
   between natural vegetation and the ambient air is described. This
   modification consists of the addition of a top with exit chimney to
   reduce dilution of chamber CO2 by external ambient air, is quickly made
   and permits estimation of the effects of elevated CO2 and water vapor
   exchange.
   The relatively simple design and construction of open top chambers make
   them the most likely method to be used in the near future for long-term
   elevated CO2 exposure of small trees, crops and grassland ecosystems.
   Improvements in the basic geometry to improve control of temperature,
   reduce the variation of CO2 concentrations, and increase the turbulence
   and wind speed in the canopy boundary layer are desirable objectives.
   Similarly, modifications for measuring water vapor and carbon dioxide
   gas exchange will extend the usefulness of open top chambers to include
   non-destructive monitoring of the responses of ecosystems to rising
   atmospheric CO2.},

Title = {A population genetic assessment of coral recovery on highly disturbed
   reefs of the Keppel Island archipelago in the southern Great Barrier
   Reef},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Coral reefs surrounding the islands lying close to the coast are unique
   to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in that they are frequently exposed to
   disturbance events including floods caused by cyclonic rainfall, strong
   winds and occasional periods of prolonged above-average temperatures
   during summer. In one such group of islands in the southern GBR, the
   Keppel Island archipelago, climate-driven disturbances frequently result
   in major coral mortality. Whilst these island reefs have clearly
   survived such dramatic disturbances in the past, the consequences of
   extreme mortality events may include the loss of genetic diversity, and
   hence adaptive potential, and a reduction in fitness due to inbreeding,
   especially if new recruitment from external sources is limited. Here we
   examined the level of isolation of the Keppel Island group as well as
   patterns of gene flow within the Keppel Islands using 10 microsatellite
   markers in nine populations of the coral, Acropora millepora. Bayesian
   cluster analysis and assignment tests indicated gene flow is restricted,
   but not absent, between the outer and inner Keppel Island groups, and
   that extensive gene flow exists within each of these island groups.
   Comparison of the Keppel Island data with results from a previous
   GBR-wide study that included a single Keppel Island population,
   confirmed that A. millepora in the Keppel Islands is genetically
   distinct from populations elsewhere on the GBR, with exception of the
   nearby inshore High Peak Reef just north of the Keppel Islands. We
   compared patterns of genetic diversity in the Keppel Island populations
   with those from other GBR populations and found themto be slightly, but
   significantly lower, consistent with the archipelago being
   geographically isolated, but there was no evidence for recent
   bottlenecks or deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium. A high
   incidence of private alleles in the Keppel Islands, particularly in the
   outer islands, supports their relative isolation and contributes to the
   conservation value of the archipelago. The lack of evidence for genetic
   erosion, in combination with our observation that the North Keppel
   Island population samples collected in 2002 and 2008, respectively,
   exhibited a pairwise genetic distance of zero, supports previous
   published work indicating that, following bleaching, Acropora corals in
   the Keppel Islands predominantly recover from regrowth of small amounts
   of remaining live tissue in apparently dead coral colonies. This is
   likely supplemented by recruitment of larvae from genetically similar,
   less disturbed populations at nearby reefs, particularly following
   extreme flood events.},

Title = {New considerations for modelling a MED-TVC plant under dynamic
   conditions},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {452},
Pages = {94-113},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The multiple-effect distillation (MED) technology is nowadays the most
   promising desalination process to be coupled with variable heat sources,
   thus leading to a more sustainable way to produce water. In order to
   prove the potential of this, it is of major interest to develop powerful
   modelling tools to predict the performance of this coupling. Only a few
   models have been presented so far. They show promising results but were
   based on some simplifying assumptions and non-physical constraints that
   could limit the analysis of the dynamic behaviour of a MED plant. This
   paper presents new considerations for the dynamic modelling of a MED
   plant associated with a thermal vapour compression unit, starting from a
   previous work ``A dynamic model for MED-TVC transient operation{''}.
   After several improvements, this model is now more representative of the
   real operating modes of a MED-TVC plant by considering real process
   inputs. This paper also highlights the importance of accurately
   modelling the interconnection between effects, the evaporation and
   condensation processes and the other components, such as the
   pre-heaters. Here is also presented a control strategy for operating a
   MED plant under dynamic conditions. Indeed, when a perturbation occurs
   in the motive steam pressure, it is possible to stabilize the whole
   plant by a simultaneous variation in the intake seawater mass flow rate
   at the final condenser. The model has been validated in steady-state
   conditions with experimental data from a MED-TVC plant operated in
   Trapani (Sicily) and was used to perform dynamic simulation to prove the
   feasibility of operating a MED-TVC plant under dynamic conditions, which
   is a major step toward proving the possibility of a coupling with
   renewable energies.},

   tower observations},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Abstract = {The atmospheric downward longwave radiation at the Earth's surface (L-d)
   is an important parameter for investigating greenhouse effects and
   global climate changes. Reanalysis data have been widely applied to
   obtain surface radiation components. Since new generation reanalysis
   data have been released, a comprehensive evaluation of the L-d
   predictions from the latest reanalysis data using ground measurements is
   still necessary. In this study, the L-d estimates of four representative
   reanalysis data (CFSR, JRA-55, ERA5, and MERRA2) were evaluated using
   ground observations at 383 stations from the AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux, BSRN,
   Buoy, FLUXNET, and SURFEAD networks. The evaluation results manifested
   that the overall root mean square errors (mean bias errors) of daily
   mean L-d values over the global surface were 21.1 (- 1.8) W m(-2), 22.4
   (- 3.9) W m(-2), 19.3 (- 3.6) W m(-2), 25.2 (- 12.6) W m(-2), and 20.5
   (3.1) W m(-2) for CFSR, JRA-55, ERA5, MERAA2, and CERES-SYN,
   respectively. Compared with the CERES-SYN satellite retrievals, the ERA5
   (CFSR) daily mean L-d estimates had relatively smaller overall root mean
   square errors (mean bias errors) over the global land surface. Over the
   global ocean surface, the JRA-55 daily mean L-d estimates had comparable
   mean bias errors (MBEs) with CERES-SYN. After removing the MBEs, the
   best annual mean L-d estimate was 344.0 (+/- 3) W m(-2) over the global
   surface of 2001 to 2020. The spatial distributions and long-term trends
   of L-d for the selected four reanalysis data and CERES-SYN were also
   investigated in this study. The comprehensive assessment of the L-d
   products from reanalysis data and satellite retrievals in this study
   would be helpful for climate change studies.},

Title = {Do transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) derived from Phaeocystis
   globosa bloom impact the physiological performances of European sea bass
   juveniles},

Abstract = {A mesocosm experiment (1 m(3) enclosures) was carried out over 28 days
   to evaluate the effect of Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) derived
   from decaying Phaeocystis globosa colonies on the physiological
   performance and mortality of European sea bass juveniles (35 mm in
   length and 113 days old). Accordingly, sea bass juveniles were exposed
   to high TEP concentrations derived from both a culture of decaying P.
   globosa colonies (7634.27 +/- 3514.41 mu g XG eq L-1) and freshly sea
   foam (932.54 +/- 341.21 mu g XG eq L-1). During the experiment,
   environmental parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and
   salinity) were stable, similar among treatments and not limiting for
   growth. Only TEP concentration varied between treatments. Fish mortality
   rate was relatively low (0 to 2\% d(-1)) and mostly occurred during the
   first week when TEP concentrations were relatively low. Despite high and
   varying TEP concentrations, juvenile sea bass physiological performances
   (growth in length and weight, Fulton condition index and RNA-DNA ratio)
   did not differ between replicates and treatments. In addition, juvenile
   sea bass increased both in size by 7.2 mm (growth rate of 0.26 mm d(-1))
   and weight by 708 mg (growth rate of 25.29 mg d(-1)) during the 28 days
   of the experiment. Altogether, these results showed clearly that TEP
   derived from decaying P. globosa bloom and foam accumulation have no
   negative effect on juvenile sea bass physiological performances and
   survival if water dissolved oxygen is maintained high. Despite being one
   of the most recurrent phytoplankton blooms recorded in the northwest
   European shelf seas and forms large blooms in the coastal waters during
   spring, we suggest that Phaeocystis bloom has no deleterious effect on
   marine coastal fish aquaculture activities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The SmartBay cabled subsea observatory is a shallow water marine
   infrastructure with two distinct operational roles, namely the provision
   of high quality, multidisciplinary, marine coastal data for scientific
   analysis combined with a role in facilitating marine technology testing
   and innovation projects. This paper highlights the unique aspects in the
   bespoke design of the infrastructure that facilitates both these roles
   by allowing multiple suites of instrumentation and equipment to operate
   simultaneously and how the supporting cyber Infrastructure system
   ensures real-time access to environmental data for scientists as well as
   secure real time access for commercial marine technology developers and
   researchers. The longevity of the infrastructure was a key component of
   the system design and these unique features are highlighted and
   discussed in terms of how they allow the infrastructure to carry out
   multiple projects while maintaining long term data collection
   capabilities from a suite of core instrumentation. SmartBay's dual
   purpose of scientific environmental monitoring and technology
   development has seen the deployment and completion of a range of
   projects involving a variety of international researchers both
   scientific and commercial. We illustrate how the SmartBay observatory
   engineering and software systems have been adapted and enhanced to
   facilitate the most efficient usage of the observatory and how
   operational efficiencies maximise the long-term commercial viability and
   sustainability of the infrastructure.},

Abstract = {Sand barrier complex dynamics play a key role in defining coastal lagoon
   structure and functioning. Artificial manipulation of these dynamics for
   biased reasons (e.g., controlling floods, improving fisheries)
   aggravates conflicts between stakeholders and introduces potential
   threats to their conservation. This is the case at Laguna de Rocha,
   Uruguay, a protected area with international recognition, where the sand
   barrier opening has been the focus of a long-term conflict. A
   cooperative effort of scientists, authorities, and local stakeholders
   produced a breaching protocol, aimed to reduce conflicts while
   preserving the natural hydrodynamics of the system and its associated
   ecological processes. Historical information and present perceptions
   about the sand barrier breach were collected, and geomorphological and
   hydrological studies were carried out. Reconstruction of the historical
   management of the breaching practice showed that the artificial opening
   started in the 1950s and that the original procedure, performed by
   fishermen and cattle ranchers, was gradually left under to managers to,
   and it is presently performed with heavy machinery. Since the 1980s,
   inappropriate opening practices may have produced negative effects on
   the physical and biological structure of the lagoon. Geomorphological
   studies revealed the sand barrier as a highly vulnerable component of
   the lagoon and suggested that new opening sites could eventually develop
   over the long term, given the predictions of climate change and sea
   level rise. The hydrological approach provided an understanding of the
   processes driving the opening mechanism and the extent of the flooding
   of private and public lands. These results outlined the basis for the
   protocol, to support managers in deciding when to perform the opening,
   based on a reduced set of indicators (water depth, sand barrier berm
   elevation, and rainfall forecasts). Reaching a consensus was mainly
   based upon the existence, for more than 15 years, of a participatory
   advisory group discussing local environmental problems. The new sand
   barrier breaching protocol is a significant improvement over the
   previous situation, and can be generalized for application in similar
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Carbonates of the Dengying Formation preserve not only carbon isotopic
   records,but also sulfur isotopic records of coeval seawater in the
   Yangtze Platform, China. The present study employs successfully a method
   of extracting trace sulfates from carbonate samples of the Dengying
   Formation collected from Yangtze Platform. The sulfur isotopic
   compositions of the trace sulfates were analyzed by using a rapid
   measuring method of S isotope ratios - an on line analytical method of
   EA-IRMS. In addition, the carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of
   carbonates of the formation were analyzed by using the traditional
   measuring method of C isotope of carbonates. The ancient seawater at the
   Dengying stage has high delta(34)S values and delta(13)C values. Most of
   the delta(34)S values of the trace sulfate samples vary between
   +20.0parts per thousand and +38.7parts per thousand, except the lower
   and upper boundaries of the Dengying Formation, and the delta(13)C
   values of the carbonate samples of the Dengying Formation vary between
   +0.5parts per thousand and +5.0parts per thousand. Large negative
   excursion in delta(34)S and delta(13)C values of ancient seawater appear
   at the boundary of Precambrian-Cambrian, which is a global character of
   the stage and significant to stratigraphic correlation and subdivision.
   The isotopic characteristics of sulfur and carbon imply a high organic
   productivity and a high burial rate of organic carbon in the Dengying
   stage. It is obvious that the palaeoceanic environment in Dengying stage
   is correspondingly stable and highly beneficial for biology to inhabit,
   propagate and procreate except the two boundaries around. The trend of
   sulfur and carbon isotopic variations maybe attributed to the gradual
   oxygenation of ocean environment during the Dengying stage.},

Abstract = {The evolution of industrial-era warming across the continents and oceans
   provides a context for future climate change and is important for
   determining climate sensitivity and the processes that control regional
   warming. Here we use post-AD 1500 palaeoclimate records to show that
   sustained industrial-era warming of the tropical oceans first developed
   during the mid-nineteenth century and was nearly synchronous with
   Northern Hemisphere continental warming. The early onset of sustained,
   significant warming in palaeoclimate records and model simulations
   suggests that greenhouse forcing of industrial-era warming commenced as
   early as the mid-nineteenth century and included an enhanced equatorial
   ocean response mechanism. The development of Southern Hemisphere warming
   is delayed in reconstructions, but this apparent delay is not reproduced
   in climate simulations. Our findings imply that instrumental records are
   too short to comprehensively assess anthropogenic climate change and
   that, in some regions, about 180 years of industrial-era warming has
   already caused surface temperatures to emerge above pre-industrial
   values, even when taking natural variability into account.},

Abstract = {The marine energy industry is in its early stages but has a large
   potential for growth. One of the most significant challenges is the
   reduction of operation and maintenance costs. Magnetic gears (MGs) offer
   the potential for long periods between maintenance intervals due to
   their frictionless torque transmission which could reduce these costs.
   This study presents a summary of the state of the art in MG technology
   and then investigates its potential for marine energy applications. A
   brief overview is given of the state of the marine energy industry and
   the environment in which marine energy converters (MECs) operate. A
   short history of MG development over the past century is then presented
   followed by a discussion of the leading MG technologies and their
   relative advantages. In order to demonstrate the potential of MGs in
   marine applications, the current technologies, i.e. mechanically geared
   and direct drive machines, are examined in terms of sizing, reliability
   and economic value using previous studies on a similar technology,
   namely wind. MGs are applied to four types of MECs to demonstrate how
   the technology can be incorporated. The potential to deploy at scale and
   potential obstacles to this are then discussed.},

Abstract = {In this article, a new dc-dc multisource converter configuration-based
   grid-interactive microgrid consisting of photovoltaic (PV), wind, and
   hybrid energy storage (HES) is proposed. Control structure along with
   power sharing scheme to operate the system under various operating
   modes, such as: 1) grid-connected mode; 2) islanded mode; 3) state of
   charge of battery (SoC(b)) less than or greater than specified limits;
   and 4) operating renewable sources (PV and wind) at maximum power point,
   is presented. The detailed analysis, modeling, and design of the
   proposed configuration and control structure are presented. The key
   highlights of the proposed configuration are: 1) low component count; 2)
   voltage boosting, voltage regulation of supercapacitor and power-sharing
   among the battery and supercapacitor are inherent; and 3) simple control
   structure with a reduced number of sensors. Supercapacitor-battery-based
   HES is interfaced which effectively handle the power fluctuations due to
   the wind, PV, and sudden load disturbances. Integration of
   supercapacitor to respond to high-frequency fluctuations increases the
   lifetime of battery storage and reduces the sizing of the storage unit.
   The proposed system is verified through digital simulation and
   experimental results.},

Title = {Fuel and metabolic scaling during the early life stages of Atlantic cod
   Gadus morhua},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {243},
Pages = {217-234},
Abstract = {The simultaneous effect of temperature (5, 7, 10 and 13degreesC) and
   light on the rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion of larval
   and early juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua was examined. Larvae
   increased their mean dry body mass by 2000 times within 48 d.
   Instantaneous growth rate exceeded 30 \% d(-1) towards the end of the
   study period, and proportionality of growth followed a triphasic
   pattern, during which body water content significantly declined but no
   inflection could be detected in the metabolic exponents. Data were
   rigorously tested via Model-I (least squares) and Model-II (geometric
   mean) regression techniques, and the aerobic metabolic rate was found to
   scale allometrically with both dry and wet body mass. The metabolic
   exponent was not affected by increasing temperature, but was
   significantly decreased by the presence of light (b = 0.88 to 0.89 for
   light-adapted larvae; b = 0.90 to 0.91 for dark-adapted larvae). The
   effect of light on small larvae (4 to 7 mm standard length, SL) caused a
   30 to 40\% increase in metabolic rate, while no effect was observed in
   larger juveniles (40 to 60 mm SL). Acute temperature acclimation of
   Atlantic cod of 4 to 60 mm SL (0.04 to 350 mg dry mass) demonstrated
   normal thermal sensitivity with Q(10) values of 2.4 for dark-adapted
   larvae and 2.6 for light-adapted larvae. Rates of ammonia excretion also
   scaled allometrically with wet and dry body mass and showed greater
   variability in dark-adapted compared to light-adapted larvae. Comparison
   of the molar rates of ammonia excretion and oxygen consumption revealed
   that Atlantic cod larvae have a high reliance on amino acids as fuel for
   energy dissipation. With lipids as the assumed co-substrate, amino acids
   were estimated to account for 70 to 95 \% of total substrate oxidation
   for larvae up to 7 mm. SL (first 3 to 4 wk of post-hatch development).
   Beyond 7 mm. SL, the reliance on amino acids as fuel began to decline,
   but even in juveniles of 40 to 60 mm SL, amino acids still represented
   the dominant source of fuel. For juveniles of between 10 and 20 mm SL,
   both the rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion remained
   unaffected by the presence of food in the gut, For short-term fasted
   juveniles (35 to 60 mm SL), however, a substantial decline in the rate
   of ammonia excretion was observed. This indicates that during short-term
   fasting (8 to 12 h) early juvenile Atlantic cod conserve amino acids,
   rather than funneling them into the tricarboxylic acid cycle.},

Title = {Turbulent Eddy Generation for the CFD Analysis of Hydrokinetic Turbines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper presents a novel theoretical and computational methodology
   for the generation of an onset turbulent field with prescribed
   properties in the numerical simulation of an arbitrary viscous flow. The
   methodology is based on the definition of a suitable distribution of
   volume force terms in the right-hand side of the Navier-Stokes
   equations. The distribution is represented by harmonic functions that
   are randomly variable in time and space. The intensity of the
   distribution is controlled by a simple PID strategy in order to obtain
   that the generated turbulent flow matches a prescribed turbulence
   intensity. A further condition is that a homogeneous isotropic flow is
   established downstream of the region where volume force terms are
   imposed. Although it is general, the proposed methodology is primarily
   intended for the computational modelling of hydrokinetic turbines in
   turbulent flows representative of tidal or riverine installations. A
   first numerical application is presented by considering the injection of
   homogeneous and isotropic turbulence with 16\% intensity into a uniform
   unbounded flow. The analysis of statistical properties as
   auto-correlation, power spectral density, probability density functions,
   demonstrates that the generated flow tends to achieve satisfactory
   levels of stationarity and isotropy, whereas the simple control strategy

Abstract = {Decreasing fossil fuel resources, coupled with the steady increase in
   energy consumption, have urged the research interest in renewable and
   alternative energy sources. Biodiesel is a well-known alternative fuel.
   Since India invests more on importing edible oils, the exploitation of
   edible oils for engine fuel is not affordable. Therefore, consideration
   has been redirected toward non-edible feedstock that does not rely on
   food supply. One of the challenging alternatives is the macroalgae. In
   the present investigation, nonedible toxic marine macroalgae species
   (Botryococcus braunii algal oil) with high calorific value and high FFA,
   which are abundantly available in India and are underutilized, have been
   selected as a feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Thus, marine
   macroalgae serve as a potential renewable raw material for biodiesel
   production.},

Abstract = {During community reassembly, consumers may express adaptive feeding
   behaviour in response to the presence of other species or according to
   their development. During the community reassembly after hypoxia of a
   temperate estuarine intertidal area, we quantified the microphytobenthos
   contribution to the diet of the three numerically dominant macrofauna
   consumers, using C-13-carbon tracing experiments. We then explored the
   relationships between their size and the microphytobenthos contribution
   to their diet. The polychaetes Hediste diversicolor and Pygospio elegans
   did not show a clear pattern of diet shift. Conversely, at a late stage
   of community reassembly, there was a dramatic decrease in the
   contribution of benthic microalgae to the diet of the clam Macoma
   balthica within the juvenile specimens (<= 5 mm), which were
   recolonising the sediment. The contribution of microphytobenthos
   decreased with the size (r = -0.81, n = 18) and the largest juveniles
   incorporated benthic microalgal carbon similarly to their co-specific
   adults found in the undisturbed areas. Including both juveniles and
   adults, the size-diet relationship of M. balthica followed an inverse
   logarithmic curve during community reassembly. Such shape differed from
   the linear relationship based on the natural abundance of stable carbon
   isotope as previously collected in the undisturbed surroundings. Our
   study provides evidence of diet shift during community reassembly and
   suggests that such diet shift might follow both consumer development in
   the recolonising areas and other processes related to successional
   stages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We examined interrelationships among natural vegetation zones, soil
   redox potential (Eh), and metrics of tree seedling performance (i.e
   survival, growth, and photosynthesis) for planted Fraxinus
   pennsylvanica, Acer saccharinum, Quercus palustris, and Quercus bicolor
   at two created perched wetlands (two years and five years old) in
   Michigan, USA. Vegetation zones apparently associated with hydrology
   were fully developed at both sites. Wetland zones always had lower mean
   Eh than upland zones, indicating mostly anaerobic and aerobic root
   environments, respectively. Eh values for transition zones were similar
   to aerobic upland zones at the five-year-old site, and changed from
   anaerobic to aerobic conditions over the growing season at the
   two-year-old site. At the five-year-old site, transition zone trees of
   all species generally had greater height growth, survival, and were less
   likely browsed by deer than upland trees. They also had much greater
   survival and endured shorter periods of anoxia stress than wetland
   trees. Photosynthesis was positively related to survival and Eh,
   suggesting that unfavorable carbon balance may help explain low survival
   in the anoxic wetland zone. Management implications include: (1)
   vegetation zonation is a good indicator of wetland hydrological factors
   important to planted tree performance; (2) targeting developed
   transition vegetation zones for tree planting could increase the success
   and efficiency of efforts to create forested wetlands; and (3)
   transition zones extended over only a 9.3 cm vertical elevation
   gradient, indicating the importance of precise grading when creating
   perched forested wetlands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Migration as a human affair: Integrating individual stress thresholds
   into quantitative models of climate migration},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {129-138},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sea level rise will expose millions of people to increasing coastal
   hazards and eventual land loss. Thus, it is important to understand how
   residents will make decisions about whether and when to move away with
   increasing exposure. Historically, non-material dimensions of human
   decision-making have been missing from quantitative modelling of
   migration under environmental change. Here, we use behavioural migration
   theory and the concept of an inherent mobility potential to define
   individual stress thresholds, represented in the tension between
   mobility potential and residential satisfaction. We further suggest that
   migration as an outcome is determined by psychological propensity to
   move, and that levels of capital act to modulate, rather than determine,
   migration responses, their timing and outcome. Using the southwest coast
   of Bangladesh as our case study, we quantify these characteristics using
   the results of a 1500 household social survey and define an exposure
   index based on projections of sea surface height drawn from a physical
   model. Aggregating data to the village level, we are able to identify
   place-specific mobility responses; for example, locations where high
   mobility characteristics are associated with high exposure and thus
   migration may occur earlier in response to increasing coastal hazard. By
   advancing theory on individual thresholds and demonstrating that complex
   human characteristics can be usefully quantified, we further the ability
   of such characteristics to be included in modelling approaches. The
   empirical results contribute to debates on immobility under climate
   change, and decision-making on the most appropriate adaptive responses
   to protect multi-dimensional well-being of climate-vulnerable people.},

Pages = {267-275},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The population ecology of polar bears at Svalbard, Norway, was examined
   from 1988 to 2002 using live-captured animals. The mean age of both
   females and males increased over the study, litter production rate and
   natality declined and body length of adults decreased. Dynamics of body
   mass were suggestive of cyclical changes over time and variation in body
   mass of both adult females and adult males was related to the Arctic
   Oscillation index. Similarly, litter production rate and natality
   correlated with the Arctic Oscillation index. The changes in
   age-structure, reproductive rates and body length suggest that recovery
   from over-harvest continued for almost 30 years after harvest ended in
   1973 and that density-dependent changes are perhaps being expressed in
   the population. However, the variation in reproduction and body mass in
   the population show a relationship between large-scale climatic
   variation and the upper trophic level in an Arctic marine ecosystem.
   Similar change in other polar bear populations has been attributed to
   climate change, and further research is needed to establish linkages
   between climate and the population ecology of polar bears.},

Title = {Forecasting unprecedented ecological fluctuations},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Forecasting `Black Swan' events in ecosystems is an important but
   challenging task. Many ecosystems display aperiodic fluctuations in
   species abundance spanning orders of magnitude in scale, which have vast
   environmental and economic impact. Empirical evidence and theoretical
   analyses suggest that these dynamics are in a regime where system
   nonlinearities limit accurate forecasting of unprecedented events due to
   poor extrapolation of historical data to unsampled states. Leveraging
   increasingly available long-term high-frequency ecological tracking
   data, we analyze multiple natural and experimental ecosystems (marine
   plankton, intertidal mollusks, and deciduous forest), and recover hidden
   linearity embedded in universal `scaling laws' of species dynamics. We
   then develop a method using these scaling laws to reduce data dependence
   in ecological forecasting and accurately predict extreme events beyond
   the span of historical observations in diverse ecosystems.
   Author summary
   Rare large-amplitude `Black Swan' fluctuation events have significant
   ecological and economic impact. In this work, we tackle the grand
   challenge in forecasting critical fluctuations in ecosystems, in
   particular in data sparse regimes. We take an unconventional approach by
   bridging the fields of statistical physics and ecological forecasting.
   We apply theory from avalanche systems (such as earthquakes) to analyze
   long-term monitoring data from diverse natural ecosystems, including
   marine plankton, intertidal mollusks, and deciduous forest. These
   datasets allow us to recover the clean power-law relations, or `scaling
   laws' in statistical physics terms, in system fluctuations that are
   ubiquitous across species and communities. Leveraging these scaling
   laws, we extrapolate rare, extreme dynamics from limited historical data
   and accurately forecast unprecedented events. Therefore, our results
   have the potential to maximize data value in ecological forecasting with
   a broad set of applications.},

Abstract = {Much of our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying
   cnidarian-algal symbiosis comes from studying the biological differences
   between the partners when they are engaged in symbiosis and when they
   are isolated from one another. When comparing the in hospite and ex
   hospite states in Symbiodiniaceae, the in hospite state is represented
   by algae sampled from hosts, and the ex hospite state is commonly
   represented by cultured algae. The use of cultured algae in this
   comparison may introduce nutrition as a confounding variable because,
   while hosts are kept in nutrient-depleted conditions, culture media is
   nutrient rich and designed to facilitate algal growth. In this
   perspective, we reexamine how nutrition may be a confounding variable in
   studies that compare the biology of Symbiodiniaceae in hospite and in
   culture. We also suggest several innovations in experimental design to
   strengthen the comparison of the two lifestyles, including the adoption
   of nutritional controls, alternatives to culture for the representation
   of Symbiodiniaceae ex hospite, and the adoption of several proteomic
   approaches to find novel Symbiodiniaceae genes important for symbiosis.},

Abstract = {By probing into the high H2S-bearing gas reservoir in Sichuan basin,this
   text found the close relationship between high-quality reservoir and
   H2S: the higher H2S Content the strata bear, the better the reservoirs
   become and the high gas yield the strata produce. The entire big gas
   reservoir has some or high contents of H2S in the marine strata of
   Sichuan basin, which developed some high-quality reservoirs, so therer
   is certain connection between H2S and reservoirs. TSR ( thermochemical
   sulfate reduction) is the chemical process between hydrocarbon and
   sulfate in thermodynamic drive,which is the process that sulphate
   minerals deoxidized to generate H2S and CO2 by hydrocarbon in the high
   temperature. So, TSR is the main process of H2S generation. The research
   found that (SO42-). the reservoirs pore have preliminary improvement due
   to dissolution of gypsiferous rock 4 While H2S from the TSR dissolved in
   the water, the hydrosulphuric acid was generated largely, the strong
   resolving ability of hydrosulphuric acid accelerate the burial
   dissolution of dolostone, in the carbonate reservoirs and form the
   bedded characteristical, and mossystructure pore and vug system with
   extremely good porous and permeability. The disolution pores and inter
   sulphur grains were seen distinctly in the thin section. The carbon
   isotopes of authigenic carbonate are between -10.3 parts per thousand
   and -18.2 parts per thousand in the corroded pore, and those of the
   strata carbonate are from +3.7 parts per thousand to 0.9 parts per
   thousand. It proved the organic and inorganic interaction, the organic
   hydrocarbon carbon transferred to secondary carbonate. The analysis show
   the calcite inclusion contain high-grade H2S, and the homogenization
   temperature is usually above 160 degrees C which satisfy the TSR
   reaction temperature. The sulfur isotopes of H2S and sulphur are
   depleted about 8 parts per thousand that compare to that of strata
   carbonate, which is a proof of TSR. Based on the early burial
   dissolution, the high-quality reservoirs with high H2S-bearing gas pool
   were generated as the late TSR and its producing acidic liquid corrode
   the deep burial carbonate reservoirs again. Based on this conclution,we
   can predict the perspective area of the high-quality carbonate
   reservoirs by the H2S content in strata.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {73},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We measured stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of
   invertebrates, Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and brook trout, Salvelinus
   fontinalis, in three distinct freshwater environments ( headwater
   tributary, ultraoligotrophic lake, and main-stem river) in the Western
   Brook system, Newfoundland, Canada. Large differences in the stable
   carbon signatures of invertebrates allowed the identification of organic
   matter assimilation from each environment by resident parr and migrating
   smolts. Brook trout captured in the headwater tributary in June had a
   carbon signature characteristic of the tributary, while those collected
   in August had enriched C-13 ( maximum =) 15.6 parts per thousand) and
   N-15 ( maximum = 12.8 parts per thousand) values. These enriched carbon
   and nitrogen signatures were indicative of foraging at sea. There was a
   low correlation between delta(13)C and delta(15)N (r(2) = 0.198) for
   individual fish that was likely due to the confounding influence of
   trout feeding in the lake and the lower main-stem of the river, where
   delta(13)C of food sources was high but delta(15)N was low. Smolts
   emigrating from Western Brook Pond where they had been foraging ( based
   on lacustrine carbon signatures) were significantly larger than those
   emigrating from a nursery brook and the main river in the same basin,
   despite having the same median age. These results suggest better growth
   opportunities in the lake environment. Trout fork length was positively
   correlated with delta(13)C and delta(15)N, demonstrating that larger
   individuals had been feeding outside the brook. These results support
   previous studies that found increased growth potential for salmonids in
   lacustrine and marine environments, and further, indicate possible
   adaptive advantages for salmonid movement away from natal brooks.},

Title = {Experimental Study on the Potential Use of Bundled Crop Straws as

Journal = {WATER},

Abstract = {Initial land reclamation of the saline soils often requires higher
   drainage intensity for quick leaching of salts from the soil profile;
   however, drainage pipes placed at closer spacing may result in higher
   cost. Seeking an inexpensive degradable organic subsurface drainage
   material may satisfy such needs of initial drainage, low investment and
   a heathy soil environment. Crop straws are porous organic materials that
   have certain strength and endurance. In this research, we explored the
   potential of using bundled maize stalks and rice straws as subsurface
   drainage material in place of plastic pipes. Through an experimental
   study in large lysimeters that were filled with saline coastal soil and
   planted with maize, we examined the drainage performance of the two
   organic materials by comparing with the conventional plastic drainage
   pipes; soil moisture distribution, soil salinity changed with depth, and
   the crop information were monitored in the lysimeters during the maize
   growing period. The results showed that maize stalk drainage and the
   rice straw drainage were significantly (p < 0.05) more efficient in
   removing salt and water from the crop root zone than the plastic
   drainage pipes; they excelled in drainage rate, leaching fraction, and
   lowering water table; and their efficient drainage processes lowered
   salt stress in the crop root zone and resulted in a slightly higher
   level of biomass. The experimental results suggest that crop straws may
   be used as a good organic substitute for the plastic drainage pipes in
   the initial stage land reclamation of the saline coastal soils.},

Title = {Sedimentary labile organic carbon and pore water redox control on

Abstract = {Rose Bengal stained benthic foraminifera were studied from 11 cores
   collected along two depth transects off southern Portugal: one in the
   Lisbon-Setubal Canyon and the other along the canyon edge. The total
   standing stocks and distribution of foraminifera were investigated in
   relation to sediment and pore water geochemistry. Nitrate was used as a
   redox indicator, sedimentary chlorophyll a and CPE (chloroplastic
   pigment equivalents) contents as a measure of labile organic matter, and
   total organic carbon as a measure of bulk organic matter availability.
   The canyon sediments were enriched in organic carbon and phytopigments
   at all water depths in comparison with the canyon edge. Water depth
   seemed to control sedimentary phytopigment content, but not total
   organic carbon. No significant correlation was seen between pigment and
   total organic carbon content.
   The abundance of calcareous foraminifera correlated with the
   phytodetritus content, whereas a weaker correlation was observed for the
   agglutinated taxa. Therefore, calcareous foraminifera appear to require
   a fresher food input than agglutinated taxa. The foraminiferal species
   composition also varied with pigment content and nitrate penetration
   depth in the sediment, in line with the TROX concept. Phytopigment-rich
   (surficial CPE content >20 mu g/cm(3)) sediments with a shallow nitrate
   penetration depth (similar to 1 cm depth) were inhabited by generally
   infaunal species such as Chilostomello oolina, Melonis barleeanus and
   Globobulimina spp. As the nitrate penetration increased to similar to 2
   cm depth in sediment and the pigment content remained relatively high
   (>15 mu g/cm(3)). Uvigerina mediterranea and Uvigerina elongatastriata
   became dominant species. With declining CPE content and increasing
   nitrate penetration depth, the foraminiferal assemblages changed from
   the mesotrophic Cibicides kullenbergi-Uvigerina peregrina assemblage to
   the oligotrophic abyssal assemblage, mainly consisting of agglutinated
   taxa. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {TOC analysis is required for the quality of drinking water and sewage

   utilising different oxidation methods, such as: persulfate/100degreesC,
   persulfate/UV and high-temperature oxidation, respectively. Humic acid,
   polyacryloamide flocculants and perfluorooctanoic acid were used as
   model compounds. None of the examined apparatus led to their complete
   oxidation. The influence of pre-oxidation with ozone and chlorine
   dioxide on the efficiency of the subsequent TOC analysis was
   investigated and was found to cause better combustion of the organic
   carbon. The storage time of the samples treated with phosphoric acid did
   not influence the efficiency of TOC analysis.},

Title = {Evaluation of Algal Biofilms on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) for Use in

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {In photosynthesis, a very small amount of the solar energy absorbed is
   transformed into chemical energy, while the rest is wasted as heat and
   fluorescence. This excess energy can be harvested through
   biophotovoltaic platforms to generate electrical energy. In this study,
   algal biofilms formed on ITO anodes were investigated for use in the
   algal biophotovoltaic platforms. Sixteen algal strains, comprising local
   isolates and two diatoms obtained from the Culture Collection of Marine
   Phytoplankton (CCMP), USA, were screened and eight were selected based
   on the growth rate, biochemical composition and photosynthesis
   performance using suspension cultures. Differences in biofilm formation
   between the eight algal strains as well as their rapid light curve (RLC)
   generated using a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometer, were
   examined. The RLC provides detailed information on the saturation
   characteristics of electron transport and overall photosynthetic
   performance of the algae. Four algal strains, belonging to the
   Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria) Synechococcus elongatus (UMACC 105),
   Spirulina platensis. (UMACC 159) and the Chlorophyta Chlorella vulgaris
   (UMACC 051), and Chlorella sp. (UMACC 313) were finally selected for
   investigation using biophotovoltaic platforms. Based on power output per
   Chl-a content, the algae can be ranked as follows: Synechococcus
   elongatus (UMACC 105) (6.38x10(-5) Wm(-2)/mu gChl-a)>Chlorella vulgaris
   UMACC 051 (2.24x10(-5) Wm(-2)/mu gChl-a)>Chlorella sp.(UMACC 313)
   (1.43x10(-5) Wm(-2)/mu gChl-a)>Spirulina platensis (UMACC 159)
   (4.90x10(-6) Wm(-2)/mu gChl-a). Our study showed that local algal
   strains have potential for use in biophotovoltaic platforms due to their
   high photosynthetic performance, ability to produce biofilm and
   generation of electrical power.},

Abstract = {Seagrasses and aquatic plants are important clades of higher plants,
   significant for carbon sequestration and marine ecological restoration.
   They are valuable in the sense that they allow us to understand how
   plants have developed traits to adapt to high salinity and
   photosynthetically challenged environments. Here, we present a
   large-scale phylogenetically profiled transcriptomics repository
   covering seagrasses and aquatic plants. SeagrassDB encompasses a total
   of 1,052,262 unigenes with a minimum and maximum contig length of 8,831
   bp and 16,705 bp respectively. SeagrassDB provides access to 34,455
   transcription factors, 470,568 PFAM domains, 382,528 prosite models and
   482,121 InterPro domains across 9 species. SeagrassDB allows for the
   comparative gene mining using BLAST-based approaches and subsequent
   unigenes sequence retrieval with associated features such as expression
   (FPKM values), gene ontologies, functional assignments, family level
   classification, Interpro domains, KEGG orthology (KO), transcription
   factors and prosite information. SeagrassDB is available to the
   scientific community for exploring the functional genic landscape of
   seagrass and aquatic plants at: http://115.146.91.129/index.php.},

Title = {Modeling, simulation, and equilibrium analysis of tethered coaxial
   dual-rotor ocean current turbines},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Tethered multirotor axial flow turbines have been proposed to overcome
   the many challenges associated with extracting ocean current energy
   where deep waters render seabed mounting strategies infeasible. However,
   flexible systems are inherently more susceptible to perturbation than
   fixed systems. The effects of flow misalignment on the hydrokinetic
   energy conversion of multirotor coaxial turbines have been investigated
   recently; however, the spatial dynamics and equilibrium behaviors of
   tethered coaxial turbines have not been well characterized, limiting the
   ability of designers to explicitly tailor the device behavior. In this
   work, a computational model of a dual-rotor coaxial turbine is
   presented, and the model is employed to explore the equilibrium behavior
   of the turbine with variations in parameters. A complete
   characterization of the hydrostatic state of the system and a
   comparative study of representative tethered turbine simulation cases is
   also presented. Two important findings are presented. First, that a
   positively buoyant dual-rotor turbine that is anchored to a
   surface-dwelling platform can operate where the turbine is located at
   some desired depth below the surface. Second, that more than one turbine
   system may be anchored to a single point while maintaining the desired
   orientation and position of each turbine to avoid collision and maximize
   energy production. The results and methods presented in this paper may
   be used to inform application-specific coaxial turbine design and to
   develop additional targeted empirical and simulation studies.},

Title = {Seabird associations with mesoscale eddies: the subtropical Indian Ocean},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {324},
Pages = {271-279},
Abstract = {We investigated seabird-eddy associations in subtropical waters of the
   southern Indian Ocean during a summer (January) cruise from Amsterdam
   Island to Western Australia. To determine habitat associations and to
   enable predictions about foraging strategies, we related the
   distributions of satellite altimetry data (sea surface height anomalies)
   to the 3 most abundant taxa in the study area: terns (sooty Sterna
   fuscata and bridled S. anaethetus) and shearwaters (wedge-tailed
   Puffinus pacificus) were significantly more common and numerous within
   convergence zones. However, a step-wise logistic regression model
   revealed that these seabirds were more strongly associated with other
   habitat variables, including the distance to breeding colonies and warm
   sea surface temperature conditions. Great-winged petrels Pterodroma
   macroptera were widely scattered and did not show associations with
   convergences or divergences. These contrasting results highlight the
   need to consider smaller-scale hydrographic features, such as frontal
   systems, when quantifying seabird associations with mesoscale eddies.
   Large-scale patterns of ocean circulation and mesoscale variability also
   seem to play a critical role in determining the extent of seabird-eddy
   associations. In contrast with previous studies, which have focused on
   dynamic frontal regions and energetic current systems, we surveyed a
   region of weak mesoscale variability north of the Subtropical
   Convergence zone.},

Title = {The tragedy of soft choices: capacity accumulation and lopsided
   allocation in the Norwegian coastal cod fishery},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {221-230},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Following years of reduced cod stocks and the build up of capture
   capacity in the coastal fleet, the Norwegian government implemented
   ``access closure{''} and ``vessel quotas{''} at the end of the 1980s, in
   order to bring capture capacity under control. However, despite these
   rather powerful policy tools, the capacity of the Norwegian cod fishery
   continued to increase during the 1990s. This paper outlines the
   processes that led to this increase in capture capacity and to the
   accumulation of vessels in the large size segments of the coastal fleet,
   the exact opposite result of that intended by the introduction of the
   fisheries policy. We present two main factors to explain these trends:
   Firstly, the expansion in quota factors due to exchange or renewal of
   vessels. This provides vessel-owners with more ``vessel-meters{''} which
   are equivalent to an increased share of total quota under the maximal
   quota regulations. This situation implies a redistribution of resources
   from smaller to larger vessels. Secondly, improved efficiency of
   technology aboard the vessels makes the vessels more efficient as
   capture machines. The effect of these changes remains hidden as long as
   the total stock increases, which was the situation from the introduction
   of the new regime and until the late 1990s. When the stock once again
   declined, the effect of the capacity build-up was exposed. A decade of
   soft choices, adjustments, and adaptations has used up the available
   solutions, New regulations and a new policy are now required. (C) 2002

Abstract = {Champion and Seth undertook the pioneering work on classification of
   forests in India. Earlier Sir H. G. Champion had compiled his monumental
   work `Preliminary Survey of Forest Types of India and Burma' in 1936.
   The original work of 1936 was revised by Sir H. G. Champion with S.K.
   Seth which was published as `A Revised Survey of the Forest Types of
   India'. Their work helped the forest managers and researchers all over
   the Indian sub-continent to prepare management plans for the scientific
   management of forests. India's forest types are very diverse in their
   compositions with a long evolutionary and geological history, occurring
   under many climatic and edaphic conditions. They have been undergoing
   subtle but significant changes in the composition of forests since the
   forest types were revised by Champion and Seth. These changes have taken
   place on account of climatic changes and anthropogenic causes (biotic
   pressure as well as management interventions). The present study was
   conducted by revisiting various forest types. It was aimed at assessing
   the changes that have occurred over a period of time since they were
   revised by Champion and Seth. The field survey covered more than 200
   forest types and subtypes representing very diverse climatic and edaphic
   conditions across the country. The sample plots were generated randomly
   across different forest types. Data collected from the field surveys
   were analyzed for preparing the change matrix of forest types, basal
   area, importance value index, stem density and diversity indexes
   including similarity indexes. Impact of climate change on the vegetation
   was critically examined to see the species level responses to the
   changes in the rainfall and temperature regimes over the past years. The
   study has indicated many changes occurring at species and forest
   subtypes levels. The species level changes were observed largely in
   Shorea robusta (Sal), Tectona grandis (Teak) and Bamboo forests with
   regard to their distribution and species density. The study has
   indicated the absence of teak from very moist and moist teak sub-type
   and occurrence of many moist deciduous and semi-evergreen species. In
   central India, the low rainfall regime has shown the decline of Sal and
   occurrence of dry deciduous species. The study revealed that both
   positive and negative changes have been witnessed in various forest
   types. These findings could be used by the policy makers, scientists and
   foresters for evolving suitable strategies for futuristic management
   intervention so that the objectives of sustainable forest management are
   realised. The new classification of forest types has been proposed
   reflecting the present ecological, climatic, bio-geographic and edaphic
   influences on the vegetation composition and stand formation. In the
   proposed new classification, 10 major groups and 48 sub-groups were
   identified.},

Title = {Spatially dynamic maternal control of migratory fish recruitment pulses
   triggered by shifting seasonal cues},
Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {69},
Number = {6},
Pages = {942-961},
Abstract = {Environmental regimes set the timing and location of early life-history
   events of migratory species with synchronised reproduction. However,
   modified habitats in human-dominated landscapes may amplify uncertainty
   in predicting recruitment pulses, impeding efforts to restore habitats
   invaluable to endemic species. The present study assessed how
   environmental and spawner influences modulate recruitment variability
   and persistence of the Missouri River shovelnose sturgeon
   (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus) under modified seasonal spawning and
   nursery habitat conditions. Using a spatially explicit individual-based
   biophysical model, spawning cycle, early life-history processes
   (dispersal, energetics and survival) and prey production were simulated
   under incrementally perturbed flow (from -10 to -30\%) and temperature
   (+1 and +2 degrees C) regimes over 50 years. Simulated flow reduction
   and warming synergistically contracted spring spawning habitats (by up
   to 51\%) and periods (by 19\%). Under these conditions, fewer mature
   females entered a reproductive cycle, and more females skipped spawning,
   reducing spawning biomass by 20-50\%. Many spawners migrated further to
   avoid increasingly unfavourable habitats, intensifying local density
   dependence in larval stages and, in turn, increasing size-dependent
   predation mortality. Diminished egg production (by 20-97\%) and weakened
   recruitment pulses (by 46-95\%) ultimately reduced population size by
   21-74\%. These simulations illustrate that environmentally amplified
   maternal influences on early life histories can lower sturgeon
   population stability and resilience to ever-increasing perturbations.},

Abstract = {The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration offers immense potential to
   return hundreds of millions of hectares of degraded tropical landscapes
   to functioning ecosystems. Well-designed restoration can tackle multiple
   Sustainable Development Goals, driving synergistic benefits for
   biodiversity, ecosystem services, agricultural and timber production,
   and local livelihoods at large spatial scales. To deliver on this
   potential, restoration efforts must recognise and reduce trade-offs
   among objectives, and minimize competition with food production and
   conservation of native ecosystems. Restoration initiatives also need to
   confront core environmental challenges of climate change and
   inappropriate planting in savanna biomes, be robustly funded over the
   long term, and address issues of poor governance, inadequate land
   tenure, and sociocultural disparities in benefits and costs. Tackling
   these issues using the landscape approach is vital to realising the
   potential for restoration to break the cycle of land degradation and
   poverty, and deliver on its core environmental and social promises.},

Title = {Reef-scale modeling of coral calcification responses to ocean
   acidification and sea-level rise},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-53},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To predict coral responses to future environmental changes at the reef
   scale, the coral polyp model (Nakamura et al. in Coral Reefs 32:779-794,
   2013), which reconstructs coral responses to ocean acidification, flow
   conditions and other factors, was incorporated into a reef-scale
   three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. This coupled
   reef-scale model was compared to observations from the Shiraho fringing
   reef, Ishigaki Island, Japan, where the model accurately reconstructed
   spatiotemporal variation in reef hydrodynamic and geochemical
   parameters. The simulated coral calcification rate exhibited high
   spatial variation, with lower calcification rates in the nearshore and
   stagnant water areas due to isolation of the inner reef at low tide, and
   higher rates on the offshore side of the inner reef flat. When water is
   stagnant, bottom shear stress is low at night and thus oxygen diffusion
   rate from ambient water to the inside of the coral polyp limits
   respiration rate. Thus, calcification decreases because of the link
   between respiration and calcification. A scenario analysis was conducted
   using the reef-scale model with several pCO(2) and sea-level conditions
   based on IPCC (Climate change 2013: the physical science basis.
   Contribution of working group I to the fifth assessment report of the
   intergovernmental panel on climate change, Cambridge University Press,
   Cambridge, 2013) scenarios. The simulation indicated that the coral
   calcification rate decreases with increasing pCO(2). On the other hand,
   sea-level rise increases the calcification rate, particularly in the
   nearshore and the areas where water is stagnant at low tide under
   present conditions, as mass exchange, especially oxygen exchange at
   night, is enhanced between the corals and their ambient seawater due to
   the reduced stagnant period. When both pCO(2) increase and sea-level
   rise occur concurrently, the calcification rate generally decreases due
   to the effects of ocean acidification. However, the calcification rate
   in some inner-reef areas will increase because the positive effects of
   sea-level rise offset the negative effects of ocean acidification, and
   total calcification rate will be positive only under the best-case
   scenario (RCP 2.6).},

Title = {Returning to their roots: Iron-oxidizing bacteria enhance short-term
   plaque formation in the wetland-plant rhizosphere},
Journal = {GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-73},
Abstract = {In the wetland rhizosphere, high densities of lithotrophic
   Fe(II)oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and a favorable environment (i.e., high
   Fe(II) availability and microaerobic conditions) suggest that these
   organisms are actively contributing to the formation of Fe plaque on
   plant roots. We manipulated the presence/absence of an Fe( II)oxidizing
   bacterium (Sideroxydans paludicola, strain BrT) in axenic hydroponic
   microcosms containing the roots of intact Juncus effusus (soft rush)
   plants to determine if FeOB affected total rates of rhizosphere Fe( II)
   oxidation and Fe plaque accumulation. Our experimental data highlight
   the importance of both FeOB and plants in influencing short-term rates
   of rhizosphere Fe oxidation. Over time scales ca. 1 wk, the FeOB
   increased Fe( II) oxidation rates by 1.3 to 1.7 times relative to
   FeOB-free microcosms. Across multiple experimental trials, Fe( II)
   oxidation rates were significantly correlated with root biomass,
   reflecting the importance of radial O-2 loss in supporting rhizosphere
   Fe(II) oxidation. Rates of root Fe(III) plaque accumulation (time
   scales: 3 to 6 wk) were similar to 70 to 83\% lower than expected based
   on the short-term Fe(II) oxidation rates and were unaffected by the
   presence/absence of FeOB. Decreasing rates of Fe( II) oxidation and
   Fe(III) plaque accumulation with increasing time scales indicate changes
   in rates of Fe(II) diffusion and radial O-2 loss, shifts in the location
   of Fe oxide accumulation, or temporal changes in the microbial community
   within the microcosms. The microcosms used herein replicated many of the
   environmental characteristics of wetland systems and allowed us to
   demonstrate that FeOB can stimulate rates of Fe(II) oxidation in the
   wetland rhizosphere, a finding that has implications for the
   biogeochemical cycling of carbon, metals, and nutrients in wetland
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Flow chart of methanol in China},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {541-550},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Methanol is considered as one of the potential materials for
   fossil-based fuel since its available applications in the fields of fuel
   and chemical materials. China has become the biggest methanol production
   country since 2006, so analyzing the consumption, production and
   transportation of methanol in China has great importance. In the present
   paper, the flow chart of methanol from production to consumption in
   China has been systematically described. Chinese industry and statistics
   data are introduced to analyze and discuss the total and segmental
   methanol amount in both production and consumption. In China, most of
   the methanol is primarily consumed in the synthesis of formaldehyde,
   alternative fuels, and acetic acid synthesis with the corresponding
   percentage of 35\%, 33\%, and 8\%. Synthesis approaches from methanol to
   these downstream products are analyzed and the variation tendencies of
   the demand on these downstream products are predicted. In 2011, about
   22.27 million t methanol was generated on-site, in which, 63.7\%, 23.0\%
   and 11.3\% are produced by coal, natural gas and coke-oven gas
   respectively. Energy flows of each synthesis process based on these
   feedstocks are given and the energy efficiency are calculated and
   compared. As for the transportation, approximately 82.6\% of methanol is
   relied on overland freight, 9\% by marine and the rest 8.4\% by train.

Title = {Determining North Atlantic meridional transport variability from
   pressure on the western boundary: A model investigation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Number = {C9},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the possibility of determining North
   Atlantic meridional transport variability using pressure on the western
   boundary, focusing on the 42 degrees N latitude of the Halifax WAVE
   array. We start by reviewing the theoretical foundations of this
   approach. Next, we present results from a model analysis, both
   statistical and dynamic, that demonstrate the feasibility of the
   approach. We consider how well we can quantify the meridional transport
   variability at 42 degrees N given complete knowledge of bottom pressure
   across the basin and to what degree this quantification is degraded by
   first ignoring the effect of intervening topography and then by using
   only bottom pressure on the western boundary. We find that for periods
   of greater than 1 year, we can recover more than 90\% of the variability
   of the main overturning cell at 42 degrees N using only the western
   boundary pressure, provided that we remove the depth-averaged boundary
   pressure signal. This signal arises from a basin mode of bottom pressure
   variability, which has power at all time scales, but that does not in
   truth have a meridional transport signal associated with it, and from
   the geostrophic depth-independent compensation of the Ekman transport.
   An additional benefit of the removal of the depth-averaged pressure is
   that this high-frequency Ekman signal, which is essentially noise as far
   as monitoring the meridional overturning circulation for climatically
   important changes is concerned, is clearly separated from other modes.},

Title = {Data-driven ship digital twin for estimating the speed loss caused by
   the marine fouling},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {186},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Shipping is responsible for approximately the 90\% of world trade
   leading to significant impacts on the environment. As a consequence, a
   crucial issue for the maritime industry is to develop technologies able
   to increase the ship efficiency, by reducing fuel consumption and
   unnecessary maintenance operations. For example, the marine fouling
   phenomenon has a deep impact, since to prevent or reduce its growth
   which affects the ship consumption, costly drydockings for cleaning the
   hull and the propeller are needed and must be scheduled based on a speed
   loss estimation. In this work a data driven Digital Twin of the ship is
   built, leveraging on the large amount of information collected from the
   on-board sensors, and is used for estimating the speed loss due to
   marine fouling. A thorough comparison between the proposed method and
   ISO 19030, which is the de-facto standard for dealing with this task, is
   carried out on real-world data coming from two Handymax chemical/product
   tankers. Results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposal and its
   better speedloss prediction accuracy with respect to the ISO 19030, thus
   allowing reducing the fuel consumption due to fouling.},

Title = {Functional profiles of phycospheric microorganisms during a marine
   dinoflagellate bloom},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {173},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are an ecological concern but relatively few
   studies have investigated the functional potential of bacterioplankton
   over a complete algal bloom cycle, which is critical for determining
   their contribution to the fate of algal blooms. To address this point,
   we carried out a time-series metagenomic analysis of the functional
   features of microbial communities at three different Gymnodinium
   catenatum bloom stages (pre-, peak-, and post-bloom). Different
   microbial composition were observed during the blooming stages. The
   environmental parameters and correlation networks co-contribute to
   microbial variability, and the former explained 38.4\% of total
   variations of the bacterioplankton community composition. Functionally,
   a range of pathways involved in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur
   cycling were significantly different during the various HAB stages.
   Genes associated with carbohydrate-active enzymes, denitrification, and
   iron oxidation were enriched at the pre-bloom stage; genes involved in
   reductive citrate cycle for carbon fixation, carbon degradation,
   nitrification and phosphate transport were enhanced at the peak stage;
   and relative gene abundance related to sulfur oxidation, vitamin
   synthesis, and iron transport and storage was increased at the
   post-bloom stage. The ecological linkage analysis has shown that
   microbial functional potential especially the C/P/Fe metabolism were
   significantly linked to the fate of the algal blooms. Taken together,
   our results demonstrated that microorganisms displayed successional
   patterns not only at the community level, but also in the metabolic
   potential on HAB's progression. This work contributes to a growing
   understanding of microbial structural elasticity and functional
   plasticity and shed light on the potential mechanisms of
   microbial-mediated HAB trajectory. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Does feeding type matter? Contribution of organic matter sources to
   benthic invertebrates on the Arctic Chukchi Sea shelf},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Benthic communities play an important role in the nutrient cycling of
   settling organic matter and provide an energy link to higher trophic
   levels. These benthic communities are highly dependent on the food
   sources provided through sinking organic material, with pelagic-benthic
   coupling particularly strong on Arctic shelf systems. Arctic shelves,
   however, are experiencing shifts in the timing of sea ice breakup that
   can have severe implications on the amount and composition of organic
   matter from different primary production sources supplied to the
   benthos. The role of benthic invertebrates in processing organic matter
   is typically classified by feeding types. The goal of this study was to
   evaluate if benthic invertebrate feeding types are a useful concept for
   understanding how organic matter from various biosynthetic sources is
   used by benthic invertebrates across the Arctic Chukchi Sea. We employed
   essential amino acid (EAA) specific stable isotope fingerprinting to
   identify proportional contributions of three EAA sources (from
   bacterial, phytoplankton, and terrestrial production) as a proxy of
   carbon sources to the diets of benthic consumers. When grouped by
   feeding types, the proportional contributions of the three EAA sources
   were similar among suspension, deposit feeders and predators/scavengers.
   Different genera within the same feeding type, however, showed
   significant differences among the EAA sources, indicating that EAA use
   is genus-specific rather than feeding type-specific. We discuss
   characteristics other than feeding mode among genera that could account
   for different EAA use, including mobility, selectivity of available EAA
   in sediments, and other trophic aspects such as assimilation efficiency.
   These characteristics provide useful additional considerations when
   grouping organisms by feeding types. High proportions of terrestrial EAA
   were found in the majority of benthic genera across all feeding types
   and characteristics in this study, reflecting the high proportions of
   this organic matter source in sediments and confirming that this source
   is being used by benthic consumers in the Arctic. EAA contributions to
   various benthic genera across the Chukchi Sea shelf had only weak
   correlations with environmental variables. While the distinctly
   different uses of different EAA sources by benthic-feeding genera but
   not by feeding types may represent high trophic plasticity in Arctic
   benthic invertebrates, expected climate change-driven shifts in the
   supply of EAA sources to the Chukchi Sea shelf benthos may still have
   implications for the composition of benthic communities and energy flow
   through the benthic food web, including energy pathways that support
   current top predators.},

Abstract = {lWe analyse the geophone orientation and coupling in a data set from the
   North Sea. Based on the polarization of the water-break on the
   sea-floor, we have derived processing algorithms for determining the
   receiver orientation for gimballed and non-gimballed geophone systems.
   For a gimballed system, the problem reduces to a simple horizontal
   rotation. However, for a non-gimballed system, where all three geophone
   axes may vary due to varying acquisition conditions such as dipping
   sea-floor, twisting of recording cable, etc., the three orientation
   angles cannot be found directly from the recorded displacement vectors.
   Using the data redundancy within a common-receiver gather, a robust
   two-stage method is derived for the non-gimballed system in which all
   three orientations can initially be unknown. Testing on the North Sea
   data set acquired with a gimballed system shows that the three-component
   geophones in the data set are orientated satisfactorily within an error
   of 5 degrees. However, there are some undesirable cross-couplings
   between the vertical and horizontal geophones, which results in leakage
   of shear-wave energy from the horizontal components to the vertical
   components.},

Volume = {101},
Number = {C6},
Pages = {14223-14235},

Abstract = {The structure and generation mechanisms of low-frequency currents at the
   northern shelf edge region of the Grand Banks are investigated using
   data from a bottom mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and
   an array of conventional current meters collected during the Canadian
   Atlantic Storms Program II. The vertical structure of the current is
   determined from an empirical orthogonal function analysis of the ADCP
   data. The analysis shows that over the shelf edge the low-frequency
   currents are predominantly barotropic and polarized in the long-shelf
   direction. There is little coherence between the local wind and the
   barotropic current, while baroclinic currents are moderately coherent
   with the local wind. In the interior of the shelf the currents and the
   local wind are highly coherent. The difference in response to wind
   forcing over the shelf edge and in the shelf interior suggests that
   currents in the shelf interior are wind driven, while currents over the
   shelf edge are generated by mechanisms other than direct wind forcing.
   Possible generation mechanisms for the barotropic long-shelf
   low-frequency currents are discussed, including meanders and eddy
   formation in the Labrador Current and continental shelf waves generated
   by distant storms.},

Abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) has been extensively investigated in the past
   decade. Despite significant advancements in our understanding of the FO
   process, questions and challenges remain regarding the energy efficiency
   and current state of the technology. Here, we critically review several
   key aspects of the FO process, focusing on energy efficiency, membrane
   properties, draw solutes, fouling reversibility, and effective
   applications of this emerging technology. We analyze the energy
   efficiency of the process, disprove the common misguided notion that FO
   is a low energy process, and highlight the potential use of low-cost
   energy sources. We address the key necessary membrane properties for FO,
   stressing the importance of the structural parameter, reverse solute
   flux selectivity, and the constraints imposed by the
   permeability-selectivity tradeoff. We then dispel the notion that draw
   solution regeneration can use negligible energy, highlighting the
   beneficial qualities of small inorganic and thermolytic salts as draw
   solutes. We further discuss the fouling propensity of FO, emphasizing
   the fouling reversibility of FO compared to reverse osmosis (RO) and the
   prospects of FO in treating high fouling potential feed waters. Lastly,
   we discuss applications where FO outperforms other desalination
   technologies and emphasize that the FO process is not intended to
   replace RU, but rather is to be used to process feed waters that cannot
   be treated by RU. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Innovative unconventional oil extraction technologies},
Journal = {FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {228-242},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {New unconventional oil extraction technologies are needed because
   conventional technologies to extract gas and oil from oil shale or tar
   sands are both economically unfeasible and ecologically devastating. One
   technology proposed in this paper is built on long-standing proposals to
   explode a nuclear bomb in the heart of an oil shale deposit which in a
   flash causes the release of gas and oil from the oil shale. This rubble
   chimney will have a glassy bottom which seals the oil from sinking into
   the earth, thus preventing damage to the aquifer. The authors show that
   the equivalent of a significant atomic bomb can be achieved using
   conventional explosives or liquid oxygen and carbon. The computations
   further show that the amount of carbonous material lost in the explosion
   is a small price to pay for the safe in situ collection of the oil and
   gas. Computations show that this technology is both physically possible
   and economically feasible. A second approach is using the supercritical
   state that exact point between liquid and gas to extract the oil and gas
   from the oil shale and from the tar sands. In one configuration, the
   supercritical state is achieved by a sea-based configuration using the
   weight of water to provide sufficient pressure. A land-based alternative
   is a pressure well a very deep well that similarly achieves sufficient
   pressure to produce the supercritical state. Supercritical carbon
   dioxide is frequently used in extraction using the supercritical state
   and the specific technology using carbon dioxide both in devices as well
   as in high pressure in situ. To contain the.pollutants and maximize the
   output, a plasma tunneler heats the oil shale in situ and collects the
   oil and gas while the gases are contained in inflatable domes at the
   ``worm hole{''} or the aperture that the earth penetration device was
   fed from. Other non-combustion proposals are advanced as well. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Ocean waves are one of the most power dense energy sources in the

   that would roll due to the wave's curvature. With the integration of
   springs to connect different segments, the segments are able to bend
   easily, allowing the enclosed balls to move faster, producing higher
   output power. The design of an air gap structure allows each segments of
   the sea snake based TENG to minimize electrostatic induction from ions
   in sea water, and solve the effect of dielectric shielding from the
   water on the device performance, as the water, if it is close to the
   TENG's electrodes, has a detrimental effect causing an increase of the
   TENG's internal capacitance, which would result in a low voltage with
   the same amount of charge being transformed. Thus, this illustrates the
   importance of the air gap structure to minimize low voltage due to high
   internal capacitance. This further shows the sea snake based
   triboelectric nanogenerator could be used in actual ocean conditions,
   such as in high salinity water environment. The added tampered spring to
   replace the air gap was able to allow the balls on the TENG to move more
   quickly, as it increased the rotational angle, and the TENG has a
   maximum power density of 3 W/m(3) under actuation. Due to the
   minimization of dielectric shielding of device performance, the sea
   snake TENG exhibits a high voltage in simulated water wave conditions.},

Abstract = {Physical-biological coupling helps structure aquatic communities, yet
   physical factors can vary widely across large, biogeographic scales. The
   eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is an ecosystem engineer that
   creates intertidal reefs, filters water, promotes denitrification,
   stabilizes shorelines, and provides habitat throughout the inner waters
   of the U.S. South Atlantic Bight (SAB). We quantified physical variables
   (temperature, salinity, duration and depth of water inundation), oyster
   reef properties (slope, vertical relief), and oyster recruitment,
   density, and biomass over a 1500 km scale across the SAB for one year.
   All oyster-level and many reef-level variables exhibited unimodal
   patterns with latitude that peaked in Georgia and South Carolina
   estuaries. Of the physical variables, salinity and duration of water
   inundation over reefs were similar across all sites, and temperature
   declined linearly with increasing latitude, except during summer when it
   had no relationship with latitude. Depth of water inundation over reefs
   was the only physical variable with a prominent unimodal distribution
   that may explain the oyster's biological responses. Similar durations of
   water inundation across all reefs coupled with higher water depths in
   the mid-latitude sites collectively indicate that these sites experience
   higher flow velocity, energy and net water volume delivery per unit
   time. The resultant higher accumulation of oyster biomass and heightened
   reef structure in areas of higher tidal energy emphasize that the
   physical forcing of the SAB (especially large cross-shelf gradients in
   tidal amplification) affects the biology of the eastern oyster,
   including its reef properties, with potential implications for community
   structure and ecosystem service delivery across a biogeographic scale.},

Title = {Internal Wave Dynamics Over Isolated Seamount and Its Influence on Coral
   Larvae Dispersion},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {The internal wave dynamics over Rosemary Bank Seamount (RBS), North
   Atlantic, were investigated using the Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology general circulation model. The model was forced by M2-tidal
   body force. The model results are validated against the in-situ data
   collected during the 136th cruise of the RRS ``James Cook{''} in June
   2016. The observations and the modeling experiments have shown two-wave
   processes developed independently in the subsurface and bottom layers.
   Being super-critical topography for the semi-diurnal internal tides, RBS
   does not reveal any evidence of tidal beams. It was found that below
   800-m depth, the tidal flow generates bottom trapped sub-inertial
   internal waves propagated around RBS. The tidal flow interacting with a
   cluster of volcanic origin tall bottom cones generates short-scale
   internal waves located in 100 m thick seasonal pycnocline. A weakly
   stratified layer separates the internal waves generated in two
   waveguides. Parameters of short-scale sub-surface internal waves are
   sensitive to the season stratification. It is unlikely they can be
   observed in the winter season from November to March when seasonal
   pycnocline is not formed. The deep-water coral larvae dispersion is
   mainly controlled by bottom trapped tidally generated internal waves in
   the winter season. A Lagrangian-type passive particle tracking model is
   used to reproduce the transport of generic deep-sea water invertebrate
   species.},

Title = {Organic Weighting Hydraulic Fracturing Fluid: Complex Interactions
   between Formate Salts, Hydroxy Carboxylate Acid, and Guar},
Journal = {SPE JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2334-2351},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing has extended to both deep--terrestrial and
   deep--sea reservoirs because hydrocarbons in shallow subsurface are
   depleting. However, the density of common inorganic weighting agents may
   not give sufficient column pressure, which may compromise the efficiency
   of hydraulic fracturing fluids (HFF) and present potential risks to
   facilities and the environment. Here, we investigated hydroxypropyl guar
   (HPG)--based HFF (HPG--HFF) using potassium formate (PF) as a weighting
   agent with and without a hydroxy carboxylate acid (citric acid,
   abbreviation FW was used througout this study) as an additional
   dispersion stabilizer. Analyses included stability investigations,
   macro- and microrheology assessments, Fourier transform
   infraredspectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, molecular dynamic simulations, and
   screening of crosslinking points. Our results showed that increased
   concentrations of PF substantially reduced the stability and viscosity
   of HPG solutions, but adding citric acid mitigated these drawbacks.
   Molecular dynamic modeling suggested that formate acid ions formed
   hydrogen bonds with HPG and water, resulting in reduced hydrophilicity
   and coiling of the HPG molecular chain. When citric acid was added, less
   formate ions surrounded the HPG molecule, and the forming FW ions
   primarily interacted with the HPG molecule through hydrogen bonding.
   Besides, the hydroxyl group of the citric acid may improve the
   hydrophilicity of the whole complex. Thus, the original nature of the
   HPG molecular chain could be compensated. Atomic force screening showed
   more crosslinking points with stronger intensity and an even
   distribution in the HPG--PF--citric acid gel system, compared to that in
   the HPG--PF gel system (without citric acid). Furthermore, thermal
   stability tests showed that the proposed PF--citric acid--HPG--HFF
   system could resist temperatures up to 120 degrees C. Our study
   demonstrates the potential application of formate--based weighting
   agents, highlighting the effects of hydrogen bonding in complex HFF.
   This benchtop study provides a foundation for future research to
   understand the application of formate--FW--based weighting HPG--HFF in
   downhole high temperature conditions.},

Title = {Modelling of land surface temperature changes as determinant of urban
   heat island and risk of heat-related conditions in the Wassa West Mining
   Area of Ghana},
Journal = {MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {In recent times, land surface temperature and its associated effect
   urban heat island (UHI) has attracted massive research and public
   attention due to their effects on the environment, climate and public
   health. Specifically, UHI adversely affects the quality of life of city
   dwellers in the form of thermal discomfort, resulting in a rise in
   energy consumption to mitigate the effects of the increase in surface
   temperature. Therefore, studying the presence, extent, spatial
   distribution and changes in surface temperature is essential as it could
   generate meaningful and useful information for sustainable urban
   planning. This research used four multi-temporal Landsat images covering
   three decades to examine surface temperature changes and urban heat
   islands in the Wassa West areas of south-western Ghana. The research was
   implemented through the application of several mathematical models,
   remote sensing and GIS techniques to determine land surface temperature
   variations over the study period. The results of the study showed a
   consistent rise in surface temperature over the 30-year period. For
   instance, in 1990, the minimum and maximum surface temperatures were
   14.96 degrees C and 27.17 degrees C, respectively. In 2020, the minimum
   and maximum temperatures had increase to 24.22 degrees C and 31.23
   degrees C, respectively. A consistent decline in the vegetation of the
   study was equally observed over the period, and this was attributed to
   the increase in urban settlements and large-scale mining activities in
   the study area. The results further indicated that low surface
   temperatures were observed in rural areas with high vegetation, whereas
   high surface temperature values were consistently observed in areas with
   impervious surface covers such as mining and urban areas, suggesting the
   presence of the UHI phenomenon. The study identifies environmentally
   critical areas in the study areas warranting the urgent attention of
   society and specific measures that could contribute to reducing the fast
   increase in surface temperature and mitigate the risk of heat-related
   conditions has been discussed.},

Abstract = {The prediction of freshwater production from the condenser of an
   agricultural seawater greenhouse is important for designing the
   greenhouse process. Two models, namely, Artificial Neural Network and
   multilinear regression (denoted as ANN and RA, respectively), were
   developed and tested to predict the freshwater production rate
   considering ambient solar intensity, condenser inlet moist-air
   temperature, humidity ratio and mass flowrate, and inlet coolant
   temperature. Statistical analysis indicated that all parameters
   significantly affected the prediction (p < 0.05). The accuracy of the
   ANN and RA models was then compared to two models previously developed
   by Yetilmezsoy and Abdul-Wahab and Al-Ismaili et al. (denoted as
   Yetilmezsoy model and Al-Ismaili model, respectively). The ANN model
   showed the best prediction when seven statistical criteria were
   considered. The Pearson correlations for ANN, RA, Yetilmezsoy, and
   Al-Ismaili models were observed as 1.00, 0.98, 0.88, and 0.96,
   respectively, while mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) were 17.84,
   79.72, 63.24, and 80.50\%, respectively. Hence it could be recommended
   to use ANN model for the prediction of freshwater production rate,
   however other three simple models could also be used with lower accuracy
   in the cases of unavailability of the ANN model.},

Abstract = {The photoautotrophic, unicellular N-2-fixer, Cyanothece, is a model
   organism that has been widely used to study photosynthesis regulation,
   the structure of photosystems, and the temporal segregation of carbon
   (C) and nitrogen (N) fixation in light and dark phases of the diel
   cycle. Here, we present a simple quantitative model and experimental
   data that together, suggest external dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
   concentration as a major limiting factor for Cyanothece growth, due to
   its high C-storage requirement. Using experimental data from a parallel
   laboratory study as a basis, we show that after the onset of the light
   period, DIC was rapidly consumed by photosynthesis, leading to a sharp
   drop in the rate of photosynthesis and C accumulation. In N-2-fixing
   cultures, high rates of photosynthesis in the morning enabled rapid
   conversion of DIC to intracellular C storage, hastening DIC consumption
   to levels that limited further uptake. The N-2-fixing condition allows
   only a small fraction of fixed C for cellular growth since a large
   fraction was reserved in storage to fuel night-time N-2 fixation. Our
   model provides a framework for resolving DIC limitation in aquatic
   ecosystem simulations, where DIC as a growth-limiting factor has rarely
   been considered, and importantly emphasizes the effect of intracellular
   C allocation on growth rate that varies depending on the growth
   environment. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Abstract = {Coniform, stromatolites are found in several sites in the Tokaanu and
   Whakarewarewa geothermal areas of North Island, New Zealand. At Tokaanu,
   silicification of these stromatolites is taking place in Kirihoro, a
   shallow hot springfed pool. At Whakarewarewa, subfossil silicified
   coniform stromatolites are found on the floor of ``Waikite Pool{''} on
   the discharge apron below Waikite Geyser, and in an old sinter
   succession at Te Anarata. The microbes in the coniform, stromatolites
   from Tokaanu, Waikite Pool, and Te Anarata have been well preserved
   through rapid silicification. Nevertheless, subtle differences in the
   silicification style induced morphological variations that commonly mask
   or alter morphological features needed for identification of the
   microbes in terms of extant taxa.
   The coniform stromatolites in the New Zealand hotspring pools are
   distinctive because (1) they are formed of upward tapering (i.e.,
   conical) columns, (2) neighboring columns commonly are linked by
   vertical sheets or bridges, (3) internally, they are formed of
   alternating high- and low-porosity laminae that have a conical vertical
   profile, and (4) Phormidium form more than 90\% of the biota. As such.,
   they are comparable to modern coniform, mats and stromatolites found in
   the geothermal systems of Yellowstone National Park and ice-covered
   lakes in Antarctica.
   Formation of the coniform stromatolites is restricted to pools that are
   characterized by low current energy and a microflora that is dominated
   by Phormidium. These delicate and intricate stromatolites could not form
   in areas characterized by fast flowing water or a diverse microflora.
   Thus, it appears that the distribution of these distinctive
   stromatolites is controlled by biological constraints that are
   superimposed on environmental needs.},

Abstract = {Assessment of hazard of erosion of shoreline bluffs requires an
   understanding of the natural processes and human use in these high risk
   areas.  As an important component associated with erosion and natural
   evolution of bluff shorelines, alongshore sediment transport is an
   essential process in defining the hazard associated with bluff erosion. 
   The objective of this study is the integration of an understanding of
   alongshore sediment transport into a proposed management framework for
   cohesive bluff shorelines.  A study of a ten kilometre area along the
   southeastern Lake Huron shoreline, at the cottage community of Horizon
   View, north of Goderich, Ontario examines the natural and human
   components which have led to the development of bluff erosion hazards. 
   Although dominant sediment transport is north to south alongshore, the
   pattern of wave refraction during south and southwest waves, suggests
   frequent northward transport of material from the 30 meter high bluffs
   at the site.  Examination of beach sediments and bluff conditions
   support this finding and indicate long term sediment supply and bluff
   instability.  Planning of future development at this location must
   appreciate the potential for continued bluff erosion and the study
   results suggest that when combined with other factors such as wave
   energy, bluff morphology, groundwater conditions, vegetation cover, land
   uses and impacts of fluctuating lake levels, studies of alongshore
   sediment transport can be a useful tool to assist in management of
   cohesive coastlines and understanding the natural hazard of bluff
   erosion in developed coastal areas.  A management framework for cohesive
   bluffs attempts to integrate an understanding of natural processes with
   human uses and land use policies in order to identify, assess and select
   a preferred management option reflecting this understanding.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in the coastal zone located in Caciliengroden,
   Jadebusen Bay (North Germany). The aim was to examine the changes in
   organic matter properties along a salt marsh soil chronosequence. Three
   soil profiles were located in low, middle-high and high marsh zones,
   between the mud flat tidal area and the dike. We propose a pattern of
   spatial changes in properties of salt marsh soils along the studied
   chronosequence.
   The results lead to the conclusion that some organic matter properties
   (C: N, humic to fulvic acid ratios and aromaticity of the humic acids)
   are good indicators for the extent of development of the studied soils.
   The lowest values of those indices, typical for aquatic sediments, were
   related to the initial soils (low marsh) while the highest values were
   recorded for semi-mature soils (high marsh).},

Abstract = {The process of decommissioning ships, usually followed by ship scraping,
   is associated not only with significant costs but also with many
   environmental and toxic hazards. Thus, re usability of such ships will
   offer more advantages than recycling its steel. This paper proposes
   reusing a post-service life vessel by converting it into an Ocean Wave
   Energy Device. A systematic study on the preliminary estimation of
   energy extraction levels from ocean waves is presented, with some
   discussion on the energy of a ship-shaped body in motion in irregular
   seas. Heave motion was found to be more favorable for such applications.
   Thereafter concept designs have been proposed for the device, and the
   designs have been analyzed in terms of the extent of relative motion and
   power that could be obtained from each of them. Numerical simulation
   techniques have been used to generate the results. Through this
   analysis, it has been established that the idea of constructing such a
   device is feasible. The relatively slower but high-force systems can use
   a hydraulic take-off unit instead of electrical inductance generators.
   The mooring system has also been identified as a separate design
   problem. Further design issues including optimizing the different
   parameters, cost analysis and fabrication issues have not been
   considered - this work is aimed to provide the starting point of the
   design exercise.},

Abstract = {Depth-induced breaking is the major wave transformation process in
   coastal waters that significantly influences the wave energy that
   eventually reaches the coastline. Most studies of depth-induced wave
   breaking focus on evaluating the wave breaking characteristics on a
   slope or reef in two dimensions, accounting for the reduction of water
   depth in the direction of wave propagation. This study investigated wave
   breaking on a three-dimensional submerged bar through experiments and
   numerical simulations. Propagation of nonbreaking and breaking waves in
   different water depths was studied and the energy transferred across the
   wavefront owing to the presence of a side slope and the nonsimultaneous
   breaking wavefront was analyzed. The results indicate that
   classification criteria that account for the local water depth can
   reasonably predict the type of breaking. The long period waves in the
   study that did not break over the structure were most affected by
   refraction. It was also found that the extent of the domain where a
   steep wave crest is seen increases from nonbreaking to spilling to
   plunging breaking waves. In the case of the nonbreaking waves, this
   steep crest propagates along the domain without breaking. (C) 2021

   maintain the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) that is
   used as a reference by all Earth Observing systems and beyond. As a
   result we obtain accurate station positions and linear velocities, a
   manifestation of tectonic plate movements important in earthquake
   studies and in geophysics in general. The ``geodetic{''} satellites used
   in SLR are passive spheres characterized by very high density, with
   little else than gravity perturbing their orbits. As a result they
   define a very stable reference frame, defining primarily and uniquely
   the origin of the ITRF, and in equal shares, its scale. The ITRF is
   indeed used as ``the{''} standard to which we can compare regional,
   GNSS-derived and alternate frames. The melting of global icecaps, ocean
   and atmospheric circulation, sea-level change, hydrological and internal
   Earth-mass redistribution are nowadays monitored using satellites. The
   observations and products of these missions are geolocated and
   referenced using the ITRF. This allows scientists to splice together
   records from various missions sometimes several years apart, to generate
   useful records for monitoring geophysical processes over several
   decades. The exchange of angular momentum between the atmosphere and
   solid Earth for example is measured and can be exploited for monitoring
   global change. LARES, an Italian Space Agency (ASI) satellite, is the
   latest geodetic satellite placed in orbit. Its main contribution is in
   the area of geodesy and the definition of the ITRF in particular and
   this presentation will discuss the improvements it will make in the
   aforementioned areas.},

   associated epilithic algal communities under past, present-day and

Abstract = {Epilithic algal communities play critical ecological roles on coral
   reefs, but their response to individual and interactive effects of ocean
   warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA) is still largely unknown. We
   investigated growth, photosynthesis and calcification of early epilithic
   algal community assemblages exposed for 6 months to four temperature
   profiles (-1.1, +/- 0.0, +0.9, +1.6 A degrees C) that were crossed with
   four carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) levels (360, 440, 650, 940
   A mu atm), under flow-through conditions and natural light regimes.
   Additionally, we compared the cover of heavily calcified crustose
   coralline algae (CCA) and lightly calcified red algae of the genus
   Peyssonnelia among treatments. Increase in cover of epilithic
   communities showed optima under moderately elevated temperatures and
   present pCO(2), while cover strongly decreased under high temperatures
   and high-pCO(2) conditions, particularly due to decreasing cover of CCA.
   Similarly, community calcification rates were strongly decreased at high
   pCO(2) under both measured temperatures. While final cover of CCA
   decreased under high temperature and pCO(2) (additive negative effects),
   cover of Peyssonnelia spp. increased at high compared to annual average
   and moderately elevated temperatures. Thus, cover of Peyssonnelia spp.
   increased in treatment combinations with less CCA, which was supported
   by a significant negative correlation between organism groups. The
   different susceptibility to stressors most likely derived from a
   different calcification intensity and/or mineral. Notably, growth of the
   epilithic communities and final cover of CCA were strongly decreased
   under reduced-pCO(2) conditions compared to the present. Thus, CCA may
   have acclimatized from past to present-day pCO(2) conditions, and
   changes in carbonate chemistry, regardless in which direction,
   negatively affect them. However, if epilithic organisms cannot further
   acclimatize to OW and OA, the interacting effects of both factors may
   change epilithic communities in the future, thereby likely leading to
   reduced reef stability and recovery.},

Title = {Does sea level rise influence propagule establishment, early growth and

Abstract = {Responses of Kandelia candel and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza in loamy-sandy
   (coarse) and silty (fine) soils to water level rise and prolonged
   inundation were investigated under mesocosm and field conditions.
   Acidity due to simulated sea level rise of 30 cm was more serious in
   fine soil than that in coarse soil. Propagules of K. candel had more
   rapid establishments under high water level and prolonged inundation,
   but establishments of B. gymnorrhiza were not significantly influenced
   by tide condition. Water level rise of 30 cm and prolonged inundation
   stimulated early growth especially in stem height increments during the
   first 2 months for K. candel and B. gymnorrhiza. However, relative
   growth rates (RGRs) during the second 2 months did not significantly
   change for K. candel and even decreased for B. gymnorrhiza with water
   level rise. The root/shoot biomass ratio in both K. candel and B.
   gymnorrhiza treated with high water level was significantly lower than
   that treated with low water level, especially in coarse soil. Biomass
   percentages of coarse roots of K. candel and B. gymnorrhiza seedlings
   significantly increased with water level rise. Water level rise led to
   decreases in Chl. a/b ratios in leaves of K. candel seedlings, but the
   ratios did not significantly change with water level for B. gymnorrhiza.
   Decreases in RGRs of B. gymnorrhiza were due to decreases in total leaf
   area resulting from increases in stomatal density. Contents of N and P
   in roots tended to increase with water level rise and prolonged
   inundation. Under both high and low water levels, all propagules of K.
   candel and B. gymnorrhiza successfully established and the seedlings
   survived throughout the mesocosm experiment. For the field trial, K.
   candel seedlings had similar high survival rates of over 90\%, while B.
   gymnorrhiza seedlings had much less survival in lower intertidal zones
   than in upper intertidal zones. These differences were ascribed to
   stronger tidal action and more sedimentation in the field than under
   mesocosm conditions. Survived seedlings of K. candel and B. gymnorrhiza
   from both propagule plantation and seedling transplantation in field
   trial also showed higher stem increments during the first 4 months in
   lower intertidal zones. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Influence of Rock Composition and pH on Reservoir Wettability for
   Low-Salinity Water-CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery Applications in Brazilian
   Reservoirs},
Journal = {SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Low-salinity waterflooding and carbon dioxide (CO2) injection are
   enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods that are currently increasing in use
   worldwide. Linking these two EOR methods is a promising approach in the
   exploration of mature fields and for post- and presalt basins in Brazil.
   Moreover, the latter reservoirs already exhibit a high CO2 content by
   nature. Interfacial phenomena between fluids and rock in a low-salinity
   water-CO2 (LSW-CO2) environment remain unclear, particularly the
   wettability behavior that is related to the pH of the medium, among
   others. This study investigates the influence of rock composition and pH
   of the brine on reservoir wettability through coreflooding and zeta
   potential experiments in LSW and determination of contact angles and
   interfacial tension (IFT) in the crude oil-LSW-CO2 system at reservoir
   conditions. Brazilian light crude oil, pure CO2, and brine solutions of
   different concentrations and compositions were used to represent the
   fluids in actual oil reservoirs. The experiments were carried out on
   Botucatu sandstone, Indiana limestone, and calcite crystal samples, with
   mineralogy determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis.
   Coreflooding experiments were conducted by the injection of 10 pore
   volumes (PVs) of fourfold diluted synthetic reservoir brine (SRB),
   followed by 10 PVs of 40-fold diluted SRB to evaluate the low-salinity
   effects. Interfacial properties, such as contact angle and IFT, as well
   as density and pH, were determined at elevated pressures to evaluate the
   synergistic effects between CO2 and salt content. In addition,
   geochemical modeling using PH REdox EQuilibrium (in C language)
   (PHREEQC) was performed to predict the in-situ pH and match with the
   experimental data. An increase in oil recovery and pH of the effluent
   was observed in the coreflooding experiments during diluted SRB
   injection. The ionic concentrations of the effluent samples also
   indicated illite dissolution. Furthermore, zeta potential measurements
   confirmed the expansion of the water film and shift from positive to
   negative surface charge of Botucatu sandstone for salt concentrations
   less than 80,000 mg/L at pH> 7, whereas in Indiana limestone, negative
   surface charge was only observed in deionized water at pH> 9. These
   observations indicate that during LSW injection alone, an increase in pH
   will favor a thicker water layer on the Botucatu sandstone surface that
   in turn increases water wettability and results in increased oil
   recovery. Conversely, the presence of CO2 in LSW causes a decrease in
   the pH of the medium, which is related to further enhancing water
   wettability when linking pH with contact angle measurements. It seems
   that a change in the pH of the brine induced by CO2 solubility in LSW
   enhanced interactions between the rock surface and water molecules. The
   respective interfacial energy then decreased, resulting in a decreasing
   water contact angle. It was also noticed that seawater-CO2 systems
   caused salt precipitation and mineralogical changes in carbonate and
   sandstone rock induced by calcite and kaolinite dissolution,
   respectively. This study contributes substantially to the understanding
   of interfacial properties and wettability behavior in LSW-CO2 systems,
   facilitating the design of LSW-CO2 EOR applications in Brazilian fields
   or even CO2 storage.
   Moreover, the study provides useful data for oil companies that have
   acquired mature wells and exploration blocks in Brazil, supporting them
   in operational and investment decisions.},

Abstract = {The Western Antarctic Peninsula region is one of the hot spots of
   climate change and one of the most ecologically sensitive regions of
   Antarctica, where permafrost is near its climatic limits. The research
   was conducted in Deception Island, an active stratovolcano in the South
   Shetlands archipelago off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
   The climate is polar oceanic, with high precipitation and mean annual
   air temperatures (MAAT) close to -3 degrees C. The soils are composed by
   ashes and pyroclasts with high porosity and high water content, with ice
   rich permafrost at -0.8 degrees C at the depth of zero annual amplitude,
   with an active layer of about 30 cm. Results from thaw depth, ground
   temperature and snow cover monitoring at the Crater Lake CALM-S site
   over the period 2006 to 2014 are analyzed. Thaw depth (TD) was measured
   by mechanical probing once per year in the end of January or early
   February in a 100 x 100 m with a 10 m spacing grid. The results show a
   trend for decreasing thaw depth from ci. 36 cm in 2006 to 23 cm in 2014,
   while MAAT, as well as ground temperatures at the base of the active
   layer, remained stable. However, the duration of the snow cover at the
   CALM-S site, measured through the Snow Pack Factor (SF) showed an
   increase from 2006 to 2014, especially with longer lasting snow cover in
   the spring and early summer. The negative correlation between SF and the
   thaw depth supports the significance of the influence of the increasing
   snow cover in thaw depth, even with no trend in the MAAT. The lack of
   observed ground cooling in the base of the active layer is probably
   linked to the high ice/water content at the transient layer. The
   pyroclastic soils of Deception Island, with high porosity, are key to
   the shallow active layer depths, when compared to other sites in the
   Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). These findings support the lack of
   linearity between atmospheric warming and permafrost warming and induce
   an extra complexity to the understanding of the effects of climate
   change in the ice-free areas of the WAP, especially in scenarios with
   increased precipitation as snow fall. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The authors performed a series of physical model experiments in the UK
   Coastal Research Facility (CRF) at HR Wallingford in 1998. These tests
   formed part of a wider programme of physical model studies at a scale of
   1:28 of the Elmer breakwater scheme in West Sussex. The authors lowered
   the crest levels of the original breakwaters in order to investigate the
   hydrodynamic and morphodynamic effect of using submerged rubble mound
   breakwaters, instead of emergent ones, to provide coastal protection in
   a macro-tidal region. Lowering the crest levels would have reduced the
   raw material and construction costs of the scheme. The visual intrusion
   would have been diminished and the inshore water would have been be more
   regularly flushed, reducing the likelihood of water quality problems
   developing at the beach. Although lowering the crest height increases
   the transmitted wave energy above certain water levels, it can be
   determined using traditional theory. However the impact on beach
   evolution of the `set-up' currents generated behind breakwaters when the
   water level is near crest level is not well understood. Their magnitude
   can not currently be predicted easily. The results from the series of
   CRF experiments reported herein demonstrate the nature and magnitude of
   these set-up currents. The authors present an equation to determine the
   `set-up' in 2D models and outline a volume continuity method to relate
   2D `set-up' to the magnitude of the 3D set up currents.},

Title = {Spatial variation in shallow sediment methane sources and cycling on the
   Alaskan Beaufort Sea Shelf/Slope},
Journal = {MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {186-197},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The MITAS (Methane in the Arctic Shelf/Slope) expedition was conducted
   during September, 2009 onboard the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) Polar
   Sea (WAGB-11), on the Alaskan Shelf/Slope of the Beaufort Sea.
   Expedition goals were to investigate spatial variations in methane
   source(s), vertical methane flux in shallow sediments (<10 mbsf), and
   methane contributions to shallow sediment carbon cycling. Three
   nearshore to offshore transects were conducted across the slope at
   locations approximately 200 km apart in water column depths from 20 to
   2100 m. Shallow sediments were collected by piston cores and vibracores
   and samples were analyzed for sediment headspace methane (CH4),
   porewater sulfate (SO42-), chloride (Cl-), and dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) concentrations, and CH4 and DIC stable carbon isotope
   ratios (delta C-13). Downward SO42- diffusion rates estimated from
   sediment porewater SO42- profiles were between -15.4 and -154.8 mmol
   m(-2) a(-1) and imply a large spatial variation in vertical CH4 flux
   between transects in the study region. Lowest inferred CH4 fluxes were
   estimated along the easternmost transect. Higher inferred CH4 flux rates
   were observed in the western transects. Sediment headspace delta
   C-13(CH4) values ranged from -138 to -48 parts per thousand., suggesting
   strong differences in shallow sediment CH4 cycling within and among
   sample locations. Measured porewater DIC concentrations ranged from 2.53
   mM to 79.39 mM with delta C-13(DIC) values ranging from -36.4 parts per
   thousand to 5.1 parts per thousand, Higher down-core DIC concentrations
   were observed to occur with lower delta C-13 where an increase in delta
   C-13(CH4), was measured, indicating locations with active anaerobic
   oxidation of methane. Shallow core CH4 production was inferred at the
   two western most transects (i.e. Thetis Island and Halkett) through
   observations of low delta C-13(CH4), coupled with elevated DIC
   concentrations. At the easternmost Hammerhead transect and offshore
   locations, delta C-13(CH4), and DIC concentrations were not coupled
   suggesting less rapid methane cycling. Results from the MITAS expedition
   represent one of the most comprehensive studies of methane source(s) and
   vertical methane flux in shallow sediments of the U.S. Alaskan Beaufort
   Shelf to date and show geospatially variable sediment methane flux that
   is highly influenced by the local geophysical environment (C) 2013

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research on the diffusion characteristics of swells contributes
   positively to wave energy forecasting, swell monitoring, and early
   warning. In this work, the South Indian Ocean westerly index (SIWI) and
   Indian Ocean swell diffusion effect index (IOSDEI) are defined on the
   basis of the 45-year (September 1957-August 2002) ERA-40 wave reanalysis
   data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
   to analyze the impact of the South Indian Ocean westerlies on the
   propagation of swell acreage. The following results were obtained: 1)
   The South Indian Ocean swell mainly propagates from southwest to
   northeast. The swell also spreads to the Arabian Sea upon reaching
   low-latitude waters. The 2.0-meter contour of the swell can reach
   northward to Sri Lankan waters. 2) The size of the IOSDEI is determined
   by the SIWI strength. The IOSDEI requires approximately 2-3.5 days to
   fully respond to the SIWI. The correlations between SIWI and IOSDEI show
   obvious seasonal differences, with the highest correlations found in
   December-January-February (DJF) and the lowest correlations observed in
   June-July-August (JJA). 3) The SIWI and IOSDEI have a common period of
   approximately 1 week in JJA and DJF. The SIWI leads by approximately 2-3
   days in this common period.},

Title = {Eco-Evolutionary Interaction in Competing Phytoplankton: Nutrient Driven
   Genotype Sorting Likely Explains Dominance Shift and Species Responses
   to CO2},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {How ecological and evolutionary processes interact and together
   determine species and community responses to climate change is poorly
   understood. We studied long-term dynamics (over approximately 200
   asexual generations) in two phytoplankton species, a coccolithophore
   (Emiliania huxleyi), and a diatom (Chaetoceros affinis), to increased
   CO2 growing alone, or competing with one another in co-occurrence. To
   allow for rapid evolutionary responses, the experiment started with a
   standing genetic variation of nine genotypes in each of the species.
   Under co-occurrence of both species, we observed a dominance shift from
   C. affinis to E. huxleyi after about 120 generations in both CO2
   treatments, but more pronounced under high CO2. Associated with this
   shift, we only found weak adaptation to high CO2 in the diatom and none
   in the coccolithophore in terms of species' growth rates. In addition,
   no adaptation to interspecific competition could be observed by
   comparing the single to the two-species treatments in reciprocal assays,
   regardless of the CO2 treatment. Nevertheless, highly reproducible
   genotype sorting left only one genotype remaining for each of the
   species among all treatments. This strong evolutionary selection
   coincided with the dominance shift from C. affinis to E. huxleyi. Since
   all other conditions were kept constant over time, the most parsimonious
   explanation for the dominance shift is that the strong evolutionary
   selection was driven by the experimental nutrient conditions, and in
   turn potentially altered competitive ability of the two species. Thus,
   observed changes in the simplest possible two-species phytoplankton
   ``community{''} demonstrated that eco-evolutionary interactions can be
   critical for predicting community responses to climate change in rapidly
   dividing organisms such as phytoplankton.},

Abstract = {Membrane scaling is caused by the precipitation of soluble salts as the
   feedwater is converted to brine. The scaling potential of any feedwater
   is determined from the feedwater analysis, the conversion of the RO
   system and the solubility limit of the various salts. In brackish water,
   calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate are the most common salts for
   which pretreatment is required. In seawater, calcium carbonate is
   usually the salt: for which pretreatment is required. Other salts for
   which pretreatment calculation should be performed to ensure that
   solubility limits are not exceeded in seawater are barium sulfate,
   strontium sulfate, calcium floride and silica. The most common method
   used to prevent scaling in RO plants is removal of deposit-forming
   constituents, i.e., removing the carbonate and bicarbonate ions from the
   feedwater by adding acid or chemicals to water to alter the physical or
   chemical nature or the growth mechanisms of the depositing species i.e.
   adding scale control inhibitors. The two methods may be used together
   depending on the nature of the feedwater used. In this paper, solubility
   product, ion product and the Stiff and Davis Stability Index are
   calculated for the brine based on the feed of the seawater at
   Doha-Kuwait and the recovery ratio of the RO plant. The optimal recovery
   for the RO units at which they can operate safely without adding any
   scale inhibitor is reported.},

Abstract = {High-temperature stability of SiC-based ceramics has been well-known,
   and therefore its composite materials have been investigated for the
   application to thermostructural materials. However, well-known SiC-based
   fibers and matrix-materials stained with salt are easily oxidized at
   high temperatures in air. This would be serious problem when these
   materials are used near the ocean or in a combustion gas containing
   alkali elements. We have developed a new type of sintered SiC fiber with
   prominent alkali resistance. This fiber also shows high-strength,
   high-modulus, excellent high-temperature stability and superior creep
   resistance. Moreover, this fiber indicated very high thermal
   conductivity about 20-fold larger than ordinary SiC based fibers.
   Furthermore, we also have developed a new type of sintered SiC
   fiber-bonded ceramics using an intermediate fiber for preparing above
   mentioned fiber. This composite material maintained initial strength up
   to 1600 degrees C, and what is more, showed very high fracture energy
   and thermal conductivity.},

Title = {Urban green roofs to manage rooftop microclimates: A case study from
   Sydney, Australia},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Urbanisation has led to a growing need for sustainable development
   leading to climate resilient cities. As the urban heat burden increases
   in severity, technologies to improve the thermal comfort of cities are
   increasingly required. Green roofs are one such technology that can
   provide increased building thermal performance. In this study, we
   investigate two identical buildings, except, one was equipped with a
   green roof, and the other without. We present the longest-term
   assessment conducted on an Australian green roof with in-situ thermal
   monitoring coupled with surface temperature assessments. Field
   measurements were utilised to calculate the thermal buffer potential of
   the green roof compared to a near-identical conventional roof, over
   three seasons. Our findings indicated a reduction in rooftop surface
   temperatures up to 20 C when ambient temperatures exceeded 40 C, as well
   as improvements to heat flow of up to 55.54\%. These results indicate
   that green roofs may contribute to the much-needed reduction in ambient
   city temperature to alleviate overheating and the costs associated with
   the urban heat island effect.},

   HOUSEHOLD RESPONSES IN COASTAL BANGLADESH},
Journal = {CLIMATE CHANGE ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper quantifies the impacts of inundation risk and soil
   salinization on the family structure and income of coastal households in
   Bangladesh. The analysis is based on a household decision model that
   relates spatial deployment of working-age, migration-capable members to
   inundation and salinization threats. The empirical analysis uses
   appropriate estimation techniques, including adjustments for spatial
   autocorrelation. The findings are consistent with a model that treats
   urban migration of working-age family members as both an income source
   and the only feasible form of disaster insurance for coastal households.
   Greater inundation risk unambiguously decreases the rural household
   share of working-age members, while the direction of the salinity effect
   depends on households' income elasticity of demand for disaster
   insurance. The econometric results suggest that this elasticity is
   significantly greater than one, yielding higher rural household shares
   of working-age members in areas with higher salinity (ceteris paribus).
   Both increased inundation risk and greater salinity increase the
   incidence of extreme poverty among coastal households. However, powerful
   poverty reduction results for market access indicate that road
   improvements would provide an important countervailing force. The
   benefits of increased market access for coastal households are present
   with or without inundation and salinization threats, making such
   investments an attractive no-regret option.},

Abstract = {Many recent, observational studies have concluded that planetary systems
   commonly exist in multiple-star systems. At least similar to 20\%, and
   presumably a larger fraction, of the known extrasolar planetary systems
   are associated with one or more stellar companions,. These stellar
   companions normally exist at large distances from the planetary systems
   (typical projected binary separations are 10(2) - 10(4) AU) and are
   often faint. (ranging from F to T spectral types). Yet, secular cyclic
   angular momentum exchange with these distant stellar companions can
   significantly alter the orbital configuration of the planets around the
   primaries. One of the most interesting and fairly common outcomes seen
   in numerical simulations is tire opening of a large mutual inclination
   angle between the planetary orbits, forced by differential nodal
   precessions caused by the binary companion. The growth of the mutual
   inclination angle between planetary orbits induces additional
   large-amplitude eccentricity oscillations of the inner planet due to the
   quadrupole gravitational perturbation by the outer planet. This
   eccentricity oscillation may eventually result in the orbital decay of
   the inner planet through tidal friction, as previously proposed as Kozai
   migration or Kozai cycles with tidal friction (KCTF). This orbital decay
   mechanism induced by the binary perturbation and subsequent tidal
   dissipation may stand as an alternative formation channel for close-in
   extrasolar planets.},

Title = {Exploring the path of inter-provincial industrial transfer and carbon
   transfer in China via combination of multi-regional input?output and
   geographically weighted regression model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Due to the adjustment of China?s regional industrial structure, some
   industries, especially industrial industries, are gradually transferring
   to the mainland. This process is also accompanied by carbon transfer.
   However, few studies focus on the consistency of industrial transfer and
   carbon transfer path, and do not consider the role of environmental
   regulation. Based on the multi-regional input?output (MRIO) model, this
   study measures the industrial transfer and carbon transfer of 30
   provinces in China, and compares the path of industrial transfer and
   carbon transfer. Considering the spatial differences of provinces, the
   GWR model is used to investigate the impact of industrial structure,
   energy intensity, urbanization and environmental regulation on carbon
   transfer. The results show that the eastern coastal region is the
   largest industrial outflow area and the largest carbon inflow area. The
   direction of industrial transfer and carbon transfer is inconsistent,
   indicating that there are other factors that affect carbon transfer.
   Environmental regulation is negatively correlated with net carbon
   outflow. Industrial structure, energy intensity and urbanization all
   contribute to carbon transfer. Among them, energy intensity has the
   greatest impact on carbon transfer, and the elastic coefficient is above
   8. Therefore, it is suggested to strengthen technological innovation,
   increase the development and utilization of renewable energy, and
   realize the diversified utilization of energy resources.},

Abstract = {In this study, iron and aluminum electrodes were put in marine clay
   which was taken from the south coast in Korea to increase the undrained
   shear strength by inducing the densification and cementation between
   clay particles and precipitates which were developed by electric
   decomposition in an electrode. To raise the cementation rate and reduce
   treatment time, high electric current (2.5A) was applied in each
   electrode at a semi-pilot scale soil box with marine clay. After the
   tests, the undrained shear strength was measured at designated points
   using a static cone penetration test device and sampling was conducted
   simultaneously in order to measure water content, pH and electric
   conductivity which would be the key for configuring the cementation
   effects indirectly. In the results of electric decomposition in iron
   electrode, the measured shear strength was increased considerably
   compared to the initial shear strength because of the cementation effect
   between iron ions and soil particles. In the case of an electric
   decomposition test in aluminum electrodes, the distribution of measured
   shear strength and degree of improvement were more homogeneous than that
   of iron electrodes.},

Title = {Global radiative adjustment after a collapse of the Atlantic meridional
   overturning circulation},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {1789-1799},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The transient climate response to a collapse of the Atlantic meridional
   overturning circulation (AMOC) is analysed from the difference between
   two ensembles of climate model simulations with ECHAM5/MPI-OM, one with
   hosing and the other without hosing. The primary effect of the collapse
   is to redistribute heat over the two hemispheres. However, Northern
   Hemisphere sea ice increase in response to the AMOC collapse induces a
   hemisphere-wide cooling, amplified by atmospheric feedbacks, in
   particular water vapour. The Southern Hemisphere warming is governed by
   slower processes. After 25 years the global cooling peaks. Thereafter,
   the response is characterised by a gradual readjustment of global mean
   temperature. During the AMOC collapse a downward radiation anomaly
   arises at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), heating the earth's surface.
   The net downward radiation anomaly at TOA arises from reduced longwave
   emission by the atmosphere, overcompensating the increased net upward
   anomalies in shortwave and longwave radiation at the surface. This
   radiation anomaly is associated with net ocean heat uptake: cooling of
   the overlying atmosphere results from reduced ocean heat release through
   the increase of sea-ice cover in the North Atlantic. The change in
   energy flow arises from the reduction in latent and sensible heat flux,
   which dominate the surface radiation budget. Similar experiments with a
   climate model of intermediate complexity reveal a stronger shortwave
   response that acts to reduce the net downward radiation anomaly at TOA.
   The net shortwave and longwave radiation anomalies at TOA always
   decrease during the first 100 years after the AMOC collapse, but in the
   intermediate complexity model this is associated with a sign change
   after 90 years when the net radiation anomaly at TOA becomes upward,
   accompanied by net ocean heat loss. After several hundred years the
   longwave and shortwave anomalies increase again, while the net residual
   at TOA remains small. This radiative adjustment is associated with the
   transition to a colder climate.},

Abstract = {This preliminary study used DNA metabarcoding to test whether the
   stomach content and gut microbiome of tuna could be a viable near
   real-time monitoring tool for detecting composition and change in
   oceanic ecosystems. The gut content of skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis,
   n=55) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares, n=46) captured in the
   Pacific Ocean during El Nino Southern Oscillation events (ENSO) between
   2015-2017 were examined by high throughput sequencing and complemented
   by morphological assessments to identify fishes, crustaceans and
   cephalopods in the stomach content. Gut microbiome was examined solely
   by high throughput sequencing. Stomach content and gut microbiome were
   compared between tuna species, ENSO events and capture location using
   generalised linear models. The full model (tuna species, capture
   location and interaction with ENSO) best explained fish prey
   composition, while capture location and ENSO weakly explained the
   composition of crustaceans and cephalopods. Skipjack and yellowfin tuna
   captured near coastal areas (Longitude<170 degrees W) showed a greater
   diversity of prey compared to fish captured in oceanic regions of the
   Pacific, while Thunnus albacares showed a much more diverse stomach
   content than K. pelamis (21 fish, eight cephalopods and six
   crustaceans). Fish captured during La Nina events showed higher prey
   diversity compared to fish captured during El Nino. Tuna species best
   explained differences in gut microbiome to the Phylum level, while no
   model explained gut microbiome differences to the Order or Family level.
   This preliminary study shows that capture location and ENSO events
   explained differences in stomach content of K. pelamis and T. albacares,
   while tuna species best explained gut microbiome assemblages to the
   Phylum level.},

Abstract = {Desalination with humidification and dehumidification process is deemed
   as an efficient and promising means of utilizing the condenser and
   evaporator of heat pump to produce freshwater from seawater. This paper
   presents a new type desalination unit driven by mechanical vapor
   compression pump which was designed and fabricated by the Institute of
   Air-Conditioning \& Solar Energy of the Northwestern Polytechnical
   University. The unit utilized the heat from condenser and the cold from
   evaporator of heat pump adequately, and reclaimed most latent heat. The
   air, firstly, was humidified in the humidifier with the alveolate
   structure, and then was cooled in the precondenser and the evaporative
   condenser to produce freshwater. A mathematical model of the unit is
   presented, in which the hydrokinetics method was used to study the flow
   and the heat and mass transfer inside the alveolate humidifier. The
   effects of some of the operation such as flow rates, temperatures of
   cooling water and air, and etc., were studied in detail. The comparison
   between the numerical and experimental results was accepted. The
   desalination unit that is considered in the study produces freshwater 60
   kg/day with the less electric power that is 500 W and is proven to be an
   efficient desalination device to obtain freshwater.},

Abstract = {Once a booming fishery in the Gulf of Maine, green sea urchin
   (Stronglocentrotus droebachiensis) catches declined drastically in the
   1990s and have remained low over the past couple decades. To monitor
   changes in urchin populations, settlement patterns of S. droebachiensis
   at sites in the northern (Eastport and Frazer Point, ME) and southern
   Gulf of Maine (York, ME and Isles of Shoals, NH) were recorded. From
   1994 to 2019, AstroTurf (R) panels attached to wire frames were
   intermittently laid on the ocean bottom at five sites along the Gulf of
   Maine in late spring and retrieved in the mid to late summer. The
   present study examined changes in recruitment densities over the 23-year
   period from 1996 to 2019 and found a drop in recruitment at the southern
   sites by two orders of magnitude over the time span. Aside from the
   likely pressure of overfishing, recruitment declines may be influenced
   by anthropogenic climate change and higher predation rates by Jonah
   crabs, Cancer borealis.},

Abstract = {Cellulose poulticing is a widespread method of desalination in practice
   for removal of salts from ancient structures. Optimization of the
   process is essential, considering that poulticing/desalination is the
   prime step during the protection of existing structures in the coastal
   zones. Even though poulticing is widely used in European countries, it
   is not common in India, because the principle and efficacy of the method
   have not been studied so far for masonry materials in the ancient Indian
   structures with specific microstructure. The present study analyses the
   effect of cellulose poulticing in bricks considering the role of pore
   size in the substrates and the removal of different types of salts
   depending upon the pore distribution. The process was found around 74\%
   more efficient in removing Na2SO4 than NaCl in materials with more
   micropores (pore size <1 mu m), as demonstrated from scanning electron
   microscopy images and analysis of pore structure using mercury intrusion
   porosimetry on brick samples. Interesting results on the unsuitability
   of cellulose poulticing in certain materials and the reasons for the
   same were obtained, which are based on the predominant transport
   mechanisms for salt removal. The study would be a reference for
   initiating cellulose poulticing as an effective desalination method in
   the ancient structures of coastal southern India.},

Title = {Carbonation of mantle peridotite by CO2-rich fluids: the formation of
   listvenites in the Advocate ophiolite complex (Newfoundland, Canada)},
Journal = {LITHOS},

Volume = {323},

Abstract = {The mantle section of the Advocate ophiolite (Newfoundland, Canada)
   contains unique outcrops of listvenite (magnesite-quartz), antigorite-
   and quartz-bearing talc-magnesite rock, and carbonated
   antigorite-serpentinite. This lithological sequence records the
   sequential carbonation of serpentinite by CO2-rich hydro thermal fluids.
   High Cr and Ni contents and preservation of Cr-spinel with a composition
   similar to that of Atg-serpentinite (molar Mg/Mg + Fe = 0.50-0.65; Cr/Cr
   + Al = 0.50-0.70), show that the Advocate listvenite and talc-magnesite
   rocks formed by carbonation of variably serpentinized mantle
   harzburgite. Replacement of lizardite by magnesite coeval with the
   breakdown of lizardite to antigorite + brucite and the lack of prograde
   olivine and magnetite in antigorite serpentinite and talc-magnesite
   rocks constrain the temperature of carbonation between c. 280 degrees C
   and 420 degrees C. Thermodynamic modelling of carbonation of
   serpentinite at 300 degrees C and 0.2-0.5 GPa accounts for the sequence
   of carbonated rocks in the Advocate complex. Phase relations and
   petrological observations indicate that the aqueous aSiO(2) and aCO(2)
   of the infiltrating CO2-rich fluid were buffered at the Atg-Tlc-Mgs and
   Qtz-Tlc-Mgs pseudo-invariant points, forming dominantly three-phase
   rocks by variable extents of carbonation at these pseudo-invariant
   points. Listvenites formed at large fluid-rock ratio when quartz became
   saturated in the fluid and precipitated along magnesite grain boundaries
   and in variably sized tensional veins.
   The whole rock Fe3+/Fe-total ratio of the Advocate carbonate-bearing
   sequence decreases with increasing whole rock carbon content, from
   0.65-0.80 in brucite-bearing antigorite serpentinite to 0.10-0.30 in
   talc-magnesite rocks and listvenite. The whole rock iron reduction is
   associated with an increase in the ferrous iron content of magnesite and
   the formation of hematite and goethite, indicating a concomitant
   increase of the fluid oxygen fugacity. The sequence of carbonation
   reactions is uniquely preserved in three main growth zones
   characteristic of listvenite magnesite: (i) an inner zone of magnetite
   -bearing, Fe-poor, Mn-bearing magnesite formed by carbonation of
   lizardite, brucite and olivine from Atg-serpentinite; (ii) an outer zone
   of Fe-rich magnesite formed by carbonation of antigorite and in
   equilibrium with Fe -poor talc; and (iii) an outermost rim of Fe-poor
   magnesite formed by carbonation of talc.
   We propose that carbonation of the Advocate serpentinized mantle
   harzburgite occurred in a supra-subduction upper plate ophiolite by
   fluxing of slab-derived, CO2-rich fluids channelled along deep faults at
   the onset of accretion of the forearc basin (c. 300 degrees C, <0.5
   GPa). The rather constant delta O-18 (11.0-14.4 parts per thousand
   V-SMOW) and relatively low delta C-13 (-8.9 to 5.0 parts per thousand
   V-PDB) of magnesite throughout the sequence of carbonated rocks in the
   Advocate complex is consistent with CO2-rich fluids derived from
   decarbonation or dissolution of organic carbon- and carbonate-bearing
   meta-sediments, such as those occurring in the underlying Birchy complex
   the partially subducted continental margin of Laurentia. Carbonation of
   serpentinized oceanic or continental mantle lithosphere by reactive
   percolation of CO2-rich fluids derived from the slab in forearc settings
   may represent a significant carbon reservoir for the deep carbon cycle.

Abstract = {The resilience of an active distribution network (ADN) is continuously
   threatened by extreme weather, natural disaster, and cyber-physical
   incidents. An automatic restoration framework is thus desired to
   optimally integrate the emerging smart-grid technologies with the
   grid-edge flexibility to self-heal the ADNs. This paper proposes a
   framework for sequential ADN restoration by coordinating different
   distributed energy resources (DERs) on the grid-edge. The uncertainty of
   the renewable DERs is, however, a challenge. Therefore, the proposed
   framework is formulated as a chance-constrained optimization problem
   (CCOP). The chance-constraints use a parametrized response policy for
   the control during fluctuations and are reformulated for an efficient
   solution. The proposed CCOP's solution provides a sequence of control
   actions at each time-step that coordinates the network switches and DERs
   to form multiple islanded microgrids. Its effectiveness is evaluated on
   IEEE 123 node ADN.},

Abstract = {Four-month current and temperature observations collected in two
   different positions and at four different depths in the Golfo Artabro,
   off the NW corner of the Iberian Peninsula, have been analysed in order
   to investigate some aspects of tides in this area. Tidal currents in the
   deepest stations are much greater than expected for a purely barotropic
   tide, a result that is even more outstanding if the bottom decay of the
   interior currents is allowed for. The near-bottom tidal enhancement is
   confirmed by the large tidal fluctuations of temperature at M2
   frequency, equivalent to internal oscillations of some tens of metres of
   amplitude. The phase of these oscillations suggests propagation of the
   internal tide parallel to the depth gradient. The slope of the bottom
   profile is comparable to the slope of the internal rays and favours the
   generation of internal tides of considerable amplitude. The existence of
   areas of supercritical slope shoreward of the mooring lines is able to
   reflect seawards the energy of the incoming internal waves along
   trajectories nearly parallel to the sea floor, a mechanism that is put
   forward as responsible for the considerable concentration of tidal
   energy in the bottom layer. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mass coral mortality under local amplification of 2 degrees C ocean
   warming},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {A 2 degrees C increase in global temperature above pre-industrial levels
   is considered a reasonable target for avoiding the most devastating
   impacts of anthropogenic climate change. In June 2015, sea surface
   temperature (SST) of the South China Sea (SCS) increased by 2 degrees C
   in response to the developing Pacific El Nino. On its own, this
   moderate, short-lived warming was unlikely to cause widespread damage to
   coral reefs in the region, and the coral reef ``Bleaching Alert{''}alarm
   was not raised. However, on Dongsha Atoll, in the northern SCS,
   unusually weak winds created low-flow conditions that amplified the 2
   degrees C basin-scale anomaly. Water temperatures on the reef flat,
   normally indistinguishable from open-ocean SST, exceeded 6 C-degrees
   above normal summertime levels. Mass coral bleaching quickly ensued,
   killing 40\% of the resident coral community in an event unprecedented
   in at least the past 40 years. Our findings highlight the risks of 2
   degrees C ocean warming to coral reef ecosystems when global and local
   processes align to drive intense heating, with devastating consequences.},

Abstract = {This study aims to propose an optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder-type
   wave energy converter (WEC) prototype suitable for western sea of Jeju
   island by using linear inviscid and nonlinear viscous numerical model,
   appropriately. Parametric studies with respect to draft and position of
   center of rotation of horizontal eccentric cylinder-type WEC were
   carried out through a frequency domain analysis based on the linear
   potential theory to propose an optimal design of WEC. Dynamic behaviors
   of the optimized WEC in 1/20 scale induced by regular waves with
   different wave heights was not only experimentally investigated but also
   compared with a numerical result with OpenFOAM, one of computational
   fluid dynamic models. A response amplitude operator (RAO) induced by a
   higher wave height is smaller than RAO induced by a lower wave height. A
   non-linear dynamic behavior is investigated from spectrum analysis. A
   free decay test with different initial pitch excursions shows that
   nonlinear effects due to viscosity. The extracted power of the optimized
   WEC in full scale can be estimated from the simulation of full scale
   model induced by the wave climate in western sea of Jeju island.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {163},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Liquid natural gas (LNG) exploration has started off the coast of
   northern Mozambique, in the Rovuma Basin, East Africa. In advance of gas
   production, we collected in 2018 over 100 samples of surface sediments
   from 40 locations in the pristine and exploration areas at water depths
   of 5-2000 m. We have determined the levels of hydrocarbons (total
   hydrocarbon contents (THC) and 49 individual PAHs), heavy metals,
   arsenic, grain size and total organic carbon. While sediment composition
   varied strongly from coarse sediment to high mud contents (<63 mu m),
   background levels of hydrocarbons and metals were found in most samples.
   We found anthropogenic contamination at one site in Pemba harbor. We
   observed no petroleum-related contamination, including the Palma area
   with numerous exploration wells. Elevated concentrations of barium and
   THC at some locations in this area are attributed to drilling activities
   but are not considered to be of environmental concern.},

Title = {RESPONSE OF BIOTA TO SEDIMENTARY ORGANIC-MATTER QUALITY OF THE WEST

Journal = {OCEANOLOGICA ACTA},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Relationships between benthos and sedimentary organic matter quality
   were analyzed in the West Gironde Mud Patch (WGMP), on the shelf of the
   Bay of Biscay, off the Gironde estuary, as part of the multidisciplinary
   national programme Ecomarge, a JGOFS-France contribution. At three
   stations located on an east-west transect and at different periods from
   1985 to 1988, the following parameters of the sediment were analyzed:
   POC (particulate organic carbon); SIGMA (sum of easily extractable
   macromolecules thought to be the most degradable part of particulate
   organic matter); pigments as indices of organic matter quality; ETS
   (electron-transport-system) activities and meiofauna densities as
   indices of benthic responses. Sediments from the WGMP have an overall
   low organic carbon content (0.8 \%) ; the labile organic fraction
   (SIGMA) does not exceed 10 \% of the total sedimentary POM (particulate
   organic matter). Nevertheless, the supply of freshly-formed matter was
   marked both by pigment and SIGMA increases, especially westwards.
   ETS activity was significantly linked to POC, SIGMA and chlorophyll a.
   The ETS: POC ratio was lower than in neighbouring coastal areas (i. e.
   the Gironde estuary and Arcachon Bay) but ETS: SIGMA\_ was of the same
   magnitude in the three zones, reaching values close to ETS: SIGMA ratios
   found in live bacteria. It was concluded that SIGMA could mainly be
   composed of biomass itself; the detrital part of SIGMA, thought to be
   rapidly incorporated into living material, would not accumulate.
   The distribution of meiofauna abundances did not follow the same
   gradients as pigments, ETS and SIGMA, and presumably depended on
   environmental factors other than those analyzed here.},

Abstract = {A global high-resolution ocean circulation model forced by atmospheric
   fields and the M-2 tidal constituent is used to explore plausible
   scenarios for the damping of low-mode internal tides. The plausibility
   of different damping scenarios is tested by comparing the modeled
   barotropic tides with TPXO8, a highly accurate
   satellite-altimetry-constrained tide model, and by comparing the modeled
   coherent baroclinic tide amplitudes against along-track altimetry. Five
   scenarios are tested: (1) a topographic internal wave drag, argued here
   to represent the breaking of unresolved high vertical modes, applied to
   the bottom flow (default configuration), (2) a wave drag applied to the
   barotropic flow, (3) absence of wave drag, (4) a substantial increase in
   quadratic bottom friction along the continental shelves (with wave drag
   turned off), and (5) application of wave drag to the barotropic flow at
   the same time that quadratic bottom friction is substantially increased
   along the shelves. Of the scenarios tested here, the default
   configuration (1) yields the most accurate tides. In all other scenarios
   (2-5), the lack of damping on open ocean baroclinic motions yields
   baroclinic tides that are too energetic and travel too far from their
   sources, despite the presence of a vigorous mesoscale eddy field which
   can scatter and decohere internal tides in the model. The barotropic
   tides are also less accurate in the absence of an open ocean damping on
   barotropic motions, that is, in scenarios (3) and (4). The results
   presented here suggest that low-mode internal tides experience
   substantial damping in the open ocean.},

Abstract = {Interest in the role of organic acids as chemical constituents in
   troposphere has been growing rapidly over the past couple of decades. In
   addition to their presence in the atmosphere in a variety of phases,
   organic acids are important constituents of the global troposphere and
   contribute a large fraction (similar to 25\%) to the nonmethane
   hydrocarbon atmospheric mixture. They contribute significantly to the
   acidity of precipitation and cloud water, especially in remote regions.
   In this review, we consider the information presently available on
   concentration distribution of formic and acetic acids in multiple phases
   and their sources in different geographical locations, i.e., midlatitude
   continental, tropical continental and marine sites. Photochemical
   reactions (i.e., ozone-olefin reaction, isoprene oxidation, gas phase
   reaction of formaldehyde with HO(2), and aqueous phase oxidation of
   formaldehyde) are important sources of these acids. In midlatitude
   continental regions, possible sources of formic and acetic acids, in
   addition to photochemical reactive vehicular emission, are direct
   emission from vegetation and biomass burning. In tropical continental
   sites, direct emission from vehicles, ants, soil, vegetation, and
   biomass burning are the important source of these species. The probable
   sources at marine locations are photochemical reactions, biogenic
   emissions, and long-range transport from continental sites.},

Abstract = {Inferring phylogeographic patterns of macroalgal species is essential
   for understanding the population structure and for the conservation of
   macroalgal species. In this study, the phylogeographic patterns of two
   co-distributed macroalgal species along the coast of Korea and Japan,
   Pachymeniopsis lanceolata and Pachymeniopsis elliptica, were analyzed.
   Pachymeniopsis lanceolata (215 specimens from 36 sites) and P. elliptica
   (138 specimens from 24 sites), using the plastid rbcL gene, are
   characterized by fifteen and six haplotypes, respectively. Mitochondrial
   COI-5P gene sequences revealed a low variation for both species. An
   analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), pairwise F-ST comparisons, and
   haplotype networks based on the rbcL data suggest a weak genetic
   differentiation of both species. The shared haplotypes (P. lanceolata:
   LR01; P. elliptica: ER01) found in the entire sampling range indicate
   that these two Pachymeniopsis species can disperse over long distances
   along the coast of Korea and Japan. Despite the similar phylogeographic
   pattern, our results suggest that P. lanceolata has a higher genetic
   diversity, with a wider distribution along the Korean Peninsula than P.
   elliptica. Moreover, it is adapted to low sea surface temperatures and
   survived in more of the available habitats during periods of climatic
   change, whereas P. elliptica is less adaptable and more susceptible to
   environmental disturbance. This phylogeographic study provides a
   rationale for the conservation of the wild Pachymeniopsis population.},

Abstract = {Desalination is an extremely effective too] for converting seawater,
   brackish water or wastewater into fresh water for usage. However, a
   pre-treatment is necessary to ensure that feed water will not cause
   clogging problems and precipitation on the reverse osmosis membrane.
   Pre-treatment of seawater feeding reverse osmosis (RO) membranes is
   recognised as a key in designing desalination plants. This paper covers
   the experience of Veolia Water through several examples of desalination
   plants at main sites around the world. This paper shows that the
   pre-treatment process must to be adapted to the seawater quality to be
   treated and to ensure the best quality upstream of the membranes.
   Depending on several parameters which influence the choice of the
   pre-treatment like dissolved organic carbon, SDI, turbidity, algae
   content and their evolution during the seasons, temperature, etc., the
   pretreatment can comprise different technologies: conventional
   pre-treatment (ballasted sedimentation, air flotation, dual media
   filtration, mono media filtration, double stage filtration, etc.) or
   advanced technologies including membranes coupled with a conventional
   process. This paper presents the approach of Veolia Water Solutions \&
   Technologies for the desalination plants through the application of
   different technologies used for the brackish waters (groundwater and
   estuary), the seawaters (Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf)
   and the wastewater reuse. The examples presented in this paper
   demonstrate that maximum benefit is attained by the use of an adapted
   pre-treatment and the scientific approach developed by Veolia to
   minimize the fouling problems allows a good protection of the membranes
   and assures a long life time.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},

Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {Endolithic microbial communities are prominent features of intertidal
   marine habitats, where they colonize a variety of substrates,
   contributing to their erosion. Almost 2 centuries worth of naturalistic
   studies focused on a few true-boring (euendolithic) phototrophs, but
   substrate preference has received little attention. The Isla de Mona
   (Puerto Rico) intertidal zone offers a unique setting to investigate
   substrate specificity of endolithic communities since various phosphate
   rock, limestone and dolostone outcrops occur there. High-throughput 16S
   rDNA genetic sampling, enhanced by targeted cultivation, revealed that,
   while euendolithic cyanobacteria were dominant operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs), the communities were invariably of high diversity, well
   beyond that reported in traditional studies and implying an unexpected
   metabolic complexity potentially contributed by secondary colonizers.
   While the overall community composition did not show differences
   traceable to the nature of the mineral substrate, we detected
   specialization among particular euendolithic cyanobacterial clades
   towards the type of substrate they excavate but only at the OTU
   phylogenetic level, implying that close relatives have specialized
   recurrently into particular substrates. The cationic mineral component
   was determinant in this preference, suggesting the existence in nature
   of alternatives to the boring mechanism described in culture that is
   based exclusively on transcellular calcium transport.},

Abstract = {A model for scene simulation is presented, which describes
   quantitatively the recognized phenomenology of passive millimeter-wave
   (PMW) imaging in land, sea, and air scenarios. The model describes
   objects in a scene as facets giving them electromagnetic properties from
   their electrical permittivities. This enables polarimetric effects in
   scenes to be reproduced. Illumination from the sky and ground is
   calculated using radiation transport, as are the emissive and absorbing
   effects of the atmosphere between the objects and the imager. The model
   includes the effects of image sampling, diffraction effects of finite
   imager aperture sizes, and system noise. Phenomena in experimentally
   acquired images in the 94 GHz atmospheric transmission window are
   quantified from three scenarios. These are a helicopter landing site as
   viewed by the pilot, a coastal region showing boats, land and buildings
   viewed from sea level, and an airfield viewed from directly above. These
   are compared quantitatively to the simulated scenes from these
   scenarios, finding agreement between the radiation temperatures to
   within a few degrees kelvin. These discrepancies are accounted for by
   the uncertainties in the permittivities of materials in the scene. This
   paper constitutes the partial validation of a scene simulation
   capability for PMMW imaging in outdoor scenarios.},

Title = {Along-arc, inter-arc and arc-to-arc variations in volcanic gas CO2/S-T
   ratios reveal dual source of carbon in arc volcanism},
Journal = {EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {24-47},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Some 300-600 Tg of volatiles are globally vented each year by arc
   volcanism. Such arc gas emissions have contributed to past and
   present-day evolution of the Earth atmosphere and climate by recycling
   mineral-bound volatiles subducted along active slabs. Carbon dioxide
   (CO2) and total sulphur (S-T) are, after water, the major components of
   volcanic arc gases. Understanding their relative abundances (e.g., the
   CO2/S-T ratio) in arc volcanic gases is important to constrain origin
   and recycling efficiency of these volatiles along the subduction
   factory, and to better constrain the global arc volcanic CO2 flux. Here,
   we review currently available information on global variations of
   volcanic arc CO2/S-T gas ratios. We analyse a dataset of >2000 published
   volcanic arc gas measurements that comprise (i) low-temperature
   hydrothermal gas emissions, in which ST is dominated by hydrothermal
   hydrogen sulphide (H2S), and (ii) high temperature ``magmatic{''} gases
   rich in sulphur dioxide (SO2). We show that the global CO2/S-T
   population of hydrothermal gases is mainly controlled by S loss to
   hydrothermal fluids/rocks. We then select a subset of high-temperature
   (>= 450 degrees C) arc gases which, being less affected by S
   hydrothermal loss, can be used to infer the ``deep{''} source of
   volatiles. Using a subset of time-averaged high-T gas compositions for
   56 arc volcanoes, we identify sizeable along-arc and inter-arc
   variations in the ``magmatic{''} arc gas CO2/S-T ratio, which we ascribe
   to distinct volatile origins in the magma generation/storage zone. In
   the attempt to resolve the slab vs. crustal contributions to arc gas
   budgets, we explore the global association between volcanic gas CO2/S-T
   ratios and non-volatile (trace elements) tracers in arc magmas. For the
   first time in a global study, we find evidence for higher carbon output
   (CO2/S-T) in arcs where carbonate sediment subducts on the sea-floor.
   Indeed, most arc volcanoes exhibit gas vs. trace element relationships
   that are explained by addition of slab-sediment melts +/- fluids to the
   mantle wedge. We also identify a subset of CO2-rich arc volcanoes with
   unusually high CO2/S-T ratios (Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano Island,
   Popocatepetl, Soufriere of St Vincent, Bromo and Merapi), which we
   interpret as the product of magma-limestone interactions in the upper
   crust. Evidence for this process comes from carbonate xenoliths
   and/orcarbonate basement that characterise these volcanic systems.
   Although the mean global CO2/S-T ratio of arc gas (similar to 2.5)
   reflects a predominant source from subducted sediment,
   limestone-assimilation-derived C may account for a substantial (similar
   to 19-32\%) fraction of the present-day global arc budget, and may have
   contributed to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and warmer climate in
   Earth's past. Our global CO2/S-T vs. trace element association paves the
   way to identifying the gas signature of volcanoes (or arc segments) for
   which gas information is currently missing, and so improve our current
   global volcanic arc CO2 flux inventory. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The increasing maritime traffic, due to worldwide trade, tends to
   increase the risk of wrecks, collisions and contacts between ships,
   producing sinking with high economical costs, major environmental
   impacts and unfortunately the loss of lives. There is continuous news in
   the media reporting about these issues. Governments, captains, vessel
   traffic centers, harbors, safety and rescue forces need better tools to
   prevent accidents, increase safety and optimize operational costs. In
   this review, current key technologies used on ships and shore stations
   are displayed and it is shown how new smart technologies on vessels and
   the use of bigdata and analytic tools could improve the safety of the
   sailors. Unmanned/Remote Pilot Ships are going to be introduced, too and
   finally the Sailtracker project, the initial development of a smart ship
   solution to upload and share information to the cloud to be used by
   cognitive and analytic tools.},

Abstract = {The fault current level is different in grid connected and islanded
   microgrid fault cases for the same relay due to large integration of
   distributed energy resources in the latter. Therefore, protection
   systems must be adaptive and assisted with extensive communication
   networks to respond to the dynamic changes in the microgrid
   configurations. However, the microgrid must be protected even under the
   conditions of a cyber-attack which will render the communication link
   insecure or down. This paper proposes an adaptive protection scheme
   abiding by IEC 61850 communication standard for microgrids making them
   capable of riding-through communication failures by the aid of Electric
   Vehicle Parks. The control of the Electric Vehicle Park can identify a
   fault in the AC side based on direct measurements of frequency and
   voltage without the need for a communication signal. The most critical
   case is when the microgrid is islanded and the communication is down. In
   this case, the control will adjust the operation of the connected
   Electric Vehicles to inject a high current into the microgrid as
   demanded by the fault, allowing the relays to operate properly. The
   effectiveness of the proposed protection scheme is evaluated through
   detailed simulation. The results demonstrate the successful operation of
   the protective devices during the various modes of operation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to provide a better scientific basis for
   recommendations for the creation and management of grassland alternative
   feeding areas (AFAs); agricultural land managed specifically for brent
   geese (Branta bernicla bernicla). This is required if AFAs are to be
   used to help reduce damage levels due to goose grazing. The preferences
   of brent geese for four species of forage were measured over two
   winters, on experimental plots established in spring 1992 on coastal
   arable farmland in Chichester Harbour, UK, Counts of goose droppings (a
   good index of grazing pressure) over the following two winters confirmed
   that brent geese prefer white clover (Trifolium repens L.) to perennial
   ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) or timothy
   (Phleum pratense L.). No differences in preference between the grass
   species were apparent. The preference for clover plots over grass could
   be explained by higher biomass, percentage live matter, and protein, and
   shorter swards at the beginning of the winter. The preference for clover
   over grass persisted to the second winter when the sward height of plots
   did not differ significantly. The costs and benefits of growing clover
   are discussed within the framework of current farming practice. These
   results suggest that clover, rather than fertilised grass, may be a more
   effective cover crop on AFAs, including set-aside fields managed for
   migratory geese. The sward should be managed to encourage clover growth,
   which would probably involve frequent cutting but no fertiliser, Further
   research is needed on clover replenishment rate over the winter season
   and the possible benefits of clover leys to other wildlife. Crown

Title = {Energy benefits of green-wall shading based on novel-accurate
   apportionment of short-wave radiation components},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Pages = {1506-1518},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Climber green wall can alleviate urban heat island and conserve energy,
   mainly attributed to shading of solar irradiance by vegetation, yet the
   mechanism has remained poorly understood. The radiation properties of
   transmissivity, reflectivity and absorptivity, and thermal properties of
   the building envelope equipped with green wall, jointly govern radiation
   transfer processes. This field-experimental study monitored in-situ the
   radiation regime of a climber green wall on a windowed building envelope
   using high-precision radiometers. The northeast-oriented green wall in
   humid-subtropical Hong Kong has Lonicera japonica climbers, with 0.24
   leaf area index. Radiation properties and shading-induced energy savings
   were determined in summer and validated. An innovative radiation
   apportionment model (RAM) was developed to determine the short-wave
   transmissivity, reflectivity and absorptivity of the climber canopy
   which were respectively 0.382, 0.074 and 0.543 in sunny weather and
   0.449, 0.098 and 0.454 in cloudy weather. For further model development,
   the extinction coefficient (kappa) obtained from Beer's Law was
   estimated at 4.00 and 3.34 in respective weather conditions. According
   to RAM outputs, shading alone could shield against insolation up to 497
   W/m(2) behind the canopy and 356 W/m(2) in the indoor space. Taking the
   electricity tariff and the carbon intensity of electricity generation of
   a local power company, the average daily energy savings at 0.226
   kWh/m(2) were translated into monetary and carbon units, registering
   approximately USD0.03 and 0.062 kg CO2 respectively. The extrapolated
   seasonal savings from a total of six green walls installed at the
   experimental site could reach USD75.8 and 157.9 kg CO2.},

Title = {Effect of wake interaction on the response of two tandem oscillating
   hydrofoils},
Journal = {ENERGY SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {431-442},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this study, using a hydraulic system couples 2 hydrofoils and
   fulfills the fully flow-induced oscillating motion. Two hydrofoils have
   a tandem spatial configuration because in such arrangement allows the
   turbine to reach a higher efficiency. An iteration scheme is compiled to
   the solver to solve the coupling equations which are built based on the
   hydrofoil motions and hydrodynamic. Numerical investigations are carried
   out to analyze the response of 2 tandem oscillating hydrofoils. The
   objective of this study is to review the wake interactions between 2
   tandem hydrofoils rather than to pursue the maximum power efficiency. It
   is found that the heaving amplitude and energy extraction performance of
   the upstream hydrofoil are greater than that of downstream hydrofoil,
   because the downstream hydrofoil operates in the wake of upstream
   hydrofoil. For the fully flow-induced motion model presented in this
   study, both favorable and unfavorable strong wake vortices interactions
   are not observed, because the change in system response will weaken the
   strong wake interaction. Moreover, the difference between 2 hydrofoil
   responses does not necessarily decline with increasing inter-hydrofoil
   spacing.},

Title = {Antarctic emerald rockcod have the capacity to compensate for warming

Abstract = {Increases in atmospheric CO2 levels and associated ocean changes are
   expected to have dramatic impacts on marine ecosystems. Although the
   Southern Ocean is experiencing some of the fastest rates of change, few
   studies have explored how Antarctic fishes may be affected by
   co-occurring ocean changes, and even fewer have examined early life
   stages. To date, no studies have characterized potential trade-offs in
   physiology and behavior in response to projected multiple climate change
   stressors (ocean acidification and warming) on Antarctic fishes. We
   exposed juvenile emerald rockcod Trematomus bernacchii to three PCO2
   treatments (similar to 450, similar to 850, and similar to 1,200 atm
   PCO2) at two temperatures (-1 or 2 degrees C). After 2, 7, 14, and 28
   days, metrics of physiological performance including cardiorespiratory
   function (heart rate {[}f(H)] and ventilation rate {[}f(V)]), metabolic
   rate (MO2), and cellular enzyme activity were measured. Behavioral
   responses, including scototaxis, activity, exploration, and escape
   response were assessed after 7 and 14 days. Elevated PCO2 independently
   had little impact on either physiology or behavior in juvenile rockcod,
   whereas warming resulted in significant changes across acclimation time.
   After 14 days, f(H),f(V) and MO2 significantly increased with warming,
   but not with elevated PCO2. Increased physiological costs were
   accompanied by behavioral alterations including increased dark zone
   preference up to 14\%, reduced activity by 12\%, as well as reduced
   escape time suggesting potential trade-offs in energetics. After 28
   days, juvenile rockcod demonstrated a degree of temperature compensation
   as f(V), MO2, and cellular metabolism significantly decreased following
   the peak at 14 days; however, temperature compensation was only evident
   in the absence of elevated PCO2. Sustained increases in f(V) and MO2
   after 28 days exposure to elevated PCO2 indicate additive (f(V)) and
   synergistic (MO2) interactions occurred in combination with warming.
   Stressor-induced energetic trade-offs in physiology and behavior may be
   an important mechanism leading to vulnerability of Antarctic fishes to
   future ocean change.},

Abstract = {This study characterizes the turbulence in a 3.6 m s(-1) tidal channel
   in the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia that has been identified for
   development as a tidal power resource. A horizontally aimed
   fast-sampling single beam acoustic Doppler profiler was deployed on a
   subsurface buoy, and the flow-aligned profile is used to test the
   cross-spectral (Garbini 1982a,b) and the spatial structure function
   methods for estimating dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy.
   Second and third order structure functions computed over separation
   distances in the mean flow direction vary with spatial scale as
   predicted by the Kolmogorov hypotheses. Cross-spectra from adjacent
   spatial bins have a noise floor an order of magnitude lower than the
   corresponding auto-spectra and phase lags over increasing spatial ranges
   demonstrate the advection of coherent structures by the mean flow. The
   spectral and structure function estimates of dissipation rate vary

Title = {Impact of COVID-19 on energy use patterns and renewable energy
   development in Taiwan},
Journal = {ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has affected economic activities in the various
   sectors due to different levels of lockdown like border closure, stay at
   home, and social distancing. In this regard, energy use patterns are
   bound to change. The objective of this paper was to analyze the changes
   of energy supply and energy consumption in Taiwan through the official
   database due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020.
   In addition, some governmental measures were addressed in response to
   COVID-19 impacts on renewable energy development, especially in
   off-shore wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV). It was revealed that
   the results of the change analysis in energy supply and energy
   consumption were in line with those in the literature. The Taiwan's
   energy supply and energy consumption showed a decrease by 4.7\% and
   4.3\% on a year-on-year basis (YoY), respectively. More consistently,
   the petroleum consumption per capita indicated a decreasing trend at
   this period, but the electricity consumption per capita showed an upward
   increase over the Q1 of past decade (2010-2020). However, the
   electricity consumption slightly increased by 2.2\% mainly due to the
   increase of the electrical and electronic machinery industry in the
   industrial sector for the strong demand in overseas markets. In
   addition, the electricity consumption in the residential sector also
   increased by 5.1\% in response to the lockdown measures like
   stay-at-home learning and working. Apart from the epidemic prevention
   measures for assisting the off-shore power project constructions, some
   financial and economic relief measures have been taken to mitigate the
   COVID-19 impacts on the renewable energy (RE) development, especially in
   solar PV system.},

Abstract = {While an increase in saltwater intrusion into historically freshwater
   environments will undoubtedly affect ecosystem functioning, the
   resultant impacts on litter decay and hydrolytic enzyme activities
   remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the decay of shichito
   matgrass stem litter, the associated loss of total carbon (TC) and total
   nitrogen (TN), and the activity of litter- and sediment-associated
   hydrolytic enzymes in two subtropical tidal marshes (one brackish and
   one freshwater) in southeastern China. Results obtained after 202days of
   incubation revealed that there was no significant difference in litter
   mass loss between the brackish and freshwater marshes during both the
   standing phase (aerially decomposing litter) and the late phase of
   sediment-surface decomposition (slow decomposition of relatively
   refractory materials) (p>0.05). The loss of TC and TN from litter was
   most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the
   loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss
   61.63\%, TC released 50.55\%, and TN released 36.40\%) than in the
   freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28\%, TC released 46.31\%, and TN
   released 41.31\%). Moreover, we found significantly higher
   sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments
   during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with
   litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated
   decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh
   sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and
   tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous
   difference. Our findings provide insight into the potential consequences
   of modest saltwater intrusion; these may not alter the rates of litter
   decomposition, but could change the dominant pathway.},

Abstract = {The continuing decline of ocean fisheries and rise of global fish
   consumption has driven aquaculture growth by 10\% annually over the last
   decade. The association of fish farms with disease emergence in
   sympatric wild fish stocks remains one of the most controversial and
   unresolved threats aquaculture poses to coastal ecosystems and
   fisheries. We report a comprehensive analysis of the spread and impact
   of farm-origin parasites on the survival of wild fish populations. We
   mathematically coupled extensive data sets of native parasitic sea lice
   (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) transmission and pathogenicity on migratory
   wild juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta)
   salmon. Farm-origin lice induced 9-95\% mortality in several sympatric
   wild juvenile pink and chum salmon populations. The epizootics arise
   through a mechanism that is new to our understanding of emerging
   infectious diseases: fish farms undermine a functional role of host
   migration in protecting juvenile hosts from parasites associated with
   adult hosts. Although the migratory life cycles of Pacific salmon
   naturally separate adults from juveniles, fish farms provide L. salmonis
   novel access to juvenile hosts, in this case raising infection rates for
   at least the first approximate to 2.5 months of the salmon's marine life
   (approximate to 80 km of the migration route). Spatial segregation
   between juveniles and adults is common among temperate marine fishes,
   and as aquaculture continues its rapid growth, this disease mechanism
   may challenge the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and economies.},

Abstract = {Many ecosystem-based terms have been generated to promote more holistic
   approaches to the management of natural resources. Within Australia,
   despite the progress made toward applying these concepts to fisheries
   management, the multitude of terms has often caused stakeholder
   confusion. A national workshop concluded that ecologically sustainable
   development (ESD; known elsewhere as sustainable development) should be
   the overall goal for government and that the other terms discussed
   (ecosystem-based management, ecosystem-based fisheries management, etc.)
   described strategies that should be used by various agencies and
   industry sectors to work toward this goal. All ecosystem-based
   approaches can cover the direct and indirect environmental impacts,
   social and economic outcomes, and governance systems associated with an
   activity. The main difference among them is the scope of the regions and
   activities covered and therefore the breadth of issues to be managed. A
   hierarchy of ESD-related frameworks and tools, designed to operate at a
   number of levels (the individual fisher, local and multiregional
   management agencies), is described, and the elements needed for their
   implementation (correct scope, transparency, inclusiveness, measurable
   objectives) are discussed. These results from Australia should be
   directly relevant to the implementation of ecosystem-based approaches in
   other locations.},

Abstract = {During a 9-month study in outdoor (36 L plexiglass tanks) and laboratory
   (gradient table) cultivation systems, the green macroalga Ulva lactuca
   L, exhibited high biomass yields correlating with plant density,
   photosynthetic photon flux and temperature. During winter when the mean
   temperature of seawater was 12 degrees C, biomass increased weekly by an
   average of 87\% while yields in well water at about 18 degrees C
   averaged 600\% per week; biomass increment during spring averaged 215\%.
   Algae grown at 75\%, 50\% and 25\% of full sunlight during the spring
   had lower light compensation points, higher photosynthetic rates at low
   photosynthetic photon flux, and lower maximal rate of photosynthesis
   together with significantly higher level of chlorophyll a. Variations of
   net photosynthesis correlated with those of growth rate in outdoor
   cultivation tanks. The biomass yield for an initial stocking density of
   1.6 kg fw m(-2) was lower in early winter, similar in mid-winter and
   lower in spring than yields for an initial stocking density of 1.1 or
   0.5 kg fw m(-2). Morphological expression and thallus decay also
   appeared to be related to temperature, photosynthetic photon flux and
   plant density but did not affect biomass yield.},

Abstract = {Summer storms along the Antarctic Peninsula can cause microhabitats of
   the terrestrial midge Belgica antarctica to become periodically
   inundated with seawater from tidal spray. As microhabitats dry, larvae
   may be exposed to increasing concentrations of seawater. Alternatively,
   as a result of melting snow or following rain, larvae may be immersed in
   freshwater for extended periods. The present study assessed the
   tolerance and physiological response of B. antarctica larvae to salinity
   exposure, and examined the effect of seawater acclimation on their
   subsequent tolerance of freezing, dehydration and heat shock. Midge
   larvae tolerated extended exposure to hyperosmotic seawater; nearly 50\%
   of larvae survived a 10-day exposure to 1000mOsm kg(-1) seawater and
   similar to 25\% of larvae survived 6 days in 2000mOsm kg(-1) seawater.
   Exposure to seawater drastically reduced larval body water content and
   increased hemolymph osmolality. By contrast, immersion in freshwater did
   not affect water content or hemolymph osmolality. Hyperosmotic seawater
   exposure, and the accompanying osmotic dehydration, resulted in a
   significant correlation between the rate of oxygen consumption and
   larval water content and induced the de novo synthesis and accumulation
   of several organic osmolytes. A 3-day exposure of larvae to hyperosmotic
   seawater increased freezing tolerance relative to freshwater-acclimated
   larvae. Even after rehydration, the freezing survival of larvae
   acclimated to seawater was greater than freshwater-acclimated larvae.
   Additionally, seawater exposure increased the subsequent tolerance of
   larvae to dehydration. Our results further illustrate the similarities
   between these related, yet distinct, forms of osmotic stress and add to
   the suite of physiological responses used by larvae to enhance survival
   in the harsh and unpredictable Antarctic environment.},

Title = {Deadlock opportunism in contesting conservation areas in Indonesia},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {77},
Pages = {412-424},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Conservation areas are designated to protect biodiversity and resources
   by limiting anthropogenic stressors. In Indonesia, conservation areas
   account for almost 23 percent of the state forest with extremely limited
   allowable uses. Previous policy interventions to support community and
   traditional uses have never been very successful due to the deep roots
   of bureaucratic politics originally defined to safeguard biodiversity.
   This deadlock created by the two major laws governing forestry and
   conservation areas has been broken with recent permits for geothermal
   projects in conservation areas. The rationale is to provide an
   environmental service (renewable energy) and to address global concerns
   for climate mitigation. This paper examines how the deadlock is broken
   at least temporarily for geothermal development and maintained for
   social forestry. Arguments and findings presented in this paper are
   drawn from content analysis, interviews, and long-term engagement among
   the authors observing operationalization of conservation policies in
   Indonesia, both in Java and outer islands. We propose the operational
   framework of deadlock opportunism as a way to highlight the processes of
   breaking a deadlock by legitimizing particular interests (geothermal
   development) through green and populist narratives, while hollowing out
   claims of other interests (social forestry). Although anticipation of
   breaking the deadlock through geothermal development has encouraged
   numerous policies and programs developed for social forestry, we argue
   these developments actually camouflage the underlying legitimacy of
   communities and keep them from accessing lands within conservation
   areas. We believe the concept of deadlock opportunism and the
   operational framework can provide new insights for understanding
   progress (or lack thereof) of certain policies in their lifecycles in
   other parts of the world.},

Title = {The Magnetic Mechanism for Hotspot Reversals in Hot Jupiter Atmospheres},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {922},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Magnetically driven hotspot variations (which are tied to atmospheric
   wind variations) in hot Jupiters are studied using nonlinear numerical
   simulations of a shallow-water magnetohydrodynamic (SWMHD) system and a
   linear analysis of equatorial SWMHD waves. In hydrodynamic models,
   mid-to-high-latitude geostrophic circulations are known to cause a net
   west-to-east equatorial thermal energy transfer, which drives hotspot
   offsets eastward. We find that a strong toroidal magnetic field can
   obstruct these energy transporting circulations. This results in winds
   aligning with the magnetic field and generates westward Lorentz force
   accelerations in hotspot regions, ultimately causing westward hotspot
   offsets. In the subsequent linear analysis we find that this reversal
   mechanism has an equatorial wave analogy in terms of the planetary-scale
   equatorial magneto-Rossby waves. We compare our findings to
   three-dimensional MHD simulations, both quantitatively and
   qualitatively, identifying the link between the mechanics of
   magnetically driven hotspot and wind reversals. We use the developed
   theory to identify physically motivated reversal criteria, which can be
   used to place constraints on the magnetic fields of ultra-hot Jupiters
   with observed westward hotspots.},

Abstract = {The Increasing demand of clean energy has evoked huge interest in
   microgrid that uses renewable energy sources like solar, wind, fuel cell
   and control of microgrid components such as inverters. The neutral point
   clamped multilevel inverters have gained prominence due to its
   substantial advantage of power quality in islanded mode and coupling at
   a common point of main grid in grid connected. The islanded operation of
   microgrid necessitates frequency and voltage regulation based on the
   filter inductance current and capacitor voltage. The paper investigates
   the droop based decoupling control of neutral point clamped 3-level
   inverter in islanded mode of operation of microgrid. The control
   strategy is carried out in rotating reference frame. The set reference
   for the control strategy is generated by regulation of real and reactive
   power. The proposed control strategy is accomplished in Matlab Simulink
   environment and results were analyzed.},

Abstract = {The authors studied the seismic behavior of the ground at Kobe Port

   focused on the seismic behavior of the alluvial clay layer and conducted
   cyclic simple shear tests using the stress wave inferred from array
   records. The specimen used in this study was the clay sampled in Rokko
   Island near Kobe Port Island. The clay was from the same clay layer that
   was at Kobe Port Island, but it was not as consolidated as the clap at
   Kobe Port Island. After consolidation with several confining pressure
   levels, we conducted a dynamic simple shear test under the same stress
   rates as the actual earthquake. We compared the shear strain time
   histories inferred from array records with those from simple shear test.
   The strain time history obtained from simple shear test gave good
   comparison to that obtained from array records.},

Abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a rapidly spreading
   pandemic and is severely threatening public health globally. The
   human-to-human transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is now well established.
   The reported clinical observations and symptoms of this infection in
   humans appear in the range between being asymptomatic and severe
   pneumonia. The virus can be transmitted through aerosols and droplets
   that are released into the air by a carrier, especially when the person
   coughs, sneezes, or talks forcefully in a closed environment. As the
   disease progresses, the use and handling of contaminated personal
   protective equipment and facemasks have become major issues with
   significant environmental risks. Therefore, providing an effective
   method for treating used/contaminated facemasks is crucial. In this
   paper, we review the environmental challenges and risks associated with
   the surge in facemask production. We also discuss facemasks and their
   materials as sources of microplastics and how disposal procedures can
   potentially lead to the contamination of water resources. We herein
   review the potential of developing nanomaterial-based antiviral and
   self-cleaning facemasks. This review discusses these challenges and
   concludes that the use of sustainable and alternative facemask materials
   is a promising and viable solution. In this context, it has become
   essential to address the emerging challenges by developing a new class
   of facemasks that are effective against the virus, while being
   biodegradable and sustainable. This paper represents the potentials of
   natural and/or biodegradable polymers for manufacturing facemasks, such
   as wood-based polymers, chitosan, and other biodegradable synthetic
   polymers for achieving sustainability goals during and after pandemics.},

Title = {2022: An Unprecedentedly Rainy Early Summer in Northeast China},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the early summer (June) of 2022, the spatial mean precipitation in
   northeast China (NEC) was 62\% higher than normal and broke the
   historical record since 1951. Based on the precipitation data of 245
   meteorological stations in NEC and the National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research
   (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis, this paper analyzes the role of large-scale
   circulation and sea-surface temperature (SST) associated with anomalous
   precipitation over NEC in June using singular value decomposition (SVD),
   correlation analysis, regression analysis, and composite analysis
   methods, and further investigates the possible cause of the abnormal
   precipitation in June 2022. Results show that the northeast China cold
   vortex (NCCV) accompanying the blocking high in the Okhotsk Sea (BHOS)
   has been the primary mid-to-high latitude atmospheric circulation
   pattern affecting NEC precipitation in June since 2001. This circulation
   pattern is closely related to the tripole SST pattern over the North
   Atlantic (NAT) in March. In June 2022, the NAT SST anomaly in March
   stimulates eastward-propagating wave energy, resulting in the downstream
   anomalous circulation pattern in which the NCCV cooperates with the BHOS
   in the mid-high latitudes of East Asia. Under this background
   atmospheric circulation favorable for precipitation, the Kuroshio region
   SST anomaly in June led to a more northward and stronger anomalous
   anticyclone in the northwestern Pacific through local air-sea
   interaction, which provides more sufficient water vapor for NEC,
   resulting in unprecedented precipitation in June 2022.},

Pages = {155-158},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Lake Bonneville, the largest late Pleistocene closed-basin lake in the
   North American Great Basin, fluctuated widely in response to changes in
   climate, The geochemistry and mineralogy of endogenic calcium carbonate
   deposited in deep water, and stratigraphic studies of shore-zone
   deposits, provide evidence of millennial-scale lake-level fluctuations
   that had amplitudes of about 50 m between 30 and 10 ka, Falling-lake
   events occurred at 21, 18.5-19, 17.5, 16-15.5, 14-13, and 10 ka
   (radiocarbon gears) synchronously with the terminations of Heinrich
   events H1 and H2 and other smaller scale iceberg-rafting events (a, b,
   c, and Younger Dryas) in the North Atlantic Ocean, The Lake Bonneville
   results thus support other climate records that suggest that late
   Pleistocene millennial-scale climate change was global in extent. The
   size and shape of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which determined
   the mean positions of storm tracks, may have been the primary control on
   late Pleistocene water budgets of Great Basin lakes.},

Title = {Contrasting impacts of environmental variability on the breeding biology
   of two sympatric small procellariiform seabirds in south-eastern
   Australia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Seabirds play a vital role in marine ecosystems and the long-term study
   of their responses to environmental variations can be used to monitor
   the effects of climate change on marine fauna. However, slight
   differences in similar seabird species result in a range of responses
   which complicates our understanding of the effects of environmental
   changes to marine ecosystems. The present study investigated
   inter-annual differences in the breeding biology (breeding phenology,
   chick growth rates and breeding success) and environmental conditions
   (seasonal sea surface temperatures) of important foraging areas in two
   sympatric small Procellariiform species, the fairy prion (Pachyptila
   turtur) and the common diving petrel (Pelecanoides urinatrix), over four
   reproductive seasons (2017-2020) in Bass Strait, south-eastern
   Australia. Marine heatwaves occurred during the years of 2018/19 and
   2019/20 and coincided with years of delayed laying dates, slower chick
   growth and reduced breeding success, in both species. While fairy prions
   maintained a relatively high breeding success and broadly constant
   breeding phenology, common diving petrels delayed the start of the
   breeding season by up to 50 days and experienced dramatic collapses in
   breeding success in years of high marine heat wave occurrence. The
   difference in foraging ecology and physiological capacity (largely in
   the production of stomach oils and fasting abilities of adults and
   chicks) between both species are likely to influence the variability and
   phenology in the observed breeding seasons.},

Title = {Properties of the Energy Transport for Plane-Parallel Polychromatic
   Surface Gravity Waves in Waters of Arbitrary Depth},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {408-416},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is well known that the energy transport of ocean waves propagates
   with the group velocity and that the energy decreases exponentially with
   depth. Expanding this theory, we will derive expressions for the energy
   transport as a function of depth and the total instantaneous transport's
   development over time for waves in waters of finite depth. Solutions to
   the Laplace equation are found for plane-parallel polychromatic waves
   with linearized boundary conditions. A time series of wave elevation
   collected at Uppsala University's wave energy research test site is
   chosen to present the results. Solutions for waters of both infinite and
   arbitrary depths are presented and compared. The solutions are
   convolution-type integrals with the wave elevation where we have found
   efficient ways to calculate the kernels. The difference in group
   velocity between finite depth and infinite depth and its impact on the
   energy transport is clearly seen in the results. The use of the
   deep-water approximation gives a too low energy transport in the time
   averaged as well as in the total instantaneous energy transport. We
   further show that the total instantaneous energy transport can actually
   have a direction that is opposite to the direction of the waves as
   observed from a reference frame fixed to the seabed.},

Title = {Seasonal carbon allocation to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi assessed by

Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {368},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {547-555},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background and Aim Climate change models are limited by lack of baseline
   data, in particular carbon (C) allocation to - and dynamics within -
   soil microbial communities. We quantified seasonal C-assimilation and
   allocation by plants, and assessed how well this corresponds with
   intraradical arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) storage and structural
   lipids (16: 1 omega 5 NLFA and PLFA, respectively), as well as
   microscopic assessments of AMF root colonization.
   Methods Coastal Hypochoeris radicata plants were labeled with (CO2)-C-13
   in February, July and October, and C-13-allocation to fine roots and
   NLFA 16: 1 omega 5, as well as overall lipid contents and AM
   colonization were quantified.
   Results C-allocation to fine roots and AMF storage lipids differed
   seasonally and mirrored plant C-assimilation, whereas AMF structural
   lipids and AM colonization showed no seasonal variation, and root
   colonization exceeded 80 \% throughout the year. Molecular analyzes of
   the large subunit rDNA gene indicated no seasonal AMF community shifts.
   Conclusions Plants allocated C to AMF even at temperatures close to
   freezing, and fungal structures persisted in roots during times of low
   C-allocation. The lack of seasonal differences in PLFA and AM
   colonization indicates that NLFA analyses should be used to estimate
   fungal C-status. The implication of our findings for AM function is
   discussed.},

Title = {Enhancement of the survival probability of a photovoltaic converter-An
   optimization approach},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {115-128},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Maximizing the return on investment of a photovoltaic array requires a
   power electronics converter with the longest possible operational life.
   This paper is aimed at presenting a heatsink optimization approach to
   enhance the survival probability of a high-efficiency 1 kW DC/DC
   converter, specifically designed for PV applications. A main feature of
   the enhancement is that it takes into account the meteorological
   characteristics of the intended installation site: a coastal area with
   high humidity and cloudiness throughout the year.
   As a first step, the converter reliability is estimated according to the
   FIDES procedure, yielding a mean time between failures MTBF = 98.15 FIT.
   The numerical results pinpoint the diodes as the most failure-prone
   components, and temperature as the dominant stressor, clearly suggesting
   that the performance can be improved by resorting to better heatsinks.
   As a second step, a heatsink optimization problem is established,
   involving three objective functions: minimization of heatsink thermal
   resistance and weight, and maximization of the cooling system
   performance index, The problem is solved using a genetic algorithm,
   which yields MTBF = 74.09 FIT. The approach takes advantage of the
   computer tools currently available: mathematical toolboxes to implement
   the optimization algorithm, user-friendly reliability prediction
   software, and software packages capable of simulating the thermal
   behavior of heatsinks with good accuracy.},

Title = {The Native Oyster Restoration Alliance (NORA) and the Berlin Oyster
   Recommendation: bringing back a key ecosystem engineer by developing and
   supporting best practice in Europe},
Journal = {AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Efforts to restore the native oyster Ostrea edulis and its associated
   habitats are gaining momentum across Europe. Several projects are
   currently running or being planned. To maximize the success of these, it
   is crucial to draw on existing knowledge and experience in order to
   design, plan and implement restoration activities in a sustainable and
   constructive approach. For the development of best practice
   recommendations and to promote multidimensional knowledge and technology
   exchange, the Native Oyster Restoration Alliance (NORA) was formed by
   partners from science, technology, nature conservation, consultancies,
   commercial producers and policy-makers. The NORA network will enhance
   scientific and practical progress in flat oyster restoration, such as in
   project planning and permitting, seed oyster production, disease
   management and monitoring. It also focuses on joint funding
   opportunities and the potential development of national and
   international regulatory frameworks. The main motivation behind NORA is
   to facilitate the restoration of native oyster habitat within its
   historic biogeographic range in the North Sea and other European seas
   along with the associated ecosystem services; services such as enhancing
   biodiversity, including enhanced fish stocks, nutrient cycling and
   sediment stabilization. NORA members agreed on a set of joint
   recommendations and strongly advise that any restoration measure should
   respect and apply these recommendations: The Berlin Oyster
   Recommendation is presented here. It will help guide the development of
   the field by developing and applying best practice accordingly. NORA
   also aims to combine the outreach activities of local projects for
   improved community support and awareness and to provide educational
   material to increase knowledge of the key ecological role of this
   species and increase awareness among regulators, permit providers and
   stakeholders. A synthesis of O. edulis restoration efforts in Europe is
   provided and underlines the general significance in the field.},

Abstract = {The saline wetlands of the Monegros Desert, in the central Ebro Basin
   (NE Spain), host valuable biodiversity and pedodiversity. A part of this
   area has been proposed for inclusion in the European Union Natura 2000
   network. However, agricultural intensification is changing the area as
   more land is consolidated for new irrigation or is plowed to earn CAP
   (Common Agricultural Policy) subsidies. Soil mapping is needed to assist
   in the delimitation of natural habitats and to make conservation
   compatible with agriculture. The methodology presented here to
   characterize agri-environmental areas takes into account current
   agricultural and environmental practices. We examined the opinions of
   farmers and agricultural and environmental officers concerning a new
   agri-environmental measure, which could be proposed for inclusion in the
   Rural Development section of the CAP. The measure would save agriculture
   inputs in unproductive areas and also comply with nature conservation
   objectives. A GIS database was built for selecting the farming plots
   suitable for new agricultural practices favoring biodiversity and
   pedodiversity. At the local scale, we used remote sensing and
   pedodiversity criteria for selecting low production areas to be
   prospected. The opinion poll resulted in a positive response and
   confirmed the interest of farmers in having detailed maps of those soil
   features that limit crop production. The soil survey reveals soil
   salinity, and high contents of gypsum and calcium carbonate, as
   significant features to map low production areas for making agriculture
   compatible with habitat conservation.},

Title = {Analysis of the Optical Response of Opaque Urban Envelope Materials: The
   Case of Madrid},
Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The optical response of opaque materials in an urban envelope plays an
   important role in a city's energy exchange with the environment as it
   defines the absorption of radiation and emission of heat. In the present
   work, the most common surfaces of the finishing materials of pavement
   and walls in the city of Madrid (Spain) were identified, and their
   reflectance was measured in situ to determine their solar absorptance
   and color coordinates. Most of the selected pavement showed a relatively
   high solar absorptance in the range of 0.87 to 0.60, while in vertical
   surfaces, the range was 0.85 to 0.29. The variations of the color
   coordinates obtained for pavement were 27.1, 11.4, and 6.7 for Delta
   L{*}, Delta a{*}, and Delta b{*}, respectively. Significantly higher
   values were obtained in the case of vertical surfaces (47.5, 20.5, and
   23.6, respectively). The results were included into a database intended
   to be the seed for a catalogue of the experimental thermo-optical
   properties of opaque envelope materials in Madrid. The catalogue will be
   useful for the analysis of the stimuli generated by the urban
   environment for citizens and for achieving more reliable results from
   energy simulation tools in the search for strategies to improve urban
   comfort and sustainability.},

Title = {Sustainable Urban Regeneration through Densification Strategies: The
   Kallithea District in Athens as a Pilot Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The current main issue in the construction sector in Europe concerns the
   energy refurbishment and the reactivation of investments in existing
   buildings. Guidance for enhancing energy efficiency and encouraging
   member states to create a market for deep renovation is provided by a
   number of European policies. Innovative methods and strategies are
   required to attract and involve citizens and main stakeholders to
   undertake buildings' renovation processes, which actually account for
   just 1\% of the total building stock. This contribution proposes
   technical and financial solutions for the promotion of energy efficient,
   safe, and attractive retrofit interventions based on the creation of
   volumetric additions combined with renewable energy sources. This paper
   focuses on the urban reality of Athens as being an important example of
   a degraded urban center with a heavy heat island, a quite important
   heating demand, and a strong seismic vulnerability. The design solutions
   presented here demonstrate that the strategy of additions, because of
   the consequent increased value of the buildings, could represent an
   effective densification policy for the renovation of existing urban
   settings. Hence, the aim is to trigger regulatory and market reforms
   with the aim to boost the revolution towards nearly zero energy
   buildings for the existing building stocks.},

Abstract = {A great deal of progress has been made in recent years to investigate
   the chemical characteristics of beachrocks. Beachrocks found in
   Krakal-Sadranan Beach (Yogyakarta, Indonesia) are spread locally,
   parallel to the coastline with a breadth of about 10-30 m(2). In this
   research, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drone mapping, geological
   analysis, direct current resistivity survey, and surface seismic surveys
   were conducted to detect the underground structure of the beachrocks and
   to emphasize the coastal mapping based on targeted beachrocks. The
   correlation was developed between the sections and the data on the study
   site. Toward survey validation, laboratory tests were conducted on the
   beachrock samples collected from the study site to identify its
   properties. The evolution of the coastal zone based on beachrocks study
   is highly affected by relative sea-level changes that were described in
   the 3D model of beachrocks. The coastal changes are significantly impact
   the natural and cultural resources, and the understanding of coastal
   evolution is important for the preservation, development, and management
   of the coastal zone. This paper focused on the cementation processes and
   mechanism of beachrocks as a natural wave barrier in a tropical area,
   which is also appropriate for advanced marine ecosystems study including
   shorelines microbiotas.},

Title = {Impact of climate change on tropospheric ozone and its global budgets},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {369-387},
Abstract = {We present the chemistry-climate model UM\_CAM in which a relatively
   detailed tropospheric chemical module has been incorporated into the UK
   Met Office's Unified Model version 4.5. We obtain good agreements
   between the modelled ozone/nitrogen species and a range of observations
   including surface ozone measurements, ozone sonde data, and some
   aircraft campaigns.
   Four 2100 calculations assess model responses to projected changes of
   anthropogenic emissions (SRES A2), climate change (due to doubling CO2),
   and idealised climate change-associated changes in biogenic emissions
   (i.e. 50\% increase of isoprene emission and doubling emissions of
   soil-NOx). The global tropospheric ozone burden increases significantly
   for all the 2100 A2 simulations, with the largest response caused by the
   increase of anthropogenic emissions. Climate change has diverse impacts
   on O-3 and its budgets through changes in circulation and meteorological
   variables. Increased water vapour causes a substantial ozone reduction
   especially in the tropical lower troposphere (>10 ppbv reduction over
   the tropical ocean). On the other hand, an enhanced
   stratosphere-troposphere exchange of ozone, which increases by 80\% due
   to doubling CO2, contributes to ozone increases in the extratropical
   free troposphere which subsequently propagate to the surface. Projected
   higher temperatures favour ozone chemical production and PAN
   decomposition which lead to high surface ozone levels in certain
   regions. Enhanced convection transports ozone precursors more rapidly
   out of the boundary layer resulting in an increase of ozone production
   in the free troposphere. Lightning-produced NOx increases by about 22\%
   in the doubled CO2 climate and contributes to ozone production.
   The response to the increase of isoprene emissions shows that the change
   of ozone is largely determined by background NOx levels: high NOx
   environment increases ozone production; isoprene emitting regions with
   low NOx levels see local ozone decreases, and increase of ozone levels
   in the remote region due to the influence of PAN chemistry. The
   calculated ozone changes in response to a 50\% increase of isoprene
   emissions are in the range of between -8 ppbv to 6 ppbv. Doubling
   soil-NOx emissions will increase tropospheric ozone considerably, with
   up to 5 ppbv in source regions.},

Title = {Measuring the SCCs of different Chinese regions under future scenarios},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {130},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The assessment of the social cost of carbon (SCC) is an important basis
   for formulating regional differentiated climate policies. This paper
   attempts to assess future SCC for eight Chinese regions by using the
   regional integrated model of climate and the economy (the RICE model),
   based on four scenarios, namely baseline (BS), carbon emissions trading
   (CET), carbon quotas (CQ), and carbon tax (CT) for the period 2005-2050.
   The results show that under the BS, CET, and CT scenarios, the SCC of
   China's eight regions increases by \$22.26/t C, \$20.58/t C, and
   \$19.14/t C, respectively, from 2005 to 2050. The CT scenario performed
   best in terms of impact on CEs and SCC, but in order to do so they will
   have to bear certain economic losses. There are differences between the
   SCC of the eight Chinese regions under different scenarios. Under the
   BS, CET, and CT scenarios, the areas where SCC is highest are
   distributed in the Central, North Coast, and Southwest regions, and in
   the CQ scenario, the high-SCC areas are concentrated in the Southwest,
   North Coast, and Northeast regions. The low-SCC areas are distributed in
   the Beijing-Tianjin and South Coast regions under all four scenarios.
   The central and western regions will become the major energy consuming
   regions after 2025, so they will face a greater pressure than other
   regions to reduce emissions.},

Abstract = {In January and February 2010, heavy sea ice formed along the coast of
   the Bohai Sea and the northern Yellow Sea, China. Intertidal organisms
   were subjected to serious freezing stress. In this study, we
   investigated the freezing tolerance of the upper intertidal economic
   seaweed Porphyra yezoensis. The maximum photochemical efficiency of PS
   II (F (v)/F (m)) in undehydrated thalli remained high after 24 h at -2A
   degrees C and that in dehydrated thalli decreased in a proportion to
   thallial water loss. F (v)/F (m) dropped sharply after 24 h at -20A
   degrees C, regardless of absolute cellular water content (AWC). The F
   (v)/F (m) in frozen thalli recovered rapidly at 0-20A degrees C. A wide
   range of water loss in the thalli enhanced their tolerance to freezing.
   F (v)/F (m) values in undehydrated thalli dropped sharply after 3 d at
   -2A degrees C or 10 d at -20A degrees C while those in dehydrated thalli
   (20-53\% AWCs) remained at high levels after 9 d at -2A degrees C or 30
   d at -20A degrees C. These results indicate that P. yezoensis has high
   freezing tolerance by means of dehydration during the ebb tide and rapid
   recovery of F (v)/F (m) from freezing. A strategy of P. yezoensis
   industry to avoid heavy loss during freezing season is discussed based
   on these findings.},

Abstract = {Pelagic Sargassum macroalgae entrained in the Gulf Stream serves as
   habitat for commercially and recreationally important fish and protected
   sea turtles, among other organisms. It also plays an important role in
   the sourcing of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to the otherwise
   deficient oligotrophic pelagic waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
   Sargassum is seasonally concentrated along the western wall of the Gulf
   Stream off the coast of North Carolina. The Gulf Stream is a fast and
   constant western boundary current that consistently comes in close
   proximity to land off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. This
   area is thus an area of interest for harnessing Gulf Stream energy.
   Gulf Stream turbines will likely be far removed from the surface of the
   water, and thus, the buoyant Sargassum that floats there. Nonetheless,
   the functional roles of Sargassum and its epibionts, including primary
   production and nutrient cycling, may be either negatively or positively
   influenced by Gulf Stream turbine wake.
   Our research, conducted in mesocosms, examined how an increase in
   turbulence affected the primary production and nitrogen fixation by
   Sargassum macroalgae and its associated epibiotic communities.},

Title = {Impact of shipping emissions on ozone levels over Europe: assessing the
   relative importance of the Standard Nomenclature for Air Pollution

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {17},
Pages = {14903-14909},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The impact of shipping emissions on ozone mixing ratio over Europe is
   assessed for July 2006 using the Community Multiscale Air Quality
   modeling system and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific
   Research anthropogenic emission inventory. Results suggest that
   ship-induced ozone contribution to the total surface ozone exceeds 5\%
   over the sea and near the coastline, while an increase up to 5\% is
   simulated over a large portion of the European land. The largest impact
   (i.e., an increase up to 30\%) is simulated over the Mediterranean Sea.
   In addition, shipping emissions are simulated to increase NO2 mixing
   ratio more than 90\%, locally, and to modify the oxidizing capacity of
   the atmosphere through hydroxyl radical formation (increase by 20-60\%
   over the sea along the European coasts and near the coastal zone).
   Therefore, emissions from ships may counteract the benefits derived from
   the anthropogenic emissions reduction strategies over the continent.
   Simulations suggest regions where shipping emissions have a major impact
   on ozone mixing ratio compared to individual anthropogenic emission
   sector categories. Shipping emissions are estimated to play an important
   role on ozone levels compared to road transport sector near the coastal
   zone. The impact of shipping emissions on ozone formation is also
   profound over a great part of the European land compared to the rest of
   anthropogenic emission categories.},

Title = {A finite volume dynamic large-eddy simulation method for buoyancy driven
   turbulent geophysical flows},
Journal = {OCEAN MODELLING},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {199-218},
Abstract = {A large-eddy simulation method based upon the finite volume approach is
   developed and evaluated for buoyancy driven turbulence in the absence of
   rotational effects. The effect of the sub-grid scale motions is modelled
   by using the dynamic scaling formulation, without introducing any ad hoc
   assumption for the vertical stratification. This way, the eddy
   coefficients for momentum and temperature equations are independently
   computed, while avoiding to introduce unjustified buoyancy production
   terms in the constitutive equations. As a result, the computational cost
   is considerably reduced with respect to the classical stratification
   formulation. The method is presented in detail, by stressing the
   particular features of the finite volume large-eddy simulation approach.
   The resulting numerical code is validated against a direct numerical
   simulation. Numerical experiments are conducted by simulating the
   thermal buoyancy driven turbulence near the water surface generated in a
   finite-depth stably stratified horizontal layer with an isothermal
   bottom surface. Diagnostics include time evolution of kinetic and
   thermal energy as well as energy spectral distribution. Interesting
   results are obtained by making a comparison with a reference spectral
   solution. The method is further validated for a turbulent ocean test
   case, that is the deepening of the mixed layer in a stable stratified
   fluid. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Strengthened multi-stakeholder linkages in valuation studies is critical
   for improved decision making outcomes for valuable mangroves - The
   Malaysian case study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests in Southeast Asia are continuously declining as a
   result of unsustainable practices, partly due to limited recognition of
   the value of mangrove services in land use decision making. Valuation
   practitioners have assumed that monetary valuation should inform local
   and national decision makers to ensure sustainable management of
   mangrove resources. For ecosystem service valuation to be of use to
   decision makers, best practices should be adhered to such as having
   straightforward policy questions and strong stakeholder engagement from
   the onset of valuation studies, suitable choice of valuation
   methodologies, and the ability to effectively demonstrate causal links
   between drivers of ecosystem health, change, and resource users. This
   study, focusing on the Malaysian case study, assessed the effectiveness
   and challenges of local ecosystem service valuation studies in informing
   mangrove management decisions against a set of global best practices. A
   systematic review approach was undertaken to identify relevant Malaysian
   mangrove ecosystem service valuation studies. Of 184 studies identified,
   only 17 provided monetary values for mangrove ecosystem services. These
   studies valued nine different mangrove ecosystem services, with the
   cultural ecosystem services of tourism being the most frequently valued.
   Most of the valuation studies were designed to raise awareness of the
   value of ecosystems (64.7\%). Other intended uses included determining
   appropriate charging rates for mangrove uses (17.6\%), comparing the
   costs and benefits of different environmental uses (11.8\%), and
   providing a justification and support for certain decision making
   (5.9\%). Overall, mangrove valuation studies in Malaysia were
   characterized by weak multi-stakeholder engagement, non-standardized
   valuation units across the whole country, limited dissemination of the
   valuation outcome, and cursory references to the potential use of
   mangrove ecosystem services. Most of the studies did not exert apparent
   influence on mangrove management. Future valuation studies in Malaysia
   and the Southeast Asian region should aim to build more robust
   engagement between valuation practitioners and key stakeholder groups,
   especially decision makers, at all stages of the study process and
   incorporate a clear dissemination strategy for sharing results.},

Abstract = {The increase of demand and the depletion of energy resources have led to
   a rising demand of renewable energy. Among them, wind turbine has been
   researched because of wide generality with high resource potential.
   Despite these advantages, onshore wind turbine has a spatial constraint.
   To solve these problems, offshore wind turbine has been researched and
   the installation area of onshore structures has been expanded to
   offshore field. The design of the substructure is one of the most
   important issues in case of motion characteristics in the ocean rather
   than on the coast. Tri-pod type is attracting attention because it is
   easy to manufacture and efficient to reduce environmental load. However,
   the motion characteristics of these types of structures have not been
   clarified yet and are currently studied. In order to improve the float
   performance, it is necessary to apply the optimal float design such as
   size, weight, water plane area, and mooring to each design. In this
   study, we have described tri-pod type model and evaluated the model test
   to find the effects of the ratio of the diameter to draft in dynamic
   motions of the structures on the basis of the floating column design.
   Since each design variables are determined, experimental RAO results
   have analysed through motion analysis of 6 degrees of freedom.},

Abstract = {Designing and manufacturing a combined system that utilizes the thermal
   energy of coolant and exhaust gases from Internal Combustion Engines
   (ICE) to distill fresh water from seawater on Vietnamese offshore
   fishing vessels is an education ministry-level project that the research
   team is working on. Utilizing this heat sources not only improve heat
   efficiency, but also provide fresh water on equipped vehicles. The
   experimental process shows that, the heat energy emission changes
   consecutively according to the ICE modes, directly affects the
   performance of the heat recovery equipment as well as the performance of
   the system. The content of this paper will present the process of
   designing a waste heat recovery tube by assessing the effect of heat
   exchanger structure in exhaust heat recovery equipment to the heat
   transfer efficiency between exhaust gases and sea water. The studies
   were conducted on Ansys Fluent software, in which the input data was
   determined from experimental data. The research results depict that the
   exhaust heat recovery efficiency is highly dependent on the heat
   exchanger fins structure. With a reasonable format, the heat recovery
   efficiency can reach up to 40\% in most engine operating modes which
   lead to an improvement of approximately 12\% of the total input energy.},

Title = {Modulation of lipid biosynthesis by stress in diatoms},
Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {372},
Number = {1728},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Diatoms are responsible for up to 40\% of the carbon fixation in our
   oceans. The fixed carbon is moved through carbon metabolism towards the
   synthesis of organic molecules that are consumed through interlocking
   foodwebs, and this process is strongly impacted by the abiotic
   environment. However, it has become evident that diatoms can be used as
   `platform' organisms for the production of high valuable bio-products
   such as lipids, pigments and carbohydrates where stress conditions can
   be used to direct carbon metabolism towards the commercial production of
   these compounds. In the first section of this review, some aspects of
   carbon metabolism in diatoms and how it is impacted by environmental
   factors are briefly described. The second section is focused on the
   biosynthesis of lipids and in particular omega-3 long-chain
   polyunsaturated fatty acids and how low temperature stress impacts on
   the production of these compounds. In a third section, we review the
   recent advances in bioengineering for lipid production. Finally, we
   discuss new perspectives for designing strains for the sustainable
   production of high-value lipids.
   This article is part of the themed issue `The peculiar carbon metabolism
   in diatoms'.},

Pages = {165-184},
Abstract = {Sedimentary phosphorus species concentrations were examined in cores
   (0-10 cm) from 5 locations hi the open middle Adriatic in June 2002.
   Measurements included organic phosphorus (OP) and inorganic P species: P
   in biogenic apatite (P-FD), P adsorbed onto iron-oxy/hydroxidses (P-Fe),
   P in authigenic apatite (P-AUT) and P in detrital apatite (P-DET). Total
   iron (Fe-TOT) and iron-oxyhydroxides (Fe(III)OOH) concentrations were
   also determined as well as granulometric composition, Organic matter
   (OM), organic carbon (C-ORG) and carbonate content (CA). Sediment pore
   water measurements included redox-potential (E-H) and orthophosphate
   concentration. All relevant data were subjected to correlation. Cluster
   and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Cluster analysis indicated that
   granulometric composition and carbonate content are the leading factors
   of distinction between the stations. PCA revealed that the fine fraction
   of sediments has a key role in the vertical distribution of Fe-TOT and
   P-ORG. Linkage among P-A UT P-DET and C-ORG results from river input
   influence, while association between OM, P-Fe, E-H and OP arises from
   complex internal processes in the sedimentary P cycle.},

Title = {Evidence for changes in carbon isotopic fractionation by phytoplankton
   between 1960 and 2010},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {505-515},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Rising CO2 is expected to drive a myriad of environmental changes in the
   surface ocean. Deciphering the phytoplankton response to this complex
   change is difficult. Here we determine whether a trend in the biological
   fractionation of stable carbon isotopes (epsilon(p)) has occurred over
   the past 50 years. epsilon(p) is primarily controlled by the acquisition
   and intracellular transport of inorganic carbon and the rate of carbon
   fixation. In turn, these processes are sensitive to phytoplankton
   physiology, community composition, and notably inorganic carbon
   availability. epsilon(p) may therefore carry a signal of biological
   response to climate change. Temporal and spatial records of epsilon(p)
   can be deciphered from the difference between the stable carbon isotopic
   composition of particulate organic matter (delta C-13(POC)) and that of
   the ambient inorganic carbon pool (delta C-13(CO2)). Here we establish a
   global record of epsilon(p) extending from the 1960s to today, extracted
   from a newly compiled data set of global measured delta C-13(POC) and
   part measured/part climatology delta C-13(CO2). We find that epsilon(p)
   has changed significantly since the 1960s in the low- to mid-latitude
   surface ocean. The increase is most pronounced in the subtropics, where
   it is estimated at > 0.015 parts per thousand per year. Our findings of
   such rates of change are further supported by a high resolution temporal
   record from a single sediment trap near Bermuda. Our results are
   consistent with the idea that epsilon(p) is affected by increased
   inorganic carbon availability driven by the rise in atmospheric CO2.},

   cyclopropyl carboxylic acid ester derived from 1-nonene was subsequently
   used as the key intermediate for the synthesis of the (+)-enantiomer of
   the natural product (-)-grenadamide. The efficient and high-yielding
   approach towards grenadamide reported here is the first to utilise
   asymmetric cyclopropanation for the construction of the chiral

Title = {PREDICTING THE POTENTIAL SUITABLE HABITAT FOR TAMARIX CHINENSIS UNDER
   CLIMATE CHANGE BASED ON CMIP6 IN CHINA},
Journal = {APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Pages = {2845-2863},
Abstract = {Tamarix chinensis (Tamaricaceae), a halophytic plant, is native to
   China. Tamarix chinensis has shown significant advantages in improving
   soil desertification and enhancing soil quality in coastal saline lands
   and can be used for ornamental and medicinal purposes with high
   scientific, ecological and economic values. The scarcity of information
   about geographic distribution under global climate change makes it
   difficult to promote better cultivation of this shrub. For this study,
   we modeled the current and future suitable growth areas in 2050 and 2070
   for T. chinensis by the Maxent model using the latest Coupled Model
   Comparison Program 6 (CMIP6) data set. The results revealed that annual
   mean temperature, precipitation of wettest quarter, annual mean UV-B and
   elevation were identified as the most important factors affecting T.
   chinensis distribution. The total suitable potential distribution areas
   for T. chinensis encompassed ca. 191.38??104 km2, in which the highly
   suitable areas were mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches
   of the Yellow River and the eastern coastal areas in China. Under the
   Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 126 scenario, we predicted an
   expansion of the suitable habitat range in 2050 followed by a
   contraction in 2070; however, under the SSP585 scenario, the suitable
   habitat range of T. chinensis would decrease in 2050 and 2070. Overall,
   T. chinensis showed a shift trend in distribution to higher latitudes
   and elevations with global warming. This study could provide a
   theoretical guidance for formulating management plans for T. chinensis
   and saline soil rehabilitation in the future.},

Title = {Changes in composition of rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) beds due to
   possible recent increase in sea temperature in Eastern Canada},

Abstract = {Ascophyllum nodosum (rockweed) is the main economic resource of the
   seaweed industry in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada. The annual harvest
   steadily increased since 1995, reaching a historic peak of 37,000 tonnes
   in 2007. Due to a high demand for fertilizers and animal feed
   supplements derived from rockweed, this trend seems likely to continue.
   The current management plan for the sustainable harvest of the A.
   nodosum resource is considered conservative. The resource has been
   managed with a precautionary approach since 1995 to protect the
   integrity of the habitat. Acadian Seaplants Limited (ASL) has been
   granted approximately 90\% of the government-issued licenses to harvest
   A. nodosum resources in the Maritimes. The Canadian approach is based on
   an annual harvest from a given bed and not strip-and-return after
   several years. Since 1995, ASL has proactively undertaken extensive
   annual surveys and research on biomass productivity of this renewable
   resource to establish acceptable annual exploitation rates.
   Historically, the rockweed beds of southwestern Nova Scotia (NS) have
   been almost 99\% pure A. nodosum, with a minor component of Fucus
   vesiculosus. However, since 2004, a steady increase in F. vesiculosus,
   with a peak of 4.6\% of the total biomass in 2008, was recorded. This
   coincided with one of the mildest winters on record for the Maritimes.
   This increase in temperature seemed to be also responsible for an
   unusual recruitment of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis in rockweed beds
   in some areas of southern New Brunswick ( NB) in 2006, causing the
   detachment of up to 30\% of the seaweed biomass in some harvesting
   sectors. Another phenomenon observed in southwestern NS during 2003 and
   2004 was extensive ice damage on rockweed beds produced by an early
   melting of the ice, with losses of up to 90\% of the rockweed biomass in
   some areas.},

Title = {Solar powered artificial floating island for landscape ecology and water
   quality improvement},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {8-16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study uses solar artificial floating islands (SAFI) for water
   purification and biological conservation. The site of experiment is set
   up on a lake shore on a university campus, where the eutrophic contents
   of lake and sewage from the student dormitory are used for result
   assessment. The study demonstrates that the SAFI is able to reduce the
   EC of the eutrophic contents by 30\% and enhance dissolved oxygen (DO)
   by 2.8 times. The SAFI is also able to reduce electric conductivity of
   dormitory sewage by 34\% and increase dissolved oxygen by 982 times.
   After the improvement, the oxidation-reduction property is above +100 mV
   and the oxidation activities in samples are vigorous. The habitation of
   Ischnura senegalensis, Leucauge magnifica Yaginuma, and Duttaphrynus
   melanostictus can be observed in the SAFI enhanced water area, while the
   area without the influence of the SAFI lacks dissolved oxygen and water
   plants, which results in the common Culicidae, Hirudo nipponica Whitman,
   and Chironomida in rotten water. This research shows that the SAFI has
   determinant influence on the ecology and water quality improvement. (C)

Abstract = {The abundance of water on earth provides a large window to utilize the
   mechanical energy within river currents and ocean waves. In this regard,
   hydropower harvesting through solid-liquid contact electrification has
   received considerable interest in the recent past. Despite advancements
   in nanotechnology, liquid energy harvesting devices, especially
   solid-liquid triboelectric nanogenerators (S-L TENGs), require efficient
   engineering of the interfacial properties of their substrates to
   transfer liquid mass and momentum rapidly with the effective
   generation/transfer of surface charges. To face this challenge, several
   parameters such as the selection of material, surface morphology and
   surface properties are currently being studied to develop a better
   system architecture for energy harvesting and self-powered application
   platforms with three different interacting modes of liquid contact.
   Moreover, several parameters of the contact solvents such as the ionic
   activity and polarity have been studied to understand the practical
   applicability of S-L TENGs to harvest energy from different natural and
   artificial resources. In addition, the scope of harvesting mechanical
   energy from other volatile organic compounds has been studied recently.
   Self-powered applications of S-L TENGs in various fields have also been
   demonstrated by different research groups. This work reviews recent
   progress in the development of S-L TENGs for the first time in terms of
   the different properties of solid and liquid contact materials along
   with their respective applications. Furthermore, the work concludes with
   perspectives, future opportunities, and major challenges of fabricating
   S-L TENGs as an efficient energy harvester.},

Title = {Resilience optimization of multi-modal energy supply systems: Case study
   in German metal industry},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The energy-intensive industry sector, including the metal industry,
   strongly depends on resilient energy supply concepts. Environmental
   concerns, e.g. about the future availability of groundwater for cooling,
   force companies to analyze the resilience of their energy supply
   systems. The use of heat pumps, electrolysers and combined
   heat-and-power units couples multi-modal supply systems for electricity,
   thermal demands, and process gases. This paper presents an integrated
   design approach for industrial supply systems showcased for a real-world
   case of a German copper mill. System resilience is evaluated for both
   environmental risk mitigation and technical robustness. Quantitative
   results reveal heat pumps as an attractive technology option:
   Groundwater withdrawal for cooling is cost-efficiently reduced by 18\%,
   whereas the waste heat can be utilized to meet more than 70\% of the
   space heating demand. This enhances system resilience to a future
   tightening of the regulatory environment for water withdrawal and
   increasing carbon prices. The mill experiences only rarely grid outages
   due to the high reliability of the German power system. Additional
   distributed generators or storages with the ability of islanding
   therefore do not appear economically beneficial in this case study. (C)

Abstract = {Forests play a crucial role by regulating the global and local weather
   through the exchange of atmospheric gases and water vapor. The present
   study aims to study the intra-annual variability of net ecosystem
   exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide in a sal (Shorea robusta) dominated
   moist deciduous forest in India by integrating eddy covariance (EC) data
   and Biome-Biogeochemical Cycle (Biome-BGC) model. The study also
   attempts to address the spatial variability of NEE with respect to
   phenology. Monthly average NEE were estimated using a calibrated
   Biome-BGC model and the spatial NEE was mapped using random forest (RF)
   regression algorithm. Phenology metrics were generated using the
   moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation
   index product (MOD13A2) and its relationship with the estimated NEE was
   studied. RF regression model for monthly average spatial NEE estimation
   was built with an R-2 of 0.84 and \% RMSE of 3.68\%. The study revealed
   that the NEE at the regional scale can be estimated using the basic
   meteorological variables like mean temperature, vapor pressure deficit,
   minimum temperature and total precipitation. Biome-BGC model output
   showed that the sal forest of the study area acted as a net sink of
   carbon in almost all months of 2015, except April to June. Peak NEE
   value (-2.80 to -2.96gCm(-2)day(-1)) was observed during October month.
   Annual NEE of sal forest in 2015 was found to be -526.87gCm(-2)year(-1).
   With the start of season (end of June), sal forest showed an increasing
   trend in NEE while decreasing trend was observed at the end of season
   (end of October). The study showed the applicability of Biome-BGC model
   in Indian forest when integrated with EC data. The study also
   highlighted the utility of RF in capturing the spatial variability of
   NEE over large area.},

Volume = {58},

Pages = {510-516},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {SWAN model predictions, initialized with directional wave buoy
   observations in 550-m water depth offshore of a steep, submarine canyon,
   are compared with wave observations in 5.0-, 2.5-, and 1.0-m water
   depths. Although the model assumptions include small bottom slopes, the
   alongshore variations of the nearshore wave field caused by refraction
   over the steep canyon are predicted well over the 50 days of
   observations. For example, in 2.5-m water depth, the observed and
   predicted wave heights vary by up to a factor of 4 over about 1000 m
   alongshore, and wave directions vary by up to about 10, sometimes
   changing from south to north of shore normal. Root-mean-square errors of
   the predicted wave heights, mean directions, periods, and radiation
   stresses (less than 0.13 m, 5 degrees, 1 s, and 0.05 m(3)/s(2)
   respectively) are similar near and far from the canyon. Squared
   correlations between the observed and predicted wave heights usually are
   greater than 0.8 in all water depths. However, the correlations for mean
   directions and radiation stresses decrease with decreasing water depth
   as waves refract and become normally incident. Although mean wave
   properties observed in shallow water are predicted accurately, nonlinear
   energy transfers from near-resonant triads are not modeled well, and the
   observed and predicted wave energy spectra can differ significantly at
   frequencies greater than the spectral peak, especially for narrow-band
   swell. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Continental shelf regions in the ocean play an important role in the
   global cycling of carbon and nutrients, but their responses to global
   change are understudied. Global Earth system models (ESMs), as essential
   tools for building understanding of ocean biogeochemistry, are used
   extensively and routinely for projections of future climate states;
   however, their relatively coarse spatial resolution is likely not
   appropriate for accurately representing the complex patterns of
   circulation and elemental fluxes on the shelves along ocean margins.
   Here, we compared 29 ESMs used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC)'s Assessment Reports (ARs) 5 and 6 and a regional
   biogeochemical model for the northwest North Atlantic (NWA) shelf to
   assess their ability to reproduce surface observations of temperature,
   salinity, nitrate and chlorophyll. The NWA region is biologically
   productive, influenced by the large-scale Gulf Stream and Labrador
   Current systems and particularly sensitive to climatically induced
   changes in large-scale circulation. Most ESMs compare relatively poorly
   to observed surface nitrate and chlorophyll and show differences with
   observed surface temperature and salinity that suggest spatial
   mismatches in their large-scale current systems. Modelsimulated nitrate
   and chlorophyll compare better with available observations in AR6 than
   in AR5, but none of the models perform equally well for all four
   parameters. The ensemble means of all ESMs, and of the five
   best-performing ESMs, strongly underestimate observed chlorophyll and
   nitrate. The regional model has a much higher spatial resolution and
   reproduces the observations significantly better than any of the ESMs.
   It also simulates reasonably well vertically resolved observations from
   gliders and bi-monthly ship-based monitoring observations. A ranking of
   the ESMs indicates that only one ESM has good and consistent performance
   for all variables. An additional evaluation of the ESMs along the
   regional model boundaries shows larger variability but is generally
   consistent with the ranking on the shelf. Overall, 11 ESMs were deemed
   satisfactory for use in the NWA, either directly or for regional
   downscaling.},

Abstract = {In this study, the impact of climate change on wind and wave
   characteristics has been assessed using super-high-resolution
   MRI-AGCM3.2S wind data and numerical modeling over the Indian Ocean.
   Wave characteristics were generated in two 25-year periods covering
   historical and future projections (RCP8.5), and the assessment indicated
   that, generally, the spatial distributions of wind speed, significant
   wave height (H-s) and mean spectral wave period (T-m01) will not
   dramatically change in the future. The assessment also indicated that
   the wind direction reversing pattern during monsoons will remain
   similar. Moreover, future westerly winds in the Southern Indian Ocean
   (SIO) will shift to the south and a decrease in future wind speed north
   of the equator will occur, espearound the equator due to cially during
   winter. The relative change of H-s will be less than wind speed the
   predominance of swells transferring from the SIO. There will be no
   considerable change in the future T-m01, except during autumn in the
   area north of the equator. A novel climate stability index is suggested
   showing that the semi-enclosed seas in the NIO and the western coasts of
   India and the Maldives will be areas with the least stability in terms
   of wave climate. Despite experiencing more intense wind and wave
   climates, the overall climate will be more stable in the SIO than the
   NIO.},

Abstract = {For several years, measures to insure healthy river functions and to
   protect biodiversity have focused on management at the scale of drainage
   basins. Indeed, rivers bear witness to the health of their drainage
   basins, which justifies integrated basin management. However, this
   vision should not mask two other aspects of the protection of aquatic
   and riparian biodiversity as well as services provided by rivers. First,
   although largely depending on the ecological properties of the
   surrounding terrestrial environment, rivers are ecological systems by
   themselves, characterized by their linearity: they are organized in
   connected networks, complex and ever changing, open to the sea. Second,
   the structure and functions of river networks respond to manipulations
   of their hydrology, and are particularly vulnerable to climatic
   variations. Whatever the scale considered, river networks represent
   ``hotlines{''} for sharing water between ecological and societal
   systems, as well as for preserving both systems in the face of global
   change. River hotlines are characterized by spatial as well as temporal
   legacies: every human impact to a river network may be transmitted far
   downstream from its point of origin, and may produce effects only after
   a more or less prolonged latency period. Here, I review some of the
   current issues of river ecology in light of the linear character of
   river networks. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Subaerial Quaternary limestones exposed on raised beach terraces on the
   Atlantic coastline north of Casablanca, Morocco, are undergoing rapid
   denudation by fungal and cyanobacterial destructive processes. Erosion
   is accomplished by penetration of the substrate by mycelia, including
   dissolution of carbonate substrate which subsequently becomes trapped in
   the biofilms in the photic zone along the terraces. The cyanobacteria
   cause biophysical disintegration, redistribution and biosynthesis of
   mineral components. Invasion of the pore space created by cyanobacteria
   is followed by microbially mediated carbonate cementation, beginning
   with the precipitation of several generations of crystallographically
   diverse carbonate cements. The micro-caves exhibit a range of features
   dominated by speleothemic calcite, microborings, algal Filaments,
   hyphae, and calcite spherulites, which support the role of
   micro-organisms in the bioerosion and subsequent cementation of
   carbonate rocks in the terrestrial environment.},

Abstract = {Snow is crucial over sea ice due to its conflicting role in reflecting
   the incoming solar energy and reducing the heat transfer so that its
   temporal and spatial variability are important to estimate. During the
   Norwegian Young Sea ICE (N-ICE2015) campaign, snow physical properties
   and variability were examined, and results from April until mid-June
   2015 are presented here. Overall, the snow thickness was about 20 cm
   higher than the climatology for second-year ice, with an average of 55
   +/- 27 cm and 32 +/- 20 cm on first-year ice. The average density was
   350-400 kg m(-3) in spring, with higher values in June due to melting.
   Due to flooding in March, larger variability in snow water equivalent
   was observed. However, the snow structure was quite homogeneous in
   spring due to warmer weather and lower amount of storms passing over the
   field camp. The snow was mostly consisted of wind slab, faceted, and
   depth hoar type crystals with occasional fresh snow. These observations
   highlight the more dynamic character of evolution of snow properties
   over sea ice compared to previous observations, due to more variable sea
   ice and weather conditions in this area. The snowpack was isothermal as
   early as 10 June with the first onset of melt clearly identified in
   early June. Based on our observations, we estimate than snow could be
   accurately represented by a three to four layers modeling approach, in
   order to better consider the high variability of snow thickness and
   density together with the rapid metamorphose of the snow in springtime.},

   microstructure, and environmental benefits},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {836},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {On islands far away from the mainland, the raw materials for concrete
   production are often more difficult to obtain. Converting the coral
   waste generated during the island construction process into a marine
   ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) mixture is an eco-friendly
   strategy. Coral powder (CP) is used to partially replace cement and
   silica fume (SF), and its mechanical strength, microstructure and
   environmental benefits are evaluated. Results show that using a small
   amount of CP (5\%) to replace cement can improve the mechanical
   properties of UHPC, but the strength of UHPC decreases with the further
   increase of CP content. From the perspective of nanoindentation test, an
   appropriate amount of CP refines the pore structure of the UHPC matrix
   and increases the content of C-S-H, especially the proportion of
   high-density C-S-H. When 15\% of SF is replaced by CP (SF15), the
   strength of UHPC decreases due to the decrease of C-S-H phase and the
   deterioration of microstructure. In terms of the width of the interface
   transition zone, the width of the C5 sample (CP replace 5\% cement) is
   decreased by 16.7\% compared with the control group, while the width of
   the SF15 group is increased by 38.9\%. Compared with conventional UHPC,
   CP-based UHPC has lower carbon emission and non-renewable energy
   consumption, which effectively utilizes waste and promotes
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {Phenotypic differences among populations of the same species reflect
   selective responses to ecological gradients produced by variations in
   abiotic and biotic factors. Moreover, they can also originate from
   genetic differences among populations, due to a reduced gene flow. In
   this study, we examined the extent of differences in photo-acclimative
   traits of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile clones collected above and
   below the summer thermocline (i.e., -5 and -25m) in a continuous
   population extending along the water depth gradient. During a reciprocal
   light exposure and subsequent recovery in mesocosms, we assessed degree
   of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation of plants collected at
   different depths, by measuring changes in several traits, such as gene
   expression of target genes, photo-physiological features, and other
   fitness-related traits (i.e., plant morphology, growth, and mortality
   rates). Samples were also genotyped, using microsatellite markers, in
   order to evaluate the genetic divergence among plants of the two depths.
   Measures collected during the study have shown a various degree of
   phenotypic changes among traits and experimental groups, the amount of
   phenotypic changes observed was also dependent on the type of light
   environments considered. Overall plants collected at different depths
   seem to be able to acclimate to reciprocal light conditions in the
   experimental time frame, through morphological changes and phenotypic
   buffering, supported by the plastic regulation of a reduced number of
   genes. Multivariate analyses indicated that plants cluster better on the
   base of their depth origin rather than the experimental light conditions
   applied. The two groups were genetically distinct, but the patterns of
   phenotypic divergence observed during the experiment support the
   hypothesis that ecological selection can play a role in the adaptive
   divergence of P.oceanica clones along the depth gradient.},

Abstract = {The concept of environmental flows and its application and enforcement
   is a main challenge in several developing countries. The services and
   benefits derived from the ecosystem are indispensable for sustaining the
   livelihood of people particularly living in coastal areas.
   Decision-makers often ignore ecosystems when referring to water
   allocation, as the supporters of ecosystems are less vocal as compared
   to other stakeholders. This study focuses on establishing guidelines for
   maintaining the minimum amount of flow known as environmental flow of
   Brunei River in Brunei Darussalam for the sustainability of its rich
   ecosystem. In this study, the flow of the river was simulated based on
   land use, climate change, and potential growth of industries using a
   Water Evaluation and Planning System as a computing tool. The study
   finds that the months of March and June (1.48 and 3.92 m(3)/s) are more
   vulnerable to low flow. It recommends a threshold value of 2.7 m(3)/s
   for the environmental flow of Brunei River essential to preserve its
   rich and diversified ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Human activities have impacted the environment since the first
   toolmakers learned to make fire. As the human population has grown and
   changed, so has our impact on the environment. Currently the world's
   population is estimated at 6-7 billion, and that number of people, along
   with the billions of domesticated animals, and their activities, are
   large enough to have major global and regional impacts. Climate change,
   declining fish populations in the oceans, and ever decreasing ranges for
   ``wild{''} ecosystems are the most obvious impacts. Other impacts may be
   surprising to many people, especially those impacts that are regional
   and not raised to the level of international concern.
   This paper will take a very high level look at a number of global,
   regional and local human interactions with the environment, and how
   mitigating those impacts requires a very broad and multi-disciplinary
   response. Examples will focus on water, carbon and energy, all of which
   are needed for life, as we know it, to exist. Stewardship will be shown
   to involve determination and monitoring of many key indicators and
   environmental processes, followed by the tough decisions on how to
   steward those processes to maintain a healthy environment for all the
   planet's inhabitants. Stewardship is not easy, and there are few cases
   where solutions can be neatly divided into good or bad, positive or
   negative. (C) 2008 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Abstract = {Despite their large size and frequent occurrence in near-shore tropical
   habitats, little published information is available on the movements and
   behaviors of the giant manta ray, Manta birostris, and what factors
   influence visitation patterns. To examine the movements of manta rays in
   the Komodo Marine Park, Indonesia, an acoustic array was installed at up
   to seven sites in the park between 2000 and 2003. A total of 41 acoustic
   tags were deployed in three separate deployments in 2000, 2001 and 2002.
   Mantas were recorded in the park for up to 526 days with an average
   duration of 183 +/- 136 days, when mantas made from 3 to 303 individual
   visits to different sites (median 58 visits). There was a clear
   preference for three sites that comprised over 90\% of manta activity.
   The most popular site (German Flag) was off the southern tip of Komodo
   Island in an area with a high degree of bathymetric structure.
   Examination of the longest records suggests some site preference with 5
   of 7 individuals spending greater than 90\% of their time at the
   location where they were tagged. Using a general linear model it was
   possible to examine the effects of daytime, lunar phase, aggregation
   site, season and tidal phase on visitation patterns. The vast majority
   of visits were recorded during daylight hours at all sites. The
   strongest effects of both the lunar and tidal phase were apparent in the
   northern sites with the most visits occurring when tidal intensity was
   the greatest during full and new moons. The strongest seasonal pattern
   was observed in the south where no mantas were recorded during the first
   quarter in any year. This coincides with an increase in temperature and
   reduction of productivity in this region associated with monsoonal
   shifts. The long-term fidelity indicates that marine-protected areas
   centered around aggregation sites could help protect this species from
   overexploitation.},

Title = {Morphodynamic response to extreme wave events of microtidal dissipative
   and reflective beaches},
Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {101},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this work, the morphodynamic response of microtidal dissipative and
   reflective beaches to extreme wave events generated by hurricanes and
   cold fronts in the Colombian Caribbean was established. Two sandy
   beaches were used as case studies, Bocagrande (Cartagena, Bolivar
   Department) (dissipative) and Costa Verde (Cienaga, Magdalena
   Department) (intermediate-reflective). The numerical models SWAN and
   XBeach were used to investigate wave propagation during storm conditions
   for selected cases and to determine morphological changes on the two
   beaches. Both models were calibrated using hydrodynamic and bathymetric
   data obtained in field campaigns pre and post-cold fronts. The results
   of the numerical models satisfactorily represented the real conditions
   on both beaches. It was shown that regardless of beach configuration,
   whether dissipative or intermediate-reflective, erosive processes had a
   greater magnitude during cold fronts (March 2009 and December 2017) than
   under hurricanes conditions. Bocagrande beach is more exposed to extreme
   wave events, mainly due to its characteristic dissipative profile.
   Infragravity wave energy, fundamental in sediment transport dynamics, is
   not reflected on the beach front, but is dissipated along the swash zone
   and drags sediment to the sea. By contrast, Costa Verde shows
   conservative coastline retreats: its intermediate-reflective morphologic
   configuration played a transcendental role. Infragravity wave reflection
   on the beach front does not allow a longer water extension over dry
   areas in the swash zone under storms.},

Abstract = {The K/T boundary in the Karst region (Italy and Slovenia) is well
   documented in correspondence to shallow water limestones. Its evidence
   is usually related to palaeontological data (disappearance of Cretaceous
   taxa and subsequent appearance of Tertiary ones), palaeomagnetism (Ch
   29r) iridium anomaly and negative shift of delta C-13. In Italy, the
   Padriciano section highlights the K/T boundary included in the basal
   breccia of a peritidal cycle. Recent investigations brought to light a
   short well exposed new stratigraphic sequence containing the K/T
   boundary, 100 m east of Padriciano, as demonstrated by lithological,
   palaeontological and new isotopic data. The recording of a new peritidal
   setting denotes stressed environmental conditions. The findings of the
   biota mostly correspond to the lagoonal limestones of the peritidal
   cycle. It consists of small opportunistic thin shelled foraminifers,
   ostracods and gastropods. At Padriciano, the environmental stability
   occurred after episodes of strong fresh water influence. The
   intraclasts, oncolites and stromatolites have been observed in the
   Padriciano section. The broken shell fragments, algae and foraminifera,
   have been found associated with fenestral fabric. These features
   indicate deposition in a shallow marine (intertidal to supratidal)
   environment. Algal boundstones and microbial (stromatolitic) laminae,
   crenulated domal laminae and crenulated conical laminae have been
   studied in petrographic sections for microstructures. The K/T boundary
   section has been analysed for the carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios. The
   delta C-13 values range from -3.62 to -10.01 parts per thousand (V-PDB)
   and the 6180 values range from -3.85 to -5.47\%o (V-PDB). This extreme
   depiction in the delta C-13 record has already been reported from other
   K/T boundary sections both in the Padriciano, area (Italy) and in
   Slovenia (Dolenja Vas sections) and may be related to global climate
   change but also to local environmental changes occurring in the NW
   Adriatic Platform. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   ``Fuerte{''}, were determined using a combination of CO2 porometry, in
   vivo chlorophyll fluorometry and colorimetric detection of CO2 gas
   exchange balance.
   The optimum temperature for CO2 uptake was found to be between 18 to
   23-degrees-C for both Persea species during the cool season. At 3 to
   5-degrees-C at 36-degrees-C the net photosynthesis rates were depressed
   to 50\% of full capacity. The heat limits for photosynthetic activity
   were found to be 43-degrees-C in P. indica and 45-degrees-C in P.
   americana. At low temperatures, photosynthetic functions were not
   entirely inhibited until temperatures down to -2 and -3-degrees-C.
   Irreversible damage appeared at temperatures above 48-degrees-C and at
   -6-degrees-C in both species. At low temperatures above freezing no
   necroses were seen in the experiments. However, field observations on P.
   americana revealed that the leaves are susceptible to chilling-induced
   long-lasting photoinhibition.
   The value of tree species with stable thermal requirements and narrow
   temperature amplitudes for photosynthetic activity and survival as
   indicators of changes in climate is discussed.},

   Viruses in Mammalian Hosts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the last decade, a wide range of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have
   infected various mammalian hosts and continuously threaten both human
   and animal health. It is a result of overcoming the inter-species
   barrier which is mostly associated with gene reassortment and
   accumulation of mutations in their gene segments. Several recent studies
   have shed insights into the phenotypic and genetic changes that are
   involved in the interspecies transmission of AIVs. These studies have a
   major focus on transmission from avian to mammalian species due to the
   high zoonotic potential of the viruses. As more mammalian species have
   been infected with these viruses, there is higher risk of genetic
   evolution of these viruses that may lead to the next human pandemic
   which represents and raises public health concern. Thus, understanding
   the mechanism of interspecies transmission and molecular determinants
   through which the emerging AIVs can acquire the ability to transmit to
   humans and other mammals is an important key in evaluating the potential
   risk caused by AIVs among humans. Here, we summarize previous and recent
   studies on molecular markers that are specifically involved in the
   transmission of avian-derived influenza viruses to various mammalian
   hosts including humans, pigs, horses, dogs, and marine mammals.},

Abstract = {Metabolic rates and thermal tolerances of three species of mobile
   symbiotic molluscs (two provannid gastropods Alviniconcha sp. and
   Ifremeria nautilei; and the mussel Bathymodiolus brevior) from Lau Basin
   hydrothermal vents were measured. Thermal tolerances of the two
   gastropods were similar and well in excess of temperatures observed in
   situ, although Alviniconcha sp. appeared to have slightly higher
   tolerances. B. brevior had lower thermal limits that could exclude it
   from central areas of active venting. High-pressure respirometry
   experiments revealed that Alviniconcha sp. has very high potential
   growth rates; its uptake of carbon for its endosymbionts being among the
   highest recorded. Uptake rates of metabolites in L nautilei and B.
   brevior were an order of magnitude lower than those observed in
   Alviniconcha sp. Taken together, these thermal tolerances and metabolite
   uptake rates help to explain the zonation patterns seen in situ, where
   Alviniconcha sp. is found closest to the source of vent fluid, followed
   by I. nautilei, and then B. brevior. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The expansion of salmonid aquaculture has resulted in environmental
   challenges, including salmon lice that may infest both farmed and wild
   fish. For wild Atlantic salmon post-smolts that migrate from their
   rivers to the ocean, the first phase of their journey in the coastal
   zone, where aquaculture occurs, is critical when considering lice
   exposure. To evaluate the lice influence during the post-smot migration
   we have developed a migration model. An archive with spatiotemporal
   concentrations of lice larvae in Norwegian coastal waters has been
   established using a combination of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic and
   lice biology models. To estimate lice-induced mortality of wild salmon
   from Norwegian rivers, the infestation level on the virtual post-smolts
   was calibrated to match that observed on wild post-smolts genetically
   assigned their rivers of origin. The lice infestation pressure was
   modelled on post-smolts from 401 rivers covering all of Norway. Based on
   this, aquaculture-produced salmon lice-induced mortality of wild salmon
   post-smolts was estimated to be <10\% for 179 rivers, 10-30\% for 140
   rivers, and >30\% for 82 rivers in 2019. Estimated mortalities were used
   together with other data sets to evaluate aquaculture sustainability in
   Norway. The aquaculture regulatory system represents a globally leading
   example of science-based management that considers the environmental
   impact.},

Abstract = {Our work consists in presenting the results of an invention for a
   membrane distillation system coupled to an efficient and robust water
   solar collector. This system produces potable water with high quality
   and a small percentage of brackish discharge independent of salinity of
   the water source. To optimize and characterize experimentally the
   installation unit of the air gap membrane distillation (AGMD). During
   the tests, brackish water was used, ranging from 4.2 to 12.5g/l of salt.
   The results show that the permeate flux increases as the temperature and
   feed rate an increase, and the thickness of the air gap decreases (from
   5.12 to 1.5mm). Our AGMD system was modelled using Matlab programming on
   heat and mass transfer aspects. The 1D model is based on the transfer
   equations and correlations of the literature present in the membrane
   distillation pilot. The maximum permeate flux obtained was 7.4kg /m(2)h
   with the temperature of the hot fluid of 80 degrees C, a gap of 1.5mm
   and water flow rates of 4.8l/min for the hot chamber and cold. For all
   measurements, the maximum relative difference between the experimental
   results and the simulated results is observed at 10\% errors. The
   results of low temperature hot fluids can be interested in the solar
   energy coupling project.},

Title = {Reef fish biomass recovery within community-managed no take zones},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {192},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) are increasingly recognised as a
   key strategy for small-scale fisheries management across the
   Indo-Pacific. When effective, LMMAs can encourage responsible fishing,
   strengthen compliance and improve adaptive capacity, and may help to
   safeguard food security, address coastal poverty and increase resource
   sustainability. However, evidence that LMMAs can achieve long-term
   biological goals is limited. Here, we used a six-year dataset and a
   before-after-control-impact sampling design to assess the biological
   effectiveness of five community-managed no take zones (CMNTZs) situated
   within the Velondriake LMMA in southwest Madagascar. Linear mixed-effect
   models revealed that the difference in biomass between control and
   reserve sites increased over time. Significant differences in biomass
   between CMNTZs and controls were only evident from year two onwards,
   with 189\% more total biomass in CMNTZs than fished control sites by
   year six. There was no effect of CMNTZs on the biomass of fish families
   preferentially targeted by the local fishery, limiting the long-term
   fisheries benefits of this reserve network unless individual CMNTZs are
   made larger to accommodate the home ranges of fishery targeted families.
   There were however, reserve effects preventing the decline of untargeted
   fish families and species richness.
   Importantly, these CMNTZs delivered a conservation benefit that rivals
   government-run NTZs in the region, against a backdrop of severe biomass
   depletion, coastal poverty and human dependence on fishing-illustrating
   their suitability as a solution to marine resource depletion in
   developing tropical countries.},

Title = {Occurrence of high-diversity metazoan- to microbial-dominated
   bioconstructions in a shallow Kimmeridgian carbonate ramp (Jabaloyas,
   Spain)},
Journal = {FACIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The horizontal and vertical transitions of a wide range of
   bioconstructions are documented from the shallow domains of a
   Kimmeridgian carbonate ramp (Upper Jurassic) in the Jabaloyas area of NE
   Spain. The bioconstructions include microbial buildups, coral-bearing
   thrombolite buildups, coral-microbial buildups, branching coral patches,
   oyster patches, and stromatoporoid carpets. Buildups form stacked
   pinnacles up to 19 m thick, within a broad spectrum of coeval
   inter-buildup carbonate facies. Coral-bearing thrombolites are
   coincident with shallow-marine oolitic sands, indicating development
   during the initial platform flooding (unit 1). During the continued
   sea-level rise (units 2 and 3), coral-microbial buildups {[}encrusted by
   Crescentiella (Tubiphytes) and serpulids] were established from proximal
   to distal mid-ramp domains, and these showed an increasing proportion of
   microbial crust in distal domains. Inter-buildup oolitic facies sharply
   grade down-dip to hummocky cross-stratified intraclastic, peloidal, and
   skeletal deposits, mostly sourced from the coral-microbial buildups. The
   lower part of unit 4 was dominated by microbialites in the proximal
   areas, related to local fresh-water input causing seawater
   stratification and oxygen depletion. The upper part of unit 4 indicates
   an initial recovery of metazoan frame builders, with abundant branching
   corals. During the late regression (units 5 and 6), Marinella lugeoni
   red algae, oyster patches, and stromatoporoid boulders developed close
   to the shoreline in well-oxygenated waters with high nutrient content.
   The reported data contribute to the discussion of the optimal
   environmental conditions for each ``bioconstruction window{''} in
   Jabaloyas, namely sediment and nutrient supply, water depth, water
   oxygenation, wave energy and light availability.},

Abstract = {With the deployment of the TetraSpar demonstrator, a significant
   cost-reduction is realized in the field of offshore floating wind
   turbines. The TetraSpar floating wind turbine foundation brings a
   milestone that emphasizes on a modular and fully industrialized
   foundation that consists of main components already widely available in
   the current wind energy supply chain. In an effort to provide an open
   approach to the development of the concept, this paper aims at giving a
   description of the design in order to enable an educated discussion of
   different design philosophies and their influence on material usage and
   production times. The description of the different subcomponents of the
   system should allow any entity to build a model for comparison and/or
   benchmarking any of their own findings against this concept. It is the
   authors' expectation that this open approach to technological discussion
   is paramount to obtaining continued cost-reduction in the area of
   floating offshore wind-for this concept and others.},

Title = {Rapid detection of SNPs in candidate genes regulating the growth of

   semiconductor sequencing},

Abstract = {Orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) is one of the most
   important marine food species in Southeast Asia and China and has been
   cultured for decades. In this study, we fully utilized the limited
   capacity of semiconductor sequencing, the high efficiency of long-range
   PCR for target enrichment and a non-indexed pooling strategy to screen
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a breeding population of
   orange-spotted grouper. Forty-one genomic DNA fragments, with a total
   length of approximately 180 kb, including 22 candidate genes that
   control growth, and from a DNA pool of 20 heaviest and 22 lightest
   individuals of the sampled population were successfully sequenced using
   an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. 3 503 466 clear reads were
   produced with a length of 192 +/- 56 bp, 86.8\% of which were mapped to
   the reference with an average coverage depth of 2567-fold and physical
   coverage of 98.8\%. Finally, 1623 high-quality SNPs were adopted.
   Compared with Sanger sequencing of three random common regions, the
   sensitivity and specificity of our approach were 39.4\% and 100.0\%
   respectively. A mutation located at the third position of the previously
   labelled start codon of growth hormone receptor type 1 invalidated the
   start codon. Furthermore, comparison of the frequencies of genotypes and
   alleles of this site between the two extreme groups, prediction of
   signal peptide and identification of conservative mRNA sequences
   suggested that the functional start codon is likely located at the
   position of another downstream in-frame ATG in the mutant. These
   detected SNP markers will provide important tools for the selective
   breeding of orange-spotted grouper.},

Abstract = {The use of a co-extruded soybean poultry by-product meal with egg
   supplement was evaluated as a substitute for fish meal in a practical
   diet formulated to contain 32\% crude protein and 8\% lipid. The
   co-extruded product was substituted for menhaden fish meal on an
   iso-nitrogenous basis and offered to juvenile Litopenaeus vannamei (mean
   initial weight +/- standard deviation, 1.13 +/- 0.06 g) over a 6-week
   period. Inclusion levels ranged from 0\% (30 g fish meal/100 g diet) to
   100\% replacement (0 g fish meal/100 g diet). A fifth diet was
   formulated to contain no fish meal and 1 g krill meal/100 g diet.
   Furthermore, a commercial shrimp feed was included in the study to allow
   for a commercial reference. At the conclusion of the growth trial,
   survival, final weight, percent weight gain and feed efficiency (FE)
   were not significantly different among treatments. The inclusion of
   krill meal did not appear to improve attractability or palatability of
   the diet. Co-extruded soybean poultry by-product meal with egg
   supplement appears suitable as a substitute for fish meal in L. vannamei
   diets. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {1. Management of new coastal conservation areas refocuses attention on
   the need to distinguish between the effects of natural and man-made
   factors, and to ensure that global warming does not erroneously become a
   catch-all explanation for future ecological changes.
   2. With world distribution related to latitudinal temperature gradients
   the most sensitive responses to temperature will be seen at species'
   geographical limits.
   3. Northernmost populations often lack young age classes, and have a
   dominance of old individuals capable of surviving and reproducing after
   transfer to cold areas beyond their present limits.
   4. Northern limits are therefore being set primarily by inadequate
   repopulation rates, which in poor seasons may extend many hundreds of
   kilometres to the south.
   5. Confirmation of a warming trend here will reside in increasingly reg
   reversal of the age structure and northward colonization by planktonic
   larvae.
   6. Appropriate scenarios exist for southern limits and for species
   without planktonic stages.
   7. A chain of north and south geographical limits along continental
   coastlines will indicate where temperature-induced changes could be
   taking place generally.
   8. Attempts to establish such a system in the 1980s failed for lack of
   financial support. Current attitudes, political will, etc., are
   discussed, and irrespective of its utility as a management tool such a
   project could form a fitting baseline for the century of climatic
   change. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons. Ltd.},

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {93-100},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Deep-sea sediment cores were obtained from abyssal areas (water depth >
   4000 m) in the South China Sea (SCS) to derive acoustic characteristics
   by using a WSD-3 digital acoustic instrument at a frequency of 100 kHz.
   The compressional wave velocity (Vp) of the seafloor sediments in the
   central basin is differentiated into 3 provinces on the basis of the
   sediment properties (esp. mean grain size and velocity). Provinces 1.11
   and H2 have a high compressional wave velocity and coarse particles,
   while the middle province L. has a low compressional wave velocity and
   fine particles. The results show that the distribution of Vp is related
   to the sediment physical properties, sediment sources and ocean current.
   Vertical variations in the Vp indicate that it increases with burial
   depth in the high-velocity province, but is complicated in the
   low-velocity province, reflecting that the more active or complicated
   sedimentary environment in province L may be affected by the topography.
   We proposed a laboratory sound velocity measurement method based on
   Hamilton sound velocity ratio method. In addition, the measurement
   values from this method are close to the in situ sound velocity
   determined by adjusting the temperature of the sediment samples.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS B-FLUIDS},

Volume = {65},
Pages = {31-44},

Abstract = {In this study we develop a formulation to model the effect of a thin
   porous plate of arbitrary geometry in a fluid flow. This underlying
   model is based on the 1D pressure drop in the normal direction to the
   plate and is easily used for 2D and 3D flows. Our primary interest lies
   in perforated plates for use in ocean wave damping applications,
   although other porous media such as woven gauze or slotted screens can
   be handled in an identical manner. We implement the model in a Smoothed
   Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework which is an intrinsically
   suitable method for the interaction between complex geometries and ocean
   waves. We compare predictions of the method to theory and available
   experimental data in a set of simulations including 2D steady-state flow
   normal and inclined to a screen. In all cases the results from the SPH
   implementation are in very satisfactory agreement. The method is then
   demonstrated on solitary wave interaction with a porous barrier and the
   transmission, reflection and absorption of wave energy is predicted as a
   function of permeability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Title = {Perspectives on provenance and alteration of suspended and sedimentary
   organic matter in the subtropical Pearl River system, South China},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {259},
Pages = {270-287},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Large river systems accumulate, process, and transport huge quantities
   of organic matter (OM) from their catchments, part of which is exported
   to the ocean. Although this suite of processes comprises an important
   component of the global carbon cycle, integrated studies examining the
   nature and extent of OM processing on a basin-wide scale remain rare.
   Here, we provide an overview of provenance and composition of OM in
   suspended and deposited sediments within the Pearl River watershed in
   South China. We present new data on the organic carbon (OC) and total
   nitrogen (TN) contents, stable carbon and radiocarbon isotopic
   compositions of OC (delta C-13 and F-m), as well as grain size
   distribution and mineral-specific surface area of Pearl River sediments.
   These results are combined with published data on suspended particulate
   matter (SPM) and soil profiles in the Pearl River watershed in order to
   determine the provenance and transformation of OM in this large
   subtropical fluvial system.
   We find that the low C-14 contents, expressed as fraction modern (F-m)
   values, in suspended (F-m: 0.58-0.87) and sedimentary OM (F-m:
   0.38-0.82) are attributed to contributions from C-14-depleted soils,
   bedrock, as well as riverine primary productivity (R-pp) that utilizes
   C-14-depleted sources of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). For SPM, soil
   OM (F-m: 0.87 +/- 0.13) is inferred to be the dominant fraction during
   the wet season, whereas the contributions of R-pp (F-m: 0.86 +/- 0.04)
   and petrogenic OC (devoid of C-14) are enhanced during the dry season.
   This manifests itself in differences in OCsoil, OCRpp, and OCpetro
   contributions in SPM between wet and dry seasons (1.05 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.20
   +/- 0.50\%, 0.16 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.15\% and 0.21 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.38
   +/- 0.19\%). During erosion and transport, the most labile OM in the top
   soil is rapidly degraded, as indicated by a stronger contribution from
   soil CO2 into riverine DIC during the wet season and flood event (39 +/-
   1\% and 45 +/- 3\%) compared to the dry season (31 +/- 2\%). River
   sediments are primarily accumulated during the wet season when suspended
   sediment fluxes are high. Refractory deep soil OM (F-m: 0.74 +/- 0.07)
   dominate in these sediments, whereas moderately labile soil OM
   components are further degraded during settling and storage. This
   sedimentary OM is predominantly composed of aged soil (92 +/- 4\%), with
   a minor contribution from bedrock (7 +/- 4\%) and negligible input from
   R-pp (0.2 +/- 0\%). The longitudinal changes in the composition of
   suspended and sedimentary OM are mainly controlled by input of R-pp and
   ongoing degradation processes in the river system. The riverine
   particulate OC flux to the Pearl River estuary and ocean thus contains a
   mixture of soil, petrogenic and R-pp OM, all exhibiting relatively low
   F-m values. The riverine OM transformation and dynamics are important
   for the short-term carbon cycle, whereas the remaining signature and
   fate of the extensively processed, refractory OM has implications for
   the long-term carbon cycle. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Discovering microalgae with high lipid productivity are among the key
   milestones for achieving sustainable biodiesel production. Current
   methods of lipid quantification are time intensive and costly. A rapid
   colorimetric method based on sulfo-phospho-vanillin (SPV) reaction was
   developed for the quantification of microbial lipids to facilitate
   screening for lipid producing microalgae. This method was successfully
   tested on marine thraustochytrid strains and vegetable oils. The
   colorimetric method results correlated well with gravimetric method
   estimates. The new method was less time consuming than gravimetric
   analysis and is quantitative for lipid determination, even in the
   presence of carbohydrates, proteins and glycerol. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Finite element based meta-modeling of ship-ice interaction at shoulder
   and midship areas for ship performance simulation},
Journal = {MARINE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {71},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The climate change has made the transit through Arctic area more
   feasible, which demands reliable methods to evaluate ship performance.
   Ship performance in ice is a cross-scale problem, where the desired
   output such as ship speed lies in larger scale while the actual ship-ice
   interaction happens in smaller scale. Due to insufficient knowledge in
   ice mechanics and the demand for computational efficiency, existing
   approaches for modelling ship-ice interaction from ship performance
   perspective are mostly either (semi-) empirical, or simplified
   analytical, with reduced dimensions and extensively simplified
   mechanics. This paper presents a novel approach to model ship-ice
   interaction, which maintains the accuracy of the modelling with Finite
   Element Method (FEM) in ship-ice interaction scale, while being
   computationally very cheap, therefore is capable to be applied in ship
   scale simulations. The ice failure is firstly qualitatively investigated
   through full-scale and model-scale observations, as well as a numerical
   simulation with Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The model is then
   simplified and executed by Abaqus to automatically run a large database.
   A neural network is used to fit the results to get a simulation-free
   tool for ship-ice interaction calculation. Finally, the uncertainty in
   the results due to an important assumption is quantified. The results
   show that the obtained neural network fits the database with excellent
   performance. Therefore, it can be applied in ship scale simulations with
   improved accuracy compared to empirical or analytical approaches.},

Abstract = {Three methods for oxidizing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore
   waters of marine sediment from Cape Lookout Bight, North Carolina are
   compared: (1) high temperature (850-degrees-C) sealed tube combustion
   (STC) of salts following vacuum distillation; (2) high temperature
   catalytic combustion (HTCC) using a Shimadzu TOC-500 Total Carbon
   Analyzer; (3) low temperature chemical oxidation (LTCO) with
   peroxydisulfuric acid in sealed glass ampoules. The STC method is
   sufficiently robust to oxidize refractory compounds such as diamond and
   graphite. Direct comparison with a Carlo Erba Elemental Analyzer
   established that the STC technique is capable of quantitatively
   oxidizing organic carbon contained in the sediment solid phase. Pore
   water DOC concentrations determined by STC and HTCC generally agree
   within the analytical error of the methods. The fraction of the DOC
   reservoir resistant to LTCO is less than 10\%, indicating that these
   pore waters do not contain a large pool of DOC that is resistant to
   chemical oxidation.},

Pages = {16345-16352},
Abstract = {The method for detecting and locating a Kelvin wake in the background of
   a two-dimensional (2-D), large-scale, random rough sea surface is
   studied. In this method, the large-scale, 2-D dynamic sea surface is
   partitioned, the correlation function between each partitioned sea
   surface is analyzed and extracted by the feature selective validation
   method, and the energy characteristic difference measures between each
   partitioned sea surfaces are obtained. By averaging the difference
   measures between the target partitioned sea surface and the adjacent sea
   surface, we can obtain the average value of the characteristic
   difference measure of each partitioned sea surface. Through the
   simulation and calculation, it was determined that, after the Kelvin
   wakes are superimposed on the partitioned sea surface, the
   characteristic difference measures are clearly larger than that of the
   partitioned sea surface without superimposed wakes. This finding shows
   that the method can effectively detect the changes in the sea surface
   wave energy caused by the wakes. The result shows that the method can
   accurately and efficiently identify the location of the partitioned sea
   surface where the Kelvin wakes are superimposed, after selecting a
   reasonable threshold, to realize the accurate location of the Kelvin
   wakes.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the most important
   environmental factors determining the distribution of tree species
   within the riparian zone of Lake Duparquet, located in the southern
   boreal region of Quebec, Canada. Occurrence and relative basal area of
   10 species were recorded within an altitudinal range of 200 cm above
   mean water level along 95 transects. Stepwise logistic regression and
   canonical correspondence analyses were performed on the overall data set
   as well as separately for the five geomorphological shore types
   distinguished (depositional flats, floodplains, beaches, terraces, and
   rock outcrops). The elevation gradient, representing seasonal floodings,
   is the main factor determining the distribution of the species. The
   differences between the geomorphological shore types with respect to
   composition and arrangement of the arborescent vegetation along the
   elevation gradient are at least partially explained by surficial
   substratum, topography, aspect, and fire. Exposure to wave activity
   seems to be of minor importance only. However, since they are the
   driving force of erosion and sedimentation, the waves are to a great
   part responsible for the morphological differentiation of the shoreline.
   The distribution of the tree species along a characteristic
   physiographic cross-section is illustrated for each geomorphological
   shore type.},

   a Fault Zone Hydrothermal System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although different methods have been employed to study the
   earthquake-induced changes in aquifer permeability (e.g.,
   tidal/barometric pressure response and analytical models),
   identification of the mechanism is usually hindered by the limitation of
   application conditions or multiplicity of solutions. A numerical
   simulation that couples flow and heat transport is developed in the
   present study to explain the coseismic responses that followed two large
   earthquakes (Mw 7.0 Lijiang earthquake on 3 February 1996 and Mw 9.1
   Sumatra earthquake on 26 December 2004) at Banglazhang \#1 hot spring,
   China. The results show that decreased spring discharge and temperature
   are attributable to earthquake-induced permeability decrease, which can
   be related to the blocking of narrow fracture apertures. Analysis of the
   model revealed that seismic waves may have caused heterogeneous changes
   in permeability within the fault zone hydrothermal system, which led to
   nonsynchronous changes in spring flow and temperature. Our study
   contributes to an enhanced understanding of the impact of the evolution
   of earthquake-induced permeability in hydrothermal systems.},

Abstract = {The seasonal changes in photosynthetic production, respiration, sinking
   flux of organic carbon, and food web structure are described in the Gulf
   of St. Lawrence over a two-year period during the Canadian Joint Global
   Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) program. The results show contrasts in net
   metabolism between periods of low (winter and spring) and high (summer
   and fall) vertical stability. The winter-spring period was associated
   with an autotrophic pelagic food web: predominance of large
   phytoplankton cells, large zooplankton, and high herbivorous potential
   transfers towards the zooplankton. The stratified summer-fall period was
   associated with a heterotrophic food web: dominance of small
   phytoplankton cells, replacement of the size class occupied by large
   phytoplankton with large heterotrophic dinoflagellates and ciliates,
   smaller zooplankton, and dominance of omnivorous transfers towards the
   zooplankton, Despite differences in algal size and composition as well
   as in size structure of the trophic compartments between winter-spring
   and summer-fall, the particulate organic carbon fluxes observed at 50 m
   depth was quantitatively similar during these two periods. Even though
   winter photosynthetic production was relatively low, the high
   chlorophyll a concentration, the size structure of the trophic
   compartments, and the high contribution of large phytoplankton cells
   (mainly diatoms) to biological activity were similar to those observed
   during the spring and could explain the high heterotrophic biomass
   observed during winter. Crown copyright (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR) continues to suffer from
   repeated impacts of cyclones, coral bleaching, and outbreaks of the
   coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), losing much of its coral
   cover in the process. This raises the question of the ecosystem's
   systemic resilience and its ability to rebound after large-scale
   population loss. Here, we reveal that around 100 reefs of the GBR, or
   around 3\%, have the ideal properties to facilitate recovery of
   disturbed areas, thereby imparting a level of systemic resilience and
   aiding its continued recovery. These reefs (1) are highly connected by
   ocean currents to the wider reef network, (2) have a relatively low risk
   of exposure to disturbances so that they are likely to provide
   replenishment when other reefs are depleted, and (3) have an ability to
   promote recovery of desirable species but are unlikely to either
   experience or spread COTS outbreaks. The great replenishment potential
   of these `robust source reefs', which may supply 47\% of the ecosystem
   in a single dispersal event, emerges from the interaction between
   oceanographic conditions and geographic location, a process that is
   likely to be repeated in other reef systems. Such natural resilience of
   reef systems will become increasingly important as the frequency of
   disturbances accelerates under climate change.},

Title = {Late Jurassic - earliest Cretaceous prolonged shelf dysoxic-anoxic event
   and its possible causes},

Abstract = {The Late Jurassic - earliest Cretaceous time interval was characterized
   by a widespread distribution of dysoxic-anoxic environments in
   temperate- and high-latitude epicontinental seas, which could be defined
   as a shelf dysoxic-anoxic event (SDAE). In contrast to black shales
   related to oceanic anoxic events, deposits generated by the SDAE were
   especially common in shelf sites in the Northern Hemisphere. The onset
   and termination of the SDAE was strongly diachronous across different
   regions. The SDAE was not associated with significant disturbances of
   the carbon cycle. Deposition of organic-carbon-rich sediment and the
   existence of dysoxic-anoxic conditions during the SDAE lasted up toc.20
   Ma, but this event did not cause any remarkable biotic extinction.
   Temperate- and high-latitude black shale occurrences across the
   Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary have been reviewed. Two patterns of black
   shale deposition during the SDAE are recognized: (1) Subboreal type,
   with numerous thin black shale beds, bounded by sediments with very low
   total organic carbon (TOC) values; and (2) Boreal type, distinguished by
   predominantly thick black shale successions showing high TOC values and
   prolonged anoxic-dysoxic conditions. These types appear to be unrelated
   to differences in accommodation space, and can be clearly recognized
   irrespective of the thickness of shale-bearing units. Black shales in
   high-latitude areas in the Southern Hemisphere strongly resemble Boreal
   types of black shale by their mode of occurrence. The causes of this
   SDAE are linked to long-term warming and changes in oceanic circulation.
   Additionally, the long-term disturbance of planktonic communities may
   have triggered overall increased productivity in anoxia-prone
   environments.},

Title = {EXPRESSION OF INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH-FACTOR-I IN NORMALLY AND ABNORMALLY
   DEVELOPING COHO SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH)},
Journal = {ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {136},
Number = {2},
Pages = {446-452},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Changes in levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) messenger RNA
   (mRNA) in tissues of normally and abnormally growing (stunted) juvenile
   coho salmon in seawater were studied. Profiles of hepatic IGF-I mRNA
   levels were compared with changes in growth and plasma concentrations of
   GH and insulin. In normally growing fish, IGF-I mRNA levels, as measured
   by solution hybridization-RNase protection assay, showed that hepatic
   IGF-I mRNA levels of yearling salmon were highest in May and June.
   Increased hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels followed increases in both plasma GH
   and insulin. Levels of hepatic IGF-I mRNA decreased in July, after a
   sharp decline in plasma GH in June, and remained low until the following
   spring. The growth rate for normal fish also decreased during fall and
   winter. After increases in plasma GH and insulin, which peaked in late
   February, hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels increased rapidly and reached a
   second peak in April. Increases in plasma GH and hepatic IGF-I mRNA
   observed in the second year were smaller and occurred earlier than in
   the first spring in seawater. Growth retardation (stunting) resulted
   from the premature transfer of cultured fish to seawater. Compared with
   normally growing fish, these stunted salmon had significantly higher
   levels of plasma GH but lower levels of plasma insulin. Hepatic IGF-I
   mRNA levels in stunted salmon were significantly lower, despite elevated
   plasma GH levels. These results indicate that hepatic levels of IGF-I
   mRNA in juvenile coho salmon increase in springtime, after an increase
   in plasma GH and insulin. These seasonal increases in GH and IGF-I
   precede the rapid growth period coinciding with the springtime increases
   in temperature and photoperiod and may therefore be associated with
   these environmental cues. The elevated plasma GH and reduced hepatic
   IGF-I mRNA levels observed in growth-retarded salmon suggested that
   stunted salmon may be GH resistant. Hepatic GH resistance and diminished
   IGF-I production may be the central endocrine defects leading to growth
   retardation in stunted salmon.},

Title = {A numerical modelling study to support design of an in-situ CO2
   injection test facility using horizontal injection well in a
   shallow-depth coal seam},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Previous projects on CO2 storage in coal often reported the challenges
   associated with coal swelling and swelling-induced loss of gas
   injectivity. Since coal seams are typically thin, commonly used vertical
   wells only intersect a target reservoir over a small contact area,
   placing constraints on CO2 injectivity in addition to those resulting
   from coal swelling. This leaves the storage reservoirs largely
   under-utilized and, therefore, questions the viability of this
   technology. To address the challenges/limitations of the current
   practice, a novel in-situ CO2 injection test is planned using horizontal
   injection wells in Mikolow, Poland. This paper presents the
   pre-operational simu-lation studies conducted to assist the design and
   operation of the in-situ test. An existing dual-porosity model that is
   built on a coupled thermo-hydro-chemical-mechanical (THCM) modelling
   framework is employed in this study. Sensitivity of the model parameters
   and validity of the model are tested. Several simulation scenarios are
   developed in reference to the selected test site for various horizontal
   well configurations and gas injection conditions. From the results and
   analyses, it is evident that by varying the coal-CO2 contact area via
   the length of the horizontal injection well, as well as the operating
   conditions including fixed pressure, and fixed rate injection scenarios,
   the targeted amount (between 1 to 10 tonnes) of CO2 can be injected into
   the seam without significant loss of permeability or injectivity,
   yielding sustained gas injection. Moreover, the spread of CO2 is
   predicted to be contained within the model domain suggesting no
   significant concern of spread exceeding the test area.},

Title = {Comparison of synthetic turbulence approaches for blade element momentum
   theory prediction of tidal turbine performance and loads},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {408-418},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Turbulence is a crucial flow phenomenon for tidal energy converters
   (TECs), as it influences both the peak loads they experience and their
   fatigue life. To best mitigate its effects we must understand both
   turbulence itself and how it induces loads on TECs. To that end, this
   paper presents the results of blade element momentum theory (BEMT)
   simulations of flume-scale TEC models subjected to synthetic turbulent
   flows. Synthetic turbulence methods produce three-dimensional flowfields
   from limited data, without solving the equations governing fluid motion.
   These flowfields are non-physical, but match key statistical properties
   of real turbulence and are much quicker and computationally cheaper to
   produce. This study employs two synthetic turbulence generation methods:
   the synthetic eddy method and the spectral Sandia method. The response
   of the TECs to the synthetic turbulence is predicted using a robust BEMT
   model, modified from the classical formulation of BEMT. We show that,
   for the cases investigated, TEC load variability is lower in stall
   operation than at higher tip speed ratios. The variability of turbine
   loads has a straightforward relationship to the turbulence intensity of
   the inflow. Spectral properties of the velocity field are not fully
   reflected in the spectra of TEC loads. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Spectral signatures of recursive magnetic field reconnection},

Abstract = {We use 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the spectral
   signatures of the non-linear disruption of a tearing unstable current
   sheet via the generation of multiple secondary current sheets and
   magnetic islands. During the non-linear phase of tearing mode evolution,
   there develops a regime in which the magnetic energy density shows a
   spectrum with a power law close to B(k)(2) similar to k(-0.)8. Such an
   energy spectrum is found in correspondence of the neutral line, within
   the diffusion region of the primary current sheet, where energy is
   conveyed towards smaller scales via a `recursive' process of fast
   tearing-type instabilities. Far from the neutral line, we find that
   magnetic energy spectra evolve towards slopes compatible with the
   `standard' Kolmogorov spectrum. Starting from a self-similar description
   of the nonlinear stage at the neutral line, we provide a model that
   predicts a reconnecting magnetic field energy spectrum scaling as
   k(-4/5), in good agreement with numerical results. An extension of the
   predicted power law to generic current sheet profiles is also given and
   possible implications for turbulence phenomenology are discussed. These
   results provide a step forward to understand the `recursive' generation
   of magnetic islands (plasmoids), which has been proposed as a possible
   explanation for the energy release during flares, but which, more in
   general, can have an impact on the subsequent turbulent evolution of
   unstable sheets that naturally form in the high Lundquist number and
   collisionless plasmas found in most of the astrophysical environments.},

Abstract = {PAIS-BARBOSA, J., VELOSO-GOMES, F., and TAVEIRA-PINTO, F, 2007. Coastal
   features in the energetic and mesotidal west coast of Portugal, SI 50
   (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 459 - 463.
   Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208
   The Portuguese west coast can be classified in three morphological
   groups: sandy coast, low rocky coast and cliff coast. This coastal zone
   is very energetic (wave-dominated) and is undergoing severe erosion,
   especially on the sandy coast. The study area is characterised by an
   extensive sandy flat area, very dynamic and environmentally fragile,
   under a mesotidal regime. The main objective of this paper is to
   identify and classify morphologically (e.g. megacusps, bars, cuspate
   shorelines, beach cusps) and hydrodynamically (wave breaking, surf-zone
   processes, rip currents, littoral drift) coastal patterns, based on the
   analysis of aerial photographs datasets. The identified features and
   coastal patterns will be compared with the existent morphological beach
   models and classifications. The preliminary analyses allow the
   identification of several morphological features such as megacusps;
   shore attached oblique bars, crescentic bars, cuspate shorelines and
   beach cusps, as well as the associated hydrodynamic currents. A certain
   similarity with other tidal regimes (microtidal) was found but in some
   cases with different spatial scales.},

Abstract = {The LCL-filtered converter is widely adapted to interface renewable
   energy sources and energy storage devices to the grid. While the LCL
   filter is capable of eliminating current harmonics caused by the
   high-frequency PWM of the converter, low-order current harmonics are
   reduced selectively by the stationary-frame resonant harmonic
   compensators (HCs). There are two types of the harmonic compensator,
   namely, harmonic current compensator (HCC) and harmonic voltage
   compensator (HVC). HCCs are in general embedded in parallel with
   conventional grid current controllers by which the active and reactive
   power are regulated. If autonomous islanding operation is required, the
   active and reactive power are controlled by a V-f droop method and a
   filter capacitor voltage controller with which HCCs or HVCs are added in
   parallel. In this paper, a multi-loop controller is proposed as one
   possible alternative to the conventional grid current controller to
   improve the harmonic compensation performance by using both HCCs and
   HVCs, which is a hybrid harmonic compensation (HHC). In addition, a
   novel virtual impedance implementation technique which fits to the
   multi-loop frame is presented to maintain stability of the controller in
   case of large grid impedance.},

Title = {Patterns of phosphorus, nitrogen and delta N-15 along a peat development

Abstract = {Differentiation of limiting nutrients within small spatial scales has
   been observed in coastal mangrove forests, but research on other
   tropical peatlands suggests it is a more widespread phenomenon. In the
   Changuinola mire of coastal Panama, oligotrophy was hypothesized to
   increase along a gradient of peat development (peat doming). Nutrient
   and carbon concentration of leaf tissue, soil, and soil porewater were
   characterised over a successive sequence of plant communities along the
   gradient. Soil phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations decreased
   from 1200 mu g P g(-1) and 27 mg N g(-1) to 3 77 mu g P g(-1) and 22 mg
   N g(-1) within 2.7 km into the mire interior. These changes coincided
   with an increase in soil and average leaf N:P molar ratios from 52-128
   and 24-41, respectively. Soil P was strongly related to leaf P and soil
   N:P to foliar N:P. There was a wide range in delta N-15 values for
   canopy (4.0 to -9.4\%), Campnosperma panamense (4.0 to -7.8 parts per
   thousand) and understorey (4.8 to -3.1 parts per thousand) species.
   Foliar delta N-15 values of canopy species were strongly related to soil
   N:P, soil P and leaf P. The depleted foliar delta N-15 values appeared
   to be an effect of both the N atmospheric source and P limitation. Here,
   P limitation is likely associated with ombrotrophic conditions that
   developed as hydrologic inputs became dominated by precipitation.},

   total settling particles in Pulau Langkawi and Port Dickson was 49.8
   mg/cm(2)/day, while for Pulau Tioman, Pulau Redang, and Pulau Tinggi was
   3.5 mg/cm(2)/day. The results showed that accumulations rate in west
   coast were higher than east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. However, Pulau
   Tioman in the east coast received high accumulations rate of settling
   particles in certain times of the year due to sediment resuspension at
   shallow reefs caused by high energy seasonal yearly wave and monsoon.},

Title = {The 1-min sit-to-stand test in cystic fibrosis - Insights into

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Pages = {744-751},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: We aimed to characterize the cardiopulmonary response during
   a 1-min sit-to-stand (STS) test and compare peak exercise
   cardiorespiratory variables to a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test
   (CPET) in cystic fibrosis (CF). We further aimed to assess the validity
   of the STS power index (Power(STS)) as a measure of exercise capacity.
   Methods: Fifteen adult CF patients performed spirometry, CPET and the
   1-min STS test with respiratory gas analysis.
   Results: Peak-exercise cardiorespiratory variables during the 1-min STS
   test correlated strongly (r = 0.69-0.98) with those measured during the
   CPET. Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, heart rate, ventilation,
   and tidal volume at peak exercise were 24\%, 26\%, 9\%, 10\% and 21\%
   lower in the 1-min STS test, while respiratory frequencies were 14\%
   higher. Power(STS) showed strong to very strong correlations with
   CPET-derived absolute peak oxygen uptake and maximal workload.
   Conclusions: The 1-min STS test elicits a substantial but lower
   cardiorespiratory response compared to a maximal cycle ergometry CPET.
   While Power(STS) and STS repetitions are both valid outcome measures of
   functional capacity, STS repetitions are clinically more practical. (C)

Abstract = {The role of Pleistocene Ice Age in tropical diversification is poorly
   understood, especially in archipelagos, in which glaciation-induced sea
   level fluctuations may lead to complicated changes in land distribution.
   To assess how Pleistocene land bridges may have facilitated gene flow in
   tropical archipelagos, we investigated patterns of diversification in
   the rarely-collected rusty-bellied fantail Rhipidura teysmanni
   (Passeriformes: Rhipiduridae) complex from Wallacea using a combination
   of bioacoustic traits and whole-genome sequencing methods (dd-RADSeq).
   We report a biogeographic leapfrog pattern in the vocalizations of these
   birds, and uncover deep genomic divergence among island populations
   despite the presence of intermittent land connections between some. We
   demonstrate how rare instances of genetic introgression have affected
   the evolution of this species complex, and document the presence of
   double introgressive mitochondrial sweeps, highlighting the dangers of
   using only mitochondrial DNA in evolutionary research. By applying
   different tree inference approaches, we demonstrate how concatenation
   methods can give inaccurate results when investigating divergence in
   closely-related taxa. Our study highlights high levels of cryptic avian
   diversity in poorly-explored Wallacea, elucidates complex patterns of
   Pleistocene climate-mediated diversification in an elusive montane
   songbird, and suggests that Pleistocene land bridges may have accounted
   for limited connectivity among montane Wallacean biota. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to study, analyze, and explain most
   salient and dominant factors having adverse effects in the region called
   Bermuda triangular. World maps and US Board of Geographic Names do not
   identify its existence, which caused disappear a lot number of
   aeroplanes and ships. The published literature during last eighty-five
   years provides information about disappeared aeroplanes and ships as
   well as various reasons for the abnormal behavior in the region. Most
   important discussed reasons are the impact of solar energy, hot and cold
   water flowing in the Atlantic Ocean, strong electromagnetic fields
   solenoids, effects of spirals, effects of magnetic particles,
   hurricanes, strong winds, presence of jelly-like plasma and dilemma
   regarding geographical and other North-South poles in this region. There
   are strong believes about presence of spiritual forces and their adverse
   actions on every passing aircraft and ship through this region. Apart
   from other scientific reasons, this paper focuses on analysis of plasma
   created by oscillation of electrons. Electromagnetic field of the
   solenoid is discussed. The supernatural phenomenon like the moving light
   in the region and existence of methane similar to Mars, though argued
   and observed but not used as strong evidence of abnormal behavior in
   region of Bermuda Triangle. The paper analyzes unknown mysteries, rules
   out parapsychological, Skepticism, Paranormal, and other nonscientific
   reasons. The massive crater under Bermuda Triangle adversely affects
   weather. We analyze abnormal behavior due to effects of two Van Allen
   Belts. Other effective reasons such as, solar radiation, global heat
   waves, powerful hurricanes, winds, volcanoes, and fast-spinning
   tornadoes cause severe damage. According to observations by Hubble
   Telescope, malfunctioning, existence, emission, and attacks of very high
   intensity and energy particles emitting in the form of large groups,
   flocks, heavy clouds, and swarms confirm that Van Allen Belts exert most
   impact to cause anomalies.},

   Halopeplis perfoliata community and plant response to environmental
   conditions of the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia. The study area is
   located at five sites: Ras Tanura, Syhat, Dammam, Al-Uqair and Salwah of
   the Arabian Gulf Coastal salt marshes in eastern province of Saudi
   Arabia where the plants grows under the natural environmental condition.
   Plant samples and soil of H. perfoliata succulent (halophyte) collected
   from the five sites. Several soil concentrations were determined such as
   electric conductivity (EC), organic carbon (O.C.), Na+, Cl-, So(4), K+,
   Ca2+, and Mg2+. The highest concentrations of the ions of Na+, K+, Ca2+,
   Mg2+ in soil samples were found in Dammam site compared with the other
   sites, where Cl is the major ion followed by Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+. The
   involvement of photosynthetic pigments, and proline investigated. Values
   of TWC and RWC and photosynthetic pigment fractions content (chl. a,
   chl. b and carotenoids) from the plants obtained from Dammam were
   higher. In this study proline contents increased significantly in the
   leaves of H. perfoliata as the salt concentration increased. A total of
   57 plants species were identified in all the five study site. The life
   forms of the studied plant spices exhibit a wide variation, perennial
   shrub (PSH) were the dominate growth form (63.16 \%). This research
   suggests that H. perfoliata could remove salt from soil.},

Abstract = {A Multidisciplinary Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study (AmasSeds) investigated
   the oceanic processes near the mouth of the Amazon River in order to
   understand the fate of its enormous discharge of water, solutes and
   particulates. In addition to receiving a large fluvial discharge, the
   continental shelf near the Amazon mouth is situated on the equator and
   experiences an extremely energetic physical regime. As such, it
   represents an end member in the spectrum of coastal marine settings,
   with regard to latitude, energy and discharge. The oceanic processes
   occurring on the Amazon shelf reflect these environmental
   characteristics. A range of interdisciplinary interactions was observed
   on the Amazon shelf in response to its low latitude, among them: plume
   dynamics have little influence from Coriolis acceleration, riverine
   particles experience intense weathering conditions, high primary
   productivity occurs during all seasons, and shoreline sedimentation
   involves mangrove vegetation. The high energy conditions of the Amazon
   shelf result in: water motions dependent on suspended-sediment
   distributions, trace-metal adsorption controlled by seabed dynamics,
   severe restriction of macrobenthos, and deep physical reworking of
   sedimentary strata (to 1 m or more). The great discharge of fluvial
   materials (water, solutes, particulates) directly or indirectly causes
   three-dimensional estuarine-like processes and very high rates of
   primary productivity, sediment accumulation and carbon burial to occur
   on the shelf.
   Although AmasSeds research can link a wide range of interdisciplinary
   oceanic processes to latitude, energetics or discharge, in many cases
   the observed process is strongly influenced by a coupling of these
   characteristics. For example, the dominance of Fe and Mn oxides in
   controlling redox reactions is a result of tropical weathering that
   concentrates the Fe and Mn and of intense seabed reworking that
   regularly reoxidizes these phases. Therefore, the importance of Fe and
   Mn oxides is a result of both latitude and energy considerations. A
   fourth characteristic of the Amazon system is its tectonic setting,
   which determines physiographic features such as drainage-basin size and
   shelf width. Low latitude and great discharge characterize all areas of
   the wet tropics; energy expenditure and tectonic setting vary with
   specific location. All four characteristics must be considered when
   extrapolating AmasSeds observations to other areas and attempting to
   predict or interpret oceanic processes.},

Abstract = {The development of mankind has reached the point that new resources need
   to be trapped in order to fill our basic needs for food, feed and
   freshwater. It is foreseeable that freshwater resources will become
   limited, and that currently used agricultural imgation systems will
   steadily increase soil salinity in the near future. - To date 30\% of
   the farmland under irrigation cannot be used any more for efficient crop
   farming due to salt contamination. It is one goal of the scientific
   community, therefore, to develop sustainable production systems to
   supply animal and men with food and drinking water. The
   EU-Concerted-Action ``Sustainable Use of Halophytes{''} has the
   objectives to (i) demonstrate the feasibility of brackish water or even
   seawater irrigated ecosystems for landscape management, agriculture,
   horticulture, greenification of housing areas, wasteland and roadsides,
   roof greenification, and sand dune stabilization; (ii) inform potential
   users as well as the general public through seminars, congresses,
   exhibits in fairs, and by building demonstration sites at different
   locations in the Mediterranean and subtropical dry regions; (iii)
   perform physiological, biochemical and molecular genetically experiments
   with potential ``cash crop halophytes{''} in order to identify relevant
   parameters and to provide data for future breeding projects.
   This contribution aims at providing early information with respect to
   the use of halophytes and their by-products as fodder for the animal
   production in and areas.},

Title = {Responses of Nipa palm (Nypa fruticans) seedlings, a mangrove species,

Journal = {FLORA},

Volume = {209},

Abstract = {Nipa palm (Nypa fruticans) is the only palm that grows in mangrove
   vegetation. We investigated the effect of salt stress on the growth and
   physiology of 6-month-old seedlings of Nipa palm exposed to different
   degrees of salt stress (as NaCl) in pot culture. The overall growth
   performance of Nipa palm was unaffected by mild salt stress (8.9-16.6 dS
   m(-1)), whereas seedlings grown under severe salt stress (EC = 57.2 dS
   m(-1)) had lower chlorophyll content and fluorescence, reduced net
   photosynthesis and transpiration, which resulted in reduced growth of
   the plants. Na+ contents in leaf, petiole, and root tissues increased
   considerably under salt stress, depending upon the NaCl levels in the
   soil solution. Under salt-stress K+ content declined, whereas Ca2+
   content increased somewhat, in parallel to Na+. Free proline accumulated
   in plants growing under high salt stress (EC = 57.2 dS m(-1)). In
   contrast, soluble sugars were enriched under intermediate levels of salt
   stress (EC = 16.6 dS m(-1)). The results obtained in the present study
   suggest that, based on ecophysiological data, N. fruticans is a species
   best adapted to grow in mangrove coastal areas with moderate only salt
   load, and circumscribing quite well the actual areas of occurrence of
   this palm in the gradient from seawater habitats to inland sites. (C)

   rates but decreases survival in sea urchin larvae},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {167},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {Environmental conditions experienced by parents can have lasting effects
   on offspring. For some marine organisms, parental acclimation may
   attenuate the negative effects observed in offspring exposed to the same
   conditions. Here, development of the coral reef sea urchin Echinometra
   sp. A was examined in larvae derived from parents acclimated for 20
   months in either present-day conditions or those predicted for the year
   2100 (+ 2 degrees C/pH 7.8). Egg size was measured, and larval
   morphology, survival and respiration were quantified in larvae raised in
   present-day (26 degrees C/pH 8.1) and 2100 (28 degrees C/pH 7.8)
   treatments to near settlement to determine whether parental acclimation
   promotes greater resilience to climate change stressors. Although there
   was no difference in egg size, larvae from 2100 parents were generally
   larger and more developmentally advanced than those derived from
   present-day parents. However, negative carryover effects reduced
   survival in offspring of parents acclimated to 2100 conditions. At 15
   days post-fertilization, survival of offspring derived from 2100 parents
   was 50.6\% and 43.7\% when raised in present-day and 2100 conditions,
   respectively, compared to 59.9\% and 64.6\% in offspring derived from
   present-day parents. When raised in 2100 conditions, respiration
   declined by 36.8\% in larvae derived from present-day parents, while
   respiration rates of larvae from 2100 parents increased by 109\%,
   suggesting that carryover effects may be associated with higher energy
   consumption and physiological stress in larvae from 2100 parents.
   Although parental acclimation enhanced growth of larvae in early
   development, overall, negative carryover effects outweighed potential
   benefits of parental acclimation to ocean warming and acidification in
   this species.},

Title = {The paragenetic history of a Marinoan cap carbonate},
Journal = {SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {243},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Carbonates that cap late Neoproterozoic glacial diamictites contain
   large, atypical tepee-like structures that have been interpreted as
   evidence for seafloor dolomite cementation. The Nuccaleena Formation in
   the Adelaide Fold Thrust Belt is the stratotype Marinoan-age cap
   dolostone. At Parachilna Gorge the Nuccaleena Formation contains paired
   cogenetic tepees and growth faults that demonstrate these structures
   grew well below the sediment water interface. These tepees, and their
   associated sheet veins, were the result of pore fluid overpressure
   driven by expansive, early diagenetic dolomite cementation. Fluid
   overpressure resulted in two forces: 1) macroscale lateral compression
   that overcame the lithostatic weight to buckle sediments upward, forming
   the tepee structure, and 2) macro- to microscale extension that overcame
   the lithologic tensile strength to form sheet veins. The physical
   processes of fluid overpressure within the Parachilna Gorge cap
   carbonate are in many ways analogous to the fluid overpressure dynamics
   in mud volcanoes, and were sufficiently high to generate veins extending
   17 m below the cap carbonate. Overpressure-driven dewatering removed
   pore fluid, clay and organic matter from the dolomicrospar matrix into
   dewatering structures and fabrics. The latter are hierarchically
   arranged from small linear clay fabrics to clay-lined dendritic arrays
   to clay-choked curvilinear veins to large sheet veins. Packets of red
   clay laminae were deposited when pore fluids vented to the sea floor.
   The early diagenetic chemical evolution of the Parachilna Gorge cap
   carbonate was equally dynamic, in which an initial reducing trend was
   supplanted by an oxidation trend brought about by tepee-sheet vein
   deformation. Once established the sheet vein network also reinvigorated
   diffusional processes that likely enhanced early diagenetic cementation
   of the cap dolostone. The detailed paragenetic history also suggests
   that calcite not dolomite was the initial carbonate precipitated from
   the post-glacial Adelaidean sea. The Nuccaleena Formation exhibits the
   dolomicrospar, isotopic signatures and tepee-like structures that
   distinguish Marinoan-age cap carbonates. At Parachilna Gorge these
   typical features are a product of early diagenesis, suggesting that
   other Marinoan-age cap carbonates may also be early diagenetic in
   origin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Lead-cooled fast reactor is one of the fourth-generation nuclear energy
   systems, which has great development potential due to good neutronic,
   thermal-hydraulic characteristics and inherent safety. The lead and
   bismuth eutectic alloy (LBE) cooled fast reactor BLESS-D (Breeding
   Lead-Based Economical Safe System) is a small fast reactor developed by
   the State Power Investment Corporation Research Institute (SPICRI). It
   is designed as a multi-purpose integrated small reactor system with the
   characteristics of small power, compact size and inherent safety. In the
   future, it could be used for electricity consumption for remote areas,
   polar expedition, island development and etc.
   The conceptual design of BLESS-D is described in this paper, including
   the design criteria, safety features, main parameters and main
   components. The thermal power of BLESS-D is 300 MW. It is a pool-style
   reactor with LBE as the coolant, equipped with 8 helical tube steam
   generators and 4 primary pumps. The safety system consists of passive
   Decay Heat Removal System (DHR) and RVACS (Reactor Vessel Air Cooling
   System) outside the reactor vessel. For the preliminary transient
   analysis, the primary system and secondary boundary of BLESS-D is
   modeled with SNAP/TRACE. And the steady state simulation results are
   compared with the design values which shows good agreement. After that,
   the transient accidents under different conditions are studied to
   evaluate the feasibility and safety of the current design. In this
   paper, the results of Unprotected Transient Over Power (UTOP).
   Unprotected Loss Of Flow (ULOF) and Unprotected Loss Of Heat Sink
   (ULOHS) are discussed which shows that the current safety system design
   is sufficient to ensure the reactor safety although some optimizations
   are still needed.},

   From a view point of the direction of reflected rays, almost half of the
   energy goes upward due to diffuse reflection in case of paint, meanwhile
   most of energy goes down to the ground due to specular reflection by the
   glass. This leads to deterioration of thermal environment of surrounding
   buildings, and is one of causes of urban heat island. Retro-reflective
   facade materials are promising candidates for mitigation of urban heat
   island. The authors successfully developed a new type of transparent
   solar control window film Albeedo that selectively reflects
   near-infrared rays towards the sky. The film has a saw-tooth
   microstructure with a spectrally-selective reflection layer. This
   microstructure is able to reflect infra-red rays toward the sky. The
   upward reflectance of the film is measured by our custom made
   spectroscope. Firstly, the sample is placed in a large scale integrating
   sphere. Then, solar energy absorptive materials are arranged under the
   sample to absorb the transmitted component and positioned where the
   downward reflection goes to. Finally, a halogen lamp irradiates the
   sample at an incident angle of 60 degrees as a light source. The result
   of the upward reflectance of near-infrared is about 33\%. We also
   conducted field test measurements to evaluate the energy savings of the
   interior of the building and the degree of reflection of the exterior.

Abstract = {Disruptions in tokamaks seem to be unavoidable. Consequences of
   disruptions are (i) high heat loads on plasma-facing components, (ii)
   large forces on the vacuum vessel, and (iii) the generation of runaway
   electron beams. In ITER, the thermal energy of the plasma needs to be
   evenly distributed on the first wall in order to prevent melting, forces
   from vertical displacement events have to be minimized, and the
   generation of runaway electrons suppressed. Massive gas injection using
   fast valves is a concept for disruption mitigation which is presently
   being explored in many tokamaks. Fast disruption mitigation valves based
   on an electromagnetic eddy current drive have been developed in Julich
   since the 1990s and models of various sizes have been built and are in
   operation in the TEXTOR, MAST, and JET tokamaks. A disruption mitigation
   valve for ITER is of necessity larger with an estimated injected gas
   volume of similar to 20 kPa m(3) {[}7] for runaway electron suppression
   and all materials used have to be resistant to much higher levels of
   neutron and gamma radiation than in existing tokamaks. During the last 5
   years, the concept for an ITER prototype disruption mitigation valve has
   been developed up to the stage that a fully functional valve could be
   built and tested. Special emphasis was given to the development and
   functional testing of some critical items: (i) the injection chamber
   seal, (ii) the piston seal, (iii) the eddy current drive, and (iv) a
   braking mechanism to avoid too fast closure of the valve, which could
   damage the injection chamber seal. The concept of the valve will be
   introduced and detailed solutions and testing results for the critical
   items presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In-vessel retention (IVR) of core melt is a key severe
   accident-management strategy adopted by some operating nuclear power
   plants and proposed for some advanced light water reactors (LWRs). If
   there were inadequate cooling during a reactor accident, a significant
   amount of core material could become molten and relocate to the lower
   head of the reactor vessel, as happened in the Three Mile Island Unit 2
   accident. If it is possible to ensure that the vessel head remains
   intact so that relocated core materials are retained within the vessel,
   the enhanced safety associated with these plants can reduce concerns
   about containment failure and associated risk. For example, the enhanced
   safety of the advanced 600 MW(electric) pressurized water reactor
   (AP600) designed by Westinghouse, which relied upon external re-actor
   vessel cooling (ERVC) for IVR, resulted in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission approving the design without requiring that certain features
   common to existing LWRs, such as containment sprays, be safety related.
   Clearly, ERVC offers the potential to reduce the AP600's construction
   and operating costs. However, it is not clear that the ERVC proposed for
   the AP600 could provide sufficient heat removal for higher-power
   reactors {[}up to 1500 MW(electric)] without additional enhancements.
   This paper reviews efforts made and results reported regarding the
   enhancement of IVR in LWRs. Where appropriate, the paper identifies what
   additional data or analyses are needed to demonstrate that there is
   sufficient margin for successful IVR in high-power thermal reactors.},

Title = {Last Glacial Maximum and the Gschnitz stadial in the Maritime Alps

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Two glacial deposits in the Gesso valley (Maritime, Alps) have been
   Be-10-dated at 20 140+/-1080 (weighted mean+/-SD) and 16 590+/-970
   years, respectively, thus constraining the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
   and Gschnitz stadials in the southwestern part of the Alps. The LGM age
   is chronologically coherent with MIS 2 and synchronous with most other
   LGM moraines in the Alps. The Gschnitz stadial also appears to be in
   agreement with the ages obtained from other Alpine sites and with
   Heinrich Event I. This suggests that the Alpine glaciers reacted
   simultaneously and essentially synchronously with the climate change
   associated with Heinrich Event 1. The Equilibrium Line Altitudes (ELAs)
   of the LGM and Gschnitz reconstructed palaeoglaciers are 1850 and 1910 m
   a.s.l., respectively. The ELA comparison across the Alps indicates that
   the palaeoclimate of the Maritime Alps during the LGM was rather
   different from that of other Alpine sectors. However, the similar
   Gschnitz ELA value between the Gesso valley and other sites across the
   mountain chain indicates that Alpine glaciers responded with the same
   intensity to the climate change associated with Heinrich Event I.
   Overall, these results suggest that the interaction between the
   atmospheric circulation of air masses and local Alpine orography was
   more complex than has previously been argued.},

Title = {Climate-Endangered Arctic Epishelf Lake Harbors Viral Assemblages with
   Distinct Genetic Repertoires},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Viruses are key to understanding polar aquatic ecosystems, which are
   dominated by microorganisms. However, studies of viral communities are
   challenging to interpret because the vast majority of viruses are known
   only from sequence fragments, and their taxonomy, hosts, and genetic
   repertoires are unknown.
   Milne Fiord, located on the coastal margin of the Last Ice Area (LIA) in
   the High Arctic (82 degrees N, Canada), harbors an epishelf lake, a rare
   type of ice-dependent ecosystem in which a layer of freshwater overlies
   marine water connected to the open ocean. This microbe-dominated
   ecosystem faces catastrophic change due to the deterioration of its ice
   environment related to warming temperatures. We produced the first
   assessment of viral abundance, diversity, and distribution in this
   vulnerable ecosystem and explored the niches available for viral taxa
   and the functional genes underlying their distribution. We found that
   the viral community in the freshwater layer was distinct from, and more
   diverse than, the community in the underlying seawater and contained a
   different set of putative auxiliary metabolic genes, including the
   sulfur starvation-linked gene tauD and the gene coding for patatin-like
   phospholipase. The halocline community resembled the freshwater more
   than the marine community, but harbored viral taxa unique to this layer.
   We observed distinct viral assemblages immediately below the halocline,
   at a depth that was associated with a peak of prasinophyte algae and the
   viral family Phycodnaviridae. We also assembled 15 complete circular
   genomes, including a putative Pelagibacter phage with a marine
   distribution. It appears that despite its isolated and precarious
   situation, the varied niches in this epishelf lake support a diverse
   viral community, highlighting the importance of characterizing
   underexplored microbiota in the Last Ice Area before these ecosystems
   undergo irreversible change. IMPORTANCE Viruses are key to understanding
   polar aquatic ecosystems, which are dominated by microorganisms.
   However, studies of viral communities are challenging to interpret
   because the vast majority of viruses are known only from sequence
   fragments, and their taxonomy, hosts, and genetic repertoires are
   unknown. Our study establishes a basis for comparison that will advance
   understanding of viral ecology in diverse global environments,
   particularly in the High Arctic. Rising temperatures in this region mean
   that researchers have limited time remaining to understand the
   biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles of ice-dependent environments and
   the consequences of these rapid, irreversible changes. The case of the
   Milne Fiord epishelf lake has special urgency because of the rarity of
   this type of ``floating lake{''} ecosystem and its location in the Last
   Ice Area, a region of thick sea ice with global importance for
   conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {The effect of different commercially available marine fish diets on
   production characteristics and body composition of juvenile Cobia
   Rachycentron canadum reared in production-scale recirculating
   aquaculture systems was evaluated in a 57-d growth trial. Juvenile Cobia
   (mean weight +/- SE, 26.7 +/- 0.9g) were stocked at an initial density
   of 1.2kg/m3. After stocking, fish were fed one of three closed-formula
   diets formulated for carnivorous marine finfish (coded diet A, 50\%
   crude protein : 22\% crude lipid; diet B, 49\% crude protein : 17\%
   crude lipid; and diet C, 48\% crude protein : 17\% crude lipid), all at
   a targeted feed rate of 35\% body weight per day. At 2-week intervals,
   10\% of the population of each tank was sampled to determine mean
   weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion efficiency,
   and biomass. At the termination of the trial, the entire population of
   each tank was harvested to determine the same characteristics and
   survival. In addition, fish were sampled to determine relative changes
   in whole body composition, energy retention, protein efficiency ratio,
   and protein productive value. Final weight (203.3g), specific growth
   rate (3.6\%/d), feed conversion efficiency (92.2\%), biomass (7.3kg/m3),
   and protein productive value (25.2\%) of fish fed the high-lipid diet A
   were significantly higher than those of fish fed the other two diets. No
   differences in whole body composition were observed among fish fed the
   three diets with the exception of dry matter composition. Contrary to
   previous reports, the results of the current study indicate that
   juvenile Cobia reared in production-scale recirculating aquaculture
   systems fed high-lipid diets exhibit protein sparing and better growth.

Title = {Urban change in Goa, India},

Abstract = {Sustainable management of urban regions in coastal areas has become
   vital particularly in developing countries. Uncontrolled urban sprawl
   has the potential to be detrimental to coastal regions, irreversibly
   damaging vulnerable and valuable natural landscapes. This paper analyzes
   spatiotemporal trends in urban development of four municipalities in
   Goa, India. Landscape metrics were conducted based on urban land use
   classification. In the last decade, Goa has experienced rapid
   urbanization, which has been closely linked to their paralleled
   expansion in the tourism industry corresponding to the largest sector of
   the state's economy. Tourism development and policy in Goa largely focus
   on coastal regions, leading to a decline in tourist activity further
   inland. This has accelerated urban development and put pressure on the
   coastal landscapes. Current planning policies implemented by the state
   suggests that proper attention is given to mitigation of anthropogenic
   activity, however the dynamics of the urban sprawl continue to be
   uncontrolled and sporadic. Thus, sustainable development is crucial to
   the continued welfare of the state, and particularly within the reach of
   economic drivers such as tourism in Goa. The methods and techniques
   adopted in this paper, combine spatial metrics along with urban
   footprints, to obtain a complex understanding of the impacts urban
   development has on potentially vulnerable coastal stretches. The
   increase of urban areas has been predominantly found along the existing
   historical urban areas of Goa and the implementation of landscape
   metrics has allowed to shape an objective vision of the consequences of
   Goa's urbanization processes along its vulnerable coastal stretches. (C)

Title = {Ranking 67 Florida Reefs for Survival of Acropora cervicornis Outplants},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Over the past three decades, coral populations have declined across the
   tropical and subtropical oceans because of thermal stress, coral
   diseases, and pollution. Restoration programs are currently attempting
   to re-establish depauperate coral populations along the Florida reef
   tract. We took an integrated Bayesian approach to determine which
   Florida reefs ranked highest based on the survival of outplanted
   colonies of Acropora cervicornis from 2012 to 2018. Survival of A.
   cervicornis outplants was highly variable in the upper Florida Keys with
   some reefs showing the highest likelihood of survival (e.g., North Dry
   Rocks, Carysfort, Key Largo Dry Rocks, and Conch Reef), whereas some
   adjacent reefs showed the lowest likelihood of survival (e.g., an
   Unnamed Reef, Pickles Reef, and U47 Patch Reef). Similarly, survival was
   highly variable in the middle and lower Florida Keys and in the
   Broward-Miami subregions. Survival was high and less variable in
   Biscayne Bay and low and less variable in the Marquesas subregions. The
   reefs that ranked lowest for outplant survival were exposed to high wave
   energy. Partitioning out the spatial effects of reefs and subregions
   from the model, we detected spatial latent effects of low survival that
   were most evident in the middle and the upper Florida Keys, particularly
   between 2015 and 2017. The overall high spatial and temporal variability
   in survival among adjacent reefs highlights a need to outplant
   nursery-reared colonies strategically, in order to optimize
   coral-population recovery efforts in Florida.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {469-473},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Natural coastal shorelines change constantly due to various phenomena
   such as tides, waves, and weather. Shoreline change data are important
   for coastal management, which deals with issues including coastal
   erosion and sedimentation trends and setbacks. It has been reported that
   Chollipo Beach in Taeangun, Chungnamdo, in the western part of South
   Korea, has been progressively sedimented over the past years. In this
   study, a photogrammetric analysis was conducted to determine the
   characteristics of the shoreline of Chollipo Beach over twenty years. In
   the analysis, photogrammetric aerial triangulation using old digital
   aerial images from 1986 and unmanned aerial vehicle images from 2020
   were considered. In addition, network GPS surveying was performed for
   the acquisition of ground control points in the bundle adjustments
   stage. Finally, a digital surface model and mosaicked orthoimages were
   generated. For the analysis, contour lines and beach profiles were
   extracted. The analysis results show that over 25 years, the shorelines
   moved towards the sea by a maximum distance of 100 m and deposited sands
   reached a height of 1.84 m.},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion is a major concern and a threat to the coastal habitats,
   livelihood and socio-economic developments. The aims of the present
   research are to investigate the beach dynamics, status, and protection
   measures of world famous nesting habitat near Rushikulya estuary, south
   Odisha coast, India. Shoreline mapping and rate of changes for a period
   of 8 years (2005-2013) on each side of the inlet, 3-year beach profile
   study at six transects, and 2 years (2009 and 2010) of sediment texture
   studies along with coastal processes provide a clear glance of the
   nesting beach health. The nesting beach changes observed were
   significant erosion (47-126 m) with northward growth of sand spit and
   deposition at the beach due to deformation of spit. From 2008 to 2011,
   the southern part of the beach experienced high erosion, while the
   northern part is under erosion and deposition with seasons. Medium sand
   predominated along the beach, while the foreshore zone at the northern
   part has fine sand along with sediment accumulation during the northeast
   monsoon period. Annual changes in wave pattern and reversal wind and
   current conditions make beach cyclic at the northern part of the nesting
   beach, while the status of the southern part of the beach depends upon
   the inlet shifting and human intervention on sand spit situated at the
   south of Rushikulya estuary. To avoid chronic erosion at the nesting
   beach, the sand spit needs to be cut from the mainland through regular
   monitoring of beach. The present study may help to prepare a framework
   for proper management and conservation of nesting habitat.},

Title = {GRADHIST - A method for detection and analysis of oceanic fronts from
   remote sensing data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {264-280},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Oceanic shelf sea fronts have significant effects on local dynamics,
   ecology and climate. An assessment of the impact of climate change on
   frontal positions and frontal gradients requires reliable reference data
   and the possibility to monitor oceanic fronts. Therefore, the
   development of algorithms which automatically detect frontal positions
   from Earth Observation (EO) data is an important tool to analyse long EO
   time series, i.e. to process big data volumes. The development of
   GRADHIST was driven by the need to generate a climatology for North Sea
   fronts. GRADHIST is a new algorithm for the detection and mapping of
   oceanic fronts, which is based on a combination and refinement of the
   gradient algorithm of Canny (1986) and the histogram algorithm of Cayula
   and Cornillon (1992). GRADHIST preserves the main principles of both
   algorithms and can be applied to various ocean parameters as well as to
   different sensors with very little effort. GRADHIST was validated and
   tested using both synthetic and real data and applied to sea surface
   temperature and ocean colour parameters retrieved from satellite data;
   i.e. data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer),
   MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer), AVHRR (Advanced Very
   High Resolution Radiometer) and AATSR (Advanced Along Track Scanning
   Radiometer). Selected results and statistical analysis of a new North
   Sea climatology for oceanic fronts are presented and discussed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The amount of live and dead coral is related to recruitment, but
   differentiating them by remote sensing techniques is difficult. We
   measured change in the amount of live, bleached, and recently (<6
   months) dead coral cover (CCA6) for an island archipelago in the South
   China Sea. Six Landsat 4/7 ETM/8 OLI images from 1989-1990, 2005, and
   2014 were analyzed to assess changes in CCA6 at 14 coral reefs in the
   western Xisha Islands. Satellite images were georectified and calibrated
   to remote sensing reflectance. Models for three shallow water (<6 m)
   geomorphic zones throughout the western Xisha Islands are proposed based
   on ground-truthed data collected in 2014 and satellite-determined
   spectral values for 2014 images. Nonlinear models based on Landsat image
   blue spectral bands for reef slope and lagoon habitats, and green bands
   for reef flat habitats, are determined as optimal models. Significant
   changes in CCA6 from 2005 to 2014, and changes in coral reefs and
   geomorphic zones, correlate with increased numbers of both
   crown-of-thorns starfish, and sea surface temperature in 2007. Detecting
   change in CCA6 by remote sensing can provide large-scale information of
   value for coral reef management, restoration, and protection.},

Title = {Properties and biases of the global heat flow compilation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Geothermal heat flow is inferred from the gradient of temperature values
   in boreholes or short-penetration probe measurements. Such measurements
   are expensive and logistically challenging in remote locations and,
   therefore, often targeted to regions of economic interest. As a result,
   measurements are not distributed evenly. Some tectonic, geologic and
   even topographic settings are overrepresented in global heat flow
   compilations; other settings are underrepresented or completely missing.
   These limitations in representation have implications for empirical heat
   flow models that use catalogue data to assign heat flow by the
   similarity of observables. In this contribution, we analyse the sampling
   bias in the Global Heat Flow database of the International Heat Flow
   Commission; the most recent and extensive heat flow catalogue, and
   discuss the implications for accurate prediction and global appraisals.
   We also suggest correction weights to reduce the bias when the catalogue
   is used for empirical modelling. From comparison with auxiliary
   variables, we find that each of the following settings is highly
   overrepresented for heat flow measurements; continental crust,
   sedimentary rocks, volcanic rocks, and Phanerozoic regions with
   hydrocarbon exploration. Oceanic crust, cratons, and metamorphic rocks
   are underrepresented. The findings also suggest a general tendency to
   measure heat flow in areas where the values are elevated; however, this
   conclusion depends on which auxiliary variable is under consideration to
   determine the settings. We anticipate that using our correction weights
   to balance disproportional representation will improve empirical heat
   flow models for remote regions and assist in the ongoing assessment of
   the Global Heat Flow database.},

Abstract = {Expansion of the monospecific mangrove, Kandelia obovata, has converted
   intertidal mudflats and other habitats into mangrove forests, thus
   reducing estuarine biodiversity in the Danshuei River estuary, northern
   Taiwan. Dense mangrove vegetation was removed to create a small
   patchwork of mudflats and a tidal creek in February 2007. Subsequent
   changes in sediment properties and biodiversity of the macrobenthos and
   avian communities were examined. The results showed that the creation of
   different habitats led to changes in sediment properties and
   biodiversity. The water content and sorting degree of the sediments
   differed significantly among the restored mudflat, the tidal creek, and
   the mangrove control site. Silt/clay, organic carbon content, and
   chlorophyll a concentrations varied seasonally, but not among sites. The
   abundance of polychaetes in the creek was greater than that in the
   mudflat or the mangrove (12.5 vs. 5.3 and 2.2 individuals/m2,
   respectively), suggesting preferential colonization of infaunal
   polychaetes in habitats with prolonged submersion. Crabs showed seasonal
   changes in density, with higher densities in summer than in autumn and
   winter. The species richness of wintering shorebirds on the created
   mudflat increased dramatically from 2002 to 2007. The transformation of
   a vegetated area into an open mudflat appeared to benefit shorebirds by
   providing roosting habitat. Our study demonstrated that controlling the
   spread of estuarine mangrove forests could increase biodiversity, and
   could particularly benefit the migratory shorebird community.},

Abstract = {Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis is an important commercial macroalgae.
   However, G. lemaneiformis strains with curly branches (CB), located at
   tertiary order with different phenotype when compared with those with
   normal branches (NB), were found in the cultivation region. This study
   investigated CB of G. lemaneiformis. The results revealed that CB
   exhibited loosely arranged epidermal cells with decreased number of
   layers; thickened cell wall of medullary cells; reduced plastids with
   loose lamellas; and lower specific growth rate, pigment contents,
   chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and nucleic acid contents when
   compared with NB. Genes involved in plastid, pyrimidine, and purine
   biosynthesis as well as nitrogen metabolism were enriched, whereas those
   encoding small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) in the vicinity of
   transposable elements (TEs) were evidently down regulated in CB. The
   morphological changes in CB might be caused by the alteration at
   microstructural level. The photosystem II (PSII) in CB presented weak
   light energy utilization ability and electron transfer activity,
   compared with that in NB, and the photosynthetic structure of CB may be
   damaged, which further exerted negative effect on photosynthetic
   intensity. The reduced plastid structure may be one of the reasons for
   the decreased photosynthetic intensity of CB. Genes encoding glutamine
   synthetase involved in nitrogen metabolism were down-regulated in CB,
   resulting in decrease in nucleic acids synthesis. Under certain stress
   condition, TEs in the vicinity of sHSPs genes were activated, leading to
   a decrease in sHSPs, causing loss of algal flexibility to cope with
   changes in the external environment. These results provided valuable
   information about irregular branches formation in G. lemaneiformis.},

   slope across the deep Arctic Eurasian Basins and the Gakkel Ridge to the
   Lomonosov Ridge to determine bacterial biomasses and organic carbon
   contents. Bacterial abundance dropped along the transect from 3.03 to
   0.63 x 10(8) cells/cm(3), and correspondingly bacterial biomass
   decreased from 17.35 to 3.43 mu g C/cm(3) sediment. Positve correlations
   were only found between total organic carbon concentrations of surface
   sediment layers and biomasses of small coccoid cells and small rods. The
   ridges and slopes seem to be sedimentation areas for the larger coccoid
   cells, presumably cyanobacteria.},

Abstract = {A photobioreactor was constructed using anchored polyurethane foam
   strips (1 x 1 x 40 cm) fixed onto a stainless-steel ring to prevent
   flotation, as a biomass support material (BSM). This type of reactor was
   named a seaweed-type bioreactor. A filamentous cyanobacterium, Scytonema
   sp. TISTR 8208, which produces a novel cyclic dodecapeptide antibiotic,
   was immobilized in seaweed-type photobioreactor and cultivated with air
   containing 5\% CO2 sparged at a gas flow rate of 250 mL/min under
   illumination at a light intensity of 200 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). The
   antibiotic produced in the seaweed-type photobioreactor was purified by
   HPLC and examined regarding its spectrum and mode of action. The
   antibiotic effectively inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria,
   pathogenic yeasts, and filamentous fungi, but it had only a weak effect
   on Gram-negative bacteria. Scanning electron micrograph analysis showed
   that the most characteristic change was swelling of the cells after
   exposure to the antibiotic. The antibiotic seems to alter the
   conformation of the microbial cell membrane, thereby changing its
   permeability, leading to osmotic shock.},

Abstract = {Nanofluids have been widely used as a class of promising working fluids
   with excellent heat transfer properties. However, the theoretical
   research on the thermal enhancement mechanism of nanofluids is still in
   the preliminary stage. Fractional constitutive models provide a new
   powerful tool to investigate the superior mechanical and thermal
   properties of nanofluids owing to their advantages in depicting the
   memory and genetic properties of the system. Fractional nanofluid models
   have become one of the hot research topics in recent years as better
   control of flow behavior and heat transfer can be achieved by
   considering fractional derivatives. The existing studies have indicated
   that the results obtained by the fractional-order nanofluid model are
   more consistent with the experimental results than traditional
   integer-order models. The purpose of this review is to identify the
   advantages and applications of fractional nanofluid models. First,
   various definitions of fractional derivatives and correlations of flux
   utilized in nanofluid modeling are presented. Then, the recent
   researches on nanofluids with fractional derivatives are sorted and
   analyzed. The impacts of fractional parameters on flow behaviors and
   heat transfer enhancement are also highlighted according to the
   Buongiorno model as well as the Tiwari and Das nanofluid model with
   fractional operators. Finally, applications of fractional nanofluids in
   many emerging fields such as solar energy, seawater desalination, cancer
   therapy, and microfluidic devices are addressed in detail.},

Journal = {DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this study, long-term change of wind characteristics on the Black Sea
   has been investigated using two widely used data sources, i.e., European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim and
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction/Climate Forecast System
   Reanalysis (NCEP/CFSR), spanning 40 years between 1979 and 2018. Spatial
   and seasonal variability of climatic features such as the wind speed,
   direction, number and duration of storms, and wind power density are
   discussed. Wind climate is characterized by strong, durable and stable
   winds in the northern and western Black Sea, and relatively weak,
   short-lived and highly-variable winds in the eastern Black Sea. These
   long-term wind patterns indicate that the eastern part of the basin is
   likely to be subjected to the impacts of climate change. Long-term
   stable and strong wind conditions in the southwest part indicate
   reliable, persistent and sustainable wind energy potential. Long-term
   and seasonal variation of wind power density (WPD) at 110 m altitude
   over the Black Sea is investigated. There is a significant difference in
   WPD values between winter and summer seasons, with around 2.8 times
   larger WPD in winter than that in summer. In the western Black Sea,
   narrow confidence intervals observed in each season indicate a low level
   of variation during a season and ensures stable wind power conditions.},

Abstract = {A key question in ecology is which factors control species diversity in
   a community(1-3). Two largely separate groups of ecologists have
   emphasized the importance of productivity or resource supply, and
   consumers or physical disturbance, respectively. These variables show
   unimodal relationships with diversity when manipulated in
   isolation(4-8). Recent multivariate models(9-10), however, predict that
   these factors interact, such that the disturbance-diversity relationship
   depends on productivity, and vice versa. We tested these models in
   marine food webs, using field manipulations of nutrient resources and
   consumer pressure on rocky shores of contrasting productivity. Here we
   show that the effects of consumers and nutrients on diversity
   consistently depend on each other, and that the direction of their
   effects and peak diversity shift between sites of low and high
   productivity. Factorial meta-analysis of published experiments confirms
   these results across widely varying aquatic communities. Furthermore,
   our experiments demonstrate that these patterns extend to important
   ecosystem functions such as carbon storage and nitrogen retention. This
   suggests that human impacts on nutrient supply(11) and food-web
   structure(12,13) have strong and interdependent effects on species
   diversity and ecosystem functioning, and must therefore be managed

Title = {Rhombic calcite microcrystals as a textural proxy for meteoric
   diagenesis},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Numerous Phanerozoic limestones are comprised of diagenetic calcite
   microcrystals formed during mineralogical stabilization of metastable
   carbonate sediments. Previous laboratory experiments show that calcite
   microcrystals crystallizing under conditions similar to those that
   characterize meteoric diagenetic settings (impurity-free, low degree of
   supersaturation, high fluid:solid ratio) exhibit the rhombic
   form/morphology, whereas calcite microcrystals crystallizing under
   conditions similar to those that prevail in marine and marine burial
   diagenetic settings (impurity-rich, high degree of supersaturation, low
   fluid:solid ratio) exhibit non-rhombic forms. Based on these
   experimental observations, it is proposed here that rhombic calcite
   microcrystals form exclusively in meteoric environments. This hypothesis
   is tested using new and previously published textural and geochemical
   data from the rock record. These data show that the vast majority of
   Phanerozoic limestones characterized by rhombic microcrystals also
   exhibit petrographic and/or geochemical evidence (depleted delta C-13,
   delta O-18, and trace elements) indicative of meteoric diagenesis
   whereas non-rhombic forms are associated with marine burial conditions.
   By linking calcite microcrystal textures to specific diagenetic
   environments, our observations bring clarity to the conditions under
   which the various microcrystal textures form. Furthermore, the
   hypothesis that rhombic calcite microcrystals form exclusively in
   meteoric environments implies that this crystal form may be a useful
   textural proxy for meteoric diagenesis.},

Title = {Was there an abrupt cold climatic event in the middle Eemian? Pollen

Abstract = {Seventy samples of lacustrine sediments from a palaeolake at the
   Hieronimowo site, NE Poland were investigated by pollen analysis method.
   The obtained results indicate that the examined sequence spans the whole
   Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5e), the beginning of the Early Vistulian
   (Weichselian; MIS 5d) and some undefined period of the Plenivistulian
   (Middle Weichselian; MIS 2-4). The specific feature of the studied
   profile is the great thickness of deposits representing the hornbeam
   phase of the Eemian Interglacial (E5 R PAZ), which was the younger part
   of the climatic optimum of this interglacial, and the very well
   developed pollen record of this phase, that is absent in other profiles
   in NE Poland. Due to this, our study allowed, for the first time in NE
   Poland, the detailed reconstruction of changes in the vegetation and in
   the mean January and July temperature during the middle part of the
   Eemian Interglacial. This reconstruction unequivocally rules out the
   existence of an abrupt short-lasting cold event at that time. Only a
   gradual slight increase in temperature was apparent during the older
   part of the hornbeam phase (to > 21 degrees C for July, and to > 0
   degrees C for January) and gradual decrease during its younger part (to
   > 17 degrees C for July, and to > -5 degrees C and <-2 degrees C for
   January). So during the warmest part of the hornbeam phase,
   reconstructed temperatures for July were similar as in older part of the
   Eemian optimum (hazel phase, E4 R PAZ), however they were approximately
   2 degrees C higher for January. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All

Abstract = {The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) will enable new military,
   scientific, and commercial applications at sea. However, powering of
   electronic devices in deep water still remains one of the main
   challenges, since these systems are typically powered by traditional
   batteries. This article presents the design of the first batteryless
   underwater sensor node that can be wirelessly recharged through
   ultrasonic waves from longer distances than allowed by current
   technologies. First, the architecture of an underwater platform capable
   of extracting electrical energy from ultrasonic waves is introduced. We
   then illustrate how to interface this system with an underwater digital
   communication unit. We discuss the design of a prototype where the
   storage unit is realized with a batch of supercapacitors. We show
   through experiments that the harvested energy is sufficient to provide
   the sensor node with the power necessary to perform a sensing operation
   and power a modem for ultrasonic communications. In the article, we
   evaluate the system power transfer efficiency. Given the reduced
   attenuation of ultrasonic waves in water, we show that our approach can
   cover longer distances with less transmission power than alternative
   solutions. Last, we experimentally evaluate the overall operating
   efficiency of the system.},

Title = {The Global Seamount Census},
Journal = {OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {24-33},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Seamounts are active or extinct undersea volcanoes with heights
   exceeding similar to 100 m. They represent a small but significant
   fraction of the volcanic extrusive budget for oceanic seafloor and their
   distribution gives information about spatial and temporal variations in
   intraplate volcanic activity. In addition, they sustain important
   ecological communities, determine habitats for fish, and act as
   obstacles to Currents, thus enhancing tidal energy dissipation and ocean
   mixing. Mapping the complete global distribution will help constrain
   models of seamount formation as well as aid in understanding marine
   habitats and deep ocean circulation. Two approaches have been used to
   map the global seamount distribution. Depth soundings from single- and
   multibeam echosounders can provide the most detailed maps with up to
   200-m horizontal resolution. However, soundings from the > 5000 publicly
   available cruises sample only a small fraction of the ocean floor.
   Satellite altimetry can detect seamounts taller than similar to 1.5 km,
   and. studies using altimetry have produced seamount catalogues holding
   almost 13,000 seamounts. Based on the size-frequency relationship for
   larger seamounts, we predict over 100,000 seamounts > 1 km in height
   remain uncharted, and speculatively 25 million > 100 m in height. Future
   altimetry missions could improve on resolution and significantly
   decrease noise levels, allowing for an even larger number of
   intermediate (1-1.5-km height) seamounts to be detected. Recent
   retracking of the radar altimeter waveforms to improve the accuracy of
   the gravity field has resulted in a twofold increase in resolution.
   Thus, improved analyses of existing altimetry with better calibration
   from multibeam bathymetry could also increase census estimates.},

Title = {Using an AGCM to Diagnose Historical Effective Radiative Forcing and
   Mechanisms of Recent Decadal Climate Change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1193-1209},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An atmospheric general circulation model is forced with observed monthly
   sea surface temperature and sea ice boundary conditions, as well as
   forcing agents that vary in time, for the period 1979-2008. The
   simulations are then repeated with various forcing agents, individually
   and in combination, fixed at preindustrial levels. The simple
   experimental design allows the diagnosis of the model's global and
   regional time-varying effective radiative forcing from 1979 to 2008
   relative to preindustrial levels. Furthermore the design can be used to
   (i) calculate the atmospheric model's feedback/sensitivity parameters to
   observed changes in sea surface temperature and (ii) separate those
   aspects of climate change that are directly driven by the forcing from
   those driven by large-scale changes in sea surface temperature. It is
   shown that the atmospheric response to increased radiative forcing over
   the last 3 decades has halved the global precipitation response to
   surface warming. Trends in sea surface temperature and sea ice are found
   to contribute only similar to 60\% of the global land, Northern
   Hemisphere, and summer land warming trends. Global effective radiative
   forcing is similar to 1.5 W m(-2) in this model, with anthropogenic and
   natural contributions of similar to 1.3 and similar to 0.2 W m(-2),
   respectively. Forcing increases by similar to 0.5 W m(-2) decade(-1)
   over the period 1979-2008 or similar to 0.4 W m(-2) decade(-1) if years
   strongly influenced by volcanic forcingswhich are nonlinear with timeare
   excluded from the trend analysis. Aerosol forcing shows little global
   decadal trend due to offsetting regional trends whereby negative aerosol
   forcing weakens in Europe and North America but continues to strengthen
   in Southeast Asia.},

Title = {Fasting in the ureotelic Lake Magadi tilapia, Alcolapia grahami, does
   not reduce its high metabolic demand, increasing its vulnerability to
   siltation events},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Lake Magadi, Kenya, is one of the most extreme aquatic environments on
   Earth (pH similar to 10, anoxic to hyperoxic, high temperatures).
   Recently, increased water demand and siltation have threatened the
   viable hot springs near the margins of the lake where Alcolapia grahami,
   the only fish surviving in the lake, live. These Lake Magadi tilapia
   largely depend on nitrogen-rich cyanobacteria for food and are 100\%
   ureotelic. Their exceptionally high aerobic metabolic rate, together
   with their emaciated appearance, suggests that they are energy-limited.
   Therefore, we hypothesized that during food deprivation, Magadi tilapia
   would economize their energy expenditure and reduce metabolic rate,
   aerobic performance and urea-N excretion. Surprisingly, during a 5-day
   fasting period, routine metabolic rates increased and swimming
   performance (critical swimming speed) was not affected. Urea-N excretion
   remained stable despite the lack of their N-rich food source. Their
   nitrogen use switched to endogenous sources as liver and muscle protein
   levels decreased after a 5-day fast, indicating proteolysis.
   Additionally, fish relied on carbohydrates with lowered muscle glycogen
   levels, but there were no signs indicating use of lipid stores. Gene
   expression of gill and gut urea transporters were transiently reduced as
   were gill rhesus glycoprotein Rhbg and Rhcg-2. The reduction in gill
   glutamine synthetase expression concomitant with the reduction in Rh
   glycoprotein gene expression indicates reduced nitrogen/ammonia
   metabolism, most likely decreased protein synthesis. Additionally, fish
   showed reduced plasma total CO2, osmolality and Na+ (but not Cl-)
   levels, possibly related to reduced drinking rates and metabolic
   acidosis. Our work shows that Lake Magadi tilapia have the capacity to
   survive short periods of starvation which could occur when siltation
   linked to flash floods covers their main food source, but their
   seemingly hardwired high metabolic rates would compromise long-term
   survival.},

Abstract = {The facultative methylotroph Bacillus methanolicus MGA3 has previously
   been genetically engineered to overproduce the amino acids L-lysine and
   L-glutamate and their derivatives cadaverine and gamma-aminobutyric acid
   (GABA) from methanol at 50 degrees C. We here explored the potential of
   utilizing the sugar alcohol mannitol and seaweed extract (SWE)
   containing mannitol, as alternative feedstocks for production of
   chemicals by fermentation using B. methanolicus. Extracts of the brown
   algae Saccharina latissima harvested in the Trondheim Fjord in Norway
   were prepared and found to contain 12-13 g/l of mannitol, with
   conductivities corresponding to a salt content of similar to 2\% NaCl.
   Initially, 12 B. methanolicus wild type strains were tested for
   tolerance to various SWE concentrations, and some strains including MGA3
   could grow on 50\% SWE medium. Non-methylotrophic and methylotrophic
   growth of B. methanolicus rely on differences in regulation of metabolic
   pathways, and we compared production titers of GABA and cadaverine under
   such growth conditions. Shake flask experiments showed that recombinant
   MGA3 strains could produce similar and higher titers of cadaverine
   during growth on 50\% SWE and mannitol, compared to on methanol. GABA
   production levels under these conditions were however low compared to
   growth on methanol. We present the first fed-batch mannitol fermentation
   of B. methanolicus and production of 6.3 g/l cadaverine. Finally, we
   constructed a recombinant MGA3 strain synthesizing the C30 terpenoids
   4,4 `-diaponeurosporene and 4,4 `-diapolycopene, experimentally
   confirming that B. methanolicus has a functional methylerythritol
   phosphate (MEP) pathway. Together, our results contribute to extending
   the range of both the feedstocks for growth and products that can be
   synthesized by B. methanolicus.},

Title = {Urban church forests for local temperature regulation: Implications the
   role of managing and incorporating urban green space in urban planning},

Abstract = {The global surface temperature shows an increment of 0.5 +/- 0.1 degrees
   C per decade and 1.05 +/- 0.3 degrees C per century from 1880-2014 with
   greater increases in cities than non-urban areas. Global communities are
   shifting towards urbanization due to various factors. Urbanization has
   caused lack of stable condition for dwellers due to environmental and
   anthropogenic factors such as land cover changes. Urban temperature
   rising is the main factors hindering urban dwellers at global level due
   to insufficient green areas. Social institutions are playing important
   role in urban greening and urban climate regulation. Ethiopian Orthodox
   Tewahido Church has long history in indigenous trees biodiversity
   conservation that plays largely greening role in urban and rural parts
   of the country. However, there is a research gap in Ethiopia regarding
   the role of urban green area in the church yards in regulating urban
   temperature and microclimate change. Therefore, the study evaluated the
   role of church managed forests in Addis Ababa in regulating surface
   temperature. Surface temperature inside four church forests at a buffer
   radius of 0-50 m, 50-100 m, 100-200 m and 200-500 m estimated using
   Landsat image thermal band 6 of 1986, 2000 and 2010 and ground
   measurement by ambient thermometer at 10:00 am, 12:30 am and 3:00 pm
   local time. The ground measurement was done in order to validate
   satellite image analysis. Plant species diversity, DBH, H, HC, BH and BA
   was measured. There were 1167 trees in the four studied churches. The
   mean temperatures of the studied sites were 22.5 +/- 0.1, 23.25 +/- 0.2,
   24 +/- 0.6, 24.6 +/- 1.1 and 25.5 +/- 2.2 degrees C on site,0-50 m,
   50-100 m,100-200m and 200-500 m respectively for 1986 images; 23.2 +/-
   0.5, 23.3 +/- 1.0, 24.3 +/- 2.1, 24.8 +/- 2.2 and 25.5 +/- 1.8 degrees C
   on site, 0-50 m, 50100 m, 100-200 m and 200-500 m respectively for 2000
   images and 23.2 +/- 0.3, 23.27 +/- 0.2, 23.7 +/- 1.6, 24 +/- 1.4 and
   24.7 +/- 1.3 degrees C on site, 0-50 m, 50-100 m, 100-200 m and 200-500
   m respectively for 2010 images. The result illustrated a significant
   influence of green area on urban temperature in the buffering radius and
   implies the possibility of regulating urban temperature by planning
   urban green area in appropriate radius intervals. The study indicated
   that church forests in particular, social institution and urban green
   area in general have significant role in urban temperature regulation.},

Title = {A conceptual design of an underwater vehicle},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {33},
Number = {16},
Pages = {2087-2104},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The paper presents a conceptual design of an underwater star wars'
   system, which will be more difficult to detect by the enemy than a
   recently proposed `surface' star wars' system. The paper suggests that
   for the proposed structures needed for the underwater star wars' system,
   the material of construction should be a composite and not a metal, as
   use of the latter for large deep diving underwater vessels will result
   in such structures sinking to the bottom of the ocean like stones, due
   to the fact that they will have no reserve buoyancy. The paper also
   shows that composites have better sound absorption characteristics,
   thereby making the underwater structures difficult to detect through
   sonar equipment. It is proposed that these underwater structures should
   operate up to a depth of 7.16 miles (11.52 km), as at this depth, all of
   the oceans' bottoms can be reached.
   The author shows that current technology can be used to construct and
   operate such vessels, but more progress needs to be made with metal
   matrix and ceramic composites, so that the hulls of underwater missiles
   and torpedoes can be constructed in these materials. (C) 2006 Elsevier

Journal = {ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {81-93},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We investigated the effect of microbial activity on the chemistry of
   hydrothermal fluids related to the Vicano-Cimino system, central Italy.
   The database included the composition and delta C-13 CO2 and delta C-13
   CH4 values for soil gas from an area characterized by intense degassing
   of fluids having a deep origin. The delta C-13 CH4 values along vertical
   profiles in the soil indicated that CH4 was controlled by microbial
   oxidation occurring at shallow (< 50 cm) depth, where free O-2 was
   available. This was consistent with the vertical gradients of CH4, H2S
   and O-2 concentrations. The delta C-13 CO2 values in soil gas,
   characterized by a composition similar to that of the hydrothermal
   fluids, were not significantly influenced by biodegradation. On the
   contrary, gas strongly affected by air contamination showed a
   significant delta C-13 CO2 fractionation. Microbial activity caused
   strong consumption of hydrothermal alkanes, alkenes, cyclics and
   hydrogenated halocarbons, whereas benzene was recalcitrant. Oxygenated
   compounds from hydrocarbon degradation consisted of alcohols, with minor
   aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids. A predominance of alcohols at a
   high rate of degassing flux, corresponding to a short residence time of
   hydrothermal gas within the soil, indicated incomplete oxidation.
   N-bearing compounds were likely produced by humic substances in the soil
   and/or related to contamination by pesticides, whereas alpha-pinene
   traced air entering the soil. The study demonstrates that microbial
   communities in the soil play an important role for mitigating the
   release to the atmosphere of C-bearing gases, especially CH4, through
   diffuse soil degassing, a mechanism that in central Italy significantly
   contributes to the discharge of CO2-rich gas from deep sources. (C) 2015

Title = {Coral reef resilience to thermal stress in the Eastern Tropical Pacific},

Abstract = {Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by thermal stress caused by climate
   change. Especially devastating periods of coral loss frequently occur
   during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events originating in the
   Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). El Nino-induced thermal stress is
   considered the primary threat to ETP coral reefs. An increase in the
   frequency and intensity of ENSO events predicted in the coming decades
   threatens a pan-tropical collapse of coral reefs. During the 1982-1983
   El Nino, most reefs in the Galapagos Islands collapsed, and many more in
   the region were decimated by massive coral bleaching and mortality.
   However, after repeated thermal stress disturbances, such as those
   caused by the 1997-1998 El Nino, ETP corals reefs have demonstrated
   regional persistence and resiliency. Using a 44 year dataset (1970-2014)
   of live coral cover from the ETP, we assess whether ETP reefs exhibit
   the same decline as seen globally for other reefs. Also, we compare the
   ETP live coral cover rate of change with data from the maximum Degree
   Heating Weeks experienced by these reefs to assess the role of thermal
   stress on coral reef survival. We find that during the period 1970-2014,
   ETP coral cover exhibited temporary reductions following major ENSO
   events, but no overall decline. Further, we find that ETP reef recovery
   patterns allow coral to persist under these El Nino-stressed conditions,
   often recovering from these events in 10-15 years. Accumulative heat
   stress explains 31\% of the overall annual rate of change of living
   coral cover in the ETP. This suggests that ETP coral reefs have adapted
   to thermal extremes to date, and may have the ability to adapt to
   near-term future climate-change thermal anomalies. These findings for
   ETP reef resilience may provide general insights for the future of coral
   reef survival and recovery elsewhere under intensifying El Nino
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {Effects of thermal discharge from a coastal power plant on phytoplankton
   community were determined in subtropical Zhanjiang Bay. Two sampling
   transects were chosen up and down the Zhanjiang Plant in the Zhanjiang
   Bay, Nine stations were located along the two transects, which were
   divided into four zones. Monthly boat cruises were undertaken in the bay
   at spring up here, tide ebb slack, neap rise open and neap tide ebb
   slack respectively, during the period April-October 2012. Species
   diversity (H') showed a distinct increasing gradient from the most
   thermally polluted zone to the healthy zone. The more distinct gradient
   occurred at spring tide. Species diversity fluctuated during
   April-October 2011 and four sampling tide times with no visible
   patterns. Evenness showed indistinct gradient from the heated water
   source to the control zone, and fluctuated during April-October 2011 and
   four sampling tide times with no visible patterns. Species richness,
   cell count and Chl a concentration at mixed and healthy zones were
   significantly higher than that at heated zones, with the maximum value
   recorded at mixed zone, and showed seasonal and tidal changes with no
   obvious pattern.},

Abstract = {Carbohydrate species, such as uronic acids, play an important role in
   oceanic carbon cycling, coagulation and adsorption processes.
   Concentrations of particulate carbohydrates (PCHO) and uronic acids
   (PURA) were measured in the northern East China Sea (ECS) during June
   and November, 2006. In June, maximum concentrations of PCHO and PURA
   were observed in the surface layer of coastal waters. Their
   concentrations rapidly decreased with depth, suggesting that they are
   both bio-reactive. Moreover, phytoplankton abundance and bacteria]
   biomass seem to be associated with observed PCHO and PURA concentrations
   in the ECS during June, suggesting that production of carbohydrate
   species in the ECS is regulated by phytoplankton assemblages, bacterial
   assimilation or degradation. In November, however, PCHO and PURA
   concentrations were homogenous within the water column due to strong
   vertical mixing. No strong correlations were observed between
   carbohydrate species (PCHO and PURA) and phytoplankton or bacterial
   biomass, suggesting that production of these compounds in November might
   be caused by the physiological difference between nutrient limited and
   non-nutrient limited phytoplankton. Furthermore, strong negative
   correlations between nutrients and PCHO species suggest that nutrient
   levels may be one of the driving forces behind the production of these
   compounds in the ECS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Improved methodologies for Earth system modelling of atmospheric soluble

Abstract = {Herein, we present a description of the Mechanism of Intermediate
   complexity for Modelling Iron (MIMI v1.0). This iron processing module
   was developed for use within Earth system models and has been updated
   within a modal aerosol framework from the original implementation in a
   bulk aerosol model. MIMI simulates the emission and atmospheric
   processing of two main sources of iron in aerosol prior to deposition:
   mineral dust and combustion processes. Atmospheric dissolution of
   insoluble to soluble iron is parameterized by an acidic interstitial
   aerosol reaction and a separate in-cloud aerosol reaction scheme based
   on observations of enhanced aerosol iron solubility in the presence of
   oxalate. Updates include a more comprehensive treatment of combustion
   iron emissions, improvements to the iron dissolution scheme, and an
   improved physical dust mobilization scheme. An extensive dataset
   consisting predominantly of cruise-based observations was compiled to
   compare to the model. The annual mean modelled concentration of
   surface-level total iron compared well with observations but less so in
   the soluble fraction (iron solubility) for which observations are much
   more variable in space and time. Comparing model and observational data
   is sensitive to the definition of the average as well as the temporal
   and spatial range over which it is calculated. Through statistical
   analysis and examples, we show that a median or log-normal distribution
   is preferred when comparing with soluble iron observations. The iron
   solubility calculated at each model time step versus that calculated
   based on a ratio of the monthly mean values, which is routinely
   presented in aerosol studies and used in ocean biogeochemistry models,
   is on average globally one-third (34 \%) higher. We redefined ocean
   deposition regions based on dominant iron emission sources and found
   that the daily variability in soluble iron simulated by MIMI was larger
   than that of previous model simulations. MIMI simulated a general
   increase in soluble iron deposition to Southern Hemisphere oceans by a
   factor of 2 to 4 compared with the previous version, which has
   implications for our understanding of the ocean biogeochemistry of these
   predominantly iron-limited ocean regions.},

Abstract = {A fully reversible axial flow pump-turbine is a device that can work as
   a turbine and as a pump for both forward and reverse directions of flow.
   These machines find applications in tidal power plants. Double-cambered
   S-shaped profiles are known to be better suited for the blades of such
   machines; however, information on the acrodynamic characteristics of
   S-cambered profiles is very limited. The effect of thickness
   distribution on the performance of S-shaped airfoils is considered in
   this paper. The results obtained from an extensive experimental
   aerodynamic investigation of three S-cambered profiles with different
   thickness distributions are presented. Gottingen 775 and NACA 0010-66
   basic thickness distributions were used to obtain these profiles. The
   profiles were tested in a wind tunnel in forward and reverse directions
   of flow. The variation of lift and drag coefficients and that of
   lift-to-drag ratio with angle of attack were obtained. The study showed
   that among the profiles tested the profile with Gottingen 775 thickness
   distribution having a maximum thickness at 30\% chord is best suited for
   fully reversible axial pump-turbine application from the point view of
   high lift-to-drag ratio.},

Abstract = {Microbialite carbonates (e.g. stromatolites, thrombolites, shrubs and
   spherulites) are sedimentary deposits highly influenced by their
   environmental settings such as water depth, water chemistry and relative
   energy. Lower Cretaceous subsalt microbialite carbonates, in the Santos
   Basin (Brazil), have complex pore systems produced by their growth
   framework, which are related to carbonate precipitation by biotic and
   abiotic processes and also influenced by subsequent cementation and
   dissolution. Complex pore systems and high spatial reservoir
   heterogeneity result in reservoirs having total porosity ranging from 2
   to 27\% and permeability from less than 0.01 milidarcys to 4.9 darcys.
   Differences in textural characteristics such as shrub size, sorting and
   packing lead to different pore systems that subsequently control the
   petrophysical properties. Cements and dissolution also modify these
   texturally controlled pore systems by respectively reducing or enhancing
   the pore volume and pore-throats. The shrub size is a primary control on
   changes in the pore size and affects the permeability, whereas the shrub
   sorting influences the primary porosity, and secondarily the
   permeability. Packing acts as a secondary control on porosity. As
   result, a sample with small shrubs, well-sorted and tight packing has
   lower permeability for the same range of porosity than a sample with the
   same characteristics, but larger shrubs.},

Abstract = {An assessment of wind energy potential based on wind speed data over the
   Indian subcontinent has been made using high spatio-temporal resolution
   global reanalysis for the period from 1979 to 2018. Regions of high wind
   speed exceeding 4.5 m/s are identified over West Rajasthan, West
   Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch, Central Maharashtra, Interior Karnataka,
   and Rayalaseema. Threshold wind speeds are noted to occur during the
   daytime, and during the summer months from May through September. Wind
   speeds and the spatial extent of threshold winds increase rapidly with
   height below 40 m and then gradually up to 100 m. The wind power density
   is highest between 50 and 80 m, with the potential highest over Gujarat,
   Kutch, and Interior Karnataka and moderate over Saurashtra and
   Rayalaseema. This study also notifies that offshore wind potential is
   higher than over land, and most of the western parts of India are
   congenial for low wind farming. The present study clearly delineates
   wind speed distributions and wind power productivity regions over the
   entire Indian subcontinent. The results would provide authentic wind
   speed and wind power potential information that would be useful for the
   industries, government agencies, and industries concerning wind harness

Title = {Monitoring the Coastal Changes of the Po River Delta (Northern Italy)

   2100 AD},

Abstract = {Interaction between land subsidence and sea level rise (SLR) increases
   the hazard in coastal areas, mainly for deltas, characterized by flat
   topography and with great social, ecological, and economic value.
   Coastal areas need continuous monitoring as a support for human
   intervention to reduce the hazard. Po River Delta (PRD, northern Italy)
   in the past was affected by high values of artificial land subsidence:
   even if at low rates, anthropogenic settlements are currently still in
   progress and produce an increase of hydraulic risk due to the loss of
   surface elevation both of ground and levees. Many authors have provided
   scenarios for the next decades with increased flooding in densely
   populated areas. In this work, a contribution to the understanding
   future scenarios based on the morphological changes that occurred in the
   last century on the PRD coastal area is provided: planimetric variations
   are reconstructed using two archival cartographies (1911 and 1924), 12
   multi-temporal high-resolution aerial photogrammetric surveys (1933,
   1944, 1949, 1955, 1962, 1969, 1977, 1983, 1990, 1999, 2008, and 2014),
   and four LiDAR (light detection and ranging) datasets (acquired in 2006,
   2009, 2012, and 2018): obtained results, in terms of emerged surfaces
   variations, are linked to the available land subsidence rates (provided
   by leveling, GPS-global positioning system, and SAR-synthetic aperture
   radar data) and to the expected SLR values, to perform scenarios of the
   area by 2100: results of this work will be useful to mitigate the hazard
   by increasing defense systems and preventing the risk of widespread
   flooding.},

Abstract = {The Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov (GBY) in the Upper Jordan
   Valley revealed important data on environment and material culture, as
   well as evidence for hominin behavioural and cognitive patterns
   documented at the margins of the Hula Palaeo-lake. A 50 m long core
   (GBY\#2) drilled at the archaeological site has provided a long
   Pleistocene geological, environmental and climatological record, which
   expands the existing knowledge of hominin-habitat relationships.
   Bracketed by two basalt flows dated by 40Ar/39Ar and based on the
   identification of the Matuyama-Brunhes Boundary (MBB) and correlation
   with the GBY excavation site, the sedimentary sequence provides the
   climatic history around the MBB. Multi-proxy data including pollen and
   non pollen palynomorphs, macro-botanical remains, molluscs and ostracods
   provide evidence for lake and lake margin environments during Marine
   Isotope Stages (MIS) 20 and 19. Semi-moist conditions were followed by a
   pronounced dry phase during MIS 20, and warm and moist conditions with
   Quercus-Pistacia woodlands prevailed during MIS 19. In contrast to the
   reconstructed climate change from relatively dry to moister conditions,
   the depositional environment developed from an open-water lake during
   MIS 20 to a lake margin environment in MIS 19. Generally shallower
   conditions at the core site in MIS 19 resulted from the progradation of
   the lake shore due to the filling of the basin. Micro-charcoal analysis
   suggests a likelihood of human-induced fire in some parts of the core,
   which can be correlated with artefact-containing layers of the GBY
   excavation site. The Hula Palaeolake region provided an ideal niche for
   hominins and other vertebrates during global glacial-interglacial
   climate fluctuations at the end of the Early Pleistocene.},

Title = {It's Just Conservation: To What Extent Are Marine Protected Areas in the
   Irish Sea Equitably Governed and Managed?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {It is not enough to simply designate a protected area. According to the
   Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11, these sites should
   be governed and managed effectively and equitably. Equitable (i.e., fair
   and inclusive) conservation is vital to ensuring effective protection of
   natural resources while maintaining human well-being. Yet, equity tends
   to be overlooked in protected area assessments. Three marine protected
   areas (MPAs) in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of
   Ireland were selected to assess equitable governance and management in
   the Irish Sea. This is one of the first studies to assess equity across
   multiple stakeholder groups in MPAs. The Site-level Assessment for
   Governance and Equity (SAGE) toolkit, developed by the International
   Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) to address the gap in
   equity assessments, was used to evaluate equitable governance and
   management in these MPAs. Based on the three dimensions of equity
   (recognition, distribution, and procedure), SAGE contains Likert-scale
   questions to assess good governance by evaluating how different
   stakeholder groups perceive their protected area's management and how
   included they feel in decision-making. Quantitative data from SAGE is
   complemented by qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with
   stakeholders to understand the impact MPA management has on local
   communities and MPA users. The results of this study reveal a lack of
   communication between MPA authorities and local stakeholders. They
   highlight the need for co-management in the form of inclusive
   partnerships as an alternative to the current top-down governance
   approach favoed in the United Kingdom and Ireland.},

Abstract = {Background: Sunscreen formulations primarily offer protection against UV
   induced damages however nowadays it also maintains skin natural
   physiological conditions. Current global market is flooded with numerous
   sunscreen products which offer protection to skin against several UV
   induced damages. However most of these sunscreen formulations offers
   narrow spectrum protection against UV and also suffer from stability as
   well as toxicity related issues.
   Methods: Present work aims to isolate mycosporine amino acid (Mgy) from
   green alga namely Ulva fasciata (U. fasciata) and study its sunscreen
   potential against widely used domestic marketed formulation. Stability
   evaluations were also performed for almost 90 days.
   Results: Results demonstrated that the isolated compound, mycosporine
   glycine (Mgy) preserved physicochemical properties of the product and
   offered good stability for all formulations throughout the experimental
   period. Furthermore, Mgy loaded carbopol gel showed better sunscreen
   protection against marketed formulation in a concentration dependent
   manner. (7.709)
   Conclusion: (6.806) Novel Myg loaded gel was proved to demonstrate
   several quality characteristics that may unlock new prospects for the
   production of more efficient, safe, and economic skin-care products.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a 5-level Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Inverter
   (CHMI) able to perform several tasks and applicable to a microgrid with
   multiple local power sources. The current control strategy is based on
   the conservative power theory (CPT) generating references for different
   modes of operation. The primary merits of multilevel cascade voltage
   source inverters are the possibility of having independent DC sources,
   such as fuel cells, solar cells and batteries and, the reduced dc link
   voltage compare to the traditional 2-level inverters. Hence, the voltage
   stresses and switching losses are also decrease. In addition to
   injecting the available energy from DC sources into the grid, the CHMI
   has also being used to compensate voltage and current disturbances and
   to improve the power quality at point of common coupling. Additionally,
   the paper presents the analysis and design of cascaded voltage control
   scheme based on capacitor filter current feedback to regulate load
   voltage in islanded operation mode. The principles supporting the
   proposed control strategy are presented and the inverter performance is
   demonstrated through digital simulations using PSIM.},

Title = {Toxicity Assessment by Microtox (R) in Sediments, Pore Waters and

Abstract = {The toxicity of sediments in the Gulf of Gdansk is analyzed in relation
   to the chemical composition of interstitial and near-bottom waters, and
   sediment properties. The toxicity of sediments, pore waters and saline
   elutriates is determined by using the Microtox (R) test based on changes
   in light production of the luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The
   results indicate considerable toxicity in the majority of examined
   sediments. Since the sediment elutriates and pore waters are toxic in
   some cases, the total toxicity of the sediments is likely to be due to
   both sediment-bound and water soluble substances. The sediment toxicity
   is related to the percentage contribution of the fine fraction of
   sediments. A significant correlation between the toxicity of the
   sediments and the black carbon content implies anthropogenic
   contamination. The toxicity of the sediments is seen to increase with
   the increase of hydrogen sulfide concentration in pore waters. The
   ammonia in pore waters was found not to be responsible for the toxicity
   of the sediments.},

Abstract = {The links between climate variability, depicted by time series of
   oceanic indices, and changes in total water and groundwater storage are
   investigated across nine large aquifer basins of the African continent.
   The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission's
   observations represent a remarkable tool that can provide insight into
   the dynamics of terrestrial hydrology in areas where direct in situ
   observations are limited. In order to evaluate the impact of interannual
   and multidecadal climate variability on groundwater resources, this
   study assesses the relationship between synoptic controls on climate and
   total water storage estimates from (i) GRACE from 2002 to 2013 and (ii)
   a two-variable climate-driven model that is able to reconstruct past
   storage changes from 1982 to 2011. The estimates are then compared to
   time series of groundwater levels to show the extent to which total
   water storage covaries with groundwater storage. Results indicate that
   rainfall patterns associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) are the main driver of changes in interannual groundwater
   storage, whereas the Atlantic MultiDecadal Oscillation (AMO) plays a
   significant role in decadal to multidecadal variability. The combined
   effect of ENSO and AMO could trigger significant changes in recharge to
   the aquifers and groundwater storage, in particular in the Sahel. These
   findings could help decision-makers prepare more effective
   climate-change adaptation plans at both national and transboundary
   levels.},

Abstract = {The partitioning of solar energy over the Earth's surface drives weather
   and climate of the coupled land-ocean-atmosphere system. Over water
   surfaces, the evolution of water temperatures at a given depth in the
   mixed layer implicitly contains the signature of surface energy
   partitioning, and as such it can be used to diagnose the surface energy
   balance. In this study, we develop a novel numerical scheme by combining
   the Green's function approach and linear stability analysis to estimate
   the water surface energy balance using water temperature measurement at
   a single depth. The proposed method is capable of predicting water
   temperature in the mixed layer, and solving for the components of the
   surface energy budgets with physically based schemes. Evaluation against
   in situ measurement and the maximum entropy production method
   demonstrates that this approach is robust and of good accuracy. It is
   found that performance of the proposed method depends strongly on the
   accurate estimation of turbulent thermal diffusivity from in situ
   measurements, which carries information of meteorological and
   limnological conditions. Without explicitly using wind speed or
   temperature/moisture gradient, the proposed approach reduces uncertainty
   and potential error associated with meteorological measurements in
   estimation of water surface energy balance.},

Title = {Model selection in Bayesian framework to identify the best WorldView-2
   based vegetation index in predicting green biomass of salt marshes in
   the northern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {GISCIENCE \& REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems globally but
   have experienced dramatic degradation and loss within the past several
   decades. Vegetation biomass of coastal wetlands is not only the key
   component of blue carbon storage but also plays an important role in
   vertical accretion, important for maintaining these habitats under
   relative sea-level rise. Remote sensing offers a cost-effective approach
   to study vegetation biomass at a broad spatial scale. We developed
   statistical models to predict peak aboveground green biomass of Spartina
   alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, two dominant species of salt
   marshes using WorldView-2 satellite imagery at the Grand Bay National
   Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) on the Mississippi coast in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico. The model accounted for nested data structures
   in the sampled biomass, assimilated uncertainties from data, parameters
   and model structures, and helped determine the best vegetation index
   among a variety of commonly-used indices to predict aboveground green
   biomass. We developed a series of mixed-effects models, which included
   different combinations of fixed effect(s), random intercept, and random
   slope(s). The fixed effects were species and one of the 60 vegetation
   indices derived from a WorldView-2 image obtained on 6 October 2012. The
   random effect used was site. We implemented the models in a Bayesian
   framework and selected the best model structure and vegetation index
   based on minimum posterior predictive loss and deviance information
   criterion. The results showed that the best vegetation index to predict
   peak green biomass was the green chlorophyll index derived from the
   reflectance values of band 8 (near-infrared) and band 3 (green), and its
   effect on biomass prediction varied among sites. The inclusion of
   species as a fixed effect improved the model prediction. The study
   demonstrated the need to account for spatial dependence of data in
   developing a robust model, and the importance of the second WorldView-2
   near-infrared band (860-1040nm) in predicting aboveground green biomass
   for the Grand Bay NERR. The analysis using mixed-effects modeling in
   Bayesian inference which coherently combined field and WorldView-2 data
   with uncertainties accounted for provides a robust and nondestructive
   tool for resource managers to monitor the status of coastal wetlands at
   a high spatial resolution in a timely manner. Through this study, we
   hope to emphasize the importance of appropriately accounting for nested
   data structures using mixed-effects models and promote wider application
   of Bayesian inference to facilitate assimilation of uncertainties in
   remote sensing applications.},

Title = {THE EFFECTS OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION ON THE RADIOCARBON DATING OF THE

Abstract = {While kept at the Rockefeller Museum in East Jerusalem, many Dead Sea
   Scroll fragments were exposed to castor oil by the original team of
   editors in the course of cleaning the parchments. Castor oil must be
   regarded as a serious contaminant in relation to radiocarbon dating. If
   modern castor oil is present and is not removed prior to dating, the
   C-14 dates will be skewed artificially towards modern values. In
   Rasmussen et al. (2001), it was shown that the standard AAA pretreatment
   procedure used in the 2 previous studies dating Dead Sea Scroll samples
   (Bonani et al. 1992; Jull et al. 1995) is not capable of removing castor
   oil from parchment samples. In the present work, we show that it is
   unlikely that castor oil reacts with the amino acids of the parchment
   proteins, a finding which leaves open the possibility of devising a
   cleaning method that can effectively remove castor oil. We then present
   3 different pretreatment protocols designed to effectively remove castor
   oil from parchment samples. These involve 3 different cleaning
   techniques: extraction with supercritical CO2, ultrasound cleaning, and
   Soxhlet extraction-each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Our
   data show that the protocol involving Soxhlet extraction is the best
   suited for the purpose of decontaminating the Dead Sea Scrolls, and we
   recommend that this protocol be used in further attempts to C-14 date
   the Dead Sea Scrolls. If such an attempt is decided on by the proper
   authorities, we propose a list of Scroll texts, which we suggest be
   redated in order to validate the C-14 dates done earlier by Bonani et
   al. (1992) and Jull et al. (1995).},

Abstract = {Desert areas are considered to be the most suitable sites for CSP power
   plant installations due to their high irradiance, principally the direct
   normal irradiance (DNI), as well as the flat land scape and lower
   population densities. However, CSP reflector components are exposed to
   very harsh weather conditions in desert areas, such as wind storms,
   strong irradiation flux, scarcity of water needed for the cleaning of
   the reflectors, as well as sand and dust storms. These degradation
   factors can seriously affect the specular reflectance, surface
   morphology and therefore the overall efficiency of the CSP plants. On
   the other hand, CSP power plants installations can also be sited in
   coastal areas or industrial areas, which exposes the solar reflectors to
   salty environment or to Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) due to high levels of
   pollution in industrial sites.
   Previous work of the authors has been dedicated to the preparation of
   several types of highly reflective CSP mirrors, prepared experimentally
   by the deposition of a metallic layer of Copper (50nm) covered with a
   reflective layer of Silver (100 nm) protected with layers of Aluminum
   Oxide (Al2O3) and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) with thicknesses of 1 um and
   50 nm, respectively. The aim of this work consists on studying the
   appropriate ageing tests suitable for the nature of different mirror
   samples and the particularity of the different potential sites in
   Morocco where the CSP reflectors can be potentially exposed.},

Title = {Dynamic Reactive Power Control of Islanded Microgrids},

Abstract = {Reactive power control is a fundamental issue in microgrids, especially
   during islanded mode operation with no support from the main grid. Lack
   of infinite bus, tightly coupled generation and consumption, and
   existence of nondispatchable intermittent renewable power sources
   reinforce the need for a new VVC scheme. This paper presents a new model
   predictive control (MPC)-based dynamic voltage and var control (VVC)
   scheme, which includes the dynamics of the microgrid in the VVC
   formulation. The MPC-based controller uses a simplified voltage
   prediction model to predict the voltage behavior of the system for a
   time horizon ahead. The advantage of this method is that it can avoid
   unstable voltage conditions in microgrids by prediction of the
   instability ahead of time. This method can also avoid voltage drops or
   swells in any of the phases of the system since the model can predict
   the voltage of each phase separately. Also, the presented method can be
   implemented online so it can efficiently use the time-variant reactive
   capabilities of the distributed generators to compensate for reactive
   power needs of the system. This controller is tested for different
   operating conditions of the microgrid and the simulation results confirm
   that the MPC controller successfully keeps the system stable and
   achieves a smooth voltage profile.},

Title = {BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF BILLABONG SEDIMENTS .2. SEASONAL-VARIATIONS IN
   METHANE PRODUCTION},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {435-445},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. We examined the temporal (seasonal and diel) and spatial variation in
   methane flux from sediments of a billabong in south-eastern Australia,
   and related it to variations in the rate of organic matter decay,
   concentration of interstitial metabolites, and sediment redox.
   2. Total gas ebullition ranged from <2 to >59 ml m-2 h-1, and was
   highest in the summer months when water temperatures were >25-degrees-C.
   These rates are equivalent to carbon fluxes of about 16-30 g C-CH4 m-2
   yr-1. Ebullition was greater from unvegetated sediments than from
   sediments colonized by the emergent macrophyte Eleocharis sphacelata. R.
   Br. or the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria gigantea Graeb. There were
   no consistent differences in the rate of ebullition over the day and the
   night.
   3. Methane accounted for about 42-45\% of total sediment gas in the
   vegetated sediments, but about 60\% in the unvegetated sediments. These
   ratios did not vary greatly throughout the year. Carbon dioxide was a
   minor component of sediment gas, usually comprising < 5\% of the total.
   Carbon dioxide contents were highest in summer, especially in
   unvegetated and E. sphacelata beds.
   4. In vitro methanogenesis ranged from 3 +/- 0.9 to 106 +/- 30 nmol
   g(dry weight)-1 h-1, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. Added
   acetate (5 mm) increased the rate of methanogenesis by up to 10-fold,
   with the effect being greater in summer than winter. Generally, added
   acetate had least effect in E. sphacelata sediments. The maximum rate of
   in vitro methanogenesis with added acetate was 243 +/- 57 nmol g(dry
   weight)-1 h-1 .
   5. Ebullition was highly correlated with the rate of in vitro
   methanogenesis, with a time lag of about 4 weeks. About 35-60\% of
   benthic in vitro methanogenesis could be accounted for by ebullitive
   loss: the remainder was presumably lost via diffusion, flux through
   emergent plants or by oxidation. The rate of organic-matter degradation,
   assessed with amylopectin azure, varied throughout the year, but there
   was no clear relationship between ebullition and organic-matter decay.
   6. Concentrations of interstitial ammonium, which also varied
   seasonally, ranged from 1 +/- 0.2 to 13 +/- 1 mgN l-1. There was no
   clear relationship between ebullition rates and ammonium concentrations.
   Redox potential was most positive in the E. sphacelata sediments, but
   there was little consistent difference in the redox potential of V.
   gigantea and unvegetated sediments. Redox potential appeared not to be a
   controlling factor in methane release.},

Abstract = {The majority of American eel, Anguilla rostrata LeSueur, knowledge is
   derived from temperate regions in the United States and Canada, with
   little known from its tropical Caribbean distribution. Findings of
   original research on American eel distribution, abundance, population
   biology, habitat ecology and threats from the Caribbean island of Puerto
   Rico were synthesised. American eel were captured from 48 of 116 sites
   (41.4\%) in 26 of 49 river basins (53.1\%) during 2005-2016, and it was
   extirpated upstream of dams and migration barriers >3.0 m high (38.9\%
   of habitat). Mean density and biomass were 438.9 fish/ha and 23.44
   kg/ha, respectively. Upstream habitats favoured larger individuals, and
   females were larger than males. The swim-bladder parasite
   Anguillicoloides crassus Kuwahara, Niimi \& Hagaki was not found in 120
   eels examined. Realised threats include dams and other migratory
   barriers, habitat loss and alteration and pollution; exotic species and
   commercial fishing are impending threats; and the least understood is
   climate change.},

Abstract = {This study reports total nitrogen (TN), carbon (TC) and organic carbon
   (TOC) contents, as well as stable isotopic ratios (delta N-15(TN), delta
   C-13(TC) and delta C-13(org)), from marine, stream and lacustrine
   geological reference materials (JMs-1, JMs-2, SBC-1, SCo-2, JSd-3, JSd-4
   and JLk-1), which can be classified into two types; modern surface, and
   ancient, sediments. Using this newly obtained data set, we
   systematically investigated the biases of three pre-treatment methods
   for nitrogen and carbon measurements: (1) non-acidification (untreated
   method), (2) HCl acidification in various conditions and subsequent
   rinsing with high-purity water repeatedly (rinse method) and (3) in situ
   acidification in a gold-coated silver capsule (capsule method). Our
   results showed that such acid pre-treatments can affect both nitrogen
   and carbon measurements, except for the carbon data of the ancient
   geological RMs. Therefore, the nitrogen analysis should be conducted
   using untreated samples while carbon data should be obtained using the
   capsule method for modern surface sediments and the rinse method (6 mol
   l(-1) HCl acidification at 70 degrees C) for ancient sediments. We
   believe that using appropriate pre-treatment methods is crucial to
   deriving new interpretations of ancient/modern environmental processes
   and mechanisms in the future.},

Abstract = {The shortage of freshwater resources is becoming increasingly serious. A
   thermal power plant coupled with a low-temperature multi-effect
   distillation seawater desalination (single-stage thermal vapor
   compressor (TVC)) has been widely used. To reduce the water production
   cost effectively, a two-stage TVC is proposed in this study. The
   simulation work for the system performance under single- and two-stage
   TVC is analyzed. Results show that the performance of the system coupled
   with the two-stage TVC is superior under most conditions, and an optimal
   intermediate pressure (16 kPa) of the two-stage TVC is found for minimum
   coal consumption. When the power plant load is higher than 70\% THA, the
   cogeneration system performs well, and the motive steam of the two-stage
   TVC comes from extraction point No. 5. Otherwise, the motive steam that
   comes from extraction point No. 4 is a suitable choice. The maximum coal
   consumption reduction value is 1.48 t/h. To deal with the low operation
   load of power plants in China, 60\% THA load of power plant is a
   suitable choice for two-stage TVC of power-water cogeneration system.},

Title = {Wake measurements from a hydrokinetic river turbine},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {139},
Pages = {483-495},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {During the boreal summer of 2015, a full-scale hydrokinetic turbine was
   deployed in the Kvichak River (Alaska), delivering electricity to the
   village of Igiugig. Here, quantification and analysis of the
   hydrodynamic modifications in the river caused by the turbine are
   presented. Field observations are used to produce a unique
   three-dimensional data set of fluid velocities in the vicinity of the
   turbine before and after turbine deployment. Three dynamic regions are
   distinguished in the wake. There is an induction zone just upstream of
   the turbine, where velocities decrease and turbulence increases. There
   is a near wake just downstream of the turbine, where the reduced
   velocities recover slightly and the elevated turbulence decays rapidly.
   Finally, there is a far wake well beyond the turbine, where reduced
   velocities are persistent and turbulence remains elevated. The results
   are used in a coarse energy budget for the river, including quantifying
   the total energy dissipated by turbulence in the near wake. This wake
   dissipation is found to be almost as large as the energy extracted for
   electricity generation, even when the turbine is not operational. (C)

Abstract = {EVALUATION OF THE POTENTIALITY OF FRESHWATER MICROALGAE AS A SOURCE OF
   RAW MATERIAL FOR BIODIESEL PRODUCTION. In this work, the fatty acid
   quantity and composition of six freshwater microalgae and soybean grains
   was determined by direct transesterification and gas chromatography
   analysis. The results showed that all the freshwater microalgae species
   presented a higher quantity of fatty acid than soybean grain.
   Choricystis sp. (A) provides 115\% more fatty acids per gram of biomass
   than soybean grain. With regard to the fatty acid composition,
   Choricystis sp. (A) showed an adequate proportion of saturated and
   unsaturated fatty acids, with lower quantity of polyunsaturated fatty
   acids and, akin to some marine microalgae, constitutes an alternative
   raw material for biodiesel production.},

Abstract = {The coastal zones are areas with a high flow of energy and materials
   where diverse ecosystems are developed. The study of coastal
   oceanography is important to understand the variability of these
   ecosystems and determine their role in biogeochemical cycles and climate
   change. Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis is indispensable for the
   characterization of physical and biological processes, and it is
   affected by processes at diverse timescales. The purpose of this work is
   to analyze the oceanographic variability of the Eastern Coastal Zone of
   the Gulf of California through the study of the SST from time series
   analysis of monthly data obtained from remote sensors (AVHRR-Pathfinder
   Version 5.1 and Version 5 resolution of 4 km, MODIS-Aqua, resolution of
   4 km) for the period 1981 to 2016. The descriptive analysis of SST
   series showed that the values decrease from south to north, as well as
   the amplitude of the warm period decrease from south to north (cold
   period increase from south to north). The minimum values occurred during
   January and February, and ranged between 18 and 20 degrees C; and
   maximum values, of about 32 degrees C, arose in August and September.
   Cluster analysis allowed to group the data in four regions (south,
   center, midriff islands and north), the spectral analysis in each region
   showed frequencies of variation in scales: Annual (the main), seasonal,
   semiannual, and interannual. The latter is associated with the El Nino
   and La Nina climatological phenomena.},

Title = {Effects of ocean acidification on Antarctic marine organisms: A

Abstract = {Southern Ocean waters are among the most vulnerable to ocean
   acidification. The projected increase in the CO2 level will cause
   changes in carbonate chemistry that are likely to be damaging to
   organisms inhabiting these waters. A meta-analysis was undertaken to
   examine the vulnerability of Antarctic marine biota occupying waters
   south of 60 degrees S to ocean acidification. This meta-analysis showed
   that ocean acidification negatively affects autotrophic organisms,
   mainly phytoplankton, at CO2 levels above 1,000 mu atm and invertebrates
   above 1,500 mu atm, but positively affects bacterial abundance. The
   sensitivity of phytoplankton to ocean acidification was influenced by
   the experimental procedure used. Natural, mixed communities were more
   sensitive than single species in culture and showed a decline in
   chlorophyll a concentration, productivity, and photosynthetic health, as
   well as a shift in community composition at CO2 levels above 1,000 mu
   atm. Invertebrates showed reduced fertilization rates and increased
   occurrence of larval abnormalities, as well as decreased calcification
   rates and increased shell dissolution with any increase in CO2 level
   above 1,500 mu atm. Assessment of the vulnerability of fish and
   macroalgae to ocean acidification was limited by the number of studies
   available. Overall, this analysis indicates that many marine organisms
   in the Southern Ocean are likely to be susceptible to ocean
   acidification and thereby likely to change their contribution to
   ecosystem services in the future. Further studies are required to
   address the poor spatial coverage, lack of community or ecosystem-level
   studies, and the largely unknown potential for organisms to acclimate
   and/or adapt to the changing conditions.},

Title = {Taming chlorophylls by early eukaryotes underpinned algal interactions
   and the diversification of the eukaryotes on the oxygenated Earth},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Extant eukaryote ecology is primarily sustained by oxygenic
   photosynthesis, in which chlorophylls play essential roles. The
   exceptional photosensitivity of chlorophylls allows them to harvest
   solar energy for photosynthesis, but on the other hand, they also
   generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. A risk of such phototoxicity
   of the chlorophyll must become particularly prominent upon dynamic
   cellular interactions that potentially disrupt the mechanisms that are
   designed to quench photoexcited chlorophylls in the phototrophic cells.
   Extensive examination of a wide variety of phagotrophic, parasitic, and
   phototrophic microeukaryotes demonstrates that a catabolic process that
   converts chlorophylls into nonphotosensitive
   13(2),17(3)-cyclopheophorbide enols (CPEs) is phylogenetically
   ubiquitous among extant eukaryotes. The accumulation of CPEs is
   identified in phagotrophic algivores belonging to virtually all major
   eukaryotic assemblages with the exception of Archaeplastida, in which no
   algivorous species have been reported. In addition, accumulation of CPEs
   is revealed to be common among phototrophic microeukaryotes (i.e.,
   microalgae) along with dismantling of their secondary chloroplasts.
   Thus, we infer that CPE-accumulating chlorophyll catabolism (CACC)
   primarily evolved among algivorous microeukaryotes to detoxify
   chlorophylls in an early stage of their evolution. Subsequently, it also
   underpinned photosynthetic endosymbiosis by securing close interactions
   with photosynthetic machinery containing abundant chlorophylls, which
   led to the acquisition of secondary chloroplasts. Our results strongly
   suggest that CACC, which allowed the consumption of oxygenic primary
   producers, ultimately permitted the successful radiation of the
   eukaryotes throughout and after the late Proterozoic global oxygenation.},

   Global Navigation System-Reflectometer (GNSS-R) technology uses Delay
   Doppler Map (DDM) in relation to surface type to detect sea ice, and
   existing studies have made good progress. Feature extraction of DDM data
   is an important basis to ensure the accuracy of sea ice remote sensing.
   In this paper, we introduce the convolutional neural network algorithm
   based on the AlexNet model, and use the northern hemisphere DDM data of
   TDS-1 satellite in February 2018 for sea ice detection to verify the
   feasibility of the convolutional neural network algorithm based on the
   AlexNet model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of
   sea-ice - seawater oriented detection is 97.71\% with a correlation
   coefficient of 0.89 with the surface data of NOAA station. The
   AlexNet-based convolutional neural network is confirmed to be used for
   GNSS-R sea ice detection.},

Title = {Eukaryote plankton assemblages in the southern Kerguelen Axis region:
   Ecological drivers differ between size fractions},

Abstract = {Southern Ocean plankton communities are extremely important for global
   biogeochemical processes. However, recent efforts to survey marine
   eukaryote diversity focussed on tropical and temperate plankton
   communities, with limited sampling of the Southern Ocean. We used
   high-throughput sequencing of 18S ribosomal DNA to characterise
   eukaryotic diversity in 284 size-fractionated plankton samples from
   across the southern Kerguelen Axis, one of the most productive regions
   in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Based on three size
   fractions, combined eukaryote communities in the K-Axis region form
   three distinct groups, corresponding to a southern seasonal ice zone
   (SIZ), northern SIZ and open ocean zone. Generalised dissimilarity
   modelling showed that days since sea-ice melt was the key driver of
   community composition for the two larger size fractions (nanoand
   microplankton). In contrast, chlorophyll a and nitrate concentrations
   were better predictors for eukaryotic communities smaller than 5 pm
   (piconanoplankton). Other predictors varied in importance between
   taxonomic groups and depths, providing insights into drivers of
   community structure for different groups. Our results suggest that
   Southern Ocean eukaryotes will respond differently to environmental
   change depending on their taxonomy and size. Predicted changes in
   sea-ice extent and other environmental factors will not simply cause a
   shift in community location, but change the overall community
   composition and the suite of possible ecological interactions, with
   implications for trophodynamics, biogeochemistry, and carbon export.},

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {237},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and stochastic validation
   of free-running 5415M in irregular stern-quartering sea state 7 and
   Froude number 0.33 are presented. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes (URANS) computations are validated against experimental
   fluid dynamics (EFD) tests. EFD static stability, forward speed, wave
   direction and spectrum were set such that roll-motion resonance were
   induced, causing large roll angles, significant deck-edge immersion, and
   static instability. Prerequisite calm-water validation covers roll decay
   at zero speed and self-propulsion studies for propeller RPM. Subsequent
   CFD stochastic validation is achieved by statistical assessment of EFD
   data and CFD results (expected value, standard deviation, and
   probability distribution) for input waves and ship response: time series
   are assessed by their wave energy-spectra, autocovariance (waves only),
   and block-bootstrap analysis (waves and motions); mean-crossing
   amplitudes are studied by bootstrap method. Dynamic mode decomposition
   is used with EFD and CFD time histories to unveil the underlying ship
   dynamics and the motion correlation. Overall, CFD results are in
   agreement with EFD. Finally, a clustering approach is used to identify
   wave sequences causing large roll angles. As proof of concept, the
   characteristics of these sequences are used for the deterministic
   reconstruction of severe (large roll) and rare (capsize) events via
   regular wave computations.},

Title = {Perforator-Based Interposition Flaps for Sustainable Scar Contracture
   Release: A Versatile, Practical, and Safe Technique},

Abstract = {Background: Problematic scar contractures are frequently observed
   following extensive (burn) wounds. In this study, the authors
   investigated the applicability of islanded and nonislanded
   perforator-based interposition flaps as a technique for release of scar
   contracture.
   Methods: Patients requiring surgery for scar contracture release were
   included. Preoperatively, a suitable perforator was identified by color
   Doppler sonography. The flap design was tailored according to the
   localization of this perforator and the anticipated defect. Flap
   measurements were obtained intraoperatively and at follow-up. Supple
   scar tissue was included in the flap design when necessary, to increase
   the applicability of this concept in extensively burned patients. Flaps
   were converted into island flaps on indication to circumvent significant
   kinking of the flap base and compromised tissue perfusion.
   Results: Twenty-two flaps were performed, of which four were converted
   into island flaps. All flaps survived, but in four cases necrosis of the
   tip was observed. After a mean follow-up of 7.8 months, the width and
   surface area of the flaps had expanded to 123 percent (range, 40 to 311
   percent) and 116 percent (range, 60 to 246 percent), respectively. One
   flap was converted into a full-thickness graft during the initial
   operation.
   Conclusions: This concept of perforator-based interposition flaps was
   found to be a reliable and versatile technique for broad scar
   contractures. Moreover, it allows intraoperative tailoring, as the flap
   base can be islanded when indicated. Nevertheless, additional venous
   outflow is warranted and operative time is saved if the flap base
   remains intact. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 127: 1524, 2011.)},

Abstract = {Early Eocene carbonate sediments of the Umlatdoh Limestone (Meghalaya,
   N-E India) represent a shallow marine shelf environment. The major
   biotic components characterizing these carbonates are calcareous green
   algae and small to larger benthic foraminifera. Based on the biogenic
   associations and general sedimentological features, five major facies
   types (MFTs) are distinguished. They are dominated by poor to moderately
   sorted grainstones followed by packstones, rudstones and wackestones.
   Considerable abundance of Halimeda, scarcity of z-corals and poor to
   moderate occurrence of filter-feeding organisms imply mesotrophic to a
   slightly oligotrophic nutrient regime. Rare occurrence of geniculate
   coralline algae is probably due to the lack of suitable substrate and
   environmental conditions. High incidence of grainstones and packstones,
   fairly preserved microfossils and few reworked specimens indicate a
   parautochthonous mode of deposition. Preponderance of Alveolina and
   Nummulites indicate the possible advent of larger foraminiferal turnover
   (LFT) in the east Tethys during or even before early Eocene. A
   conceptual palaeoenvironmental model for the studied succession is
   provided to showcase various facies gradients, bathymetry levels and
   shelf zones pertinent to the Umlatdoh Limestone.},

Abstract = {The development of sediment quality criteria (SQCs) for nonpolar
   compounds using equilibrium partitioning theory (EqP) requires three
   critical data elements for the compound of interest: (a) a reliable,
   measured K-ow; (b) an acceptable minimum data set for the development of
   the final acute and final chronic values necessary to calculate a
   water-quality criterion (WQC); and (c) `'check'' experiments with
   appropriate freshwater and marine benthic organisms to ensure that their
   responses in spiked-sediment tests are in agreement with responses
   predicted based on EqP. This study presents the results of dieldrin
   check experiments with two freshwater species: the amphipod Hyalella
   azteca and the chironomid Chironomus tentans. Ten-day, flow-through,
   water-only dieldrin LC50 values for the amphipod and chironomid were 7.6
   and 1.1 mu g/L, respectively. The LC50 values for the two species based
   on organic carbon-normalized sediment concentrations of dieldrin were
   generally less variable than values based on dieldrin concentrations in
   sediments on a dry-weight basis. Ten-day LC50 values for H. azteca and
   C. tentans based on measured pore-water concentrations of dieldrin were
   greater than those based on EqP-predicted pore-water concentrations of
   dieldrin. An increase in the apparent water solubility of dieldrin as a
   result of binding to dissolved organic carbon appeared to account for
   this phenomenon. Ten-day LC50 values for H. azteca and C. tentans based
   on EqP-predicted pore-water concentrations of dieldrin were within a
   factor of 25 and 3 of their respective 10-d, water-only dieldrin LC50
   values. Avoidance of the dieldrin-spiked sediments may offer a partial
   explanation for the concentration-response results observed with H.
   azteca and the greater difference observed for this species between
   water-only and predicted pore-water 10-d LC50 values for dieldrin.
   Inhibition of growth in C. tentans was also a sensitive end point with
   effects observed at pore-water 10-d LC50 values for dieldrin. Inhibition
   of growth in C. tentans was also a sensitive end point with effects
   observed at pore-water concentrations of dieldrin as small as 5.5 mu g/g
   organic carbon. Based on these results, it appears that EqP based upon
   sediment organic carbon content is an appropriate model for converting
   WQC for dieldrin to SQC. These results also highlight the importance of
   using multiple benthic test species (including at least one infaunal
   species), end points, and sediments in SQC sediment-spiking check
   studies.},

Abstract = {This study assessed the impact of climate change on snow resources in
   the Arctic. Climate was classified for the period 1950-2100 according to
   the Koppen-Geiger (KG) classification system using the ensemble average
   of NASA-NEX CMIP5 projections for the rcp 4.5 scenario. Snow Cover
   Frequency (SCF) in days/year was calculated from the MODIS10A1 snow
   product and the SCF trends were calculated across the Arctic for the
   MODIS period (2001-2016). Ten pollution monitoring areas in the Arctic
   lowlands, especially vulnerable to climate change impacts, were selected
   for analyzing the climate and snow regimes. In seven of the ten areas we
   observed significant changes in the climate during the MODIS period and
   these same areas also showed the largest SCF trends. At lower latitudes
   we observed decreasing SCF, while further north, by the shores of the
   Arctic seas, SCF has increased. Averaged across the Arctic we observed a
   0.91 days/year decrease in SCF. Our results show that across the Arctic
   warmer climate classes have and will continue to replace polar tundra
   and cold summer regions. Based on the CMIP5 simulations, we expect the
   coverage of the currently dominant Arctic climate class, Cold climate
   with cold summers and no dry season (Dfc), to decline by about 40\% by
   2100 and be replaced by climate classes associated with warm (Dfb, Dsb,
   Dwb) and hot (Dfa, Dsa, Dwa) summers.},

Title = {Climate-driven environmental changes around 8,200 years ago favoured
   increases in cetacean strandings and Mediterranean hunter-gatherers
   exploited them},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Cetacean mass strandings occur regularly worldwide, yet the compounded
   effects of natural and anthropogenic factors often complicate our
   understanding of these phenomena. Evidence of past stranding episodes
   may, thus, be essential to establish the potential influence of climate
   change. Investigations on bones from the site of Grotta dell'Uzzo in
   North West Sicily ( Italy) show that the rapid climate change around
   8,200 years ago coincided with increased strandings in the Mediterranean
   Sea. Stable isotope analyses on collagen from a large sample of remains
   recovered at this cave indicate that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers relied
   little on marine resources. A human and a red fox dating to the
   8.2-kyr-BP climatic event, however, acquired at least one third of their
   protein from cetaceans. Numerous carcasses should have been available
   annually, for at least a decade, to obtain these proportions of meat.
   Our findings imply that climate-driven environmental changes, caused by
   global warming, may represent a serious threat to cetaceans in the near
   future.},

Title = {Sea ice extent and phenology influence breeding of high-Arctic seabirds:
   4 decades of monitoring in Nunavut, Canada},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {198},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Seabirds breeding in the high Arctic contend with variable annual sea
   ice conditions, with important consequences depending on a species'
   unique reproductive and foraging ecology. We assessed the influence of
   sea ice extent and phenology on seabird breeding biology using
   monitoring data collected for northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis),
   glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa
   tridactyla), and thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) breeding at Prince
   Leopold Island, Nunavut, Canada over 4 decades. We expected that years
   of later sea ice break-up and greater ice cover around the colony would
   create greater challenges to foraging and could result in delayed nest
   initiation, decreased colony attendance, and lower nesting success, but
   with distinct responses from each species. We also tested for
   time-lagged effects of ice conditions, where sea ice in a given year
   could impact food availability or juvenile recruitment in later years.
   Ice conditions around the colony exhibited no significant overall
   temporal trends or changepoints over the past 50 years (1970-2021),
   while counts of kittiwakes and murres increased over the study period
   1975-2013. No trends were evident in counts of fulmars or gulls or in
   egg-laying dates or nest success for any species. However, three species
   (all but glaucous gulls) exhibited unique responses between breeding
   metrics and sea ice, highlighting how breeding decisions and outcomes
   may differ among species under the same environmental conditions in a
   given year. Time-lagged effects were only detected for kittiwake nest
   counts, where the date of spring ice break-up around the colony was
   negatively associated with counts at a 5-year lag. Greater distances to
   open water were associated with lower colony attendance by fulmars and
   later nest initiation by kittiwakes and murres. Our analyses provide
   additional insights to effects of sea ice on high-Arctic seabird
   breeding ecology, which will be useful in predicting and planning for
   the complex effects of a changing climate and changing human pressures
   on this high-latitude ecosystem and for the management of high-Arctic
   marine-protected areas.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs in Malaysia are about 4,006 km(2) with over 550 species
   contributed to nation's economy. Coral reefs studies and threats in
   Malaysia have been reviewed briefly. Perspectives are addressed as coral
   reefs studies, threats, gaps and future studies. Coral reefs in Malaysia
   are being damaged at an increasing rate where it faces natural and
   anthropogenic stresses. Excellent summaries are available in terms of
   coral reefs cover throughout Malaysia however scarce in terms of
   qualitative, quantitative and biogeographical data. There are also
   limited studies on heavy metals concentration in corals skeleton
   studies. Poor to fair conditions of coral reefs in Peninsular Malaysia
   is due to increases of sedimentation and tourism impacts. Overfishing
   and fish blasting were main threats of coral reefs damage in Sabah. In
   Sarawak, coral reefs are threatened by high sedimentation and sand
   mining. The 1998-1999 bleaching event also affected coral reefs in
   Malaysia due to climate change. Gaps in coral reefs studies can be
   completed by continuous collaborations between local and international
   researchers as well as research by local universities. Economic
   valuation, policy analysis and community participation are directions in
   future coral reefs studies in Malaysia. Future studies are to understand
   effects of management on coral reefs health and impact of pollution on
   coral reefs growth with a standard coral reefs methodology. Established
   legal systems to reduce threats received by coral reefs are also need to
   be introduced. Role of science-driven management with community
   participation and media mass are also gaps to be highlighted in future
   studies.},

Abstract = {Seagrass habitats in western Florida Bay have been undergoing changes
   from monotypic Thalassia testudinum meadows to large landscapes of
   barren bottoms or to increasingly heterogeneous Thalassia meadows as a
   result of seagrass die-off patch formation.  The cause of this die-off
   is unknown but current hypotheses point to environmental stress making
   this seagrass susceptible to disease.  The potential exists for
   colonization and recovery of these die-off patches but the sequence of
   events and the persistence of the recovery have not been evaluated. 
   Based on an existing model that represents theoretical successional
   steps toward the Thalassia climax, four habitat types were sampled in
   each of two basins of western Florida Bay.  Data demonstrated a high
   potential for recovery of the denuded die-off patches.  The alga
   Batophora oerstedi is the first colonizer with replacement by other
   algal species and subsequently Halodule wrightii and eventually
   Thalassia.  Under the existing conditions of high resuspended carbonate
   sediment and biological turbidity, which are thought to be secondary
   responses of the system to the die-off of seagrasses, persistence of the
   colonizing habitats and the climax community itself is tenuous. 
   Decreases in both Halodule and Thalassia in non-die-off areas of Johnson
   Key Basin between spring and fall 1991 occurred as did decreases in
   densities of these species in recovering patches.  Subsequent visits in
   1993 revealed that the sample sites were devoid of seagrasses.},

Abstract = {The growth of frequency spectra and spectral parameters of wind waves
   generated by cold waves, a kind of severe weather system, in the
   northern East China Sea is studied in this paper. Based on a
   third-generation wave action model (the Simulating WAves Nearshore
   model), simulations were developed to analyze the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of wind waves and to output spectral data. It is shown
   that the cold wave-induced spectra can be well described by the modifi
   ed Joint North Sea Wave Project spectral form. The growth of wave
   spectra is comprehensively refl ected by the evolution of the three
   characteristic parameters: peak frequency, spectral peak and wave
   energy. Besides, the approximations of dependences between spectral
   parameters and the three types of universal induced factors are obtained
   with the least squares method and compared systematically. Fetch and
   peak frequency turn out to be suitable parameters to describe the
   spectral parameters, while the dependences on the inverse wave age vary
   in diff erent sea areas. In general, the derived relationships improve
   on results from previous studies for better practical application of the
   wind wave frequency spectrum in the northern East China Sea.},

Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {311-322},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The major subsystems of an atoll relevant to the phosphorus cycle are
   the sea (0.015 g/t P) and atmosphere, the marine biosphere
   (approximately 103 g/t P), the supramarine portion of the atoll's
   carbonate substrate including rock and soils (approximately 10(3) g/t
   P), the freshwater lens contained in that substrate (approximately 7 x
   10(2) g/t P), and terrestrial flora and fauna. By way of example, among
   low islands of Tuvalu, vegetation, principally coconut palms, contains
   approximately 0.5 t/ha P, while people, pigs and minor fowl, account for
   about 2.5-3 kg/ha P. The sea is the primary source and sink for
   phosphorus in an atoll ecosystem with the primary concentration taking
   place in the marine biosphere (1-2 kg/ha.m/a P) and subsequent
   transference to the land by physical geological processes (10(4) g/t/a
   P) and terrestrial predators (< 1 kg/ha/a P). The freshwater lens has a
   central role in redistributing phosphate received from atmospheric
   fallout, corrosion of bioclasts and breakdown of surface debris. This
   phosphorus is transported through the calcareous substrate as a humate
   complex that breaks down in or near the vadose zone. Excess free
   phosphate is precipitated as dahllite, carbonate hydroxyapatite,
   removing it from further participation in the atoll's geochemical cycle.
   Phosphorus in the fresh groundwater is recycled in the terrestrial flora
   (approximately 0.1 t/ha/a P) or lost in edge discharge. The cycle of
   phosphorus offers a model for evaluating environmental impacts but data
   is presently insufficient to determine precise quantities being
   transferred within and between all the component subsystems of the
   atoll. No satisfactory budget can be constructed detailing net losses
   and net inputs between different subsystems and, hence, likely effects
   of present land management practices, thriving populations, pollution
   and environmental changes. The atoll is a highly dynamic system able to
   recover from short term environmental disruptions but its resilience in
   this regard needs to be carefully monitored, quantified and nurtured.},

Abstract = {This article is based on the thermal infrared data obtained from
   Environmental mitigation B satellite (HJ-1B) and Storm III satellite
   (FY-3), using generalized single-channel method, retrieved the surface
   temperature of costal sea around the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant in
   winter and summer to get the quantitative information about the
   diffusion and gradient of the thermal discharge from the nuclear power
   station. Then the retrieval results were compared with the MODIS sea
   surface temperature (SST) products. It indicated that the thermal
   infrared data from HJ-1B and FY-3 were able to research on the
   distribution of thermal discharge. Furthermore, based on inversion of
   the SST distribution map, spatial and temporal distribution variations
   of thermal discharge were analyzed simply. The distribution is
   significantly different among the different seasons. During the winter
   months, the thermal discharge extended to a sector area around the power
   station, while in summer it limited to a rater longer and narrower area
   in one side of the bay. And the area where the SST has increased more
   than 3 degrees C in winter was much larger than that in summer.},

Abstract = {The storage of natural gas in underground geological formations (UGS)
   has been widely adopted to guarantee a real-time response to the market
   requests as well as to ensure National ``strategic{''} reserves. In the
   recent past, the UGS and related technologies have been approached with
   increasing interest also in terms of CO2 sequestration and of
   large-scale storage of chemical energy, with the potentiality in playing
   a fundamental role in the energy transition process toward the
   de-carbonization goals.
   In the context of the gas storage, both current regulations and public
   concerns call for geomechanical analyses to assess the safety of the
   infrastructures and the underground system and the recently formalized
   Virtual Elements Method (VEM) has been showing promising results to
   address such issue.
   An extensive research project, involving multi-competences, dedicated to
   the implementation of a VEM code able to face the geomechanical aspects
   related to oil\&gas fields is under development. The paper presents the
   VEM code simulation results of a realistic case study representing a
   typical gas field in the Italian Adriatic offshore subject to UGS. The
   effects of the production/injection operations, in terms of induced
   stress variations and consequent displacements, were calculated via the
   implemented VEM code and satisfactorily validated with the solution
   obtained from a FEM commercial software.},

Abstract = {Atlantic salmon is often a focal species of restoration efforts
   throughout the north Atlantic and it is therefore an excellent case
   study for how best to design programmes to address andmitigate threats
   and correct population declines. This perspective is written to promote
   the work that has been accomplished towards restoration of Atlantic
   salmon populations and synthesize how we believe the lessons can be used
   effectively to support efforts by management agencies to restore
   populations. We reviewed where restoration is needed for Atlantic
   salmon, agreed on definitions for three levels of successful
   restoration, and then applied these criteria to 49 published papers
   focused onAtlantic salmon restoration. We identified 16 successful
   examples of restoration among 49 papers reviewed and discussed what
   interventions led to success versus failure. We then addressed key
   questions about when hatchery stocking should be used as part of a
   restoration measure and whether local restoration efforts are enough
   when these wide-ranging species encounter broad-scale changes in the
   north Atlantic, specifically related to issues of climate change and to
   marine survival. We advise to avoid restoration as much as possible by
   protecting and managing existing populations and when restoration is
   necessary, problems should be identified and addressed in partnership
   with river users. With appropriate resources and research to resolve
   ongoing mysteries, restoration of lost Atlantic salmon populations is
   absolutely feasible.},

Abstract = {Pacific salmon are a dominant component of the northeast Pacific
   ecosystem. Their status is of concern because salmon abundance is highly
   variable-including protected stocks, a recently closed fishery, and
   actively managed fisheries that provide substantial ecosystem services.
   Variable ocean conditions, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
   (PDO), have influenced these fisheries, while diminished diversity of
   freshwater habitats have increased variability via the portfolio effect.
   We address the question of how recent changes in ocean conditions will
   affect populations of two salmon species. Since the 1980s, El Nino
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have been more frequently associated
   with central tropical Pacific warming (CPW) rather than the canonical
   eastern Pacific warming ENSO (EPW). CPW is linked to the North Pacific
   Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), whereas EPW is linked to the PDO, different
   indicators of northeast Pacific Ocean ecosystem productivity. Here we
   show that both coho and Chinook salmon survival rates along western
   North America indicate that the NPGO, rather than the PDO, explains
   salmon survival since the 1980s. The observed increase in NPGO variance
   in recent decades was accompanied by an increase in coherence of local
   survival rates of these two species, increasing salmon variability via
   the portfolio effect. Such increases in coherence among salmon stocks
   are usually attributed to controllable freshwater influences such as
   hatcheries and habitat degradation, but the unknown mechanism underlying
   the ocean climate effect identified here is not directly subject to
   management actions.},

Abstract = {A major landslide at Castlehaven on the Isle of Wight occurred as a
   reactivation of pre-existing landslides as a consequence of both coastal
   erosion and high groundwater levels caused by the very wet and stormy
   winter of 1994/95. The Castlehaven landslide lies within the Undercliff
   landslide complex and a strong relationship between landslide movement,
   groundwater level and the 4 month antecedent effective rainfall (4AER)
   has been developed for the area. In the site area movement occurs when
   the 4AER exceeds approximately 380 mm. Castlehaven also lies within an
   environmentally sensitive area with both national and international
   designations. The selection of remedial measures was influenced by the
   need for environmental protection but also needed to be robust to cope
   with predicted future changes in climate including increased storminess
   and winter total and effective rainfall, rising groundwater levels and
   sea level changes. A scheme including siphon wells, and
   electro-pneumatic wells, both used in UK for the first time, was
   designed and constructed to reduce winter groundwater levels to the
   equivalent summer levels at which movement is substantially reduced thus
   improving landslide stability and protecting valued environmental
   assets.},

Abstract = {This paper basically concentrates on providing an appropriate
   distributed-based energy management framework in smart islands. Smart
   island is defined as insular territory with the ability to implement
   integrated solutions to the management of infrastructures and natural
   resources. The distributed optimization is accomplished by using
   primal-dual method of multipliers which has shown more promising
   performance in terms of execution time and convergence rate compared to
   the alternating-direction method of multipliers. The proposed energy
   management scheme is carried out between 5 different agents including an
   energy hub, a networked multi-microgrid with 3 agents and a
   transportation system. The transportation system comprises of the subway
   system and plug-in electric vehicles. The proposed networked
   multi-microgrid is made up of 3 microgrid systems, each one comprises of
   wind generation units, photovoltaic units and a tidal unit. Despite the
   assumption that the agents are both suppliers and consumers of energy
   and are completely operated and separated from the other sections, they
   share energy through a peer-to-peer energy trading. Such sharing scheme
   will be ended up by obtaining an equilibrium point through which a
   consensus is reached and all the parties are satisfied. Results prove
   the validity of the proposed approach in providing a proper energy
   negotiation framework in a smart island in terms of accuracy and
   applicability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Human activities in many parts of the world have greatly affected
   natural areas. Therefore, monitoring and forecasting of land-cover
   changes are important components for sustainable utilization,
   conservation, and development of these areas. This research has been
   conducted on Igneada, a legally protected area on the northwest coast of
   Turkey, which is famous for its unique, mangrove forests. The main focus
   of this study was to apply a land use and cover model that could
   quantitatively and graphically present the changes and its impacts on
   Igneada landscapes in the future. In this study, a Markov chain-based,
   stochastic Markov model and cellular automata Markov model were used.
   These models were calibrated using a time series of developed areas
   derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery between 1990 and 2010
   that also projected future growth to 2030. The results showed that CA
   Markov yielded reliable information better than St. Markov model. The
   findings displayed constant but overall slight increase of settlement
   and forest cover, and slight decrease of agricultural lands. However,
   even the slightest unsustainable change can put a significant pressure
   on the sensitive ecosystems of Igneada. Therefore, the management of the
   protected area should not only focus on the landscape composition but
   also pay attention to landscape configuration.},

Title = {Cool-water carbonate production from epizoic bryozoans on ephemeral
   substrates},
Journal = {PALAIOS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-48},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Bryozoan skeletons are a dominant constituent of cool-water carbonate
   sediments in the Cenozoic of southern Australia. The primary substrate
   on much of the modern continental shelf is Loose sediment that is
   reworked intermittently to 200 + m water depth by storm Leaves.
   Availability of stable substrate is a Limiting factor in the modern
   distribution of bryozoans in this setting. As a result, a significant
   proportion of the sedimentologically important modern bryozoans (30-250
   m water depth) live attached to sessile, benthic invertebrate hosts that
   possess organic or spicular skeletons. Hosts such as hydroids, ascidian
   tunicates, sponges, soft worm tubes, octocorals, and other
   lightly-calcified and articulated bryozoans provide ephemeral
   substrates; after death, host skeletons disarticulate and decay, leaving
   little or no body fossil record.
   The calcareous sediments produced by these epizoic bryozoans from
   ephemeral substrates result in loose particles that rarely preserve
   substratal relationships, but potentially retain diagnostic basal
   attachment morphologies. Although the best known examples of epizoic
   carbonate production on ephemeral substrates are from the southern
   Australian margin, this may be an important phenomenon both globally and
   in the fossil record. Bryozoan sediment production from epizoans on
   ephemeral substrates would seem, however, to have a scant record prior
   to the Cretaceous.},

Abstract = {Stiffened thin steel plates are structures widely employed in
   aeronautical, civil, naval, and offshore engineering. Considering a
   practical application where a transverse uniform load acts on a simply
   supported stiffened steel plate, an approach associating computational
   modeling, Constructal Design method, and Exhaustive Search technique was
   employed aiming to minimize the central deflections of these plates. To
   do so, a non-stiffened plate was adopted as reference from which all
   studied stiffened plate's geometries were originated by the
   transformation of a certain amount of steel of its thickness into
   longitudinal and transverse stiffeners. Different values for the
   stiffeners volume fraction (phi) were analyzed, representing the ratio
   between the volume of the stiffeners' material and the total volume of
   the reference plate. Besides, the number of longitudinal (N-ts) and
   transverse (N-ts) stiffeners and the aspect ratio of stiffeners shape
   (hdt s , being h(s) and t(s), respectively, the height and thickness of
   stiffeners) were considered as degrees of freedom. The optimized plates
   were determined for all studied phi, values and showed a deflection
   reduction of over 90\% in comparison with the reference plate. Lastly,
   the influence of the phi parameter regarding the optimized plates was
   evaluated defining a configuration with the best structural performance
   among all analyzed cases.},

Abstract = {Diapycnal mixing plays a primary role in the thermodynamic balance of
   the ocean and, consequently, in oceanic heat and carbon uptake and
   storage. Though observed mixing rates are on average consistent with
   values required by inverse models, recent attention has focused on the
   dramatic spatial variability, spanning several orders of magnitude, of
   mixing rates in both the upper and deep ocean. Away from ocean
   boundaries, the spatiotemporal patterns of mixing are largely driven by
   the geography of generation, propagation, and dissipation of internal
   waves, which supply much of the power for turbulent mixing. Over the
   last 5 years and under the auspices of U.S. Climate Variability and
   Predictability Program (CLIVAR), a National Science Foundation (NSF)-
   and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-supported
   Climate Process Team has been engaged in developing, implementing, and
   testing dynamics-based parameterizations for internal wave-driven
   turbulent mixing in global ocean models. The work has primarily focused
   on turbulence 1) near sites of internal tide generation, 2) in the upper
   ocean related to wind-generated near inertial motions, 3) due to
   internal lee waves generated by low-frequency mesoscale flows over
   topography, and 4) at ocean margins. Here, we review recent progress,
   describe the tools developed, and discuss future directions.},

Abstract = {A project is now underway on the construction of a reclaimed island in
   Pusan city, Korea. The reclaimed island is to be constructed on the sea
   between Yeung-do and Songdo district in Pusan area and is about 6.2
   km(2). A part of the needed soil for the reclamation is supplied by
   cutting down the top of hills in Yeung-do and Songdo. So we predicted
   the local climate effects, such as the wind and the air temperature
   distributions, that would result because of those large-scale
   modifications of the earth surface. For the area around the reclaimed
   island the three-dimensional numerical model which employed the nested
   technique to calculate with the higher resolution was used to predict
   the climate effects. The nested technique uses two grid systems, one for
   large-scale calculating region which is the coarse mesh grid (CMG) and
   the other for small-scale region which is the fine mesh grid (FMG). The
   simulations were carried out both for the present situation and for the
   condition that could result after construction of the reclaimed island
   on the typical summer day when the sea and land breezes strongly
   developed. The first calculation results reasonably agreed with the
   observed data. And the second calculation results indicated the
   following: (1) the temperature would increase about 1 degrees C above
   the reclaimed island at the daytime, (2) the temperature would slightly
   decrease above the reclaimed island but increase about 0.5 degrees C
   above the top of both hills which are cut down at the nighttime, (3) the
   wind velocity would increase on the west side of the reclaimed island at
   the daytime, (4) the wind velocity would decrease above the reclaimed
   island but increase above the top of both hills cut down at the
   nighttime. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd},

Abstract = {Unintentional islanding is one of the major concerns associated with
   integration of large solar photovoltaic generation with the power
   distribution network. However the issue of islanding needs to be
   comprehensively understood and managed given a challenging scenario
   ahead. This demands transition towards predictive approaches rather than
   the prevalent reactive ones for island detection and system management.
   The present work describes a machine learning based preemptive islanding
   detection module designed on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer for issuing
   advance alert to grid-interfaced solar photovoltaic inverters in the
   event of an imminent islanding situation and triggering the subsequent
   action. The module can activate a timely change in the inverter's
   operating mode by detecting precursors to accidental islanding, before
   the utility relay can trip a circuit breaker. Thus an intentional island
   can be maintained with acceptable power quality after the mode-changing
   operation. The module can also issue a shut-down command to the
   inverter's control in order to completely avoid an unintentional island
   formation. Preliminary tests on an islanding precursor, discovered in
   simulation and on real laboratory-based network, have been presented.
   The precursor is simulated on a modified IEEE feeder and the online
   classification accuracy and speed indicate promising potential as a
   field-level prototype.},

Title = {Trace metal dynamics in the sediments of a constructed and natural urban
   tidal marsh: The role of iron, sulfide, and organic complexation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {133-141},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Two tidal marshes in the New Jersey Meadowlands, one constructed and one
   natural were characterized to compare their ability to immobilize trace
   metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn). Surface and pore waters were
   sampled four times a year between 2008 and 2010 and sediment cores were
   collected yearly in the constructed marsh and once in 2010 in the
   natural marsh. Interactions of trace metals with redox active species
   such as iron and sulfide as well as with organic matter were
   investigated. Precipitation with sulfides played a major role in
   immobilizing certain trace metals, including Cr, Mn, and Pb. At both
   sites, the presence of sulfide did not preclude the presence of
   dissolved trace metals in pore-water at concentrations exceeding their
   metal sulfide solubility product. Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling
   indicated these dissolved metals remained in solution due to an
   association with heterogeneous dissolved organic carbon. No net trace
   metal accumulation in the surficial sediments of the constructed marsh
   was noted between 2007 and 2010. This implied that a dynamic equilibrium
   of trace metal flux into and out of the sediments was established,
   rather than a long-term net accumulation of trace metals. In the
   constructed marsh, little difference was found between the
   immobilization potential in the area of intermittent flooding (high
   marsh) and the area of sustained flooding (low marsh). The newly
   constructed wetland immobilized significantly more Cr, Mn, and Zn than
   the natural marsh and similar concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Pb. This may
   be due to increased redox buffering through a larger FeS buffering pool
   against tidally induced oxygen delivery. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Impacts of Climate Oscillation on Offshore Wind Resources in China Seas},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The long-term stability and sustainability of offshore wind energy
   resources are very important for wind energy exploration. In this study,
   the Cyclostationary Empirical Orthogonal Function (CSEOF) method, which
   can determine the time varying spatial distributions and long-term
   fluctuations in the cyclostationary geophysical process, was adopted to
   investigate the geographical and temporal variability of offshore wind
   resources in China Seas. The CSEOF analysis was performed on wind speeds
   at 70 m height above the sea surface from a validated combined Quick
   Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) wind product
   (2000-2016) with high spatial resolution of 12.5 km, and Climate
   Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) wind data (1979-2016) with a grid size
   of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees. The decomposition results of the two
   datasets indicate that the first CSEOF mode represents the variability
   of wind annual cycle signal and contributes 77.7\% and 76.5\% to the
   wind energy variability, respectively. The principal component time
   series (PCTS) shows an interannual variability of annual wind cycle with
   a period of 3-4 years. The second mode accounts for 4.3\% and 4.7\% of
   total wind speed variability, respectively, and captures the
   spatiotemporal contribution of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on
   regional wind energy variability. The correlations between the mode-2
   PCTS of scatterometer or CFSR winds and the Southern Oscillation Index
   (SOI) are greater than 0.7, illustrating that ENSO has a significant
   impact on China's offshore wind resources. Moreover, the mode-1 or
   mode-2 spatial pattern of CFSR winds is basically consistent with that
   of scatterometer data, but CFSR underestimates the temporal variability
   of annual wind speed cycle and the spatial changes of wind speed related
   to ENSO. Compared with reanalysis data, scatterometer winds always
   demonstrate a finer structure of wind energy variability due to their
   higher spatial resolution. For ENSO events with different intensities,
   the impact of ENSO on regional wind resources varies with time and
   space. In general, El Nino has reduced wind energy in most regions of
   China Seas except for the Bohai Sea and Beibu Bay, while La Nina has
   strengthened the winds in most areas except for the Bohai Sea and
   southern South China Sea.},

Title = {Metabolic Niches and Biodiversity: A Test Case in the Deep Sea Benthos},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The great anthropogenic alterations occurring to carbon availability in
   the oceans necessitate an understanding of the energy requirements of
   species and how changes in energy availability may impact biodiversity.
   The deep-sea floor is characterized naturally by extremely low
   availability of chemical energy and is particularly vulnerable to
   changes in carbon flux from surface waters. Because the energetic
   requirements of organisms impact nearly every aspect of their ecology
   and evolution, we hypothesize that species are adapted to specific
   levels of carbon availability and occupy a particular metabolic niche.
   We test this hypothesis in deep-sea, benthic invertebrates specifically
   examining how energetic demand, axes of the metabolic niche, and
   geographic range size vary over gradients of chemical energy
   availability. We find that benthic invertebrates with higher energetic
   expenditures, and ecologies associated with high energy demand, are
   located in areas with higher chemical energy availability. In addition,
   we find that range size and location of deep-sea, benthic species is
   determined by geographic patterns in chemical energy availability. Our
   findings indicate that species may be adapted to specific energy
   regimes, and the metabolic niche can potentially link scales from
   individuals to ecosystems as well as adaptation to patterns in
   biogeography and biodiversity.},

Abstract = {The composition of Earth's atmosphere depends on the redox state of the
   mantle, which became more oxidizing at some stage after Earth's core
   started to form. Through high-pressure experiments, we found that Fe2+
   in a deep magma ocean would disproportionate to Fe3+ plus metallic iron
   at high pressures. The separation of this metallic iron to the core
   raised the oxidation state of the upper mantle, changing the chemistry
   of degassing volatiles that formed the atmosphere to more oxidized
   species. Additionally, the resulting gradient in redox state of the
   magma ocean allowed dissolved CO2 from the atmosphere to precipitate as
   diamond at depth. This explains Earth's carbon-rich interior and
   suggests that redox evolution during accretion was an important variable
   in determining the composition of the terrestrial atmosphere.},

Abstract = {In order to assess and to compare the abundances of prokaryotes in coral
   sands from three different areas in the Indo-Pacific, a technique was
   developed and evaluated for enumeration of prokaryotes living on and
   within calcareous grains. Propidium iodide labelling of prokaryotes and
   consecutive confocal laser scanning microscopy showed microbial
   colonisation within pores and small fissures of the coral sands. This
   embedded microbial colonisation required at least four extractions with
   weak acetic acid to dissolve the grain surface layer in order to detach
   97\% of the prokaryotic cells. Microbial enumeration based on this
   technique revealed that the abundance of prokaryotes in the carbonate
   sands were not significantly different among the three sites, but were
   about one order of magnitude higher than reported for silicate sands of
   a similar grain size spectrum. A possible reason for this high abundance
   of prokaryotes is the complex surface structure of the biogenic
   calcareous grains, their correspondingly highly porous matrix and the
   associated ability of prokaryotes to penetrate into carbonate grains.
   Our results highlight the role of calcareous reef sands as a substratum
   with a large specific surface area for prokaryotic colonisation and
   emphasise the contribution of calcium carbonate reef sands for element
   cycles in subtropical and tropical ecosystems.},

Title = {Planning for a sustainable desert city: The potential water buffering
   capacity of urban green infrastructure},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},

Volume = {167},

Abstract = {Urban green infrastructure offers arid cities an attractive means of
   mitigation/adaptation to environmental challenges of elevated thermal
   stress, but imposes the requirement of outdoor irrigation that
   aggravates the stress of water resource management. Future development
   of cities is inevitably constrained by the limited availability of water
   resources, under challenges of emergent climate change and continuous
   population growth. This study used the Weather Research and Forecasting
   model with urban dynamics to assess the potential water buffeting
   capacity of urban green infrastructure in arid environments and its
   implications for sustainable urban planning. The Phoenix metropolitan
   area, Arizona, United States, is adopted as a testbed with water-saving
   and fully-greening scenarios investigated. Modifications of the existing
   green infrastructure and irrigation practices are found to significantly
   influence the thermal environment of Phoenix. In particular, water
   saving by xeriscaping (0.77 +/- 0.05 x 10(8) m(3)) allows the region to
   support 19.8\% of the annual water consumption by the projected 2.62
   million population growth by 2050, at a cost of an increase in urban
   ambient temperature of about 1 degrees C.},

Title = {Community disassembly and reassembly following experimental storm surge
   and wrack application},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Questions The structure of coastal vegetation could be altered by a
   regime of more intense hurricanes stemming from global climate change:
   (1) How do plant communities and environmental conditions across an
   estuarine gradient change in relation to simulated storm surge and wrack
   deposition? and; (2) Are there differences in the magnitude of
   compositional shifts along an underlying soil water conductivity
   gradient?
   Location Coastal northwest Florida, USA.
   Methods Four plant communities spanning an estuarine gradient (brackish
   marsh, freshwater marsh, wetland forest and pine savanna) were surveyed
   prior to and following flooding with artificial seawater and manual
   application of wrack. Environmental data (soil water conductivity and
   light transmission to soil surface) were also collected before and after
   treatment applications. Soil samples for texture analysis were collected
   prior to experimental treatments.
   Results The storm surge treatment reduced cover of most species, causing
   browning and eventual loss of leaves, particularly in pine savanna
   species. Soil water conductivity remained elevated for 6 mo following
   the experimental storm surge in the wetland forest and pine savanna.
   Wrack deposition resulted in substantial mortality of underlying
   vegetation and reduced species richness in all communities. The
   composition of the pine savanna plant community shifted in response to
   experimental storm surge and wrack application, with hardy species
   capable of resprouting becoming more abundant and sensitive species
   dropping out of the assemblage. Vegetation zones with high background
   soil salinity were more resilient to the effects of storm surge and
   wrack deposition.
   Conclusions The results suggest that the combined effects of storm surge
   and wrack deposition can drive compositional shifts, particularly in
   more upland assemblages. We conclude that vegetation consisting of
   species naive to increased salinity and/or burial by wrack are highly
   vulnerable to tropical storm intensification.},

Title = {Germination potential of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) swamp soil
   seed bank along geographical gradients},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {759},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Changing environments of temperature, precipitation and moisture
   availability can affect vegetation in ecosystems, by affecting
   regeneration from the seed bank. Our objective was to explore the
   responses of soil seed bank germination to climate-related environments
   along geographic gradients. We collected seed banks in baldcypress
   (Taxodium distichum) swamps along the Mississippi River and the Gulf of
   Mexico Coast in the United States, which have distinct temperature
   and/or precipitation gradients, and germinated themin a greenhouse. The
   frequency, richness and seed density of species germinated from the seed
   bank were compared between various geographic locations, experimental
   water regimes (saturated, flooded) and wetland types (tidal, non-tidal
   and inland swamps). We also analyzed the relationship of seed density to
   the environment by using a Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling (NMDS)
   model. Sixty-one species germinated from the seed bank, differing in
   pattern by geographic location, experimental water regime and wetland
   type. The foundation species (i.e., T. distichum and Cephalanthus
   occidentalis) germinated with a niche affinity for the northern part of
   the latitudinal gradient (Tennessee and Illinois) and these species may
   shift northward with climate change. Some species had higher seed
   density in the locations thatwere subject to more persistent drought
   conditions (e.g., Texas) including Cyperus rotundus and Gratiola
   virginiana, indicating that these species may be better adapted to sites
   with high temperature and lowprecipitation. In contrast, certain species
   including Saururus cernuus and Ludwigia palustriswere present throughout
   the range of these gradients, and somay be more resilient to any future
   climate shifts. We found that the regeneration potential of baldcypress
   swampsmight be altered by changes in local and climate environment
   because of nuances of responses of seed banks to climates along
   latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Our study can help predict
   vegetation regeneration potential to climate change environments
   depending on the ability of these species to disperse and maintain seed
   banks. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   highest levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids were observed at the early
   stationary phase. At all growth stages, I.galbana (T.iso) contained
   arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose and glucose. Glucose represented
   the main sugar, and its content per dry alga biomass weight increased

Title = {Application of an alternative mesh morphing method on the numerical
   modeling of oscillating wave surge converters},
Journal = {RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Abstract = {A technology capable of converting the horizontal motion of the ocean
   waves into energy by the application of a flap-piston system has been
   improved over the last few years, this device is known as oscillating
   wave surge converter. This system has great potential, already proven,
   for electric power generation. The computational fluid dynamics is one
   of the most used tools for the study of wave energy converters. In this
   context, the present paper proposes the application of an alternative
   mesh morphing method to represent the hydrodynamics of these devices,
   which is based on a bottom that oscillates with the converter, leading
   the flap to reach high inclinations without causing numerical
   divergences. The study is performed using the OpenFOAM computational
   code and its extension OLAFOAM. These are based on Reynolds Average
   larder Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling and the Volume of Fluid method
   (VOF) for the free surface representation, which are applied to a
   bidimensional model, allowing the numerical modeling of the converter.
   The proposed method presented good agreement of the results when
   compared to the experimental studies in similar hydrodynamic cases. The
   methodology based on a moving bottom presented relative differences,
   concerning the method that considers the bottom as fixed, between 4\%
   and 17\% for the cases where the flap is near to the ocean bottom and up
   to 8\% for cases where it is further away.},

Title = {Displacements due to surface temperature variation on a uniform elastic

Abstract = {We investigate the displacement field induced by temperature variation
   within a spherical thermal boundary layer under an Earth-like condition
   of surface heating by deriving analytical solutions on a uniform elastic
   sphere under the constraint that its centre of mass remains stationary
   in space. Similar to strain solutions, our displacement solution
   consists of spectra of two distinctive modes: an exponential mode
   relating to the thermal body force and a power-law mode relating to the
   (equivalent) thermal surface loading. The exponential modes of the
   thermal body force in our solution turn out to be identical to that in a
   classic half-space solution, while the effect of thermal loading by the
   power-law modes in our spherical solution is different from the
   exponential modes of thermal loading in the half-space solution. The
   thermal surface loading is found, by analytical and numerical analyses,
   equally important in order of magnitude as the thermal body force in
   producing the radial displacement at the surface throughout the entire
   harmonic spectrum. The transverse displacement arises mainly from the
   power-law modes of thermal surface loading. Numerical simulations, based
   on NASA's space-borne observation of the global land surface temperature
   (ocean is masked out), have shown unique patterns in the annual
   variation of the global displacement field that fits the climatological
   and geographical settings. The predicted amplitude of the thermally
   induced surface deformation in global scale is at the millimetre level
   with the largest similar to 2 mm for radial displacement and similar to
   1 mm for transverse displacement. Comparative analysis shows that the
   radial displacement field is asymptotically proportional to the surface
   temperature distribution, which justifies the use of the half-space
   solution as a good approximation for modelling the global radial
   displacement. The transverse displacement obtained by patched half-space
   solution fails to capture the long-range transverse variations on a
   spherical surface, and thus, is inadequate for modelling and
   synthesizing the global transverse displacement.},

   mechanisms are important to establish, as most of Earth's natural gas
   hydrate is likely bound in marine mud systems. Herein, we focus on
   understanding the origin of hydrate and how fracture form at non-vent
   sites by examining previously hydrate-bearing fractures in conventional
   cores taken from Keathley Canyon 151, U.S. northern Gulf of Mexico,
   drilled by the Gas Hydrate Joint Industry Project in 2005. We combine
   information from well logs, sediment cores, and science party results
   and add new X-ray computed tomography of archival sections and scanning
   electron microcopy of core samples to develop a conceptual model. We
   propose that locally generated microbial methane is transported via
   diffusion from small pores in marine mud into biomineralized burrows
   with larger pore size in a process called short-range migration. Hydrate
   forms in burrows once the methane diffuses into them and the dissolved
   methane concentration exceeds the solubility threshold. When hydrate
   fills a burrow, heave from additional hydrate growth places stress on
   the burrow edges, expands the fracture, and creates additional void
   space in which methane can diffuse and continue forming hydrate.
   Fractures slowly propagate in the direction of maximum principal stress.
   Plain Language Summary Gas hydrates are formed when methane and water
   molecules combine at high pressures and low temperatures to create an
   ice-like solid. They are found in a wide variety of marine and
   permafrost environments and can occupy fractures in subseafloor marine
   sediment. Often, fractures are caused by gas venting from sources below
   the seafloor. However, hydrate-filled fractures are also observed in
   areas without gas vents and thus without connection to an obvious gas
   source. This paper presents a possible mechanism for hydrate fracture
   formation at non-vent sites by analyzing marine sediment samples from a
   nonvent site in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Our results indicate
   methane here was formed by sediment dwelling bacteria and that this
   methane filled partially fossilized burrow tubes left by small marine
   organisms. Once methane concentrated in burrows tubes, gas hydrate began
   to form, and additional gas hydrate growth expanded burrows and
   generated fractures in the sediment. It is important to understand the
   hydrate systems at such sites form, because hydrate is an important part
   of the carbon cycle, and these systems likely contain most of the
   Earth's supply.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to estimate the potential of artificial reef pass
   as a renewable source of energy. The overall idea is to mimic the
   functioning of natural reef-lagoon systems in which the cross-reef
   pressure gradient induced by wave breaking is able to drive an outward
   flow through the pass. The objective is to estimate the feasibility of a
   positive energy breakwater, combining the usual wave-sheltering function
   of immersed breakwater together with the production of renewable energy
   by turbines. A series of numerical simulations is performed using a
   depth-averaged model to understand the effects of each geometrical reef
   parameter on the reef-lagoon hydrodynamics. A synthetic wave and tide
   climate is then imposed to estimate the potential power production. An
   annual production between 50 and 70 MWh is estimated.},

Title = {A sustainable and preventative risk management model for ship recycling
   industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {When the dynamic environment of ship recycling is considered, many
   different severe risks may occur. These risks affect different
   dimensions including people, environment and economic. The aim of the
   study is give a framework to guide managers and even policy makers to
   strive a holistic view in their preventative risk management activities
   in ship recycling. In this framework, which is proposed for sustainable
   risk management in ship recycling industry, risk areas related to
   occupational safety, working conditions, fluctuations in steel industry,
   economic cycles in construction sector and direct and indirect
   environmental impacts are suggested to be considered. In order to deal
   with aforementioned risk areas, several preventative actions are
   proposed such as; for people related risks, Occupational Health and
   Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) implementation; for economic risks,
   responsiveness as a competitive strategy, and for environmental risks,
   green supply chain management implementation is proposed. For each
   action, different sub factors are defined from the literature, and for
   an effective implementation, fuzzy DEMATEL method is used to analyze
   causal link between these factors. Finally, managerial implications for
   sustainable risk management in ship recycling industry are presented.

Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A novel and robust distributed benthic microbial fuel cell (DBMFC) was
   developed to address the energy supply issues for oceanographic sensor
   network applications, especially under scouring and bioturbation by
   aquatic life. Multi-anode/cathode configuration was employed in the
   DBMFC system for enhanced robustness and stability in the harsh ocean
   environment. The results showed that the DBMFC system achieved peak
   power and current densities of 190 mW/m(2) and 125 mA/m(2) respectively.
   Stability characterization tests indicated the DBMFC with multiple
   anodes achieved higher power generation over the systems with single
   anode. A computational model that integrated physical, electrochemical
   and biological factors of MFCs was developed to validate the overall
   performance of the DBMFC system. The model simulation well corresponded
   with the experimental results, and confirmed the hypothesis that using a
   multi anode/cathode MFC configuration results in reliable and robust
   power generation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Regional Patterns of Tropical Indo-Pacific Climate Change: Evidence of
   the Walker Circulation Weakening},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1689-1710},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Regional patterns of tropical Indo-Pacific climate change are
   investigated over the last six decades based on a synthesis of in situ
   observations and ocean model simulations, with a focus on physical
   consistency among sea surface temperature (SST), cloud, sea level
   pressure (SLP), surface wind, and subsurface ocean temperature. A newly
   developed bias-corrected surface wind dataset displays westerly trends
   over the western tropical Pacific and easterly trends over the tropical
   Indian Ocean, indicative of a slowdown of the Walker circulation. This
   pattern of wind change is consistent with that of observed SLP change
   showing positive trends over the Maritime Continent and negative trends
   over the central equatorial Pacific. Suppressed moisture convergence
   over the Maritime Continent is largely due to surface wind changes,
   contributing to observed decreases in marine cloudiness and land
   precipitation there.
   Furthermore, observed ocean mixed layer temperatures indicate a
   reduction in zonal contrast in the tropical Indo-Pacific characterized
   by larger warming in the tropical eastern Pacific and western Indian
   Ocean than in the tropical western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean.
   Similar changes are successfully simulated by an ocean general
   circulation model forced with the bias-corrected wind stress. Whereas
   results from major SST reconstructions show no significant change in
   zonal gradient in the tropical Indo-Pacific, both bucket-sampled SSTs
   and nighttime marine air temperatures (NMAT) show a weakening of the
   zonal gradient consistent with the subsurface temperature changes. All
   these findings from independent observations provide robust evidence for
   ocean-atmosphere coupling associated with the reduction in the Walker
   circulation over the last six decades.},

Title = {Microanalysis of carbonate cement delta O-18 in a CO2-storage system

Abstract = {Oxygen isotope (delta O-18) zonation in carbonate mineral cements is
   often employed as a proxy record (typically with millimeter-scale
   resolution) of changing temperature regimes during different stages of
   sediment diagenesis. Recent advances in secondary ion mass spectrometry
   allow for highly precise and accurate determinations of cement delta
   O-18 values to be made in situ on a micrometer scale, thus significantly
   increasing the spatial resolution available to studies of diagenesis in
   sandstone-shale and carbonate systems. Chemo-isotopically zoned
   dolomite-ankerite cements within shaly sandstone beds of the
   predominantly silty-shaly Eau Claire Formation (Cambrian, Illinois
   Basin) were investigated, revealing the following: with increasing depth
   of burial (from <0.5 to similar to 2 km {[}<1500 to 6500 ft]), cement
   delta O-18 values decrease from a high of approximately 24 parts per
   thousand down to approximately 14 parts per thousand (on the Vienna
   standard mean ocean water {[}VSMOW] scale, equivalent to -6.5 parts per
   thousand to -16.5 parts per thousand on the Vienna Peedee belemnite
   {[}VPDB] scale). The observed cross-basin trend is largely consistent
   with cements having formed in response to progressive sediment burial
   and heating. Within the context of independent burial and thermal
   history models for the Illinois Basin, cementation began soon after
   deposition and continued intermittently into the mid-Permian. However,
   temperatures in excess of burial model predictions are inferred at the
   time of latest ankerite cement precipitation, which we propose
   overlapped in time with conductive heating of the Eau Claire Formation
   (a closed system) from under- and overlying sandstone aquifers that
   channeled the flow of hot, Mississippi Valley type mineralizing brines
   during the mid-Permian (ca. 270 Ma).},

Title = {Diverse range of mineralization induced by phase separation of
   hydrothermal fluid: Case study of the Yonaguni Knoll IV hydrothermal
   field in the Okinawa Trough back-arc basin},
Journal = {RESOURCE GEOLOGY},

Abstract = {The Yonaguni Knoll IV hydrothermal vent field (24 degrees 51'N, 122
   degrees 42'E) is located at water depths of 1370-1385 m near the western
   edge of the southern Okinawa Trough. During the YK03-05 and YK04-05
   expeditions using the submersible Shinkai 6500, both hydrothermal
   precipitates (sulfide/sulfate/carbonate) and high temperature fluids
   (Tmax = 328 degrees C) presently venting from chimney-mound structures
   were extensively sampled. The collected venting fluids had a wide range
   of chemistry (Cl concentration 376-635 mmol kg(-1)), which is considered
   as evidence for sub-seafloor phase separation. While the Cl-enriched
   smoky black fluids were venting from two adjacent chimney-mound
   structures in the hydrothermal center, the clear transparent fluids
   sometimes containing CO2 droplet were found in the peripheral area of
   the field. This distribution pattern could be explained by migration of
   the vapor-rich hydrothermal fluid within a porous sediment layer after
   the sub-seafloor phase separation. The collected hydrothermal
   precipitates demonstrated a diverse range of mineralization, which can
   be classified into five groups: (i) anhydrite-rich chimneys, immature
   precipitates including sulfide disseminations in anhydrite; (ii) massive
   Zn-Pb-Cu sulfides, consisting of sphalerite, wurtzite, galena,
   chalcopyrite, pyrite, and marcasite; (iii) Ba-As chimneys, composed of
   barite with sulfide disseminations, sometimes associated with realgar
   and orpiment overgrowth; (iv) Mn-rich chimneys, consisting of carbonates
   (calcite and magnesite) and sulfides (sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite,
   alabandite, and minor amount of tennantite and enargite); and (v)
   pavement, silicified sediment including abundant native sulfur or
   barite. Sulfide/sulfate mineralization (groups i-iii) was found in the
   chimney-mound structure associated with vapor-loss (Cl-enriched) fluid
   venting. In contrast, the sulfide/carbonate mineralization (group iv)
   was specifically found in the chimneys where vapor-rich (Cl-depleted)
   fluid venting is expected, and the pavement (group v) was associated
   with diffusive venting from the seafloor sediment. This correspondence
   strongly suggests that the subseafloor phase separation plays an
   important role in the diverse range of mineralization in the Yonaguni IV
   field. The observed sulfide mineral assemblage was consistent with the
   sulfur fugacity calculated from the FeS content in sphalerite/wurtzite
   and the fluid temperature for each site, which suggests that the shift
   of the sulfur fugacity due to participation of volatile species during
   phase separation is an important factor to induce diverse
   mineralization. In contrast, carbonate mineralization is attributed to
   the significant mixing of vapor-rich hydrothermal fluid and seawater. A
   submarine hydrothermal system within a back-arc basin in the continental
   margin may be considered as developed in a geologic setting favorable to
   a diverse range of mineralization, where relatively shallow water depth
   induces sub-seafloor phase separation of hydrothermal fluid, and
   sediment accumulation could enhance migration of the vapor-rich
   hydrothermal fluid.},

Abstract = {Changes in forest management policies in the Pacific Northwest have
   resulted in a broad array of management alternatives to clearcutting on
   state and federal forest lands. These management alternatives should be
   monitored for their effects on animal use, particularly during critical
   periods for survival. We compared abundance of resident birds among
   three alternative silvicultural treatments (modified clearcut,
   two-story, small-patch group-selection) and unharvested controls during
   winter. Total bird abundance was highest in small-patch stands and
   lowest in modified clearcuts during winter. Species richness was highest
   in small-patch stands and lowest in control and clearcut stands. Two
   species (Steller's jays {[}Cyanocitta stelleri] and golden-crowned
   kinglets {[}Regulus satrapa]) were most abundant in control stands and
   small-patch stands. Spotted towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) were more
   abundant in two-story stands; dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) were
   more abundant in harvested stands than control stands. The small-patch
   group-selection treatment retained structural and compositional
   complexity of vegetation and provided habitat for more individuals than
   two-story or modified clearcut treatments. However, two-story and
   modified clearcut treatments with components of mature and old-growth
   forests (snags, logs, large trees) provided habitat for several bird
   species during winter. Silvicultural treatments that retain structural
   and compositional vegetation complexity or develop late-successional
   characteristics more quickly than stands regenerating following
   traditional clearcutting practices may be used by more bird species and
   should be considered when developing stand management guidelines.},

Abstract = {Globally, mineral processing activities produce an estimated 680 GL/yr
   of alkaline wastewater. Neutralizing pH and removing dissolved elements
   are the main goals of wastewater treatment prior to discharge. Here, we
   present the first study to explicitly evaluate the role of microbial
   communities in driving pH neutralization and element removal in alkaline
   wastewaters by fermentation of organic carbon, using bauxite residue
   leachate as a model system, and evaluate the effects of organic carbon
   complexity and microbial inoculum addition rates on the performance of
   these treatment systems at laboratory scale. Rates and extents of pH
   neutralization were higher in bioreactors fed with simpler organic
   carbon substrates (glucose and banana: 6 days to reach pH <= 8) than
   those fed with more complex organic carbon substrates (eucalyptus mulch:
   15 days to reach pH <= 8; woodchips: equilibrium pH around 9).
   Concentrations of dissolved Al, As, B, Mo, Na, S, and V all
   significantly decreased after bioremediation. Increasing soil inoculant
   addition rate accelerated rates and extent of pH neutralization and
   element removal up to 0.1 wt \%; further increases had little effect.
   Overall, glucose added at 1.8 wt \% and soil inoculum added at 0.1 wt \%
   provided the most effective minimal combination of carbon substrate and
   inoculum to drive pH neutralization and element removal.},

Title = {RAD sequencing enables unprecedented phylogenetic resolution and

Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {70-79},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Species delimitations is problematic in many cases due to the difficulty
   of evaluating predictions from species hypotheses. In many cases
   delimitations rely on subjective interpretations of morphological and/or
   DNA data. Species with inadequate genetic resources needed to answer
   questions regarding evolutionary relatedness and genetic uniqueness are
   particularly problematic. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of
   restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to objectively
   resolve unambiguous phylogenetic relationships in a recalcitrant group
   of deep-sea corals with divergences >80 million years. We infer robust
   species boundaries in the genus Paragorgia by testing alternative
   delimitation hypotheses using a Bayes Factors delimitation method. We
   present substantial evidence rejecting the current morphological species
   delimitation model for the genus and infer the presence of cryptic
   species associated with environmental variables. We argue that the
   suitability limits of RAD-seq for phylogenetic inferences cannot be
   assessed in terms of absolute time, but are contingent on taxon-specific
   factors. We show that classical taxonomy can greatly benefit from
   integrative approaches that provide objective tests to species
   delimitation hypotheses. Our results lead the way for addressing further
   questions in marine biogeography, community ecology, population
   dynamics, conservation, and evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Fossil derived fuels available for application within the maritime
   sector have been dominated by heavy fuel oil (HFO), which is
   conventionally used in low speed (main) engines, and more refined fuels
   such as marine diesel oil (MDO), which is consumed in fast or medium
   speed engines. However, increasing fuel costs and regulatory pressure
   such as the restrictions placed on sulphur content have increased
   interest in the use of alternative fuels. A number of alternative fuels
   have been identified and may be viable for use within the maritime
   sector including straight vegetable oil (SVO) as an alternative to HFO
   in low speed engines, biodiesel to replace MDO/MGO in low to medium
   speed engines and bio-liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) in gas engines
   using LNG. The potential sources of biomass feedstocks, conversion
   pathways and technologies are identified. The key parameters limiting
   their potential application are examined, in particular, availability,
   technological development, technical integration, and operational
   consequences. A proposed solution to overcome these limitations is
   recommended. The effective implementation of these strategies will
   enable the more widespread use of biofuels in marine applications,
   significantly reducing emissions from ships and improving global air
   quality and also protecting the ecological environment.},

Title = {Thermophile Lytic Enzyme Fusion Proteins that Target Clostridium
   perfringens},
Journal = {ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Clostridium perfringens is a bacterial pathogen that causes necrotic
   enteritis in poultry and livestock, and is a source of food poisoning
   and gas gangrene in humans. As the agriculture industry eliminates the
   use of antibiotics in animal feed, alternatives to antibiotics will be
   needed. Bacteriophage endolysins are enzymes used by the virus to burst
   their bacterial host, releasing bacteriophage particles. This type of
   enzyme represents a potential replacement for antibiotics controlling C.
   perfringens. As animal feed is often heat-treated during production of
   feed pellets, thermostable enzymes would be preferred for use in feed.
   To create thermostable endolysins that target C. perfringens,
   thermophile endolysin catalytic domains were fused to cell wall binding
   domains from different C. perfringens prophage endolysins. Three
   thermostable catalytic domains were used, two from prophage endolysins
   from two Geobacillus strains, and a third endolysin from the deep-sea
   thermophilic bacteriophage Geobacillus virus E2 (GVE2). These domains
   harbor predicted L-alanine-amidase, glucosaminidase, and
   L-alanine-amidase activities, respectively and degrade the peptidoglycan
   of the bacterial cell wall. The cell wall binding domains were from C.
   perfringens prophage endolysins (Phage LYtic enzymes; Ply): PlyCP18,
   PlyCP10, PlyCP33, PlyCP41, and PlyCP26F. The resulting fifteen chimeric
   proteins were more thermostable than the native C. perfringens
   endolysins, and killed swine and poultry disease-associated strains of
   C. perfringens.},

Abstract = {In nuclear reactors, a tremendous amount of thermal energy and
   radioactivity is generated due to fission reactions. Safety is in
   general an important aspect for any industry; however, the emission of
   significant nuclear radiation into the environment during an accident
   causing harm to humans both at the reactor site and off-site is the main
   safety concern. The three major nuclear accidents releasing radiation to
   the environment were-Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima. To
   avoid these accidents in future, the demand for safety in nuclear
   installations has become more important. Nuclear industry from these
   accidents has learned and taken stringent steps toward ensuring a better
   reliability of safety systems that ensure cooling of reactor and fuel
   storage pond, shutting down of reactor and containing the radioactivity.
   Plant experience indicates that quality assurance during design,
   procurement, operation, maintenance, surveillance and human resource
   management have a direct bearing on the reliability of these safety
   systems. Based on a philosophy that effective quality assurance is
   inseparably linked to the fostering of an excellent safety culture and
   ensuring reliability, the implementation of quality management system
   based on IAEA standard is needed to achieve the desired safety and
   reliability objective. This paper presents the detailed activities
   carried out in quality assurance programme in a nuclear reactor to
   enhance the safety and reliability of nuclear reactor safety systems.},

Abstract = {Dissolved iron (Fe) concentrations in the California coastal upwelling
   regime vary over two orders of magnitude (from <0.05 to >5 nM), which
   leads to a wide range in Fe effects on phytoplankton growth. Fe-addition
   experiments are appropriate to use to assess the biological role of Fe
   in low-Fe areas, but other methods are needed in Fe-replete regions. We
   present experiments that use additions of the exogenous siderophore
   desferrioxamine B (DFOB, obtained from a terrestrial actinomycete
   fungus) to sequester ambient Fe and to markedly decrease its
   availability to the biota. DFOB additions resulted in artificial Fe
   limitation of the phytoplankton community in high-Fe areas of the
   upwelling region. Results of these ``Fe-removal{''} experiments mirror
   those of Fe-addition experiments in low-Fe, high-nutrient,
   low-chlorophyll (HNLC) waters. When DFOB is added to Fe-replete waters,
   changes in nutrient concentrations, biomass, and other biological
   parameters closely resemble those seen in Fe-limited controls in HNLC
   areas, while the controls without DFOB behave much like HNLC Fe-addition
   bottles. DFOB additions in high-Fe waters greatly reduced biological Fe
   uptake and, consequently, nitrate, silicic acid, and carbon-uptake rates
   as well as particulate production. Diatoms and other phytoplankton
   bloomed profusely in unamended controls but not in Fe-Limited +DFOB
   bottles. Bacterial numbers and zooplankton grazing activity were also
   severely reduced in DFOB-addition bottles. These experiments demonstrate
   that artificially lowering Fe availability can induce limitation of
   autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton and can prevent utilization of
   the high ambient levels of upwelled nutrients along the California
   coast. Our results suggest that DFOB-bound Fe is highly unavailable to
   the plankton community, a result that offers researchers an important
   tool to use to probe the influence of Fe on biological community
   development in high-Fe regimes.},

Abstract = {In northern Mexico, aridity, salinity and high temperatures limit areas
   that can be cultivated. To investigate the nature of nitrogen-fixing
   symbionts of Phaseolus filiformis, an adapted wild bean species native
   to this region, their phylogenies were inferred by MLSA. Most rhizobia
   recovered belong to the proposed new species Ensifer aridi. Phylogenetic
   analyses of nodC and nifH show that Mexican isolates carry symbiotic
   genes acquired through horizontal gene transfer that are divergent from
   those previously characterized among bean symbionts. These strains are
   salt tolerant, able to grow in alkaline conditions, high temperatures,
   and capable of utilizing a wide range of carbohydrates and organic acids
   as carbon sources for growth. This study improves the knowledge on
   diversity, geographic distribution and evolution of bean-nodulating
   rhizobia in Mexico and further enlarges the spectrum of microsymbiont
   with which Phaseolus species can interact with, including cultivated
   bean varieties, notably under stressed environments. Here, the species
   Ensifer aridi sp. nov. is proposed as strain type of the Moroccan
   isolate LMR001(T) (= LMG 31426(T); = HAMBI 3707(T)) recovered from

Abstract = {The use of CO2 has received considerable interest as a method of EOR but
   a major drawback is its availability and increasing cost Therefore, as
   the number of CO2 injection projects increase, an alternative must be
   considered to meet the economic considerations. For this reason
   attention has been directed to nitrogen injection which may be a good
   substitute for CO2. The purpose of the experiments described in this
   paper was to investigate the efficiency of oil recovery by CO2 and N-2
   in fractured carbonate rock. The combined effects of gravity drainage
   and component exchange between gas in fracture and oil in matrix on oil
   recovery in fractured reservoirs subjected to CO2 or nitrogen gas
   injection are experimentally studied. Laboratory experiments have been
   carried out on a low permeable outcrop chalk, as an analogue to a North
   Sea reservoir rock. This was surrounded by a fracture, established with
   a novel experimental set-up. The experiments aimed to investigate the
   potential of oil recovery by secondary and tertiary CO2 and nitrogen gas
   injection at high pressure high temperature condition. The matrix block
   was saturated using recombined binary mixture live oil (C-1-C-7) while
   the fracture was filled with a seating material to obtain a homogeneous
   saturation. The sealing material was then removed by increasing the
   temperature which in turn creates the fracture surrounding the core. Gas
   was injected into the fracture at pressures above the bubble point,of
   the oil. Oil recovery as a function of time was monitored during the
   experiments. Results from secondary gas injection experiments indicate
   that CO2 injection at elevated pressure and temperature is more
   efficient than N-2 injection.
   Results from tertiary gas injection experiments also show that injection
   of CO2 could significantly recover the oil, even after waterflooding,
   compared to N-2 injection. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Influence of a velocity profile \& support structure on tidal stream
   turbine performance},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {23-30},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With tidal turbine technology in its infancy prototype devices are
   likely to be positioned at locations where both the local marine
   environment and vessel navigation are favourable. However, as marine
   turbine technology develops toward economic viability there is a
   propensity for undesirable interactions with local shipping, higher
   turbulence levels and velocity shear through the water column to occur.
   The latter high shear could result from positioning the turbine lower in
   the water column, perhaps due to local shipping requirements. This paper
   helps to elucidate the performance of the tidal turbine and in
   particular the blade forces during rotation within a high shear velocity
   profile. A velocity profile from ADCP measurements was used as an inlet
   boundary for CFD analysis. The work shows that the presence of a
   suitably positioned stanchion downstream of the turbine will result in
   reduced performance characteristics over a complete rotation. However,
   the amplitude of the characteristics, in particular, the axial loading
   increases which would require careful design considerations. (C) 2012

Title = {Plant invasion affects vegetation structure and sediment nitrogen stocks
   in subtropical mangroves},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {172},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Plant invasion can primarily affect the structure and functioning of
   terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although there is evidence that
   plant invasion can modify organic matter dynamics in mangroves, it is
   uncertain whether and to which extent these changes can affect carbon
   (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in the sediment-plant system. Here, we
   measured: (i) the structure of native vegetation and C and N in the
   sediment-plant system in subtropical mangroves subjected to aquatic
   macrophytes invasion in southeastern Brazil. We answered the following
   questions: i) Do invaded mangroves differ in aboveground biomass
   compared to non-invaded mangroves?; ii) Are there C4 macrophytes in
   these sites? iii) What are the C and N stocks in sediment of invaded
   mangroves? We quantified C and N concentrations and the isotopic
   signature of such elements (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in the sediment
   plant system, the C and N stocks in the sediment (0-20 cm depth), and
   mangrove aboveground biomass. Mangrove aboveground biomass was lower at
   invaded compared to non-invaded sites reflecting the species
   displacement in invaded sites. The sediment at invaded mangroves did not
   significantly contribute to C4 sources because of the large predominance
   of both mangrove and invasive C3 plants. While sediment C stocks were
   similar among study sites (similar to 47 Mg ha(-1)), N stocks were lower
   at invaded (2.7 Mg ha(-1)) comparing to non invaded (3.2 Mg ha(-1))
   mangroves. The lower N stocks at invaded sites can reflect the higher
   leaf N concentrations and lower C:N ratios of invasive plants compared
   to mangroves. Thus, the effects of macrophytes invasion in subtropical
   mangroves are more apparent for vegetation structure and N stocks. C
   stocks alteration is expected the be detectable in the future.},

Title = {Uptake of trace elements into authigenic carbonate at a brine seep in
   the northern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {582},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Hypersaline seafloor environments formed by brine seepage represent role
   model examples of extreme marine ecosystems; they may for example help
   to identify potential habitats for life on other planets. Trace and rare
   earth elements (REEs) are crucial components enabling microbial life at
   brine and hydrocarbon seeps. However, the behavior of trace elements at
   brine seeps is currently poorly understood. Because authigenic
   carbonates forming at brine seeps archive information on the composition
   of seepage fluids, we have analyzed carbonates collected from a brine
   seep site (Mississippi Canyon 709, MC709 for short) of the northern Gulf
   of Mexico (GoM). The dominance of low-magnesium (Mg) calcite among the
   carbonate minerals, moderately low delta C-13(carb) values (average:
   -26.1\%., VPDB), as well as the presence of oil in carbonates suggest
   concomitant seepage of brine fluids and crude oil at this site. High
   delta C-18(carb) values (up to +4.5 parts per thousand, VPDB) suggest
   the involvement of O-18-rich fluids during carbonate precipitation,
   likely resulting from mineral-water reactions in deeper sediments.
   Significant enrichments of barium (Ba), strontium (Sr), and lithium (Li)
   in the samples suggest that deep ascending brine fluids contributed to
   carbonate formation. Enrichments in molybdenum (Mo), arsenic (As), and
   antimony (Sb) and a correlation between Mo, As, and Sb enrichment
   factors (EF) and the authigenic iron fraction (Fe/Al ratios) suggest
   that iron particulate shuttle processes were involved in scavenging of
   dissolved Mo, As, and Sb from seawater. This notion is strengthened by
   the co-variation of Mo-EF and U-EF and the shale-normalized REE patterns
   of the brine-seep carbonates. This study allows to constrain the
   enrichment mechanisms of trace and REE elements at brine seeps,
   providing the foundation for an improved understanding of the
   distribution and behavior of trace metals, as well as their role in
   microbial metabolisms in the local hypersaline environment.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Concerns about the potential adverse effects of Spartina invasion on New
   Zealand estuaries, such as habitat loss and degradation, have led to
   herbicide use to control its spread. An experiment was conducted in the
   Manukau Harbour (New Zealand) to determine sediment remobilisation rates
   (Delta E) from herbicide-treated S. anglica patches. Paired treatment
   and control patches (<= 25 m diam.) were monitored at two sites 500 in
   apart with different wave exposures. Above- (AGB) and below-ground (BGB)
   biomass decomposition and Delta E were determined from repeat surveys
   over c. 2.5 years. Work done by waves (W), which integrates wave-energy
   dissipation at the bed over time, was used as a surrogate measure of
   sediment transport potential. Complete AGB loss occurred in both treated
   patches within 3 months of initial herbicide application, whereas BGB (a
   matrix of roots and rhizomes) persisted much longer. An exponential
   decay model (r(2) = 0.6) fitted to the site-two treatment data predicted
   an c. 85\% reduction in BGB after 5 years, whereas the BGB changes for
   the larger and more heterogeneous site-one treatment were more complex.
   BGB was a better predictor of average bed elevation than AGB in multiple
   regression models and, although bed elevation decreased through time and
   with waves, BGB was positively related to bed elevation at both sites.
   Delta E was similar for both treatment patches (c. 0.05 and c. 0.06 m
   yr(-1), P < 0.001, r(2) >= 0.97) and complete sediment loss was
   predicted to occur within 6-10 years. The site-one control patch
   accumulated sediment (0.01 myr(-1), P<0.001, r(2) = 0.81) whereas the
   more wave-exposed site-two control eroded (0.01 m yr(-1), P = 0.0017,
   r(2) = 0.61). The potential for adverse sediment effects resulting from
   Spartina control at wave-exposed sites will be minimal if the treated
   areas are small relative to the size of the estuary.},

Abstract = {Many countries committed to promoting eco-friendly transportation by
   accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in their country
   due to their beneficial feature, including in Indonesia. The ancillary
   services by EVs will be one of solution for power system due to their
   unique characteristic as energy storage. Indonesia is one of the
   developing countries that has a thousand islands which are mostly not
   connected to each other. Java-Madura-Bali (JAMALI) system is one of the
   large systems that has energy mix which is mainly produced by coal-fired
   power plant and limited energy storage. Large capacity battery from
   penetrated EVs in the future might be a good opportunity to support the
   grid, with time mapping for charging and discharging. Duration and
   period of opportunity can be determined by frequency recognition that
   has been measured for 1 month. This paper shows the opportunity of
   parked EVs utilization by releasing and absorbing the electricity for
   the load leveling and frequency regulation. The impacts of EVs adoption
   and V2G participation rates, which are motivated by some incentive from
   Transmission Service Operator (ISO), are analyzed. The results show that
   controllable charging and discharging behaviors of EVs have led to the
   idea of EVs utilization for supporting the grid. The feasibility of
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G) in Indonesian electrical grid is evaluated in this
   study. The evaluated ancillary services include load leveling and
   frequency regulation. Copyright 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A fast radiative transfer model for visible through shortwave infrared

Journal = {JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY \& RADIATIVE TRANSFER},

Volume = {116},

Abstract = {A computationally efficient radiative transfer model (RTM) for
   calculating visible (VIS) through shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectances
   is developed for use in satellite and airborne cloud property
   retrievals. The full radiative transfer equation (RTE) for combinations
   of cloud, aerosol, and molecular layers is solved approximately by using
   six independent RTEs that assume the plane-parallel approximation along
   with a single-scattering approximation for Rayleigh scattering. Each of
   the six RTEs can be solved analytically if the bidirectional
   reflectance/transmittance distribution functions (BRDF/BTDF) of the
   cloud/aerosol layers are known. The adding/doubling (AD) algorithm is
   employed to account for overlapped cloud/aerosol layers and
   non-Lambertian surfaces. Two approaches are used to mitigate the
   significant computational burden of the AD algorithm. First, the BRDF
   and BTDF of single cloud/aerosol layers are pre-computed using the
   discrete ordinates radiative transfer program (DISORT) implemented with
   128 streams, and second, the required integral in the AD algorithm is
   numerically implemented on a twisted icosahedral mesh. A concise surface
   BRDF simulator associated with the MODIS land surface product (MCD43) is
   merged into a fast RTM to accurately account for non-isotropic surface
   reflectance. The resulting fast RTM is evaluated with respect to its
   computational accuracy and efficiency. The simulation bias between
   DISORT and the fast RTM is large (e.g., relative error > 5\%) only when
   both the solar zenith angle (SZA) and the viewing zenith angle (VZA) are
   large (i.e., SZA > 45 degrees and VZA > 70 degrees). For general
   situations, i.e., cloud/aerosol layers above a non-Lambertian surface,
   the fast RTM calculation rate is faster than that of the 128-stream
   DISORT by approximately two orders of magnitude. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {In-situ measured primary productivity of ice algae in Arctic sea ice
   floes using a new incubation method},

Abstract = {Recent changes in climate and environmental conditions have had great
   negative effects such as decreasing sea ice thickness and the extent of
   Arctic sea ice floes that support ice-related organisms. However,
   limited field observations hinder the understanding of the impacts of
   the current changes in the previously ice-covered regions on sea ice
   algae and other ice-related ecosystems. Our main objective in this study
   was to measure recent primary production of ice algae and their relative
   contribution to total primary production (ice plus pelagic primary
   production). In-situ primary productivity experiments with a new
   incubation system for ice algae were conducted in 3 sea ice cores at 2
   different ice camps in the northern Chukchi Sea, 2014, using a C-13 and
   N-15 isotope tracer technique. A new incubation system was tested for
   conducting primary productivity experiments on ice algae that has
   several advantages over previous incubation methods, enabling stable
   carbon and nitrogen uptake experiments on ice algae under more natural
   environmental conditions. The vertical C-shaped distributions of the ice
   algal chl-a, with elevated concentrations at the top and bottom of the
   sea ice were observed in all cores, which is unusual for Arctic sea ice.
   The mean chl-a concentration (0.05 +/- 0.03 mg chl-a m(-3)) and the
   daily carbon uptake rates (ranging from 0.55 to 2.23 mg C m(-2) d(-1))
   for the ice algae were much lower in this study than in previous studies
   in the Arctic Ocean. This is likely because of the late sampling periods
   and thus the substantial melting occurring. Ice algae contributed
   1.5-5.7\% of the total particulate organic carbon (POC) contents of the
   combined euphotic water columns and sea ice floes. In comparison, ice
   algae contributed 4.8-8.6\% to the total primary production which is
   greater than previously reported in the Arctic Ocean. If all of the
   ice-associated productions were included, the contributions of the sea
   ice floes to the total primary production would be greater in the Arctic
   Ocean and their importance would be greater in the arctic marine
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Energy harvesting performance and flow structure of an oscillating
   hydrofoil with finite span},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {314-326},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The energy harvesting performance and resulting flow structures of a
   hydrofoil oscillating in pitch and heave are studied experimentally in a
   water flume. The shape of a hydrofoil cross-section is shown to have
   negligible influence on the power generation for the geometries tested.
   It is found that contribution to efficiency from heaving motion
   increases with reduced frequency at optimal pitching amplitude. However,
   contribution to efficiency from pitching motion decreases with reduced
   frequency because the development of a leading-edge vortex during the
   stroke is delayed at the high reduced frequency. Increasing the aspect
   ratio of the hydrofoil leads to a higher contribution to efficiency from
   heaving over the range of aspect ratios considered in this study.
   However, the effect of the aspect ratio on efficiency from pitching is
   negligible. When end plates are mounted at both ends of the hydrofoil,
   heaving power enhances. However, the enhancement of heaving power
   becomes smaller with increasing aspect ratio. Meanwhile, pitching power
   improves uniformly with the addition of end plates for all three aspect
   ratios. Our study suggests that the dependence of energy harvesting
   performance on aspect ratio is due to the delayed growth of the
   leading-edge vortex near the ends of the hydrofoil.},

Title = {Self-powered environmental monitoring via a triboelectric nanogenerator},
Journal = {NANO ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {98},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With air pollution increasing around 75\% in the past 30 years, 80\% of
   the globe's wasted water flowing into Earth's oceans and rivers
   untreated, and more than 22 million hectares of soil being polluted, a
   more effective, efficient, and self-sufficient chemical sensor is needed
   to recognize, and in some cases, treat these pollutants. Currently, many
   sensors that require an external power source such as a battery or
   capacitor, necessitate human maintenance and involvement for accurate
   data collection, and can be detrimental to the environment. This makes
   the current technology highly unfavorable and incompatible with the
   recent surge in the Internet of Things (IoT). With that said, with the
   recent advances in Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs), chemical
   sensors are able to become smaller, smarter, and most importantly,
   self-powered. In this review, the research progress of triboelectric
   nanogenerators for environmental monitoring are systematically
   summarized. More specifically applications including air, soil, and
   water chemical sensing will be examined. We concluded our review with a
   discussion of the challenges and problems of leveraging triboelectric
   nanogenerators for self-powered environ-mental monitoring.},

Abstract = {We examined the shell morphology of the bay mussel Mytilus trossulus
   (Gould) at six locations with various levels of wave exposure in Barkley
   Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.
   Young adult M. trossulus (29-35 mm shell length) collected from
   wave-exposed sites displayed striking differences in shell morphology
   from M. trossulus from sheltered sites. Mytilus trossulus from
   wave-exposed habitats had a lower shell height/shell width ratio and a
   thicker shell; they also had higher, more robust dysodont teeth, as well
   as a thicker hinge ligament. Examination of juveniles (12-14 mm shell
   length) collected from a wave-exposed shore and a sheltered shore
   separated by only a few hundred metres displayed similar differences in
   shell morphology and ligament thickness. These observations suggest that
   wave exposure is the cause of the observed differences in shell
   morphology and ligament thickness in M. trossulus. This is the first
   report of a correlation between wave exposure and morphology of the
   dysodont teeth and ligament in a bivalve. We discuss potential selective
   pressures that may favor characteristics of wave-exposed shells,
   including the probability of dislodgment and misalignment of valves in
   high wave energy areas.},

Journal = {DESALINATION},

Volume = {436},
Pages = {15-27},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {To understand the process and the source of origin of the
   hypersaline/brines along the selected locations in Kuwait's, groundwater
   and sea water samples were collected. The analysis of the samples
   reveals that a few groundwater samples had Electricity Conductivity
   higher than that of the seawater. The study was carried out by
   calculating the ratio of ions to halides such as NO3/Cl, Mg/Cl, Br/Cl,
   Sr/Cl, Mn/Cl, Li/Cl and V/Cl. The ratios reveal that there were three
   different types of groundwater: a) groundwater less contaminated with
   seawater, b) groundwater equally contaminated by seawater and c)
   groundwater with ionic concentration greater than the seawater. It was
   inferred that most of the groundwater samples collected near the bay
   were having higher EC than those that were collected near the open sea.
   The hypersalinity of the groundwater samples was inferred due to the
   influence of the effluents of the desalination plants and H2S enriched
   waters, though there were other processes in operation governed by the
   pH, anthropogenic sources and infiltration of metal from oil ash near
   the thermal power plants. The statistical analysis reveals that in
   certain locations, multiple processes are active to make it more salt
   enriched.},

Abstract = {Those parts of the northwest Pacific Ocean where sea level has been
   rising fastest over the past few decades include islands in the
   Federated States of Micronesia. To understand the possible effects of
   rapid sea-level rise, coastal surveys were undertaken within Pohnpei
   State in October 2014. The high volcanic island of Pohnpei was targeted
   along with 10 reef-edge island groups on its surrounding barrier reef as
   well as islands on Ant Atoll, 15 km southwest. Evidence of shoreline
   erosion attributable to sea-level rise is found only in a few places
   along the main island's northeast (windward) coast. High rainfall has
   led to the accumulation of terrestrial sediment along the coast that is
   covered with mangrove forest 2-3 km broad in places shielding the
   island's coast from wave erosion. A different picture is found on
   reef-edge islands around which erosion over the last few decades can
   mostly be explained by recent sea-level rise. Islands have disappeared
   within living memory, others drastically reduced in size in the past
   decade, while others - their sand cover washed away - are being reduced
   to a skeletal (boulders anchored by mangrove) state. The coasts of Ant
   Atoll appear little affected by erosion ascribable to sea-level rise. In
   summary, fewer effects than might be expected from recent sea-level rise
   were seen in Pohnpei, largely for reasons of natural coastal resilience
   or a lack of record, especially for reef-edge islands. The importance of
   mangrove conservation and an understanding of sediment dynamics on the
   broad reef-lagoon shelf surrounding the main island is manifest.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Temperature is observed to have different trends at coastal and ocean
   locations along the western Iberian Peninsula from 1975 to 2006, which
   corresponds to the last warming period in the area under study. The
   analysis was carried out by means of the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation
   (SODA). Reanalysis data are available at monthly scale with a horizontal
   resolution of 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees and a vertical resolution of 40
   levels, which allows obtaining information beneath the sea surface. Only
   the first 21 vertical levels (from 5.0 m to 729.35 m) were considered
   here, since the most important changes in heat content observed for the
   world ocean during the last decades, correspond to the upper 700 m.
   Warming was observed to be considerably higher at ocean locations than
   at coastal ones. Ocean warming ranged from values on the order of 0.3
   degrees C dec(-1) near surface to less than 0.1 degrees C dec(-1) at 500
   m, while coastal warming showed values close to 0.2 degrees C dec(-1)
   near surface, decreasing rapidly below 0.1 degrees C dec(-1) for depths
   on the order of 50 m. The heat content anomaly for the upper 700 m,
   showed a sharp increase from coast (0.46 Wm(-2)) to ocean (1.59 Wm(-2)).
   The difference between coastal and ocean values was related to the
   presence of coastal upwelling, which partially inhibits the warming from
   surface of near shore water. Citation: Santos F, Gomez-Gesteira M,

Abstract = {The increase in air temperature produced by urbanization, a phenomenon
   known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect, is often neglected in
   current building energy simulation practices. The UHI effect can have an
   impact on the energy consumption of buildings, especially those with low
   internal heat gains or with an inherent close interaction with the
   outdoor environment (e.g. naturally-ventilated buildings). This paper
   presents an urban weather generator (UWG) to calculate air temperatures
   inside urban canyons from measurements at an operational weather station
   located in an open area outside a city. The model can be used alone or
   integrated into existing programmes in order to account for the UHI
   effect in building energy simulations. The UWG is evaluated against
   field data from Basel (Switzerland) and Toulouse (France). The error of
   UWG predictions stays within the range of air temperature variability
   observed in different locations of the same urban area.},

Volume = {117},

Abstract = {We have presented adsorption assisted cooling and desalination employing
   zeolites and silica gel as adsorbents and water as adsorbate for useful
   cooling effects at the evaporator and the desalination effects at the
   condenser. Since the conventional adsorption cooling system works at low
   evaporator pressure, only a small portion of the adsorption capacity is
   used for water production. To overcome these limitations, we have
   modelled and simulated a cooling cum desalination system, where the
   adsorption cooling system (stage-1) is amalgamated with the adsorption
   desalination system (stage-2). Therefore, the overall performance is
   improved by heat recovery between the condenser and the evaporators of
   both cycles. The simulation results are presented in terms of specific
   cooling power (SCP), specific daily water production (SDWP), coefficient
   of performance (COP), performance ratio (PR) and overall conversion
   ratio (OCR). These results are also compared with experimental data. It
   is found that the adsorption beds of cooling cycle should be housed with
   AQSOA-Z02 zeolites for more cooling capacity, whereas the sorption
   elements of desalination cycle are fabricated with silica gels for more
   SDWP. The proposed system produces 26\% more water and 45\% more cooling
   capacity as compared with conventional equivalent adsorption cooling and
   desalination systems. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Numerical study of a double-slope solar still coupled with capillary
   film condenser in south Algeria},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {245-252},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The effect of joining a condensation cell to a single-basin double slope
   solar still was investigated numerically. Direct solar radiation heated
   the saline water then evaporated. A fraction of the resulting vapor is
   condensed on the inner glass cover plate and the rest on the outer metal
   plate. Solar radiation, ambient temperature and the temperatures at
   different system components were monitored. The performance of the
   system was evaluated and compared to that of a conventional solar still
   under the same meteorological conditions. The proposed prototype
   functioned perfectly and its daily yield reached 7.15 kg m(-2) d(-1).
   Results show that the productivity of the present system was about 60\%
   higher than that of the conventional and capillary film types. The
   contributions of the glass cover, metal plate and condenser plate are
   43\%,18\% and 39\% of the total distillate yield respectively. It was
   noticed that the productivity of the capillary film solar still was
   sensitive to the mass flow of the feeding water. It was also found that
   the absorptivity coefficient and the diffusion gap have significant
   effect on distillate production of the system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION \& DISTRIBUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {14},
Pages = {2791-2804},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {At different times, the load correlation of the integrated energy system
   (IES) is different and its changes over time are regular. However, the
   regularity of such changes is rarely considered in the current IES
   prediction research. In view of the above reasons, an IES short-term
   load forecasting method based on load-correlation peaks and valleys is
   proposed. Inspired by the concept of load peaks and valleys, the concept
   of load-related peaks and valleys is put forward. Furthermore, based on
   the above concept, a method of establishing different prediction models
   within a day based on the correlation threshold is proposed. In order to
   implement the initial correlation threshold reasonably, a marine
   predator algorithm with an integrated gray wolf optimizer (MPAIGWO) is
   proposed. After the initial parameters are selected, use the
   self-learning ideas in situational awareness to change the parameters.
   In the case study, the power, thermal, and cold loads of IES were
   predicted. The comparison results show that the prediction results of
   this method have high accuracy. In addition, this method can also
   overcome the influence of irrelevant input variables on prediction. The
   algorithm comparison proves that the MPAIGWO has the highest
   optimization performance under the same conditions.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {101},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-142},
Abstract = {The influence of atmospheric deposition on the chemical characteristics
   of soil solutions in a small catchment area in NW Spain was studied. The
   soils, developed from slates, were sampled from seven sites supporting
   different forms of vegetation (deciduous and pine forest and heath).
   Soil solutions were extracted, by the column displacement method, from
   soil samples collected monthly from March 1992 until November 1993. The
   solutions were acidic with a low content of basic cations. The most
   common ions in all horizons were Cl- and Na+, due to marine influence.
   In the surface horizons (0-10cm), relatively high concentrations of
   SO42-(150-380 mu mol litre(-1)) and Zn (similar to 2 mu mol litre(-1))
   were obtained, with good correlation between the two ions. These
   results, along with the prevalence of inorganic forms of Al (50-90\% of
   total Al), were related to the effects of acidic deposition in the
   catchment area. The more rapid breakdown of litter in the soils under
   deciduous forest explains the greater ionic concentrations obtained in
   these solutions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The problem of oblique water wave diffraction by two equal thin,
   parallel, fixed vertical barriers with gaps present in uniform
   finite-depth water is investigated here. Three types of barrier
   configurations are considered. A one-term Galerkin approximation is used
   to evaluate upper and lower bounds for reflection and transmission
   coefficients for each configuration. These bounds are seen to be very
   close numerically for all wave numbers and as such their averages
   produce good numerical estimates for these coefficients. Only the bounds
   for the reflection coefficient are numerically computed. These are also
   numerically compared with the results obtained by using multiterm
   Galerkin approximations involving Chebyshev polynomials for a wide range
   of parameters. Numerical results for the reflection coefficients for the
   three barrier configurations are presented graphically. It is seen that
   total reflection occurs only for the surface-piercing barriers while
   total transmission occurs for all the three configurations considered
   here. It is also observed that the introduction of an equal second
   barrier to a submerged barrier increases the reflection coefficient
   considerably in some frequency bands and as such submerged double
   barrier configurations are preferable to a submerged single barrier for
   the purpose of reflecting more wave energy into the open sea.},

Title = {Geothermal Geological Characteristics and Genetic Model of the Shunping
   Area along Eastern Taihang Mountain},
Journal = {MINERALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Knowledge about subsurface geological characteristics and a geothermic
   genetic model plays an essential role in geothermal exploration and
   resource assessment. To solve the problem in the Shunping area along
   eastern Taihang Mountain, geothermal geological conditions were analyzed
   by geophysical, geochemical, and geological methods, such as
   magnetotelluric, gas geochemistry, and structural analysis. The
   geothermic genetic model was developed by analyzing the characteristics
   of the heat source, water source, migration channel, reservoir, and cap
   rock of the geothermal geological conditions. Favorable deep thermal
   conduction conditions and sufficient atmospheric precipitation in the
   study area provide an original heat source and water supply for
   geothermal formation. The faults and unconformities of different scales
   have become effective channels for the migration of underground hot
   water. The thermal reservoir formed by marine carbonate rocks with karst
   fissure development provides suitable space for the storage of
   underground hot water. Although the Cenozoic strata have good thermal
   insulation and water insulation function, the thermal insulation and
   water insulation effect is not ideal because of the shallow coverage in
   the Shunping area and the damage by tectonic action, which affected
   thermal insulation and water insulation to some extent, restricting the
   practical preservation of underground heat energy in the Shunping area.
   The bedrock geothermal resource in the Shunping area is original from
   the combined action of multiple indexes of source, transport, reservoir,
   and cap. The geothermal geologic conditions of source and reservoir in
   the Shunping area are very similar to those in the Xiongan new area, and
   have obvious advantages in hydrodynamic conditions. Although limited by
   the cap's effectiveness, the geothermal resources in the Shunping area
   can provide some clean energy support for local production and life,
   thereby satisfying economic development conditions and encouraging
   further geological exploration.},

Title = {Inverting ice surface elevation and velocity for bed topography and
   slipperiness beneath Thwaites Glacier},
Journal = {CRYOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3867-3887},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {There is significant uncertainty over how ice sheets and glaciers will
   respond to rising global temperatures. Limited knowledge of the
   topography and rheology of the ice-bed interface is a key cause of this
   uncertainty as models show that small changes in the bed can have a
   large influence on predicted rates of ice loss. Most of our detailed
   knowledge of bed topography comes from airborne and ground-penetrating
   radar observations. However, these direct observations are not spaced
   closely enough to meet the requirements of ice-sheet models, so
   interpolation and inversion methods are used to fill in the gaps. Here
   we present the results of a new inversion of surface elevation and
   velocity data over Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, for bed topography
   and slipperiness (i.e. the degree of basal slip for a given level of
   drag). The inversion is based on a steady-state linear perturbation
   analysis of the shallow-ice-stream equations. The method works by
   identifying disturbances to surface flow which are caused by obstacles
   or sticky patches in the bed and can therefore be applied wherever the
   shallow-ice-stream equations hold and where surface data are available,
   even where the ice thickness is not well known. We assess the
   performance of the inversion for topography with the available radar
   data. Although the topographic output from the inversion is less
   successful where the bed slopes steeply, it compares well with radar
   data from the central trunk of the glacier for medium-wavelength
   features (5-50 km). This method could therefore be useful as an
   independent test of other interpolation methods such as mass
   conservation and kriging. We do not have data to allow us to assess the
   success of the slipperiness results from our inversions, but we provide
   maps that may guide future seismic data collection across Thwaites
   Glacier. The methods presented here show significant promise for using
   high-resolution satellite datasets, calibrated by sparser field
   datasets, to generate high-resolution bed topography products across the
   ice sheets and therefore contribute to reduced uncertainty in
   predictions of future sea-level rise.},

Title = {Place as a boundary device for the sustainability sciences: Concepts of
   place, their value in characterising sustainability problems, and their
   role in fostering integrative research and action},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {A, SI},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sustainability science is difficult to conceptualise, plan and conduct,
   given the broad range of epistemological commitments, methodological
   practices, and approaches to problem-framing taken by its constituent
   disciplines. This special issue is based on the idea of place as a
   boundary device for the sustainability sciences, in the belief that it
   can foster integrative work, guide theoretical reflection, encourage
   methodological innovation, and inform empirical research. Here we
   reflect on place concepts, before developing a series of arguments on
   the relationship of place to sustainability science. We first emphasise
   that place is not solely an interpretivist or post-positivist
   perspective on sustainability, as it is also congenial to mechanistic or
   positivist ontologies. Secondly, we argue that place does not entail a
   retreat from theory into particularism or thick description; it is
   coherent with attempts to provide explanations. Thirdly, we claim that
   it does not imply a sedentary, parochial approach to sustainability
   science that neglects interactions across scale or location. Fourthly,
   we caution that public spheres for tackling environmental issues can act
   to close-down deliberation and marginalise informal knowledge, if
   institutions retain norms that emphasise abstract, placeless evidence.
   We highlight how these ideas have been cashed out in the collected
   papers in this special issue, in domains ranging from biofuels
   governance, to estuary management, to marine governance, to ecosystem
   stewardship, to community-led low energy transitions, and to climate
   change more broadly. We end by suggesting that a place-based approach to
   sustainability science entails a relentless focus on context. It takes
   the spatially patterned, heterogeneous, fluid, networked, and
   contextually moderated form of socio-environmental processes as central
   points of investigation, rather than as mere modifiers of more general
   mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A comprehensive assessment of the intertidal biodiversity along the
   Portuguese coast in the early 2000s},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Background The unprecedented rates of current biodiversity loss have
   motivated a renewed interest in environmental and biodiversity
   monitoring. The need for sustained monitoring strategies has prompted
   not only the establisment of new long-term monitoring programmes, but
   also the rescue of data from historical or otherwise archived sources.
   Amongst the most valuable datasets are those containing information on
   intertidal systems, as they are particularly well suited for studying
   the biological effects of climate change. The Portuguese rocky coast is
   quite interesting for studying the effects of climate change on the
   distribution of species due to its geographical orientation, latitudinal
   patterns in temperature, species richness, species' distribution
   patterns and availability of historical information. This work aims at
   providing a comprehensive picture of the distribution and abundance of
   intertidal macro-invertebrates and macro-algae along the Portuguese
   rocky coast in the early 2000s. New information This study provides a
   description of the rocky shore intertidal biodiversity of the mainland
   Portuguese coast in the early 2000s. The spatial distribution and
   semi-quantitative abundance of a total of 238 taxa were assessed at 49
   wave-exposed locations. These data provide a comprehensive baseline
   against which biodiversity changes can be effectively and objectively
   evaluated.},

Title = {Bayesian Inversion of Time-Lapse Seismic AVO Data for Multimodal

Abstract = {We consider time-lapse seismic amplitude versus offset (AVO) inversion
   for the reservoir properties porosity and water saturation, with a focus
   on monitoring the evolution of water saturation in a dynamic setting of
   ongoing production. We operate in a Bayesian framework based on the
   integration of seismic AVO modeling and rock physics relations. One
   major challenge in the inversion of seismic data for reservoir
   properties is the multimodality of these properties. Fluid saturation is
   generally bimodal due to the gravity effect, and often distinctly so,
   with abrupt spatial mode transitions. The novelty of the proposed
   approach is the assumption of a selection Gaussian random field (S-GRF)
   for the prior spatial model of porosity and water saturation, which can
   represent the multimodal characteristics of these reservoir properties.
   The likelihood model is Gauss-linear and based on linearized seismic and
   rock physics models, which entails that the associated posterior model
   is also an S-GRF, with analytically assessable parameters. Hence, the
   posterior model is capable of representing multimodality and abrupt
   spatial mode transitions. Two realistic case studies are considered; the
   production of an oil reservoir in the North Sea, and the injection of
   CO2 into a subsurface potential CO2 storage unit. Focus is on the
   movement of the oil-water-contacts along a vertical profile in the first
   case, and on the expansion of the CO2 region in a cross section in the
   other, both of which can be inferred from the changes in the water
   saturations. The results are considered to be very encouraging and the
   proposed statistical formulation appears to be particularly well suited
   for fluid monitoring problems of the described type.},

Abstract = {Many marine animals have evolved sensory abilities to use electric and
   magnetic cues in essential aspects of life history, such as to detect
   prey, predators and mates as well as to orientate and migrate. Potential
   disruption of vital cues by human activities must be understood in order
   to mitigate potential negative influences. Cable deployments in coastal
   waters are increasing worldwide, in capacity and number, owing to
   growing demands for electrical power and telecommunications.
   Increasingly, the local electromagnetic environment used by electro- and
   magneto-sensitive species will be altered. We quantified biologically
   relevant behavioural responses of the presumed, magneto-receptive
   American lobster and the electro-sensitive Little skate to
   electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions of a subsea high voltage direct
   current (HVDC) transmission cable for domestic electricity supply. We
   demonstrate a striking increase in exploratory/foraging behaviour in
   skates in response to EMF and a more subtle exploratory response in
   lobsters. In addition, by directly measuring both the magnetic and
   electric field components of the EMF emitted by HVDC cables we found
   that there were DC and unexpectedly AC components. Modelling, restricted
   to the DC component, showed good agreement with measured results. Our
   cross-disciplinary study highlights the need to integrate an
   understanding of the natural and anthropogenic EMF environment together
   with the responses of sensitive animals when planning future cable
   deployments and predicting their environmental effects.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses different concepts for efficient supply of power and
   heat to specific offshore installations in the North Sea, with the
   objective of cutting carbon dioxide emissions. The concepts analyzed
   include solutions with on-site power generation, full plant
   electrification, and hybrid solutions where power can be either
   generated locally or taken from the onshore grid. A detailed modeling of
   the power generation system was carried out, enabling design and
   off-design simulations. Plant power and heat demand profiles were used
   to evaluate the various concepts throughout the entire field's life. A
   first analysis of the common on-site power generation systems revealed
   the possibility of cutting carbon dioxide emissions simply by optimizing
   the operating strategy. Overall, the assessment of the different
   concepts showed that full plant electrification and the implementation
   of an offshore combined cycle have the potential to substantially reduce
   cumulative carbon dioxide emissions. A sensitivity analysis of the
   carbon dioxide emission factor, associated with the grid power, stressed
   how this parameter has a strong influence on the analysis outputs and,
   thus, needs to be thoroughly assessed. Similarly, the impact of
   increased plant heat demand was evaluated, showing that advantages
   connected to the plant electrification tend to diminish with the
   increase in heat requirements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Fast wave-by-wave prediction of weakly nonlinear unidirectional wave
   fields},
Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Accurate future prediction of wave fields can be used to optimize the
   performance of wave energy converters as well as various offshore
   operations. A highly efficient model using single, fixed-probe
   measurements for predicting unidirectional wave fields of up to
   second-order nonlinearity has been developed. The fundamental problem
   with the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in forward prediction
   is the inherent assumption of periodicity of the finite-length record
   beyond its ends. The main aim here is to enhance the performance of the
   FFT algorithm during prediction of linear wave fields while retaining
   its computational efficiency. Given a finiteduration wave record up to
   the present time at a location upwave, it is observed that introducing a
   smooth transition of the record down to zero at both ends by adding half
   of a NewWave-type wave group improves the prediction at the point of
   interest dramatically compared to just using the raw record. These
   extensions can in turn serve as predictions for cases requiring future
   knowledge without the use of upwave measurements. These schemes are
   tested on their capability to predict synthetic wave fields at locations
   downwave and into the future. Comparisons are made by computing the
   numerical error within a theoretical predictable zone which is also
   estimated in this work. A second validation is done on weakly nonlinear
   sea states that include both sum and difference bound wave components
   calculated using exact second-order theory. A simulation method that
   initially linearizes the signal, then advances it in both space and
   time, and finally re-inserts estimated boundharmonics based on a
   narrow-banded approximation proves to be very effective, yielding
   substantial improvements compared to assuming the signal is completely
   linear. The narrow-banded linearization/re-insertion is a very fast
   time-domain operation, hence the additional computational cost is very
   little. The nonlinear model is validated using synthetic wave records
   for waves in intermediate-depth water.},

Title = {Sulfur diagenesis under rapid accumulation of organic-rich sediments in
   a marine mangrove from Guadeloupe (French West Indies)},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {454},

Abstract = {The biogeochemistry of sulfur and carbon during early-diagenetic
   processes within organic-rich marine mangrove sediments was studied in
   the ``Manche a Eau{''} lagoon, Guadeloupe, West Indies. These sediments
   are characterized by a total organic carbon content (TOC) mostly above
   11wt\%, delta C-13(TOC) below-25 parts per thousand VPDB and C/N-molar
   ratios exceeding 15. Rates of mangrove-derived organic carbon
   accumulation vary between similar to 200 and 400 gOC.m(-2).yr(-1), with
   highest rates at the shore of the lagoon. On the lagoon border, where
   colorless filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria colonize the sediments,
   active sulfate reductionwithin the upper 20 cm, with a net removal rate
   of similar to 0.5 mu mol.cm(-3).d(-1), is assumed to be essentially
   driven by organic carbon oxidation. This is expressed by relatively low
   apparent sulfur isotope fractionation (34enet = -33\%) and a gentle
   delta O-18/delta(34)Ssulfate apparent slope of 0.36 +/- 0.03 (2s).
   Further inside the lagoon, in the absence of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria,
   higher apparent sulfur isotope fractionation and a steeper delta
   O-18/delta(34)Ssulfate slope (0.67 +/- 0.20) suggest an overall lower
   sulfate removal rate that may be coupled to minor sulfur
   disproportionation. Spatial and vertical variation in sulfur cycling,
   reflected by oxygen and sulfur isotopic characteristics, seem to be
   mainly controlled by unsteady to relatively steady organicmatter
   deposition and its reactivity. In all sediments, delta S-34 values of
   pyrite are positively correlated with the TOC/TS ratio and negatively
   correlated with delta(CTOC)-C-13; suggesting a primary control of the
   quantity and quality of organic matter on the pyrite isotope records,
   despite potential iron-limiting conditions for the most active sites.
   Our results provide insights into the role of organic carbon input on
   sulfur cycling; stimulating sulfate reduction and in turn the presence
   of sulfur-oxidizing microbial mats, resulting in an intense cycling of
   both carbon and sulfur in these marine mangrove sediments. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Effect of Langmuir circulation (LC) on upper ocean mixing is
   investigated by a two-way wave-current coupled model. The model is
   coupled of the ocean circulation model ROMS (regional ocean modeling
   system) to the surface wave model SWAN (simulating waves nearshore) via
   the model-coupling toolkit. The LC already certified its importance by
   many one-dimensional (1D) research and mechanism analysis work. This
   work focuses on inducing LC's effect in a three-dimensional (3-D) model
   and applying it to real field modeling. In ROMS, the Mellor-Yamada
   turbulence closure mixing scheme is modified by including LC's effect.
   The SWAN imports bathymetry, free surface and current information from
   the ROMS while exports significant wave parameters to the ROMS for
   Stokes wave computing every 6s. This coupled model is applied to the
   South China Sea (SCS) during September 2008 cruise. The results show
   that LC increasing turbulence and deepening mixed layer depth (MLD) at
   order of 0 (10 m) in most of the areas, especially in the north part of
   SCS where most of our measurements operated. The coupled model further
   includes wave breaking which will brings more energy into water. When LC
   works together with wave breaking, more energy is transferred into deep
   layer and accelerates the MLD deepening. In the north part of the SCS,
   their effects are more obvious. This is consistent with big wind event
   in the area of the Zhujiang River Delta. The shallow water depth as
   another reason makes them easy to influence the ocean mixing as well.},

Title = {GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND CHARGE HISTORY OF OIL IN THE UPPER
   CRETACEOUS M1 SANDSTONES (NAPO FORMATION) IN BLOCK T, ORIENTE BASIN,
   ECUADOR},

Abstract = {Major oil discoveries have recently been made in Block T in the north of
   the Oriente Basin, Ecuador. The oil is reservoired in the M1 Sandstones
   of the Upper Cretaceous Napo Formation. To investigate the origin and
   charge history of the petroleum, a detailed geochemical study was
   carried out on 43 crude oil samples from 42 producing wells in Block T
   together with fluid inclusion analyses of three core samples from two
   wells.
   According to the results of GC/GC-MS analyses of the oil samples, the
   oils contain n-alkanes with a peak carbon number at C-15-C-17 and a
   subordinate peak at C-25-C-30. The nC(21-)/nC(22+) ratio ranges from
   0.64 to 1.69, and the Carbon Preference Index from 0.95 to 1.23. The
   odd-over-even predominance is 1.02-1.27. A cross-plot of C-22/C-21
   versus C-24/C-23 tricyclic terpanes indicates that the source rock is a
   marine marl mixed with a small amount of terrigenous material. C-27
   regular steranes are more dominant than C-28 approximate to C-29 and the
   C-29/C-27 ratio ranges from 0.67 to 0.94 indicating a source rock
   dominated by marine algal material with minor terrigenous input. R-c
   calculated using the MPI index was 0.83\% to 1.11\%, indicating that the
   oils were generated during the early to peak oil generation stage. A
   cross-plot of C-29 alpha alpha alpha 20S/(20S+20R) versus C-29 alpha
   beta beta/(beta beta+alpha alpha), and ratios of C31L-hopane 22S/(22S +
   22R) and C32L-hopane 22S/(22S + 22R), gave similar maturity results.
   The presence in the same oil samples of a complete n-alkane series
   together with an unresolved UCM hump and 25-norhopanes indicates at
   least two stages of oil charging, with severe biodegradation of the
   early-stage oil and a later charge of fresh, unaltered oil.
   The homogenization temperatures of 36 fluid inclusions in samples from
   Block T wells F20 and F67 range from 81 to 95 degrees C. A reconstructed
   burial and geothermal history of well F20 indicates that the M1
   Sandstones in this area reached a temperature of 81 degrees C at 19-16
   Ma, after which temperatures increased continuously to 95-100 degrees C
   at the present day. The homogenization temperatures of the analysed
   fluid inclusions combined with the geothermal history indicate that oil
   charging into the M1Sandstones began in the early Miocene and continues
   at the present day.},

Title = {Observation and prediction of three-dimensional morphology at a
   high-energy macrotidal beach},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {243},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Three-dimensional beach features such as crescentic sandbars and rip
   channels influence beach response to, and recovery from, storm waves, as
   well as significantly affecting the safety and amenity provided by the
   surf-zone for beach water-users. In this contribution temporal
   variations in subtidal and intertidal beach three-dimensionality are
   observed at a high-energy macrotidal beach, and a simple equilibrium
   model is developed to predict the changes over multi-year timescales. A
   dataset of 5.5 years of quasi-weekly bar measurements, and quasi-monthly
   intertidal surveys from Perranporth beach (Cornwall, UK) were used to
   quantify seasonal to inter-annual changes in three-dimensionality. The
   three-dimensionality of the outer bar displayed significant annual
   periodicity, with annual minima and maxima occurring in winter and
   spring, respectively. The lower intertidal beach displayed a similar
   periodicity, but developed three-dimensionality 1-4 months before the
   outer bar. The model predicts increases or decreases in the scale of
   three-dimensional features by examining the disparity between
   instantaneous wave conditions and a temporally varying equilibrium wave
   condition. A tidally-modulated wave power term determines the rate of
   morphological change. Negative feedback was found to be an important
   process governing the changes in three-dimensionality; while free
   morphological behaviour may drive three-dimensional growth, negative
   feedback exerts stability in the system, making it inherently
   predictable using a temporally varying equilibrium value. The model
   explained 42\% and 61\% of the overall variability in outer bar and
   lower beach three-dimensionality, respectively. It skilfully predicted
   changes outside the training data range, during the most energetic
   8-week period of waves measured in the last 65 years off SW England, in
   winter 2013/14. The model outperformed a simple baseline model (a linear
   fit), as well as a comparable linearized feedback model from the
   literature, providing the first long-term (multi-year) predictions of
   seasonal to inter-annual beach three-dimensionality for a macrotidal
   beach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Energy budgets of Atlantic hurricanes and changes from 1970},
Journal = {GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {On the basis of the current observational record of tropical cyclones
   and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Atlantic, estimates are made
   of changes in surface sensible and latent heat fluxes and hurricane
   precipitation from 1970 to 2006. The best track data set of observed
   tropical cyclones is used to estimate the frequency that storms of a
   given strength occur after 1970. Empirical expressions for the surface
   fluxes and precipitation are based on simulations of hurricane Katrina
   in August 2005 with the advanced Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF)
   model at 4 km resolution without parameterized convection. The empirical
   relationships are computed for the surface fluxes and precipitation
   within 400 km of the eye of the storm for all categories of hurricanes
   based upon the maximum simulated wind and the observed sea surface
   temperature and saturation specific humidity. Strong trends are not
   linear but are better depicted as a step function increase from 1994 to
   1995, and large variability reflects changes in SSTs and precipitable
   water, modulated by El Nino events. The environmental variables of SST
   and water vapor are nonetheless accompanied by clear changes in tropical
   cyclone activity using several metrics.},

   Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.
   Tidal variations in dissolved nutrients and particulate matter at the
   mouth of semiclosed Keunso Bay were investigated over four seasons. The
   role of the bay, whether it acted as a sink or a source, was
   element-specific and seasonally dependent. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   was imported in spring, summer, and winter due to active denitrification
   throughout the year and was exported offshore in autumn. For dissolved
   inorganic phosphorus, the bay served as a sink in spring and winter and
   as a source in summer and autumn, possibly in association with the redox
   potential of surface sediments. Similarly, dissolved silicate was
   imported in spring when a spring bloom occurred, but the bay was a
   silicate source in summer and autumn. Suspended particulate matter flux
   also varied seasonally, with tendencies of summer export and winter
   import, possibly controlled by meteorological conditions and tidal
   cycle. Particulate organic carbon was exported offshore in summer but
   imported in winter.},

Abstract = {Two high-frequency acoustic seafloor classification systems (12- and
   15-kHz) were used in conjunction with sediment core analysis to
   characterize sediment facies at a study site near Garden Key in Dry
   Tortugas, Florida. The acoustic system uses echo return amplitude to
   compute acoustic impedance that is then correlated with sampled sediment
   impedance values calculated from wet bulk density and compressional wave
   velocity. Several bottom provinces were identified using the 15-kHz data
   to construct a real-time map of ship tracks in colors that represent the
   surficial sediment facies type. Sediment facies over the entire study
   site (36 km 2) range from sandy silts to exposed limestone rock and
   coral reef structures. Color contour maps using the 12-kHz data, created
   after correlating acoustic impedance predictions with core measured
   sediment properties, validates the initial facies pattern predictions
   made in real-time. The sediment facies patterns indicate a long-term
   pattern of deposition of fine-grained, silt-sized, surficial sediments
   in an area adjacent to the emergent carbonate embankment.
   Two-dimensional acoustic profiles along survey tracklines also provide
   cross-sectional views of seafloor and subbottom stratigraphy that
   confirm the buildup of these fine sediments in the northwest corner of
   the study site. A generous supply of sediment resulting from an
   abundance of benthic green algae (Halimeda sp.) on adjacent shallow
   platforms form a thick sequence of fine sandy silt at the base of the
   southeastern edge of the embankment and fringing reef. Sediment cover
   over the limestone bedrock thins and becomes coarse southeast of Garden
   and Bush Keys, suggesting the likely existence of a dominant flow around
   the shallow carbonate embankment that restricts export of fine sediments
   out of the area. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {The ability of flying continuously over prolonged periods of time has
   become target of numerous research studies performed in recent years in
   both the fields of civil aviation and unmanned drones. High altitude
   platform stations are aircrafts that can operate for an extended period
   of time at altitudes 17 km above sea level and higher. The aim of this
   paper is to design and optimize a wing for such platforms and
   computationally investigate its aerodynamic performance. For that
   purpose, two-objective genetic algorithm, class shape transformation and
   panel method were combined and used to define different airfoils with
   the highest lift-to-drag ratio and maximal lift coefficient. Once the
   most suitable airfoil was chosen, polyhedral half wing was modeled and
   its aerodynamic performances were estimated using the CFD approach. Flow
   simulations of transitional flow at various angles-of-attack were
   realized in ANSYS FLUENT and various quantitative and qualitative
   results are presented, such as aerodynamic coefficient curves and flow
   visualizations. In the end, daily mission of the aircraft is simulated
   and its energy requirement is estimated. In order to be able to cruise
   above Serbia in July, an aircraft weighing 150 kg must accumulate 17 kWh
   of solar energy per day.},

Abstract = {This work investigates solar events occurred in September 2017
   characterized by a series of Forbush decreases and a ground level
   enhancement (GLE). Forbush decreases is a rapid decrease in the observed
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic\_cosmic\_ray intensity following
   a coronal mass ejection while GLE is induced by a strong solar event for
   which the flux of high-energy solar particles is sufficient to enhance
   the radiation level on the ground. These investigations were performed
   using data recorded by a neutron spectrometer network composed of a
   Bonner sphere system. Two instruments located at Pic-du-Midi Observatory
   (+2,885 m above sea level) and at Concordia station (Antarctica, +3,233
   m) record simultaneously and continuously the neutron spectra, allowing
   to consider short-term variations during solar events. The main
   objective is to analyze neutron spectral properties including their
   energy distributions and dynamics. This paper presents cosmic
   ray-induced neutron spectra during active solar event leading to changes
   in the local cosmic ray spectrum (Forbush decreases and a GLE).
   Concerning the GLE, analyses show that neutrons in the evaporation
   domain are particularly amplified during the GLE, while other energetic
   domains increase uniformly.},

Title = {Relating exercise-induced desaturation and gas-exchange in pulmonary

Journal = {RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY \& NEUROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {259},
Pages = {58-62},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We measured pulmonary gas exchange during six minute walk test (6MWT) in
   patients with idiopathic (IPAH) and congenital heart disease-related
   pulmonary hypertension (CHDPH), and determined the relationship between
   the degree of desaturation and changes in minute ventilation to carbon
   dioxide production (V-E)VCO2 and end-tidal partial pressure for carbon
   dioxide (PetCO2) in both groups. Fifty-two patients (IPAH, n = 28;
   CHDPH, n = 24) completed 6MWT with simultaneous pulmonary gas exchange.
   Whilst no significant difference in six minute walk distance was
   observed between groups (IPAH: 529 +/- 89; CHDPH: 476 +/- 119 m, p =
   0.10), oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, and minute ventilation
   were higher in IPAH than CHDPH (p < 0.01). In addition, CHDPH
   desaturated to a greater extent than IPAH with a lower post-6MWT SpO2
   (IPAH: 92.3 +/- 7.9; CHDPH: 73.3 +/- 14.9\%, p < 0.01). The change in
   SpO(2) correlated to the change in V-E/VCO2 (r= 0.44, p = 0.02) and
   PerCO(2) (r = 0.49, p < 0.01) for CHDPH, but not IPAH. The
   exercise-induced hypoxic stimulus during 6MWT in CHDPH may be associated
   with an enhanced ventilatory response.},

Title = {Assessing the conservation risk of Sphaerodactylus notatus, the US
   herpetofaunal species most vulnerable to sea level rise},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {While climate change and sea level rise threaten species across the
   globe, species in low-lying coastal regions, such as South Florida, are
   projected to face particularly severe threats. One such species is the
   Florida reef gecko (Sphaerodactylus notatus), the only gecko native to
   the eastern U.S., and a highly understudied species that persists in
   heavily fragmented habitats of only three coastal Florida counties. To
   assess the conservation status of this species, we conducted surveys
   throughout South Florida to determine potential extirpations from
   historic localities and to delimit S. notatus' current distribution. We
   also estimated the level of threat S. notatus faces from sea level rise
   relative to other species by analyzing sea level risk of all
   herpetofauna in the U.S. We detected geckos in only 41\% of sites with
   appropriate habitat, and in only 65\% of historic localities. Geckos
   were only present within 1.2 km from the coast, and the minimum 2.2 m of
   sea level rise already expected based on current carbon emissions will
   place 85\% of suitable S. notatus habitat under water. Our findings were
   used to update the conservation risk of S. notatus according to IUCN and
   Florida guidelines for listing threatened and endangered species, and
   suggest this species now fits the criteria to warrant listing. In
   comparison to all other U.S. herpetofaunal species, we found that S.
   notatus is the most at risk from sea level rise due its fidelity to
   low-lying coastal habitats.},

Abstract = {Theory and simulations have shown that the maximum crest height in an
   area can be substantially greater than the single point maximum.
   Theoretical results have been tested and confirmed using data from a 10
   by 10 array of wave probes in the Mann Offshore Basin. Estimation of the
   maximum crest height under a TLP's deck is more complicated than it is
   in unobstructed waters. A TLP's large columns diffract and radiate
   incident waves. Fortunately, the short term statistics of the diffracted
   waves have the same form as the short term statistics of the incident
   waves. The maximum crests under the TLP are estimated by using
   diffraction theory to find the wave spectra at each point. Then, linear
   simulations are used to find time series at each point. Finally, the
   linear maxima are multiplied by the ratio between the theoretical linear
   and second order crest heights. Comparisons with measurements from wave
   probes placed under a TLP model in the Mann Offshore Basin support the
   accuracy of this process. These results mean that the maximum crest
   heights in the area under a deck must be considered in air gap
   calculations.},

Title = {Molecular Basis for Substrate Recognition and Catalysis by a Marine
   Bacterial Laminarinase},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Laminarin is an abundant algal polysaccharide that serves as carbon
   storage and fuel to meet the nutrition demands of heterotrophic
   microbes. Laminarin depolymerization catalyzed by microbial
   extracellular enzymes initiates remineralization, a key process in ocean
   biogeochemical cycles. Here, we described a glycoside hydrolase 16
   (GH16) family laminarinase from a marine alga-associated Flavobacterium
   at the biochemical and structural levels. We found that the endolytic
   enzyme cleaved laminarin with a preference for beta-1,3-glycoside
   linkages and showed transglycosylation activity across a broad range of
   acceptors. We also solved and compared high-resolution crystal
   structures of laminarinase in the apo form and in complex with
   beta-1,3-tetrasaccharides, revealing an expanded catalytic cleft formed
   following substrate binding. Moreover, structure and mutagenesis studies
   identified multiple specific contacts between the enzyme and glucosyl
   residues essential for the substrate specificity for beta-1,3-glucan.
   These results provide novel insights into the structural requirements
   for substrate binding and catalysis of GH16 family laminarinase,
   enriching our understanding of bacterial utilization of algal laminarin.
   IMPORTANCE Heterotrophic bacterial communities are key players in marine
   biogeochemical cycling due to their ability to remineralize organic
   carbon. Processing of complex organic matter requires heterotrophic
   bacteria to produce extracellular enzymes with precise specificity to
   depolymerize substrates to sizes sufficiently small for uptake. Thus,
   extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis initiates microbe-driven
   heterotrophic carbon cycling. In this study, based on biochemical and
   structural analyses, we revealed the depolymerization mechanism of
   beta-1,3-glucan, a carbon reserve in algae, by laminarinase from an
   alga-associated marine Flavobacterium. The findings provide new insights
   into the substrate recognition and catalysis of bacterial laminarinase
   and promote a better understanding of how extracellular enzymes are
   involved in organic matter cycling.},

Abstract = {Wind and solar power generation have nearly become synonymous with green
   energy in recent years. Vibration analysis is crucial to the structural
   integrity of wind turbines, especially for those exposed to tropical
   storms and salt corrosion in the coastal environment. In this study, a
   one-dimensional linear continuous model is applied to analyze the
   spectral characteristics of the supporting tower of wind turbines.
   Simulated frequency-domain displacements were obtained for the vibration
   of the supporting tower subjected to the reduction in local stiffness,
   representing various cases of tower defects. To identify the defected
   section of the supporting tower, the unit angle of each section is used
   as the indicator of the defect that can be obtained using a signal
   processing technique developed in this study. The results of the
   numerical analysis show that the method can effectively expose the
   defect location Furthermore, the progression of the existing defect and
   the difference between the existing defect and the new one can also be
   observed. The results of this study demonstrate a great potential for
   future applications. In practice, the possible variation of the tower
   structure can be obtained by comparing the measured signal results at
   different periods. This would allow for maintenance to target precisely
   at the defected areas so as to achieve efficient allocation of
   maintenance funds.},

Abstract = {An approach to heating and cooling system optimization is presented by
   an example project of an air-conditioning system for a residence
   situated in a coastal region of north Adriatic. An existing house was
   renewed and provided with additional thermal insulation at outside
   surfaces. Thickness of the insulation layer was determined on a basis of
   minimal total heating cost during the considered time of 50 years,
   considering oil fuelled boiler and a heat pump as alternative heating
   systems. Windows with increased air-tightness, including glass with low
   heat transfer coefficient and low thermal radiation transmission
   coefficient were used. Heating and cooling load were thus decreased
   significantly. The air-conditioning system was designed using air-to air
   heat Pump for heating and cooling. The possibility for system expansion
   for solar energy utilization is provided as well. Air distribution was
   provided through air-ducts which were incorporated into a new insulation
   layer of an example house. Energy consumption has been measured during
   several years' operation of a system, and measurements' results confirm
   estimated consumption. Further simulations have been performed in order
   to investigate the feasibility of solar collector's application. Results
   of simulations encourage the design and the construction of air solar
   collector field which will be incorporated into a roof and connected
   with an air-conditioning system.},

Abstract = {Water uptake by plants and evaporation from the soil surface usually
   govern the salts dynamics in the soil and is highly related to the
   climatic conditions. Poor management of saline water may increase the
   soil salinity to a level higher than crop tolerance. The comparative
   investigations of saline water effects on soil and crops under various
   environments are lacking. Therefore pot experiments were carried out to
   evaluate the effects of saline irrigations on barley and accumulation of
   salts in sand dune soil under three conditions - glasshouse, growth
   chamber and greenhouse. Plants were irrigated with diluted seawater
   adjusted to three levels of electrical conductivity: 3, 8 and 13 dS
   m(-1). The results of the experiments showed that saline waters and
   experimental conditions remarkably affected the evapotranspiration rate,
   soil moisture, salt accumulation and plant biomass production. Low
   temperature conditions exhibited highest plant growth and soil moisture
   and lowest salt deposition. Plants showed no symptoms of salt stress in
   the glasshouse. Growth chamber and greenhouse profoundly reduced plant
   biomass and higher salt accumulation in the soil. Higher stress of
   salinity was noticed in plants irrigated with high saline water. Higher
   amount of salts in the water impaired dry shoot yield by an average of
   60\%. The temperature conditions of greenhouse and growth chamber caused
   substantial water loss and induced water deficit situation in plants. A
   good management of saline water is a necessary option for a sustainable
   agriculture in salt affected soils. The use of high saline water for
   crops may carefully be rationalized in the warm climate.},

   overestimates measured free aqueous concentrations and biolipid

   relationships based on measured free aqueous phase concentrations or the

   of biolipid concentrations. Solid-phase concentration-based predictions
   perform better when sorption to amorphous organic matter and black

Title = {Concentration and Temperature Effects on Water and Salt Permeabilities
   in Osmosis and Implications in Pressure-Retarded Osmosis},
Journal = {MEMBRANES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Osmotic power extracted from the mixing of freshwater with seawater is a
   renewable energy resource that has gained increasing attention during
   recent years. The estimated energy can significantly contribute to the
   production of power worldwide. However, this power production will be
   subject to variation due to both local conditions and seasonal
   variation. The present paper explores the effect of concentration and
   temperature on water and salt fluxes in osmosis at zero transmembrane
   pressure for five different membranes. Further, the measured fluxes have
   been utilized to model water and salt permeabilities (A and B), and the
   structure parameter (S). The observed flux variations at different
   combinations of concentration and temperature have been ascribed to skin
   properties, i.e., changes in A and B of each membrane, whereas S was
   assumed constant within the range of concentrations and temperatures
   that were tested. Simplified equations for the variation in A and B with
   temperature and concentration have been developed, which enable A and B
   to be calculated at any concentration and temperature based on
   permeabilities determined from osmotic experiments at standard test
   conditions. The equations can be used to predict fluxes and specific
   power production with respect to geographical and seasonal variations in
   concentration and temperature for river water/seawater pressure-retarded
   osmosis. The obtained results are also useful for forward osmosis
   processes using seawater as draw solution.},

Abstract = {P>Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bacterial energy and carbon
   storage compound which exhibits a controlling effect on the
   gastrointestinal microbiota. Its beneficial activities for aquaculture
   have already been shown in terms of increased disease resistance and
   growth performance in a number of studies. However, the action of PHB on
   the intestinal microbial community in the treated animals has not yet
   been studied in depth. In this research, the effects of PHB on the
   microbiota composition in the intestinal tract of juvenile sea bass were
   examined. It was found that fish cohabiting in the same tank were on
   average 87\% similar regarding the intestinal microbiota. When subjected
   to the same treatment and environmental conditions but reared in
   different tanks, the compositions of the enteric communities diverged.
   The provision of PHB overruled this tank effect by sustaining a
   microbial core community in the gut that represented 60\% of the total
   bacterial diversity at the highest PHB level of 10\%. The microbial
   community compositions converged between replicate tanks upon
   supplementation of PHB and were characterized by high dynamics and
   increased evenness. The results are discussed in the framework of
   hypotheses that try to relate the intestinal microbial community
   composition to the health status of the host organisms.},

Abstract = {The present research was undertaken in order to examine the feasibility
   of a novel biosorbent Gracilaria corticata (red seaweed) for the removal
   of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. Biosorption studies were
   conducted as a function of equilibrium pH, initial dye concentration,
   and biosorbent dosage. It was identified that the biosorption capacity
   of G. corticata strongly depends on solution equilibrium pH and highest
   biosorption capacity of 28.9mg/g was observed at pH 8. The Fourier
   transform infrared analysis confirmed interaction of dye molecules with
   binding sites on the surface of G. corticata. Also, the scanning
   electron microscopy images revealed morphological cell surface changes
   after biosorption of MB onto G. corticata. The removal efficiency of MB
   from solution with an initial concentration of 150mg/L varied from 50.8
   to 94.9\% for an increase of the seaweed dose from 2 to 5g/L. Kinetic
   study was performed using pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models,
   but higher degree of correlation coefficient and low \% error values
   were obtained for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Experimental
   isotherms were favorable and the data were analyzed using the Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, and Toth models, with the latter
   successfully described MB isotherm with high correlation coefficient and
   low \% error values. The biosorption capacity of G. corticata toward MB
   was determined as 95.41mg/g, according to the Langmuir model.},

Abstract = {It is important for liner shipping companies to maintain cost efficient
   and robust liner shipping networks. Regularly, they set up pro-forma
   schedules, yet it is difficult to stay on time. We consider the problem
   of managing the delays. Therefore, we need to determine an optimal
   recovery policy and buffer time allocation to the ship route in order to
   minimize the total costs associated with delays and recovery actions,
   such as increasing sailing speed. We introduce a general framework
   consisting of a mixed integer programming formulation to solve discrete

   apply this framework to the above described problem. Furthermore, we

Abstract = {A cycle of fluctuation in the Far Eastern sardine, Sardinops sagax,
   population is accompanied by an abrupt drop and recovery of fish size
   and lipid content of parent fish, which may reflect a phase variation
   from coastal to oceanic and its reverse. The cycle begins with die
   survival success of a smaller number of eggs produced by high-quality
   parents, which is triggered by a global climate change (density
   independent process), and finally ends in the survival failure resulting
   from an overexpansion of an enormous number of fish produced by
   low-quality parents (density-dependent process).},

Abstract = {Nowadays, desalination plants are considered as tools to utilize water
   from different natural resources such as seawater and brackish water.
   Globally, the number of desalination plants are increasing to achieve
   the high demand for fresh water to be used for human consumption,
   industrial activities, and public services. However, the brine
   discharged will have detrimental effect on the marine environment, and
   thus the brine should be reused, treated, or discharged properly. The
   present study aims to give a comprehensive insight into the current
   development of the desalination process through examining the different
   technologies available, energy consumption, water production costs of
   these technologies and the brine water characteristics. Several brine
   disposal strategies are analysed here and compared to evaluate their
   effectiveness and drawbacks. The potential usages of brine are also
   carefully examined. Also, we discuss the zero-liquid discharge (ZLD)
   method, its benefits, challenges, environmental and operating
   characteristics, and the current progress of research in this field.
   Ultimately, the future research and development strategies for the
   concentrate management are briefly analysed. It was noted that the ZLD
   process is very significant to the environment in terms of reducing the
   pollution caused by discharged brine and achieving sustainability. (C)

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {147-161},
Abstract = {As part of the Keweenaw Interdisciplinary Transport Experiment in Lake
   Superior (KITES) project, sediment traps were deployed at multiple
   locations along the northern coast of the Keweenaw Peninsula in Lake
   Superior. Traps were deployed at multiple depths (25 m below water
   surface to 5 m above sediments) at varying distances from shore (0.5-21
   km) during the months May-October over a 3-year period. Material
   captured in the sediment traps was analyzed for total carbon (C), total
   nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), total copper (Cu), (210)Pb, and
   stable isotope ratios of C and N. Copper in sediment trap material, a
   tracer for mine residues, indicated transport of material in both
   directions along the peninsula. Cross-margin transport of material
   occurred at all trap locations along the coast and in all seasons. The
   most significant finding was that sediment traps suspended just below
   the thermocline collected large amounts of resuspended sediments even
   when the trap was moored in 120-220 m of water (9-21 km from shore).
   Estimates of the contribution to settling fluxes of organic carbon from
   resuspended sediments ranged from 10-30\% in offshore traps; estimates
   based on (210)Pb agreed well with estimates based on a carbon mixing
   model. Element ratios suggest that resuspended material in offshore
   traps originated in near-shore regions. Despite the strong influence of
   resuspension on the composition of sedimenting material, stable isotope
   ratios were controlled by processes occurring in the water column.
   Seasonal variations in isotope ratios may reflect seasonal shifts
   between predominance by autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in the
   water column.},

Title = {Fully nonlinear investigations on performance of an OWSC (oscillating
   wave surge converter) in 3D (three-dimensional) open water},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {210},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The hydrodynamic behavior of a hinged Oscillating Wave Surge Converter
   (OWSC) device in open water, including motion response, extracted power
   and capture efficiency, is numerically investigated through a developed
   three-dimensional (3D) fully nonlinear higher-order boundary element
   method (HOBEM) model. In this time-domain mode, an image Green function
   is adopted in the whole circular domain with radiation condition at far
   field to avoid re-reflection from the lateral walls and resonance of the
   transverse standing waves which both occur in 3D numerical wave tank.
   The calculated surface elevation and the structural response are
   compared well with the existing measured and numerical results. It can
   be proved from present results that wave nonlinearity would change the
   flap's natural frequency and break the limit of highest possible
   efficiency 50\%. An OWSC with thinner thickness and wider width becomes
   more efficient for extending the applicable extent of wave frequency for
   performance improvement. In addition, when the OWSC device is installed
   at the shallow water depth, the energy extraction can be magnified due
   to shoaling effect. The time series further reveal that the larger wave
   amplitude leads to the motion response dominated simultaneously by
   difference frequency, fundamental frequency and higher-order
   frequencies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},

Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Several investigations of the physical properties of wave-structure
   interactions and absorption of structures in coastal areas discussed the
   development of several permeable and porous breakwaters. This article
   addresses highly-pervious dense pipe with small apertures, which can be
   beneficial for convection and interchange of sea water within the harbor
   district, and furthermore, perform effectively in wave absorption. This
   study investigates the dissipation of porous perpendicular pipe
   breakwaters, and presents laboratory investigations of wave transmission
   from permeable pipe breakwaters with different wave conditions and
   various combinations of diameter and tube length. Since wave energy is
   mainly dissipated due to drag and interception of the resultant motion
   by the pipe breakwaters, the reflectivity of such effects is discussed
   by the evaluation of partly reflected and transmitted ratio.
   Consequently, the performance of the pipe breakwater for predicting the
   wave transmission coefficient is investigated. Experimental results
   reveal that dissipation and/or reflection is more effective when
   decreasing pipe diameter than increasing pipe length, specifically when
   dimensionless frequency sigma(2)h/g > 1.5. Nevertheless, the effect is
   relatively inconspicuous when sigma(2)h/ g < 0.75. A partial outcome
   demonstrates the influence of pipe diameter and variations of reflection
   coefficients corresponding with dimensionless frequencies for incident
   waves with various wave heights. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The present study assesses the effects of starvation and refeeding on
   1-{[}C-14]-methyl aminoisobutyric acid (C-14-MeAIB) uptake, C-14-total
   lipids, (CO2)-C-14 production from C-14-glycine, C-14-protein synthesis
   from C-14-leucine and Na+-K+-ATPase activity in jaw muscle of Neohelice
   granulata previously maintained on a carbohydrate-rich (HC) or
   high-protein (HP) diet. In N. granulata the metabolic adjustments during
   starvation and refeeding use different pathways according to the
   composition of the diet previously offered to the crabs. During
   starvation, (CO2)-C-14 production from C-14-glycine, and C-14-protein
   synthesis from C-14-leucine were reduced in HC-fed crabs. In crabs
   maintained on the HP or HC diet, C-14-total lipid synthesis increased
   after 15 days of starvation. In crabs fed HP diet, C-14-MeAIB uptake and
   Na+-K+-ATPase activity decreased in refeeding state. In crabs refeeding
   HC diet, C-14-MeAIB uptake and (CO2)-C-14 production decreased during
   the refeeding. In contrast, the C-14-protein synthesis increased after
   120 h of refeeding. In both dietary groups, C-14-total lipid synthesis
   increased during refeeding. Changes in the carbon amino acid flux
   between different metabolic pathways in muscle are among the strategies
   used by this crab to face starvation and refeeding. Protein or
   carbohydrate levels in the diet administered to this crab modulate the
   carbon flux between the different metabolic pathways. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {The formation of a Nd-Ca carbonate solid solution was studied by
   monitoring the reactions of calcite with aqueous Nd, orthorhombic
   NdOHCO3(s) with aqueous Ca, and calcite with hexagonal Nd-carbonate
   solid phase as a function of time at 25-degrees-C and controlled pCO2
   (g). All experiments reached steady state after 200 h of reaction. The
   dominant mechanism controlling the formation of the solid solution was
   precipitation of a Nd-Ca carbonate phase from the bulk solution as
   individual crystals or at the orthorhombic NdOHCO3(s)-solution
   interface. The lack of Nd adsorption or solid solution at the
   calcite-solution interface suggests that the solid solution was
   orthorhombic and may be modeled as a mixture of orthorhombic NdOHCO3(s)
   and aragonite.
   Orthorhombic NdOHCO3(s) was determined to be the stable Nd-carbonate
   phase in the Nd-CO2-H2O system at PCO2(g) 0.1 and 1.0 atmospheres at
   25-degrees-C. The equilibrium constant corrected to zero ionic strength
   for orthorhombic NdOHCO3(s) solubility is 10(10.41(+/-0.29)) for the
   following: NdOHCO3(s) + 3H+ = Nd3+ + CO2(g) + H2O.},

   Microgrids},

Abstract = {Direct current (DC) microgrids (MG) constitute a research field that has
   gained great attention over the past few years, challenging the
   well-established dominance of their alternating current (AC)
   counterparts in Low Voltage (LV) (up to 1.5 kV) as well as Medium
   Voltage (MV) applications (up to 50 kV). The main reasons behind this
   change are: (i) the ascending amalgamation of Renewable Energy Sources
   (RES) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which predominantly
   supply DC power to the energy mix that meets electrical power demand and
   (ii) the ascending use of electronic loads and other DC-powered devices
   by the end-users. In this sense, DC distribution provides a more
   efficient interface between the majority of Distributed Energy Resources
   (DER) and part of the total load of a MG. The early adopters of DC MGs
   include mostly buildings with high RES production, ships, data centers,
   electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and traction systems. However,
   the lack of expertise and the insufficient standards' framework inhibit
   their wider spread. This review paper presents the state of the art of
   LV and MV DC MGs in terms of advantages/disadvantages over their AC
   counterparts, their interface with the AC main grid, topologies,
   control, applications, ancillary services and standardization issues.
   Overall, the aim of this review is to highlight the possibilities
   provided by DC MG architectures as well as the necessity for a
   solid/inclusive regulatory framework, which is their main weakness.},

Title = {Re-evaluation and optimisation of dissolution methods for strontium
   isotope stratigraphy based on chemical leaching of carbonate
   certificated reference materials},
Journal = {MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {154},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Strontium isotope stratigraphy (SIS) is widely used in geoscience as a
   chemo-stratigraphic tracer. In past SIS research, diverse sample
   dissolution methods have been developed and applied to bulk carbonate
   rocks to extract target Sr isotope signatures of primary carbonates,
   which are easily contaminated with Sr from extraneous phases. However,
   the accuracy of the various dissolution methods is debated because all
   carbonate materials in previous studies were collected directly from the
   field and did not undergo strict homogeneity examination before sample
   dissolution. To verify and evaluate the actual bias for carbonate in SIS
   research, in this study, we analysed a set of artificial carbonate mixed
   standard samples including carbonate certificate reference materials
   (CRMs) GBW03105a for limestone and JDo-1 for dolostone in addition to
   that for clay minerals, GBW03103. These samples were verified to be
   stable in their Sr concentrations and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and could be
   used as benchmarks to enable reasonable evaluation on the extraction
   method for carbonate materials. We conducted a subtle chemical leaching
   experiment with 12 steps on these samples after preleaching by ammonium
   acetate.
   Our results show that the acidic preleach is useful in diminishing the
   Sr contamination from the extraneous phases. Nevertheless, the Sr
   contamination from the clay mineral can not be completely removed by the
   chemical leaching method and it would be more substantial for carbonate
   samples with lower purity and relatively lower original Sr-87/Sr-86. Our
   work suggests an optimised dissolution scheme for carbonate Sr-87/Sr-86
   analysis: (1) an acidic preleach to dissolve about similar to 60\% of
   the sample, (2) a further dissolution of similar to 20\% of the sample
   to prepare for the Sr-87/Sr-86 analysis, (3) leaving at least 10\% of
   the sample undissolved. A simplified dissolution protocol with advantage
   of rapid operational and relatively-high reliability was finally
   proposed for strontium isotope stratigraphy research, particularly for
   reconstruction of secular Sr isotope evolution curve.},

   a solitary wave interacting with developed coasts},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {134},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)
   carried out to study the interactions of a solitary wave with arrays of
   blocks, representing idealized beachfront buildings positioned at
   different arrangements, show that formation of jet-type channelized flow
   significantly alters the flow hydrodynamics, delays wave breaking and
   influences the total loading on the blocks in the back row. The
   staggered layout yields a 30-60\% increase in the maximum force on the
   block in the back row compared to those of the single-row and straight
   layouts while the latter creates the highest shielding effect. The total
   number of primary vortices forming around the blocks is proportional to
   the number of sharp edges of the blocks. The dimensions of the vortex
   tubes are controlled by the width of the block. Although vorticities
   were not directly measured, the critical phenomena are accurately
   represented by the simulated flow field which was thoroughly validated
   using observations and measurements.},

   Gas Drainage Effect under Different Unloading Stress Paths},
Journal = {GEOFLUIDS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Coal seam gas is a critical substance because it can be a source of a
   large quantity of clean energy as well as a dangerous source of risk. A
   pressure relief gas drainage is an effective and widely used method for
   coal seam gas recovery and gas disaster control in coal mines. A series
   of pressure relief gas drainage experiments were conducted using
   large-scale coal samples under different unloading stress paths in this
   study to explore the unloading stress paths. From the experimental
   results, the dynamic evolutions of gas pressure, coal temperature, and
   gas production were analyzed. The trends of gas pressure and coal
   temperature during pressure relief gas drainage were similar: dropping
   rapidly first and then slowly with time. Correspondingly, gas production
   was fast in the early stage of pressure relief gas drainage and became
   stable thereafter. Meanwhile, gas flow characteristics were
   significantly affected by the unloading stress paths. Gas pressure and
   coal temperature had the maximum descent by unloading stress in three
   directions simultaneously, and the unloading stress of theZdirection had
   the minimal impact when only unloading in one direction of stress.
   However, the influence of unloading stress paths on gas production was
   complex and time dependent. The difference coefficient parameter was
   proposed to characterize the influence degree of unloading stress paths
   on the pressure relief gas drainage effect. Eventually, the selection of
   unloading stress path under different situations was discussed based on
   time, which is expected to provide the basis for pressure relief gas
   drainage.},

Abstract = {Corals in the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA) in the northern Red Sea show high
   thermal tolerance. The GoA has therefore been suggested as a coral reef
   refuge from climate change. However, as a narrow body of water with high
   residence time and a rapidly growing population, the GoA is prone to
   anthropogenic stressors, heavy metal pollution being one such stressor.
   In the present study, the branching coral Stylophora pistillata,
   extensively studied for its high resistance to elevated seawater
   temperature in the GoA, was exposed to combinations of thermal
   treatments (ambient (21-23 degrees C), + 4 degrees C and + 8 degrees C
   above ambient) and ecologically relevant copper (Cu) concentrations
   (ambient and + 1 mu g L-1 above ambient concentration). Significant
   interactions were found between elevated temperature and Cu enrichment
   effects on coral physiology, mainly affecting processes associated with
   photosynthesis. Contrasting responses were recorded at 72 h and 2 weeks
   from start of the exposure to Cu enrichment. Cu enrichment caused a
   decrease in Fv/Fm, maximum rETR, and net photosynthesis in ambient
   temperature after Cu exposure of 72 h, while at the second sampling
   point only (2 weeks), a decrease was also recorded at + 4 and + 8
   degrees C. Superoxide dismutase activity was higher in Cu-enriched
   conditions, suggesting that corals were responding to oxidative stress.
   Thus, a higher input of Cu in the GoA may be energetically costly and
   might result in decreased resistance of corals to thermal stress under
   warming scenarios.},

Abstract = {Progress of the Indian economy is threatened by the impact of climate
   change. Generation of urban heat islands (UHIs), waning of urban green
   cover, increase in carbon emissions and air pollution deteriorate the
   living environment. Rise in urban temperatures and heat stress induced
   mortality remain major concerns. Although the National Action Plan on
   Climate Change emphasises the national missions of `enhanced energy
   efficiency', and `green India', little research has been devoted to
   explore the passive cooling potential of urban greenery in India, thus
   lending uniqueness to this study. The manifestations of unplanned urban
   development (UHIs, escalated carbon emissions, air pollution) are
   discussed and corroborated with identification of contributory factors.
   Contemporary greening practices and bye-laws in four major Indian cities
   (New Delhi, Pune, Chennai, and Visakhapatnam) are analysed and compared
   with global best practices. The findings are used to propose planning
   guidelines which are expected to assist in consolidating natural
   sustainability of emerging economies.},

Abstract = {Skirted foundations are a potential foundation solution for a range of
   offshore structures, including hydrocarbon and renewable energy
   platforms and subsea structures. Offshore foundations can be subject to
   cyclic loading from environmental, installation, and operational events
   affecting the geotechnical response. A series of centrifuge tests have
   been performed on a shallow skirted foundation on normally consolidated
   kaolin clay under a range of vertical cyclic load sequences to
   investigate the effect of tensile or compressive average stress, the
   magnitude of the applied stress, and the effect of cyclic loading of low
   magnitude followed by consolidation on the foundation response. Results
   are presented as vertical foundation displacements normalized by the
   foundation geometry and interpreted within the traditional shear-strain
   contour approach. The findings indicate that the average, rather than
   maximum, vertical stress defines the foundation vertical displacement
   response and failure mode, a threshold stress exists below which a
   steady state is maintained even at a high number of cycles, and
   geotechnical resistance increases as a result of low-level cyclic
   loading followed by consolidation.},

Volume = {11},

Pages = {551-582},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Ionizing radiation is a ubiquitous feature of the Cosmos, from exogenous
   cosmic rays (CR) to the intrinsic mineral radioactivity of a habitable
   world, and its influences on the emergence and persistence of life are
   wide-ranging and profound. Much attention has already been focused on
   the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation on organisms and the
   complex molecules of life, but ionizing radiation also performs many
   crucial functions in the generation of habitable planetary environments
   and the origins of life. This review surveys the role of CR and mineral
   radioactivity in star formation, generation of biogenic elements, and
   the synthesis of organic molecules and driving of prebiotic chemistry.
   Another major theme is the multiple layers of shielding of planetary
   surfaces from the flux of cosmic radiation and the various effects on a
   biosphere of violent but rare astrophysical events such as supernovae
   and gamma-ray bursts. The influences of CR can also be duplicitous, such
   as limiting the survival of surface life on Mars while potentially
   supporting a subsurface biosphere in the ocean of Europa. This review
   highlights the common thread that ionizing radiation forms between the
   disparate component disciplines of astrobiology.},

Abstract = {Wave friction factors are estimated from vertical profiles of near-bed
   turbulence and horizontal velocity spanning the wave bottom boundary
   layer. Measured values are partitioned by bed state, which ranged from
   irregular ripples to flat bed, and are examined as a function of two
   traditionally selected parameters-physical bed roughness and outer flow
   Reynolds number. The measurements are from two field experiments in very
   different nearshore environments: a relatively protected unbarred pocket
   beach and a linear barred beach exposed to the open shelf (Duck).
   Measured wave friction factors are remarkably similar for the two
   beaches and are highest for low-energy rippled beds and lowest for the
   high-energy flat bed conditions. The reduction in the friction factor
   for high-energy conditions corresponds to a decrease in the physical
   roughness of the bed as wave energy increases. As a function of relative
   roughness, measured friction factors are generally consistent with
   previous laboratory results and theoretical results for the high-energy
   cases, but the predicted values for the low-energy rippled beds show
   some significant differences. A new expression is derived for the bed
   roughness and is found to have a stronger dependence on ripple steepness
   than previously suggested laboratory-based relationships. Estimated
   friction factors exhibit a power-law dependence on Reynolds number and
   occupy a narrow band within the rough turbulent and transition regions.},

Abstract = {The vortex-induced vibration for aquatic clean energy (VIVACE) converter
   harnesses hydrokinetic energy by enhancing flow-induced oscillations
   (FIOs) of elastically supported rigid cylinders in a river, tide, or
   ocean current. The harnessing power depends on the intensity of the
   oscillation, which is a consequence of the flow-structure interaction.
   The inflow condition for the downstream (second) cylinder is slowed down
   and perturbed by the upstream (first) cylinder, due to the shielding
   effect. Therefore, the optimal structural parameters, i.e., stiffness
   and damping ratio, for the second cylinder may be different from the
   first cylinder, in terms of energy harnessing. To improve the
   performance of the VIVACE converter, a series of experiments are
   conducted in a recirculating water channel, with various stiffness
   combinations of two cylinders in tandem. Results show that the stiffness
   of the second cylinder, K-2, does not affect the energy harnessing power
   in vortex-induced vibration (VIV) occurring at low speeds, because the
   oscillation of the downstream cylinder in this velocity range is
   completely dominated by the wake of the upstream cylinder. K-2 has a
   great influence on the harnessing power at higher velocities in the
   transition region from VIV to galloping and in galloping. Changing K-2
   onsets and enhances galloping at lower flow velocity and harnesses up to
   110\% more energy than the case of K-1 = K-2.},

   which are considered as mismatch losses. To reduce these losses various
   reconfiguration techniques have been proposed earlier. The losses are
   directly depended on both position of the modules and shape of shadow.
   This paper proposes a pattern to increase the power in partial shading
   condition by defining the physical position of the modules using Sumdoku
   or Addoku puzzle pattern without modifying the TCT(Tide cross tide)
   based electrical connection. The Addoku arrangement distributes the
   shade of a module in row hence the generation of power is enhanced. In
   this work the power generation is compared with TCT and proposed Addoku
   arrangement is studied under different shading conditions and results of
   the proposed pattern yield to improved performance in partial shading
   condition.},

Title = {CO2 flux geothermometer for geothermal exploration},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {213},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {A new geothermometer (T-CO2 (Flux)) is proposed based on soil diffuse
   CO2 flux and shallow temperature measurements made on areas of steam
   heated, thermally altered ground above active geothermal systems. This
   CO2 flux geothermometer is based on a previously reported CO2
   geothermometer that was designed for use with fumarole analysis. The new
   geothermometer provides a valuable additional exploration tool for
   estimating subsurface temperatures in high-temperature geothermal
   systems. Mean T-CO2 Flux estimates fall within the range of deep drill
   hole temperatures at Wairakei (New Zealand), Tauhara (New Zealand),
   Rotokawa (New Zealand), Ohaaki (New Zealand), Reykjanes (Iceland) and
   Copahue (Argentina). The spatial distribution of geothermometry
   estimates is consistent with the location of major upflow zones
   previously reported at the Wairakei and Rotokawa geothermal systems.
   T-CO2 Flux was also evaluated at White Island (New Zealand) and Reporoa
   (New Zealand), where limited sub-surface data exists. Mode T-CO2 Flux at
   White Island is high (320 degrees C), the highest of the systems
   considered in this study. However, the geothermometer relies on
   mineral-water equilibrium in neutral pH reservoir fluids, and would not
   be reliable in such an active and acidic environment. Mean T-CO2 Flux at
   Reporoa (310 degrees C) is high, which indicates Reporoa has a separate
   upflow from the nearby Waiotapu geothermal system; an outflow from
   Waiotapu would not be expected to have such high temperature. (C) 2017

Title = {Bayesian analysis of short term extreme mooring tension for a point
   absorber with mixture of gamma and generalised pareto distributions},
Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {110},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Model tests have been conducted to study the performance of slack,
   catenary and hybrid mooring systems for a point absorber in survival sea
   states. The snap loads can be found in mooring tension time series of
   all the tested mooring configurations. The classical Weibull
   distribution is applied to model the extreme dynamic mooring tensions.
   In addition to the Weibull distribution, the Bayesian inference method
   with a new Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure is proposed to
   study the short term extreme mooring tensions based on model test
   results. Before applying this method to analyse extreme mooring tension,
   its accuracy is validated. The probability densities as well as short
   term extreme dynamic tension estimated by a mixture of Gamma and
   Generalised Pareto Distributions models are compared with the
   two-parameter Weibull model results. In the end, an extensive discussion
   of about the mixture of Gamma components, peak definitions, threshold
   and Markov chain Monte Carlo iteration on Bayesian inference is carried
   out. It is validated that the mixture model proposed in this paper shows
   good performance in predicting the extreme mooring tensions even when
   the snap loads occur, while the Weibull distribution fails to give
   accuracy predictions.},

Title = {Hydrodynamic analysis of a modular multi-purpose floating structure
   system with different outermost connector types},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {176},
Pages = {158-168},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The present work investigates the effect of different outermost
   connector types on the hydrodynamic responses of a modular multi-purpose
   floating structure (MMFS) system. The MMFS system is preliminarily
   designed for a mild sea zone, which is composed of a number of
   standardized floating modules. In this study, the MMFS system has been
   simplified as a seven-module connected system. Considering the
   structural deformation of the MMFS system mainly occurs in the
   connectors among adjacent modules, each module is viewed as a rigid
   body. Both the hydrodynamic interaction effect and mechanical coupling
   effect among modules have been taken into consideration in the
   time-domain analysis. Different outermost connector designs have been
   proposed and investigated for the MMFS system. The results indicate that
   the hydrodynamic responses of the MMFS system are sensitive to the
   effects of the connector types, the wave phase, and the wavelength. The
   hinge-type design of the outermost connector can significantly reduce
   the extreme responses of both the bending moment and the shear force of
   the connectors. The additional PTO damper design for the outermost
   hinge-type connector can effectively reduce the motion of the outermost
   module, and also produce considerable wave energy.},

Title = {The use of internal heart rate loggers in determining cardiac
   breakpoints of fish},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {89},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As marine environments are influenced by global warming there is a need
   to thoroughly understand the relationship between physiological limits
   and temperature in fish. One quick screening method of a physiological
   thermal tipping point is the temperature at which maximum heart rate
   (f(Hmax)) can no longer scale predictably with warming and is referred
   to as the Arrhenius break temperature (T-AB). The use of this method has
   been successful for freshwater fish by using external electrodes to
   detect an electrocardiogram (ECG), however, the properties of this
   equipment pose challenges in salt water when evaluating marine fish. To
   overcome these challenges, this study aimed to explore the potential use
   of implantable heart rate loggers to quantify the T-AB of Chrysoblephus
   laticeps, a marine Sparid, following the ECG method protocols where
   f(Hmax) is monitored over an acute warming event and the T-AB is
   subsequently identified using a piece-wise linear regression model. Of
   the nine experimental fish, only five (56\%) returned accurate f(Hmax)
   data. The T-AB of successful trials was identified each time and ranged
   from 18.09 to 20.10 degrees C. This study therefore provides evidence
   that implantable heart rate loggers can estimate TAB of fish which can
   be applied to many marine species.},

Abstract = {During the massive mucilage event in the northern Adriatic Sea in July
   1991 samples of macroaggregate were fixed in different ways: with
   formaldehyde, deep frozen and freeze-dried. Conventional microscopy
   (light and epifluorescence) revealed different autotrophic species
   embedded in gelatinous matrix. Cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria
   were also identified. Scanning confocal laser microscopy (SCLM) and
   fluorescent molecular probes (the lectins concanavalin A and UEA-I)
   showed wall-free cytoplasm and particulate polysaccharides leaking from
   the envelopes of broken cells in the matrix. The extensive cell lysis
   was supported by the observation of cytoplasm-free cytoskeletons,
   stained by the molecular probe phalloidin. High concentrations of
   triglycerides (30\% of total lipids) and free fatty acids (22\%) along
   with very low concentrations of phospholipids (2\%) also indicated
   massive cell degradation in freeze-dried material. The mucilage
   observations were compared with those of a natural plankton community
   grown under high nutrient conditions using the same techniques. Free
   polysaccharides were observed as globular flocs (marine snow) during in
   situ enrichment experiments and intracellular polysaccharides as carbon
   storage materials in autotrophic organisms. No strings, filaments,
   layers, cell lysis or lipid classes indicating strong cell
   biodeterioration were observed in a 1 mo controlled experiment during an

Title = {Unravelling the sources of carbon emissions at the onset of Oceanic
   Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a},
Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {530},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) la represents a major
   perturbation of the Earth's climate system and in particular the carbon
   cycle, as evidenced by widespread preservation of organic matter in
   marine settings and a characteristic negative carbon isotopic excursion
   (CIE) at its onset, followed by a broad positive CIE. The
   contemporaneous emplacement of a large igneous province (LIP) is invoked
   as a trigger for OAE la (and OAEs in general), but this link and the
   ultimate source of the carbon perturbation at the onset of OAEs is still
   debated. In this study, we simultaneously assimilate an atmospheric
   pCO(2) reconstruction along with a delta C-13 record from the Spanish
   Cau section in an Earth system model to obtain a novel transient
   reconstruction of emission rates and identify the primary
   carbon-emitting sources across the negative CIE interval at the onset of
   OAE la. We reconstruct carbon emissions of 4,300-29,200 Pg from a
   mixture of carbon sources. This estimate is a lower bound, as
   contemporaneous organic carbon burial is not accounted for. Carbon was
   first released at slow rates from a C-13-depleted reservoir (e.g.
   thermo- and/or biogenic methane from sill intrusions). Towards the end
   of the negative CIE the rate of emissions increased and they became more
   C-13-enriched, likely from a dominantly volcanic source (e.g. LIPs). New
   osmium isotope (Os-187 /Os-188) measurements, from the same section as
   the pCO(2) reconstruction and delta C-13 data, reveal a shift to less
   radiogenic values coinciding with the change towards mantle-derived
   carbon emissions as indicated by our modelling results, lending further
   support to our interpretation. These results highlight that geologically
   triggered carbon emissions were likely driving the OAE onset. (C) 2019

Title = {Dendro-provenancing of Arctic driftwood},
Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Arctic driftwood may represent a cross-disciplinary proxy archive at the
   interface of marine and terrestrial environments, which will likely gain
   in importance under future global climate change. Circumpolar network
   analyses that systematically consider species-specific boreal origin
   areas, transport routes and deposition characteristics of Arctic
   driftwood, are, however, missing. Here, we present tree ring width (TRW)
   measurements of 2412 pine, larch and spruce driftwood samples from
   Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, the Faroe Islands, and the Lena Delta in
   northeastern Siberia. Representing the largest Arctic driftwood TRW
   compilation, these data are compared against 495 TRW reference
   chronologies from the boreal forests of Eurasia and North America. The
   southern Yenisei region is the main source for recent pine driftwood at
   all Arctic sampling sites, whereas spruce mainly originates in western
   Russia and central Siberia, as well as in northern North America. Larch
   driftwood is, for the first time, dendroprovenanced to central and
   eastern Siberia. A new larch driftwood chronology extends the middle
   Lena River reference chronology back to 1203 CE. Annually resolved
   radiocarbon measurements further date six larch driftwood chronologies
   between 1294 and 2013 CE. Although being highly replicated, our study
   emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research efforts
   including radiocarbon dating, isotopic tracing and aDNA processing for
   improving Arctic driftwood provenancing in space and time. If
   successful, Arctic driftwood studies will contribute to the
   reconstruction of past boreal summer temperature variations and ocean
   current dynamics, as well as changes in sea ice extent and relative sea
   level over the last centuries to millennia. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {IMPACTS OF MARINE RANCHING CONSTRUCTION ON SEDIMENT PORE WATER
   CHARACTERISTIC AND NUTRIENT FLUX ACROSS THE SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE IN
   A SUBTROPICAL MARINE RANCHING (ZHELIN BAY, CHINA)},
Journal = {APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Pages = {163-179},
Abstract = {Marine ranching is an effective way to restore depleted stocks and
   increase fisheries production. The effects of marine ranching
   construction on sediment pore water characteristics and nutrient flux
   across the sediment-water interface were determined by incubation
   experiments. Nine stations were selected along an inshore to offshore
   gradient of different sediment types representing different zones used
   for marine ranching in Zhelin Bay, China. The results showed that
   nutrient concentrations of overlying water and pore water varied by zone
   and were influenced by biological and physical characteristics. In the
   macroalgae zone (MA), macroalgae was cultured from September to May
   Decayed macroalgae in this zone during winter lead to pH variation
   (ranged from 8.05 to 8.16) and highest nitrite (range from 0.1719 to
   0.9210 umol m(-2) D-1), ammonia (range from 1.778 to 4.448 umol m(-2)
   D-1) and total nitrogen (range from 23.43 to 140.6 umol m(-2) D-1). In
   the benthic molluscs' area, shellfish activities led to higher ammonia
   (range from 0.3312 to 7.725 umol L-1) and total nitrogen (range from
   59.67 to 447.7 umol L-1) concentration in the overlying water during the
   summer season. In the artificial reef zone (depth 15-20 m), the
   deployment of artificial reef materials altered the sea floor which
   resulted in upwelling and a consequent increase in the flux of total
   phosphate. The results of this study will be useful to improve marine
   ranching efforts in China and worldwide.},

Title = {Catastrophic events and estuarine connectivity influence presence of
   aquatic macrophytes and trophic status of intermittently-open coastal
   lagoons in eastern Australia},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {238},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Small intermittently open lagoons are the most common type of estuary in
   NSW but the majority of them have no seagrass despite apparently
   suitable physical and water quality conditions. This paper describes the
   consequences of a catastrophic drought on trophic structure of primary
   producers in two intermittently open coastal lagoons that have
   negligible anthropogenic stress. It examines the roles of various
   factors influencing primary producers and hence ecosystems in
   intermittently open lagoons, in both short and long timeframes.
   Two estuarine lagoons with undisturbed catchments (Durras Lake and
   Nadgee Lake) experienced decadal scale shift in production dominance
   from benthic to pelagic and back to benthic following a catastrophic
   reduction in water levels during drought conditions. Water quality
   deteriorated significantly (high turbidity, ammonia and chlorophyll)
   after loss of macrophytes and then re-established to ``normal{''}
   conditions within 2-3 years. Despite this, macrophytes did not re-appear
   for 6-7 years. The high proportion of intermittent estuaries with no
   seagrass was concluded to be a consequence of recruitment limitation,
   and estuarine morphology shapes the ecology of these lagoons, rather
   than an inherent inability for seagrass and macrophytes to live in the
   estuaries. Recruitment of macrophytes required coincident occurrence of
   multiple rare stochastic events, making chance an important aspect of
   re-establishment of biological assemblages in disturbance driven
   ecosystems.
   Conceptual models derived for northern hemisphere, riverine,
   surface-water fed estuaries tend to dominate thinking about estuaries in
   the literature, but are clearly inappropriate for typical
   southern-hemisphere low-flow and groundwater-dominated intermittent
   estuaries.
   Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of occurrence of the
   conditions that led to the loss of seagrass and macrophytes and
   therefore potentially reduce the number of intermittent estuaries in NSW
   with macrophytes. In the systems described, maintenance of regional
   seagrass populations is reliant on the stochastic survival of some
   populations to act as source populations. Climate change is predicted to
   make what are currently ``extreme{''} events more common. This could, in
   turn, mean that the likelihood of the sort of loss described in our two
   cases studies could become more common, increasing the proportion of
   systems with no seagrass and progressively closing the window of
   opportunity for external recruitment. Potentially, this could lead to
   localised extinction of seagrass in intermittent estuaries.},

Journal = {SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY},
Year = {1994},

Abstract = {The Middle Ordovician `'Chickamauga'' Formation at Red Mountain
   Expressway (RME) and Tidwell Hollow (TWH) sections in Alabama (U.S.A)
   has a complex early diagenetic history. Early diagenetic history of the
   buildup facies consisted of two phases of marine cementation separated
   by two generations of meteoric, equant calcite with moldic dissolution
   separating equant calcite generations. A third generation of meteoric,
   equant (drusy) calcite is present after secondary marine diagenesis.
   Equant (drusy) calcite is interpreted as meteoric because its stable
   isotopic composition (deltaC-13 = -0.1 to -1.6 parts per thousand,
   deltaO-18 = -4.8 to -7.3 parts per thousand) is too variable to be
   accounted for by marine or mixing zone precipitation. Equant (drusy)
   calcite from buildup facies is mostly non-luminescent and non-ferroan.
   This is unlike early, ferroan equant calcite (dull to bright
   luminescent) from below the unconformity that overlies the
   `'Chickamauga'' Formation at RME. Meteoric diagenesis below the
   unconformity is unrelated to early diagenesis in the underlying buildup
   facies. Equant (drusy) calcite from the buildup facies at RME has a
   covariation of deltaC-13 and deltaO-18 values that forms a truncated
   inverted `'J'' and has elevated Mg values. These geochemical signatures
   indicate precipitation at a site that was distal from the recharge zone.
   Meteoric diagenesis at RME occurred during rising relative sea level and
   flow of meteoric fluids under a submerged platform is the only mechanism
   able to reconcile available stratigraphic, petrologic, and geochemical
   data. Ordovician meteoric deltaC-13 values (from TWH and other
   formations) are slightly depleted (2-4 parts per thousand) relative to
   coeval marine carbonate, especially when compared with post-Silurian
   meteoric carbonate. Minor depletion of Ordovician carbonate is the
   result of limited generation of light soil-gas CO2 before the
   development of vascular plants.},

Title = {Distribution and Uptake of Key Polychlorinated Biphenyl and

Journal = {ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {As part of a broader study of budgets, transport, and bioaccumulation of
   persistent organic contaminants in the Strait of Georgia, Canada,
   matching samples of sediment and bulk benthos were collected near two
   marine sewage outfalls, two large urban harbours, and background areas.
   Samples were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and
   polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners. We present data for
   those congeners that fell within the top six rankings by concentration
   (23 PCBs and 10 PBDEs) within at least one of the environmental media
   measured in other studies (air, water, sediments, benthos, pelagic
   biota). Multifactor regression analyses incorporating sediment
   characteristics (total organic carbon, fines) predicted uptake (r (2) =
   0.74 to 0.98, p < 0.04) over the range of congeners and habitats
   examined. PBDEs were taken up by biota more readily than PCBs,
   suggesting a large, potentially available biological reservoir of PBDEs
   in sediments. Dominant congeners in benthos comprised PBDEs 47, 99, 209,
   and 100 and PCBs 138/163, 153, 101, 118, and 110. PBDE uptake was
   anomalously high near one wastewater outfall, likely due to selective
   feeding on PBDE-enriched particulates from that source. Conversely,
   outfalls supply food and sediments with PCB concentrations similar to
   ambient sediments. However, organic enrichment of sediments near
   outfalls clearly enhanced PCB uptake by benthos, probably due to greatly
   increased biomass turnover near these sources. Data suggest there to be
   an initial reservoir of PCBs in newly settled juvenile benthos, which is
   much less evident for PBDEs. This is likely a consequence of the
   ecosystem-wide distribution of legacy PCBs but not the more current-use
   PBDEs. Congener-uptake patterns were dependent on source and input
   dynamics, feeding methods, and contaminant metabolism or debromination,
   particularly of deca-BDE.},

Abstract = {During the last decades, global cyanobacteria biomass increased due to
   climate change as well as industrial usage for production of biofuels
   and food supplements. Thus, there is a need for thorough
   characterization of their potential health risks, including
   allergenicity. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize
   similarities in allergenic potential of cyanobacteria originating from
   the major ecological environments. Different cyanobacterial taxa were
   tested for immunoreactivity with IgE from allergic donors and
   non-allergic controls using immunoblot and ELISA. Moreover, mediator
   release from human FceR1-transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells
   was measured, allowing in situ examination of the allergenic reaction.
   Phycocyanin content and IgE-binding potential were determined and
   inhibition assays performed to evaluate similarities in IgE-binding
   epitopes. Mass spectrometry analysis identified IgE-reactive bands
   ranging between 10 and 160 kDa as phycobiliprotein compounds. Levels of
   cyanobacterial antigen-specific IgE in plasma of allergic donors and
   mediator release from sensitized RBL cells were significantly higher
   compared to non-allergic controls (p < 0.01). Inhibition studies
   indicated cross-reactivity between IgE-binding proteins from fresh water
   cyanobacteria and phycocyanin standard. We further addressed IgE-binding
   characteristics of marine water and soil-originated cyanobacteria.
   Altogether, our data suggest that the intensive use and the strong
   increase in cyanobacterial abundance due to climate change call for
   increasing awareness and further monitoring of their potential health
   hazards. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Usable solar radiation (USR) represents spectrally integrated solar
   energy in the spectral range of 400-560 nm, a domain where photons
   penetrate the most in oceanic waters and thus contribute to
   photosynthesis and heating at deeper depths. Through purely numerical
   simulations, it was found that the diffuse attenuation coefficient of
   downwelling USR (K-d(USR), m(-1)) is nearly a constant vertically in the
   upper water column for clear waters and most turbid waters. Subsequently
   an empirical model was developed to estimate Kd(USR) based on the
   diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (Kd(490), m(-1)). We here
   evaluate this relationship using data collected from a wide range of
   oceanic and coastal environments and found that the relationship between
   Kd(490) and Kd(USR) developed via the numerical simulation is quite
   robust. We further refined this relationship to extend the applicability
   to ``clearest{''} natural waters. This refined relationship was then
   used to produce sample distribution of Kd(USR) of global oceans. As
   expected, extremely low Kd(USR) (similar to 0.02 m(-1)) was observed in
   ocean gyres, while significantly higher Kd(USR) (similar to 5.2 m(-1))
   was found in very turbid coastal regions. A useful application of
   Kd(USR) is to easily and accurately propagate surface USR to deeper
   depths, potentially to significantly improve the estimation of basin
   scale primary production and heat fluxes in the upper water column.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Climatic Niche Dynamics of an Invasive Plant
   Mikania micrantha Kunth and Its Potential Distribution Under Projected
   Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},

Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Similarity of climatic niches occupied by a species in its native and
   invasive ranges has been recognized as one of the key factors for
   successful invasion. Accounting for changes in climatic niche over time
   may provide better understanding of the dynamic biological invasion
   process. We investigated these changes for an invasive alien plant
   Mikania micrantha in South and Southeast Asia, Australia, Oceania and
   parts of the USA. Based on documented occurrences over 200 years
   (1800-2017), we reconstructed the introduction history of the species
   and estimated climatic niche dynamics for the presumed invasion routes.
   We estimated niche conservatism and the environmental analogy between
   native and invasive ranges and used ecological niche modeling to
   identify the potential distribution of M. micrantha under current and
   future climate change scenarios. Our study identified six pathways
   through which the species was presumably introduced from its native
   range. Climatic conditions of the initial introduction sites were found
   to be similar to those in the native niche. However, the species
   occupied climatic niches in dry and cold areas over time, being outside
   of the limits of the realized climatic niche of its native range. The
   climatic niche dynamics also differed between the invasion pathways with
   variable time lag. This pattern of niche change over time was found to
   be consistent in future. Nearly 20\% of the invasive range was found to
   be climatically suitable for this species and was predicted to expand
   toward cold and dry areas of the invasive range affecting nearly half of
   the global biodiversity hotspots. By analyzing M. micrantha invasion at
   a time scale, this study revealed multiple introduction pathways,
   variation in climatic niche dynamics among invasion routes, and
   potential range expansion of the species in its invasive range. Although
   further experimental and molecular studies are needed to explain these
   findings fully, this study highlights the need for temporally explicit
   approaches toward better understanding and successful management of
   biological invasions.},

Title = {Molecular mechanisms underlying responses of the Antarctic coral
   Malacobelemnon daytoni to ocean acidification},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {170},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Benthic organisms of the Southern Ocean are particularly vulnerable to
   ocean acidification (OA), as they inhabit cold waters where
   calcite-aragonite saturation states are naturally low. OA most strongly
   affects animals with calcium carbonate skeletons or shells, such as
   corals and mollusks. We exposed the abundant cold-water coral
   Malacobelemnon daytoni from an Antarctic fjord to low pH seawater (LpH)
   (7.68 +/- 0.17) to test its physiological responses to OA, at the level
   of gene expression (RT-PCR) and enzyme activity. Corals were exposed in
   short- (3 days) and long-term (54 days) experiments to two pCO(2)
   conditions (ambient and elevated pCO(2) equaling RCP 8.5, IPCC 2019,
   approximately 372.53 and 956.78 mu atm, respectively).
   Of the eleven genes studied through RT-PCR, six were significantly
   upregulated compared with control in the short-term in the LpH
   condition, including the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70), Toll-like receptor (TLR), galaxin and
   ferritin. After long-term exposure to low pH conditions, RT-PCR analysis
   showed seven genes were upregulated. These include the mannose-binding
   C-Lectin and HSP90. Also, the expression of TLR and galaxin, among
   others, continued to be upregulated after long-term exposure to LpH.
   Expression of carbonic anhydrase (CA), a key enzyme involved in
   calcification, was also significantly upregulated after long-term
   exposure. Our results indicated that, after two months, M. daytoni is
   not acclimatized to this experimental LpH condition. Gene expression
   profiles revealed molecular impacts that were not evident at the enzyme
   activity level. Consequently, understanding the molecular mechanisms
   behind the physiological processes in the response of a coral to LpH is
   critical to understanding the ability of polar species to cope with
   future environmental changes. Approaches integrating molecular tools
   into Antarctic ecological and/or conservation research make an essential
   contribution given the current ongoing OA processes.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the logarithmic production of existing well-known food
   materials is unable to keep up with the demand caused by the exponential
   growth of the human population in terms of the equality of access to
   food materials. Famous local food materials with treasury properties
   such as mangrove fruits are an excellent source to be listed as emerging
   food candidates with ethnomedicinal properties. Thus, this study reviews
   the nutrition content of several edible mangrove fruits and the
   innovation to improve the fruit into a highly economic food product.
   Within the mangrove fruit, the levels of primary metabolites such as
   carbohydrates, protein, and fat are acceptable for daily intake. The
   mangrove fruits, seeds, and endophytic fungi are rich in phenolic
   compounds, limonoids, and their derivatives as the compounds present a
   multitude of bioactivities such as antimicrobial, anticancer, and
   antioxidant. In the intermediary process, the flour of mangrove fruit
   stands as a supplementation for the existing flour with antidiabetic or
   antioxidant properties. The mangrove fruit is successfully transformed
   into many processed food products. However, limited fruits from species
   such as Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia
   caseolaris, and Avicennia marina are commonly upgraded into traditional
   food, though many more species demonstrate ethnomedicinal properties. In
   the Middle East, A. marina is the dominant species, and the study of the
   phytochemicals and fruit development is limited. Therefore, studies on
   the development of mangrove fruits to functional for other mangrove
   species are demanding. The locally accepted mangrove fruit is coveted as
   an alternate food material to support the sustainable development goal
   of eliminating world hunger in sustainable ways.},

Title = {Export of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the eddy region of the

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {We examined particulate organic carbon (POC) export using U-238-Th-234
   disequilibrium in the tropical northwest Pacific Ocean, where numerous
   eddies are present. We obtained data from an anticyclonic eddy in 2019
   and from both anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies in 2020. In 2019, excess
   Th-234 and higher POC concentrations were observed in the upper 100 m
   layer inside the anticyclonic eddy compared with the outer area of the
   eddy (the reference site). We speculate that the peculiar feature of
   excess Th-234 in the surface layer was caused by horizontal transport of
   POC into the eddy and consequent POC degradation and release of
   particulate Th-234 to a dissolved form. However, in 2020, lower POC
   concentrations with Th-234 deficiency were observed in both cyclonic and
   anticyclonic eddies relative to the reference site. In both years, POC
   export was lower in the cores of the anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies
   relative to the reference site. We propose that severe nutrient
   depletion in the upper 150 m layer hindered nutrient supply by vertical
   water movement in the eddies. Despite the low POC export at 100 m depth,
   POC export at 500 m depth was comparable to values observed at 500 m
   depth at Station Papa in the more productive northeastern Pacific
   region. Our results imply that POC export into the deep ocean interior
   in this region may not be as low as expected from the low primary
   productivity in the euphotic zone.},

Abstract = {The Krechba gas field at In Salah (Algeria), the site of the first
   industrial scale on-shore CO2 storage demonstration project, is also
   known for satellite-based ground-deformation monitoring data of
   remarkable quality. In this work, we focus on the In Salah injection
   well KB-502, where a double-lobe uplift pattern has been observed in the
   ground-deformation data. On the basis of previous numerical results,
   semi-analytical inverse deformation solutions, and seismic analyses, we
   explain this pattern of uplift as resulting from injection-induced
   deformation in a deep vertical fracture zone. In this study, we simulate
   a fracture zone characterized by high permeability and low mechanical
   stiffness, which activates after a few months of injection, causing
   irreversible changes in permeability. We study the transient evolution
   of uplift using the observed injection rate and compare it to the field
   Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data using the
   displacement in the satellite line-of-sight. We also carry out a
   sensitivity study, analyzing the extent of the fracture zone,
   particularly its height from the reservoir depth. Our analysis supports
   the notion that the fracture zone is confined within the caprock and
   does not penetrate into the overlying aquifer. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Effect of water temperature on gut transit time, digestive enzyme
   activity and nutrient digestibility in yellowtail kingfish (Seriola
   lalandi)},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},

Abstract = {Yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) are farmed in sea cages in South
   Australian waters and exposed to seasonal variations in water
   temperature. The temperature variations, ranging from 10 to 24 C.
   influence feed intake and on-farm feeding practices. Sub-adult
   yellowtail kingfish are fed twice daily in summer while feeding in
   winter may be reduced to once every second day. Lower winter water
   temperatures increase gut transit times which may lead to a condition
   known as winter syndrome. This syndrome causes an enteritis response in
   yellowtail kingfish and reduces farm productivity. The impact of water
   temperature on gut transit time, nutrient digestibility and protease and
   lipase enzyme activities in yellowtail kingfish (2.12 +/- 0.03 and 2.77
   +/- 0.03 kg live weight in summer and winter respectively) was
   investigated at summer and winter water temperatures; 20.8 +/- 0.4
   degrees C and 12.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C respectively, using observations
   made on dissected fish and detection of the passage of dietary markers.
   Water temperature had a significant effect on gut transit time, with
   visual observations demonstrating that at summer water temperatures it
   takes 1216 h for all digesta to be voided from the fish compared to
   36-48 h at winter temperatures. Temperature did not have a significant
   effect on the dietary nutrient apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC,
   \%) although there was a numerical tendency for nutrient ADC to be
   higher in the posterior intestine at summer water temperatures: 46\% vs.
   35\% for dry matter; 70\% vs. 67\% for protein; 66\% vs. 58\% for fat;
   and 70\% vs. 63\% for energy. Nutrient digestibility did not differ
   significantly between the anterior and posterior intestinal sections;
   however, the ADC values were consistently higher in posterior intestine.
   Protease activity was significantly higher in the posterior intestine
   and there was also a numerical, but not significant, increase in
   protease and lipase activities in the anterior section of the intestine
   during winter. Lipase activity was significantly higher in the anterior
   intestine during summer, when compared to the posterior section, and
   numerically higher in this section during winter. In winter it was found
   that a greater proportion of nutrient digestion occurred in the stomach,
   pyloric caeca and anterior intestine when compared to summer. This was
   thought to be due to the slower gut motility and higher enzyme
   activities observed during winter. Even though gut transit time was
   slower in winter, the lower water temperature also resulted in nutrient
   digestibility that was numerically lower. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A global survey of ``TURF-reserves{''}, Territorial Use Rights for
   Fisheries coupled with marine reserves},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {97-106},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Overfishing and degradation of the marine environment continue to plague
   coastal communities worldwide, with multiple diverse solutions being
   proposed. Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) is a fishery
   management approach that aligns fishers' incentives with sustainability,
   while marine reserves have proven effective for ecosystem protection,
   and in some cases for fishery enhancement. These two management
   approaches are often used in isolation, leaving the potential utility of
   integrating them poorly understood. We examine cases where TURFs and
   marine reserves have been implemented together to create
   ``TURF-reserves''. We compiled a database of 27 TURF-reserves and
   collected information on the governance, management, enforcement,
   fishing practices, fishing rights, regulations, and design attributes
   for each site. We address several research questions including: what
   species are managed with TURF-reserves, how are TURF-reserves created
   and who is involved in the process? Our findings show that the majority
   of surveyed TURF-reserves arose from previously established TURF systems
   that target a range of fisheries, and multiple entities play a role in
   TURF-reserve development and management. We also examine the differences
   between two TURF-reserve archetypes and find that those developed with a
   strong history of customary tenure share distinct qualities from those
   created in a more recently established, government-mandated system. (C)

Number = {11},

Abstract = {We present the results of a double-plume integral model for a positively
   buoyant multiphase plume of liquid carbon dioxide injected at mid-depths
   (500-2000 m) in the ocean. In addition to the relevant plume physics,
   the model accounts for dissolution of the carbon dioxide droplets, the
   effect on dissolution of clathrate hydrate films, and the increase in
   seawater density due to enrichment by dissolved carbon dioxide. Due to
   the creation of negative buoyancy in the entrained fluid through
   dissolution of carbon dioxide, the near-field mixing exhibits a complex
   set of energetic descending outer plume structures that do not converge
   to a steady state. The unsteady near field is shown to be inherent in
   the plume physics, resulting in enhanced distribution of the dissolved
   carbon dioxide over the plume height and formation of multiple, unsteady
   intrusion layers. Despite the complex plume near field, we demonstrate
   that the height of maximum plume rise has a steady solution. A general
   empirical design equation for the maximum height of plume rise is
   presented from the model results, dependent on the initial droplet
   diameter and buoyancy flux, the strength of the ambient stratification,
   and the linear mass transfer reduction factor due to hydrate formation.
   A sensitivity analysis of the design equation highlights the droplet
   diameter as the most important design variable and demonstrates that
   current uncertainty in the value of the mass transfer reduction factor
   results in uncertainty of the plume rise height within a factor of
   three.},

   in conceptual approaches when determining the external borders and
   delimitating continental shelf. We characterize the domestic model of
   Arctic exploration and the food supply system of territories. We
   identify the current problem of extraction of marine resources, their
   processing and delivery to the consumer. The intersectoral resource
   economy of the Arctic territories, the difficulties of fishery and fish
   processing, aquaculture production, the lack of support for local farms
   cultivating crops and producing of animal genetic resources are
   inherited from previous economic models. The basic features of the
   modern economy of the Arctic have significant country-specific
   differences depending on the policies that are implemented on one or
   another Arctic territory. This is manifested in the conditions created
   by the state as well as in the level of investment attractiveness and
   the quality of life. The factors affecting food security in Arctic areas
   are the following: the access to fishing stocks; support of the
   agricultural sector and rural households; the formation of state market
   mechanisms when creating interregional agro-food complexes; respect for
   animal genetic resources. We recommend enhancing the regulatory,
   institutional and economic opportunities of coastal regions, creating
   the conditions for competition development in the extraction and
   processing of natural resources in the Arctic.},

Abstract = {1. Ecologists continue to debate whether the assembly of communities of
   species is more strongly influenced by dispersal limitations or
   niche-based factors. Analytical approaches that account for both
   mechanisms can help to resolve controls of community assembly.
   2. We compared littoral snail assemblages in Lake Tanganyika at three
   different spatial scales (5-25 m, 0.5-10 km and 0.5-27 km) to test
   whether spatial distance or environmental differences are better
   predictors of community similarity.
   3. At the finest scale (5-25 m), snail assemblages shifted strongly with
   depth but not across similar lateral distances, indicating a stronger
   response to environmental gradients than dispersal opportunities.
   4. At the two larger scales (0.5-27 km), both environmental similarity
   and shoreline distance between sites predicted assemblage similarity
   across sites. Additionally, canonical correspondence analysis revealed
   that snail abundances were significantly correlated with algal
   carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and wave energy.
   5. Our results indicate that the factors governing assemblage structure
   are scale dependent; niche-based mechanisms act across all spatial
   scales, whereas community similarity declines with distance only at
   larger spatial separations.},

Abstract = {Passive target detection through shipping-radiated noise is a key

   value in civil and military fields. In this study, the stable spectral

   the perspective of underwater channels. We utilize the channel impulse
   response function as the classification basis of different targets.
   First, the underwater channel is estimated by the cepstrum. Then, the
   channel cepstral features carried by different spectral line components
   are extracted in turn. Finally, the spectral line components belonging
   to the same target are clustered by the cepstral feature distance to
   realize the classification of different targets. The simulation and
   experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in

Title = {Classification of Boulders in Coastal Environments Using Random Forest
   Machine Learning on Topo-Bathymetric LiDAR Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Boulders on the seabed in coastal marine environments provide key geo-
   and ecosystem functions and services. They serve as natural coastal
   protection by dissipating wave energy, and they form an important hard
   substrate for macroalgae, and hence for coastal marine reefs that serve
   as important habitats for fish. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the possibility of developing an automated method to classify boulders
   from topo-bathymetric LiDAR data in coastal marine environments. The
   Rodsand lagoon in Denmark was used as study area. A 100 m x 100 m test
   site was divided into a training and a test set. The classification was
   performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm. Different
   tuning parameters were tested. The study resulted in the development of
   a nearly automated method to classify boulders from topo-bathymetric
   LiDAR data. Different measure scores were used to evaluate the
   performance. For the best parameter combination, the recall of the
   boulders was 57\%, precision was 27\%, and F-score 37\%, while the
   accuracy of the points was 99\%. The most important tuning parameters
   for boulder classification were the subsampling level, the choice of the
   neighborhood radius, and the features. Automatic boulder detection will
   enable transparent, reproducible, and fast detection and mapping of
   boulders.</p>},

Abstract = {The south Australian Eucla Shelf belongs to the world's largest
   cool-water carbonate sedimentary system. During the Pleistocene, it
   exported large amounts of sediment to the shelf edge and upper slope
   resulting in an expanded sedimentary wedge. Wedge-internal clinoforming
   seismic reflectors suggest a stacking of the deposits into genetic
   sequences. High-resolution stable oxygen and carbon isotope, point
   counting, grain size, and carbonate mineralogical XRD analyses were
   carried out to characterize these genetic sequences along a dip-parallel
   transect of three ODP Leg 182 drill holes located between the shelf edge
   and upper slope. Oxygen and carbon isotope fluctuations show that the
   genetic sequences formed as a response to sea level fluctuations. Within
   the genetic sequences, facies differentiation and sediment volume
   partitioning occur along the transect. Lowstand deposits are fine
   grained and contain more sponge spicules and micrite. Highstand deposits
   are coarse grained with tunicate spicules, brown bioclasts, as well as
   bryozoan and corallinacean debris. Boundaries separating highstand and
   lowstand deposits are triggered by sea level fall, and are expressed as
   abrupt grain size changes or as turning points in grain-size trends.
   Analyzed components vary in abundance along the transect. Genetic
   sequences show dip-parallel variations in thickness combined with
   changing relative proportions of lowstand versus highstand deposits.},

Title = {Prospects for the Implementation of Underground Hydrogen Storage in the
   EU},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The hydrogen economy is one of the possible directions of development
   for the European Union economy, which in the perspective of 2050, can
   ensure climate neutrality for the member states. The use of hydrogen in
   the economy on a larger scale requires the creation of a storage system.
   Due to the necessary volumes, the best sites for storage are geological
   structures (salt caverns, oil and gas deposits or aquifers). This
   article presents an analysis of prospects for large-scale underground
   hydrogen storage in geological structures. The political conditions for
   the implementation of the hydrogen economy in the EU Member States were
   analysed. The European Commission in its documents (e.g., Green Deal)
   indicates hydrogen as one of the important elements enabling the
   implementation of a climate-neutral economy. From the perspective of
   2050, the analysis of changes and the forecast of energy consumption in
   the EU indicate an increase in electricity consumption. The expected
   increase in the production of energy from renewable sources may
   contribute to an increase in the production of hydrogen and its role in
   the economy. From the perspective of 2050, discussed gas should replace
   natural gas in the chemical, metallurgical and transport industries. In
   the longer term, the same process will also be observed in the aviation
   and maritime sectors. Growing charges for CO2 emissions will also
   contribute to the development of underground hydrogen storage
   technology. Geological conditions, especially wide-spread aquifers and
   salt deposits allow the development of underground hydrogen storage in
   Europe.},

Abstract = {Aim Species distribution modelling (SDM) represents a valuable
   alternative to predict species distribution over vast and remote areas
   of the ocean. We tested whether reliable SDMs can be generated for
   benthic marine organisms at the scale of the Southern Ocean. We aimed at
   identifying the main large-scale factors that determine the distribution
   of the selected species. The robustness of SDMs was tested with regards
   to sampling effort, species niche width and biogeography. Location
   Southern Ocean. Methods The impact of sampling effort was tested using
   two sets of data: one set with all presence-only data available until
   2005, and a second set using all data available until 2015 including
   recent records from campaigns carried out during the Census of Antarctic
   Marine Life (CAML) and the International Polar Year (IPY) period
   (2005-2010). The accuracy of SDMs was tested using a ground-truthing
   approach by comparing recent presence/absence data collected during the
   CAML and IPY period to pre-CAML model predictions. Results Our results
   show the significance of the SDM approach and the role of abiotic
   factors as important drivers of species distribution at broad spatial
   scale. The addition of recent data to the models significantly improved
   the prediction of SDM and changed the respective contributions of
   environmental predictors. However, the intensity of change varied
   between models depending on sampling tools, species ecological niche
   width and biogeographic barriers to dispersal. Main conclusions We
   highlight the need for new data and the significance of the
   ground-truthing approach to test the accuracy of SDMs. We show the
   importance of data collected through international initiatives, such as
   the CAML and IPY to the improvement of species distribution modelling at
   broad spatial scales. Finally, we discussed the relevance of SDM as a
   relevant marine conservation tool particularly in the context of climate
   change and the definition of Marine Protected Areas.},

Abstract = {Lagoon-barrier systems are a dynamic coastal environment. When an
   ephemeral connection between a lagoon and the ocean develops, it has
   significant impact on hydrology, sedimentology and ecology.
   Increasingly, human actions and sea level rise also influence lagoons
   with the potential to increase their connectivity with the ocean. The
   Muni-Pomadze lagoon in central Ghana is a small lagoon-barrier system
   that is intermittently open to the ocean. Following opening in 2014 the
   lagoon was open to the ocean for more than two years. Causes for the
   unusually long period of lagoon opening are unclear although human
   intrevention has played a role. Field observation, digital mapping and
   GIS analysis of the shoreline during the two year period of lagoon
   opening has enabled an understanding of how the lagoon-ocean connection
   has impacted coastal morphology, erosion and sedimentation. Opening has
   resulted in rapid changes to the location of the barrier breaching
   (tidal inlet), erosion on the barrier and sedimentation in the lagoon.
   Such modifications have implications for local resources and ecosystem
   services that underpin the livelihood and wellbeing of local
   communities. Elucidating how a connection to the ocean impacts lagoons
   and the coastal communities they support are important to managing
   lagoons not only in Ghana but across West Africa.},

Abstract = {Oleaginous photosynthetic organisms such as microalgae are promising
   sources for biofuel production through the generation of carbon-neutral
   sustainable energy. However, the metabolic mechanisms driving high-rate
   lipid production in these oleaginous organisms remain unclear, thus
   impeding efforts to improve productivity through genetic modifications.
   We analyzed the genome and transcriptome of the oleaginous diatom
   Fistulifera solaris JPCC DA0580. Next-generation sequencing technology
   provided evidence of an allodiploid genome structure, suggesting
   unorthodox molecular evolutionary and genetic regulatory systems for
   reinforcing metabolic efficiencies. Although major metabolic pathways
   were shared with nonoleaginous diatoms, transcriptome analysis revealed
   unique expression patterns, such as concomitant upregulation of fatty
   acid/triacylglycerol biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation
   (beta-oxidation) in concert with ATP production. This peculiar pattern
   of gene expression may account for the simultaneous growth and oil
   accumulation phenotype and may inspire novel biofuel production
   technology based on this oleaginous microalga.},

Abstract = {Gas chimneys are geological features that are associated with seal
   bypass systems. Knowledge of the capacity of the seal is important for
   the evaluation of the petroleum systems and Carbon Capture and Storage
   (CCS) studies. The seal is breached when the capillary pressure
   threshold is exceeded by the underlying buoyancy pressure. The chaotic
   seismic character that is generally associated with the gas chimneys has
   been studied previously to evaluate the origin and geometry of the
   chimneys. Seismic attributes have also been used to determine the
   character of the gas chimneys and the potential association of
   hydrocarbon fields. However, it is important to evaluate the sealing
   potential of the cap rock in the vicinity of the gas chimney. This paper
   demonstrates that the chimney can be used as a calibration point and,
   with the use of seismic attributes, variations of sealing capacity can
   be evaluated. Out of many existing seismic attributes, understanding the
   shale structure is crucial to narrow the search criteria for the right
   class of attributes. Using the most useful stream of seismic attributes,
   the average sealing potential of the Lakes Entrance Formation is
   estimated. The sealing capacity map across the field is then shown to
   help evaluate the prospectivity of the area of study and may upgrade
   subsequent play fairway maps. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The Arctic Ocean is a fundamental node in the global hydrological cycle
   and the ocean's thermohaline circulation. We here assess the system's
   key functions and processes: (1) the delivery of fresh and low-salinity
   waters to the Arctic Ocean by river inflow, net precipitation,
   distillation during the freeze/thaw cycle, and Pacific Ocean inflows;
   (2) the disposition (e.g., sources, pathways, and storage) of freshwater
   components within the Arctic Ocean; and (3) the release and export of
   freshwater components into the bordering convective domains of the North
   Atlantic. We then examine physical, chemical, or biological processes
   which are influenced or constrained by the local quantities and
   geochemical qualities of freshwater; these include stratification and
   vertical mixing, ocean heat flux, nutrient supply, primary production,
   ocean acidification, and biogeochemical cycling. Internal to the Arctic
   the joint effects of sea ice decline and hydrological cycle
   intensification have strengthened coupling between the ocean and the
   atmosphere (e.g., wind and ice drift stresses, solar radiation, and heat
   and moisture exchange), the bordering drainage basins (e.g., river
   discharge, sediment transport, and erosion), and terrestrial ecosystems
   (e.g., Arctic greening, dissolved and particulate carbon loading, and
   altered phenology of biotic components). External to the Arctic
   freshwater export acts as both a constraint to and a necessary
   ingredient for deep convection in the bordering subarctic gyres and thus
   affects the global thermohaline circulation. Geochemical fingerprints
   attained within the Arctic Ocean are likewise exported into the
   neighboring subarctic systems and beyond. Finally, we discuss observed
   and modeled functions and changes in this system on seasonal, annual,
   and decadal time scales and discuss mechanisms that link the marine
   system to atmospheric, terrestrial, and cryospheric systems.},

Journal = {BASIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {241-257},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Field, petrographic and fluid inclusion characteristics of sand
   injectites from five outcrop localities and from the subsurface of the
   Tertiary of the south Viking Graben are described. Although the case
   studies are from a wide variety of sedimentological, stratigraphic and
   tectonic settings, and hence their diagenetic evolutions differ
   significantly, it is possible and useful to assign diagenetic events to
   three distinct phases of fluid flow associated with sand injectites in
   sedimentary basins. Firstly, there is fluid flow associated with the
   injection of the fluid-sediment mix during shallow burial. Early
   diagenetic imprints in sand injectites reveal that basinal fluids, which
   may be released during movement along deeper-seated faults, can be
   associated with this process and thus the injection process may reveal
   information on the timing of basin-scale movement of fluids. Secondly,
   following the injection process, basinal fluids continue to migrate
   through uncemented injectites and mix with the ambient meteoric and/or
   marine pore fluids that invade injectites from the overlying and
   surrounding host sediments. Early, often pervasive, carbonate
   cementation is common within sand injectites and rapidly turns sand
   injectites into flow barriers during shallow (< 1 km) burial. If early
   carbonate cementation is not pervasive, fluid inclusions in late quartz
   cement (similar to > 2 km of burial) reveal additional information on
   fluid flow associated with sand injectites during deeper burial. The
   latest phase of fluid flow occurs when sand injectites are reactivated
   as preferential fluid conduits during phases of deformation, when
   well-cemented subvertical sand injectites become sites of focussed
   brittle deformation (fracturing). This study shows that sand injectites
   are a common and volumetrically important type of structural
   heterogeneity in sedimentary basins and that long-lived fluid flow
   associated with sand injectites in very different settings can be
   assessed and compared systematically using a combination of petrography
   and fluid inclusion studies.},

Abstract = {The western Canadian Arctic is identified as an area of potentially
   significant global warming. Thawing permafrost, sea level rise, changing
   sea ice conditions and increased wave activity will result in
   accelerated rates of coastal erosion and thermokarst activity in areas
   of ice-rich permafrost. The Yukon Coastal Plain is widely recognized as
   one of the most ice-rich and thaw-sensitive areas in the Canadian
   Arctic. In particular, Herschel Island displays extensive coastal
   thermokarst. Retrogressive thaw slumps are a common thermokarst landform
   along the Herschel Island coast that have been increasing in both
   frequency and extent have in recent years due to increased thawing of
   massive ground ice and coastal erosion. The volume of sediment and
   ground ice eroded by retrogressive slump activity and the potential
   release of climate change related materials like organic carbon, carbon
   dioxide and methane are largely unknown. The remote setting of Herschel
   Island, and the Arctic in general, make direct observation of this type
   of erosion and the analysis of potential climate feedbacks extremely
   problematic. Remote sensing provides possibly the best solution to this
   problem. This study looks at two retrogressive thaw slumps located on
   the western shore of Herschel Island and using stereophotogrammetric
   methods attempts to (1) develop the first three-dimensional geomorphic
   analysis of this type of landform, and (2) provide an estimation of the
   volume of sediment/ground ice eroded through back wasting thermokarst
   activity. Digital Elevation Models were extracted for the years 1952,
   1970 and 2004 and validated using data collected in the field using
   Kinematic Differential Global Positioning System. Estimates of sediment
   volumes eroded from retrogressive thaw slumps were found to vary
   greatly. In one case the total volume of material lost for the
   1.970-2004 period was approximately 1560000 m(3). The estimated volume
   of sediment alone was 360 000 m(3). The temporal analysis of the DEMs
   suggest that second generation retrogressive thaw slump activity within
   the floor of a large polycyclic retrogressive thaw slump is possible.},

Abstract = {Biotic gas generation from the degradation of organic carbon in marine
   sediments supplies and maintains gas hydrates throughout the world's
   oceans. In nascent, ultraslow-spreading ocean basins, methane generation
   can also be abiotic, occurring during the high-temperature (>200 degrees
   C) serpentinization of ultramafic rocks. Here, we report on the
   evolution of a growing Arctic gas-and gas hydrate-charged sediment drift
   on oceanic crust in eastern Fram Strait, a tectonically controlled,
   deep-water gateway between the subpolar North Atlantic and Arctic
   Oceans. Ultraslow-spreading ridges between northwest Svalbard and
   northeast Greenland permit the sustained interaction of a mid-ocean
   ridge transform fault and developing sediment drift, on both young (<10
   Ma) and old (>10 Ma) oceanic crust, since the late Miocene. Geophysical
   data image the gas-charged drift and crustal structure and constrain the
   timing of a major 30 km lateral displacement of the drift across the
   Molloy transform fault. We describe the buildup of a 2 m.y., long-lived
   gas hydrate-and free gas-charged drift system on young oceanic crust
   that may be fed and maintained by a dominantly abiotic methane source.
   Ultraslow-spreading, sedimented ridge flanks represent a previously
   unrecognized carbon reservoir for abiotic methane that could supply and
   maintain deep-water methane hydrate systems throughout the Arctic.},

Abstract = {Early Triassic carbonate ramp sediments of the lower part of the Elika
   Formation are known as Vermicular limestone. In the Moro Mountain,
   northwest Iran, the Vermicular limestone includes bioturbated dolomitic
   mudstone, bioclastic packstone and grainstone, algal calcirudite and
   intraclastic grainstone. These sediments accumulated in their lower part
   in open marine subtidal and shoal environments, changing upward to
   lagoonal and intertidal environments. Heavily bioturbated gray mudstone
   formed under quiet water conditions in lagoon and lower intertidal
   environments. Storm processes and high salinity indicative of an arid
   environment influenced the activities and distribution of euryhaline
   and/or opportunistic trace-makers. The low biodiversity of the
   trace-maker community is reflected by the low ichno-diversity, the sole
   trace fossil being abundant Planolites.},

   China: Structure, age and distribution},
Journal = {FACIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {83-89},
Abstract = {A carbonate crust, with a principally digitate structure, caps latest
   Permian reef complexes in east Sichuan, China. The crust contains the
   conodont Hindeodus parvus, confirming its age as earliest Triassic; it
   therefore closely postdates the end-Permian mass extinction, and is
   related to associated palaeoenvironmental change. Although its branches
   have lobate margins, and internal structures of radial fabrics and
   lobate fabrics in different specimens, an organic origin cannot be
   confirmed, because crust fabric is largely recrystallised. Therefore we
   apply the term ?microbialite to reflect uncertainty of its nature. The
   crust is co-eval (within the parvus Zone) with confirmed microbial
   biostromes and mounds in Guizhou Province, south of Sichuan. The sum of
   evidence, assembled by workers in several sites worldwide, indicates a
   sea-level rise occurred in the boundary interval, and this is
   corroborated by facies of the Sichuan crust. Abrupt appearance and
   disappearance of the crust, formed by precipitated carbonates, in east
   Sichuan, represents short-lived unusual post-extinction marine
   conditions which were switched abruptly on, then off. Microbial deposits
   overlying the P/T boundary in other locations in the Tethys Ocean (Iran
   and Japan) support the view that the unusual oceanic conditons had at
   least a regional distribution. Because the crust abruptly terminates,
   and is not succeeded by fossil-rich deposits, application of the
   disaster biota concept is inappropriate; an environmentally-driven
   control on carbonate precipitation is better supported by the evidence,
   whether or not it was biotically-mediated.},

Abstract = {To decrease the need for fossil fuels, the alternative energy resources
   must be not only economically viable but also sustainable in the long
   term. One of the most promising alternatives is the marine renewable
   energy resource. The relatively young marine energy industry is
   presented with two challenges: first, to deliver a continuous reliable
   power supply, and second, to minimize potentially harmful effects of the
   power extraction on the marine environment. The requirement to
   understand the interactions between a tidal turbine and the surrounding
   flow environment motivated this work. A tidal turbine mounted on the
   seabed induces a wake that extends far downstream of the device. As the
   direction of tidal flow changes, so does the position of the wake with
   respect to the device. The detailed study of the turbine wake has been
   conducted by means of computer simulations. An existing finite-volume
   computer model called the vorticity transport model has been modified to
   suit the purpose of simulating the wake of a horizontal axis tidal
   turbine subjected to a nonuniform flow typical of that close to the
   seabed. High-resolution computer simulations suggest that a progressive
   fragmentation of the vortical structure occurs during the development of
   the wake of a tidal turbine. The predicted fragmentation generates
   small-scale unsteady flow phenomena beyond five rotor diameters
   downstream of the device in the area previously thought unaffected by
   the presence of a tidal turbine. The effects of nonuniform flow on the
   vorticity structure downstream of a tidal turbine and the fragmentation
   process are analyzed in this work.},

Abstract = {One of the main challenges for full-waveform inversion (FWI) is taking
   into account both anisotropy and elasticity. Here, we perform elastic
   FWI for a synthetic 2D VTI (transversely isotropic with a vertical
   symmetry axis) model based on the geologic section at Valhall field in
   the North Sea. Multicomponent surface data are generated by a
   finite-difference code. We apply FWI in the time domain using a
   multiscale approach with three frequency bands. An approximate inverse
   Hessian matrix, computed using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, is employed to
   scale the gradients of the objective function and improve the
   convergence. In the absence of significant diving-wave energy in the
   deeper part of the section, the model is updated primarily with
   reflection data. An oblique displacement source, which excites
   sufficiently intensive shear waves in the conventional offset range,
   helps provide more accurate updates in the Shear-wave vertical velocity,
   especially in the shallow layers. We test three model parameterizations,
   which exhibit different radiation patterns and, therefore, create
   different parameter trade-offs. Whereas most examples are for a
   constant-density model, we also generate a density field using Gardner's
   relationship and invert for the density along with the velocity
   parameters. The parameterizations that combine velocities and anisotropy
   coefficients generally yield superior results to the one that includes
   only velocities, provided that a reasonably accurate initial model is
   available.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this work were to study the volatile chemical
   composition of essential oil (EO) from Piper marginatun Jacq
   (Piperaceae), obtained from plants collected in two Colombian geographic
   locations: municipalities Acandi (Choci) and Turbaco (Bolivar). Also,
   evaluate their antioxidant, repellent and antifeedant properties. EOs
   were isolated by hydrodistillation technique and identified by gas
   chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometric detector (GC-MS). The
   major compounds found in P. marginatum collected in Acandi were
   cis-p-anethole (46.3\%), estragole (28.9\%), safrole (9.0\%), while in
   P. marginatum from Turbaco were germacrene D (36.6\%), beta-elemene
   (12.6\%), germacren-D-4-ol (5.4\%). The antioxidant activity of the EOs
   were determined using the method of DPPH radical. The percentages of
   inhibition of DPPH. of P marginatum from Turbaco and Acandi were 90.0\%
   and 73.7\%, respectively. The EO from Turbaco had the highest repellent
   activity against Tribolium castaneum, at a concentration of 0.1 uL /cm2
   at 2 and 4 hours of exposure (85\% and 76\% respectively). P. marginatum
   from Turbaco was more active against Spodoptera littoralis larvae
   (Percent feeding inhibition, FI= 80.6\%) and a high Percent settling
   inhibition of Myzus persicae and Rhopalosiphum padi (SI = 87.9\% and 86,

Title = {Influence of mangrove forests on subjective and psychological wellbeing
   of coastal communities: Case studies in Malaysia and Indonesia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests possess multiple functions for the environment and
   society through their valuable ecosystem services. Along with this, the
   mangrove forests have large and diverse social values, in combination
   contributing to the health and wellbeing of the surrounding communities.
   This study aims (i) to assess the benefits of mangrove forests and their
   impact on subjective and psychological wellbeing of coastal communities
   and (ii) to understand the challenges coastal communities face that
   limit sustainable wellbeing. We have used a mixed methodological
   approach, combining workshop, interview, and survey, to obtain
   qualitative and quantitative information from two coastal communities in
   Malaysia and Indonesia. For quantitative data, 67 participants from both
   coastal communities participated using a pre-tested structured
   questionnaire. To obtain opinions from key informants in Malaysia and
   Indonesia, we organized two stakeholders' workshops and community
   interviews. When merging these interviews and workshops, we identified
   the following three themes related to the perception of mangrove forest
   benefits: (1) the advantage of living in a natural countryside; (2) the
   natural resources supporting employment, income, and family security;
   and (3) the increase in subjective and psychological wellbeing. The mean
   score of wellbeing for Indonesian participants (28.6) was slightly
   higher than that for Malaysian participants (26.2) and was significant.
   Overall, the respondents felt happy because the combination of job
   security and leisure activities supports feeling content and satisfied.
   The analyses also suggest that the combination of exposure to coastal
   environments and stress reduction promotes good mental health; however,
   diagnostic health data are lacking. The lower score of mental wellbeing
   in Malaysia is attributed to respondents involved in risky fishing
   activities and local regions with excessive tourism. The findings from
   this study imply that coastal mangrove forest management plays an
   important role in the living conditions of coastal communities and their
   subjective and psychological wellbeing. Hence, restoration and
   sustainability of mangrove ecosystem are important.},

Title = {Performance increase of membrane distillation pilot scale modules
   operating in vacuum-enhanced air-gap configuration},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {475},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents the first experimental evaluation at pilot scale of
   the operation of vacuum-enhanced air-gap membrane distillation (V-AGMD)
   using two commercial spiral-wound modules at Plataforma Solar de
   Almeria's solar desalination test facilities. The main difference
   between the modules was the channel length (1.5 and 2.7 m) as a result
   of having different membrane surface area (7.2 m(2) and 25.9 m(2)
   respectively) and different number of envelopes. Suction of air from the
   gap improved the vapour transfer through the membrane pores and the
   performance of the modules was significantly increased in relation to
   common air-gap (AGMD) operational mode, especially in the treatment of
   high salinity feeds. Increases of up to 234\% in permeate flux and
   decreases of 68\% in specific thermal energy consumption were measured.
   Depending on the channel length of the modules, the effect of vacuum led
   to extreme permeate productivity (8.7 l h(-1) m(-2)) in the shortest, or
   to extreme energy efficiency (49 kWh(th) m(-3), equivalent to a GOR of
   13.5) in the longest. These are the best experimental performances
   obtained so far with pilot scale modules in membrane distillation.},

Title = {Ecological Implications of Extreme Events: Footprints of the 2010
   Earthquake along the Chilean Coast},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {Deciphering ecological effects of major catastrophic events such as
   earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, storms and fires, requires
   rapid interdisciplinary efforts often hampered by a lack of pre-event
   data. Using results of intertidal surveys conducted shortly before and
   immediately after Chile's 2010 M-w 8.8 earthquake along the entire
   rupture zone (ca. 34-38 degrees S), we provide the first quantification
   of earthquake and tsunami effects on sandy beach ecosystems. Our study
   incorporated anthropogenic coastal development as a key design factor.
   Ecological responses of beach ecosystems were strongly affected by the
   magnitude of land-level change. Subsidence along the northern rupture
   segment combined with tsunami-associated disturbance and drowned
   beaches. In contrast, along the co-seismically uplifted southern
   rupture, beaches widened and flattened increasing habitat availability.
   Post-event changes in abundance and distribution of mobile intertidal
   invertebrates were not uniform, varying with land-level change, tsunami
   height and coastal development. On beaches where subsidence occurred,
   intertidal zones and their associated species disappeared. On some
   beaches, uplift of rocky subtidal substrate eliminated low intertidal
   sand beach habitat for ecologically important species. On others,
   unexpected interactions of uplift with man-made coastal armouring
   included restoration of upper and mid-intertidal habitat seaward of
   armouring followed by rapid colonization of mobile crustaceans typical
   of these zones formerly excluded by constraints imposed by the armouring
   structures. Responses of coastal ecosystems to major earthquakes appear
   to vary strongly with land-level change, the mobility of the biota and
   shore type. Our results show that interactions of extreme events with
   human-altered shorelines can produce surprising ecological outcomes, and
   suggest these complex responses to landscape alteration can leave
   lasting footprints in coastal ecosystems.},

Title = {High survivorship after catch-and-release fishing suggests physiological
   resilience in the endothermic shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus)},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {The shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) is a species commonly
   targeted by commercial and recreational anglers in many parts of the
   developed world. In Australia, the species is targeted by recreational
   anglers only, under the assumption that most of the sharks are released
   and populations remain minimally impacted. If released sharks do not
   survive, the current management strategy will need to be revised.
   Shortfin mako sharks are commonly subjected to lengthy angling events;
   however, their endothermic physiology may provide an advantage over
   ectothermic fishes when recovering from exercise. This study assessed
   the post-release survival of recreationally caught shortfin mako sharks
   using Survivorship Pop-up Archival Transmitting (sPAT) tags and examined
   physiological indicators of capture stress from blood samples as well as
   any injuries that may be caused by hook selection. Survival estimates
   were based on 30 shortfin mako sharks captured off the southeastern
   coast of Australia. Three mortalities were observed over the duration of
   the study, yielding an overall survival rate of 90\%. All mortalities
   occurred in sharks angled for < 30 min. Sharks experienced increasing
   plasma lactate with longer fight times and higher sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs), increased plasma glucose at higher SSTs and
   depressed expression of heat shock protein 70 and beta-hydroxybutyrate
   at higher SSTs. Long fight times did not impact survival. Circle hooks
   significantly reduced foul hooking when compared with J hooks. Under the
   conditions of this study, we found that physical injury associated with
   hook choice is likely to have contributed to an increased likelihood of
   mortality, whereas the high aerobic scope associated with the species'
   endothermy probably enabled it to cope with long fight times and the
   associated physiological responses to capture.},

Abstract = {Using concentrated sunlight for photovoltaic energy conversion has long
   been identified as a way to make cost intensive solar cell materials and
   devices more cost effective. The recently proposed micro-concentrator
   approach for Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 brings concentrator photovoltaics from the
   centimeter and millimeter scale down to the micrometer scale, with the
   goal of reducing the amount of critical raw materials. We show here that
   the micro concentrator, approach has large benefits in terms of the heat
   dissipation and that heat management on the micro-scale allows the use
   of concentration factors as high as 1000 x without any special cooling
   efforts. Specifically, we show that line-shaped micro-concentrator solar
   cells need to be either smaller than 50 pm wide, or be used at low
   concentration factors below 100 x. In contrast, island-shaped
   micro-concentrator solar cells show improved efficiencies at cell sizes
   of (100 mu m)(2) and concentration factors up to 1000 x. Additionally,
   we consider different materials for the substrate and the lens array for
   light `concentration in view of their heat management capacities. The
   results presented here provide design guidelines for the further
   development of thin film micro-concentrator solar cells, applicable to a
   variety of materials systems, e.g. Cu(In,Ga)Se-2, CdTe, or metal halide
   perovskite solar cells.},

Abstract = {Sediment samples were collected with streamer traps at different
   elevations in the water column and across the surf zone. Beach profiles
   and breaking waves were measured together with the sediment sampling.
   The experiments were conducted on beaches with various sediment
   composition ranging from well-sorted fine sand to poorly sorted gravel
   and shell debris. The cross shore variation of sediment mean grain size
   ranged from less than 1 phi to significant variation of up to 3.5 phi.
   The resultant database contains 99 vertical grain-size profiles,
   composed of 99 bottom samples and 552 trap samples taken throughout the
   water column and at 29 different locations along the southeast coast of
   the United States and the Gulf coast of Florida.
   A homogeneous vertical profile of mean grain size and grain-size
   distribution pattern was found on most of the beaches with a wide range
   of sediment sizes, The homogeneous vertical profile, representing 92\%
   of the measurements, was found on all morphological features: swash
   zone, breaker line, mid-surf zone, trough, and bar. A homogeneous
   distribution indicates that the vertical mixing mechanism in the water
   column of the surf zone is independent of sediment size ranging from
   fine sand to fine pebbles, Bottom sediment, represented by an 8-cm core
   sample, was generally coarser than the sediment trapped in the water
   column.},

   ecosystems (IEs) are linked closely to each other by the dispersal and
   circulation of nutrients and organic matter and the movement of
   organisms, and form a coastal ecosystem complex (CEC). The CEC is
   understood as a unit of structure and function of coastal seas. It is
   characterized by a high degree of species diversity and it plays a large
   role in fishery and aquaculture production, as it provides important
   marine services for humans. This special volume compiles recent
   ecological studies of target species and IEs, to facilitate the
   conservation of coastal seas and the sustainability and production of
   their fisheries and aquaculture based on our understanding of the
   structure and function of the CEC in these environments.},

   must be considered also.  Future changes in offshore engineering
   including mechanical engineering aspects will probably reflect the
   recurring challenges of improved safety and cost reduction, as much as
   those of inadequacies in current performance and of gaps in present
   capabilities.  Brief reference is made to some other exploited and

Abstract = {In the evaluation of performance of numerical models, static stability
   has gained less interest and attention than many other atmospheric
   parameters. Nevertheless, this parameter may in fact have rather large
   implications as it controls such features as gravity waves and
   turbulence. In this paper, a closer look has been taken at the behavior
   of static stability in a 3 km gridded numerical downscaling of the
   ERA-Interim reanalysis. The simulation performed with the Weather
   Research and Forecasting model has been nudged towards large scale
   analysis (spectral nudging) and satellite-derived ocean surface winds
   (Quick Scatterometer). The validation of low-level static stability was
   conducted in the North Sea using data from the FINO1 mast for year 2008,
   and a deeper part of the atmosphere was validated using the Ekofisk oil
   platform radiosonde data for years 2007-2010. The offshore mast
   comparison shows that the model over-predicts the number of unstable
   cases and that the unstable cases are not unstable enough. The model
   simulated a clear dependency between vertical wind shear and static
   stability; however, this was not the case in the observations. The model
   produced too few events with weak turbulence, but rather put the
   emphasis on intermediate turbulent intensities. With the radiosonde data
   measuring the static stability over a deeper part of the atmosphere,
   similar results as for lower levels showed. In addition, the temperature
   gradient across the inversion at the boundary layer top was too shallow
   in the model, potentially letting too much wave energy escape the
   boundary layer. (c) 2015 The Authors Wind Energy Published by John Wiley

Title = {Influence of the surface-termination of hexagonal SiC(0001) on the
   temperature dependences of Ge growth modes and desorption},
Journal = {SURFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {546},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {With the aim of comparing initial Ge adsorption and desorption modes on
   different surface terminations of 4H-SiC(0 0 0 1) faces, 3 x 3, root3 x
   root3R30degrees (R3) and 6root3 x 6root3R30degrees (6R3)
   reconstructions, of decreasing Si surface richness, have been prepared
   by standard surface preparation procedures. They are controlled by
   reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED), low energy electron
   diffraction and photoemission. One monolayer of Ge has been deposited
   similarly at room temperature on each of these three surfaces, followed
   by the same set of isochronal heatings at increasing temperatures up to
   complete Ge desorption. At each step of heating, the structural and
   chemical status of the Ge ad-layer has been probed. Marked differences
   between the Si- (3 x 3 and R3) and C-rich (6R3) terminations have been
   obtained. Ge wetting layers are only obtained up to 400 degreesC on 3 x
   3 and R3 surfaces in the form of a 4 x 4 reconstruction. The wetting is
   more complete on the R3 surface, whose atomic structure is the closest
   to an ideally Si-terminated 1 x 1 SiC surface. At higher temperatures,
   the wetting layer stage transicts in Ge polycrystallites followed by the
   unexpected appearance on the 3 x 3 surface of a more ordered Si island
   structure. It denotes a Si clustering of the initial Si 3 x 3 excess,
   induced by the presence of Ge. A phase separation mechanism between Si
   and Ge prevails therefore over alloying by Ge supply onto a such
   Si-terminated 3 x 3 surface. Conversely, no wetting is obtained on the
   6R3 surface and island formation of exclusively pure Ge takes place
   already at low temperature. These islands exhibit a better epitaxial
   relationship characterized by Ge(1 1 1)//SiC(0 0 0 1) and Ge(1 1
   -2)//SiC(1 - 1 0 0), ascertained by a clear RHEED spot pattern. The
   absence of any Ge-C bond signature in the X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy Ge core lines indicates a dominant island nucleation on
   heterogeneous regions of the surface denuded by the 6R3 graphite
   pavings. Owing to the used annealing cycles, the deposited Ge amount
   desorbs on the three surfaces at differentiated temperatures ranging
   from 950 to 1200 degreesC. These differences probably reflect the
   varying morphologies formed at lower temperature on the different
   surfaces. Considering all these results, the use of imperfect 6R3
   surfaces appears to be suited to promote the formation of pure and
   coherent Ge islands on SiC. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {30},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Salt marshes are a type of coastal wetland that are affected by dynamic
   coastal processes. Ice blocks and wrack (mats of plant debris) regularly
   float onto northern marshes and become stranded, affecting vegetation
   and soil accretion. There is little research regarding the capacity of
   ice and wrack to transport viable plant propagules onto marshes where
   they can colonize, which may be particularly important at barren new
   salt marsh restoration sites. Contributions of sediment by ice may also
   be important to raise the marsh platform to elevations appropriate for
   plant colonization. We collected ice (n = 27) and wrack (n = 18) samples
   at marshes in the Bay of Fundy, ran germination trials with the
   contents, and measured the quantity of sediment in the ice. We found
   viable propagules from halophytic and non-halophytic species in wrack,
   and viable propagules of Sporobolus pumilus in ice. Additionally, we
   found sediment densities between 0.01 and 4.75 g/cm(3) in ice blocks
   that translated to 26.61-21,483.59 kg of total sediment per block,
   representing a large source of sediment. We found that the number of
   germinating propagules could not be predicted by wrack size, and that
   pH, sediment density, sediment weight in ice blocks were variable across
   the marsh surface, while ice salinity was negatively correlated with
   elevation and distance from creek. Our results indicate that ice and
   wrack represent a potential source for vegetation colonization at salt
   marsh sites and highlights their contributions to facilitating
   vegetation colonization through building marsh soils.},

Title = {Effective radiative forcing from historical land use change},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3489-3505},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The effective radiative forcing (ERF) from the biogeophysical effects of
   historical land use change is quantified using the atmospheric component
   of the Met Office Hadley Centre Earth System model HadGEM2-ES. The
   global ERF at 2005 relative to 1860 (1700) is -0.4 (-0.5) Wm(-2), making
   it the fourth most important anthropogenic driver of climate change over
   the historical period (1860-2005) in this model and larger than most
   other published values. The land use ERF is found to be dominated by
   increases in the land surface albedo, particularly in North America and
   Eurasia, and occurs most strongly in the northern hemisphere winter and
   spring when the effect of unmasking underlying snow, as well as
   increasing the amount of snow, is at its largest. Increased bare soil
   fraction enhances the seasonal cycle of atmospheric dust and further
   enhances the ERF. Clouds are shown to substantially mask the radiative
   effect of changes in the underlying surface albedo. Coupled
   atmosphere-ocean simulations forced only with time-varying historical
   land use change shows substantial global cooling (dT = -0.35 K by 2005)
   and the climate resistance (ERF/dT = 1.2 Wm(-2) K-1) is consistent with
   the response of the model to increases in CO2 alone. The regional
   variation in land surface temperature change, in both fixed-SST and
   coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations, is found to be well correlated
   with the spatial pattern of the forced change in surface albedo. The
   forcing-response concept is found to work well for historical land use
   forcing-at least in our model and when the forcing is quantified by ERF.
   Our results suggest that land-use changes over the past century may
   represent a more important driver of historical climate change then
   previously recognised and an underappreciated source of uncertainty in
   global forcings and temperature trends over the historical period.},

Title = {Effects of land use on stream metabolism and organic matter turnover},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1359-1376},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We measured ecosystem metabolism and organic matter transport seasonally
   in five streams draining catchments dominated by native forest, exotic
   pine plantation, grazed tussock grassland, or developed pasture. All
   streams are tributaries of the Taieri River in southeastern New Zealand.
   Whole-stream metabolism was estimated by both two-station and
   single-station open-channel methods, allowing comparison between these
   techniques. Transfer of oxygen across the stream surface was estimated
   using reaeration coefficients determined from three different
   procedures: tracer gas injections (propane), analysis of the oxygen
   record, and empirical velocity-depth equations. Measurements of gross
   primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR) showed
   differences among streams that reflected method rather than ecosystem
   process. The ratio of GPP:CR and net ecosystem metabolism, however,
   showed strong concordance among methods, suggesting that bias involved
   in standardizing estimates to areal units may be more important than
   differences among methods. The two-station approach appeared to cope
   more adequately with steep slope, high bed roughness, and low GPP than
   did the single-station method. However, in tranquil and productive
   streams, both methods worked well. When differences between methods were
   accounted for, results emphasized how differences in terrestrial
   landscapes may markedly affect ecosystem processes within streams.
   Shading by the heavy canopy at the native forest site, turbidity at the
   pasture site, and the valley walls at one of the tussock grassland sites
   appeared to limit GPP. CR was high in the native forest site, due to a
   large supply of organic material from the riparian zone. Concentrations
   of seston were highest at the developed pasture site, apparently a
   result of intensive grazing and associated bank failure. The organic
   content of seston was highest in the native forest site and lowest in
   the pasture site. Organic carbon spiraling length in the pasture site
   was longer than average for a stream of its size, whereas spiraling
   length in the native forest site was short when compared to
   similar-sized streams elsewhere. Changes in catchment land use and
   riparian vegetation, as well as reach-specific geomorphic factors, alter
   light availability and organic matter supply, which are fundamental
   factors controlling organic matter production, respiration, and
   transport in streams.},

Abstract = {Soils in permafrost regions contain twice as much carbon as the
   atmosphere, and permafrost has an important influence on the natural and
   built environment at high northern latitudes. The response of permafrost
   to warming climate is uncertain and occurs on time scales longer than
   those assessed by direct observation. We dated periods of speleothem
   growth in a north-south transect of caves in Siberia to reconstruct the
   history of permafrost in past climate states. Speleothem growth is
   restricted to full interglacial conditions in all studied caves. In the
   northernmost cave (at 60 degrees N), no growth has occurred since Marine
   Isotopic Stage (MIS) 11. Growth at that time indicates that global
   climates only slightly warmer than today are sufficient to thaw
   extensive regions of permafrost.},

Abstract = {Coastal monitoring has become reliant upon automated sensors for data
   acquisition. Such a technical commitment comes with a cost;
   particularly, the generation of large, high-dimensional data streams
   ('Big Data') that personnel must search through to identify data
   structures. Nature-inspired computation, inclusive of artificial neural
   networks (ANNs), affords the unearthing of complex, recurring patterns
   within sizable data volumes. In 2009, select meteorological and
   hydrological data were acquired via autonomous instruments in Sarasota
   Bay, Florida (USA). ANNs estimated continuous chlorophyll (CHL) a
   concentrations from abiotic predictors, with correlations between
   measured:modeled concentrations >0.90 and model efficiencies ranging
   from 0.80 to 0.90. Salinity and water temperature were the principal
   influences for modeled CHL within the Bay; concentrations steadily
   increased at temperatures >28 degrees C and were greatest at salinities
   <36 (maximizing at ca. 35.3). Categorical ANNs modeled CHL classes of
   6.1 and 11 mu g CHL L-1 (representative of local and state-imposed
   constraint thresholds, respectively), with an accuracy of ca. 83\% and
   class precision ranging from 0.79 to 0.91. The occurrence likelihood of
   concentrations > 6.1 mu g CHL L-1 maximized at a salinity of ca. 36.3
   and a temperature of ca. 29.5 degrees C. A 10th-order Chebyshev
   bivariate polynomial equation was fit (adj. r(2) = 0.99, p < 0.001) to a
   three-dimensional response surface portraying modeled CHL
   concentrations, conditional to the temperature-salinity interaction. The
   TREPAN algorithm queried a continuous ANN to extract a decision tree for
   delineation of CHL classes; turbidity, temperature, and salinity (and to
   lesser degrees, wind speed, wind/current direction, irradiance, and
   urea-nitrogen) were key variables for quantitative rules in tree
   formalisms. Taken together, computations enabled knowledge provision for
   and quantifiable representations of the non-linear relationships between
   environmental variables and CHL a. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {We report a novel technique for the fabrication of planar-type Ni-based
   single-electron transistors (SETs) using electromigration method induced
   by field emission current. The method is so-called ``activation{''} and
   is demonstrated using arrow-shaped Ni nanogap electrodes with initial
   gap separations of 21-68 nm. Using the activation method, we are easily
   able to obtain the SETs by Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) field emission current
   passing through the nanogap electrodes. The F-N field emission current
   plays an important role in triggering the migration of Ni atoms. The
   nanogap is narrowed because of the transfer of Ni atoms from source to
   drain electrode. In the activation procedure, we defined the magnitude
   of a preset current Is and monitored the current / between the nanogap
   electrodes by applying voltage V. When the current / reached a preset
   current Is, we stopped the voltage V. As a result, the tunnel resistance
   of the nanogaps was decreased from the order of 100 T Omega to 100 k
   Omega with increasing the preset current Is from 1 nA to 150 mu A.
   Especially, the devices formed by the activation with the preset current
   from 100 nA to 1.5 mu A exhibited Coulomb blockade phenomena at room
   temperature. Coulomb blockade voltage of the devices was clearly
   modulated by the gate voltage quasi-periodically, resulting in the
   formation of multiple tunnel junctions of the SETs at room temperature.
   By increasing the preset current from 100 nA to 1.5 mu A in the
   activation scheme, the charging energy of the SETs at room temperature
   was decreased, ranging from 1030 meV to 320 meV. Therefore, it is found
   that the charging energy and the number of islands of the SETs are
   controllable by the preset current during the activation. These results
   clearly imply that the activation procedure allows us to easily and
   simply fabricate planar-type Ni-based SETs operating at room
   temperature.},

Abstract = {Low-temperature excitonic effects in a high-quality AlGaAs/GaAs single
   quantum well (25 monolayers wide) structure grown without growth
   interruptions at the interface were studied using steady-state,
   time-resolved and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Heavy-hole
   free exciton and impurity (neutral donor) bound exciton emissions,
   associated with quantum well regions (islands) 24 and 25 monolayers
   wide, have been resolved and identified using excitation energy resonant
   with the heavy-hole exciton energy. Interisland exciton migration, until
   now reported only for growth interrupted structures, is observed,
   indicating that islands formation is not a specific property of growth
   interrupted structures. We estimate the rate of transfer of free
   excitons between regions of width 24 monolayers and 25 monolayers to be
   290 ps(-1). We show that the relative intensity of free-to-bound
   excitonic emissions strongly depends on interface morphology and that
   enhanced bound exciton recombination is observed under some conditions.
   The relevant mechanisms of such enhanced bound exciton recombination are
   proposed.},

Abstract = {Aim: To investigate the species-specific exposure and distributional
   responses of marine fish and invertebrate taxa to rapidly shifting
   climate in the Pacific Arctic, characterized by warming and cooling
   episodes, over the last 24years.
   Location: Pacific Arctic region, eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea.
   Methods: We examined the variations in the summer (June-July) habitat
   patterns of 21 marine fish and invertebrate taxa in the eastern Bering
   Sea using multimodel ensemble predictions of species distribution
   between 1993 and 2016. Using ensemble model outputs, we examined the
   rates of predicted (biotic velocities) and expected (bioclimatic
   velocities) distribution shifts across taxa under four consecutive time
   periods of distinct climatic regimes. We then compared these
   species-specific velocity metrics to the rates of local climatic shifts
   (climatic velocities) and quantified the potential lags in
   distributional responses relative to changes in climate across taxa and
   transitions.
   Results: Our analyses showed that individual taxa responded to climatic
   fluctuations at different paces and generally exhibited lags in their
   predicted distributional responses. Subarctic species revealed higher
   habitat sensitivity and exposure to climatic changes than Arctic taxa,
   as they expand their habitat ranges into suitable regions emerging in
   the north under warmer conditions. Importantly, the actual rates of
   climate shifts (climatic velocities) were poorly correlated with both
   the expected and observed shifts in species distributions across taxa.
   Main conclusions: Our findings underpin the importance of incorporating
   species-specific climatic sensitivity and exposure to changes in
   climatic conditions when predicting range shift responses and evaluating
   species vulnerability. These insights are critical for conservation and
   management of fisheries resources in the region.},

Abstract = {Several approaches to the containment and treatment of contaminated
   sediment were evaluated, including the efficacy of adding activated
   carbon to sediment as an in-situ stabilization method and the use of
   conventional and innovative treatment caps. The applicability of
   phytoremediation for dredged sediments and sediments in shallow water or
   wetlands was also explored. The effectiveness of any treatment relies on
   successful application in the field and the emphasis herein is on
   evaluation of these approaches in the field. A demonstration at Hunters
   Point, San Francisco Bay, California strives to prove the efficacy of
   activated carbon treatment, and stands as an example for applications
   elsewhere. Simultaneous containment and treatment of sediment
   contaminants is being demonstrated in the Anacostia River, Washington,
   DC using both organic and metal sequestering agents incorporated into a
   cap. Both conventional placement and placement in a laminated mat were
   demonstrated to provide an array of placement approaches. The laminated
   mat allowed placement of thin layers of high value material at specific
   location, enabling the use of high value ``active{''} capping materials
   such as activated carbon and microscale iron. Phyto- and
   rhizoremediation using plants and related bacteria is a promising
   approach for treatment of contaminated sediments, but has its inborn
   limitations. To overcome the slow performance of the process, transgenic
   plants were evaluated that express the bacterial gene responsible for
   cleaving PCBs, or metal binding proteins to provide additional metal
   binding capacity. Continued development of cap and sediment treatments,
   and approaches to assess effectiveness and long-term reliability are
   encouraged.},

Title = {Development of an estuarine assessment scheme for the management of a
   highly urbanised catchment/estuary system, Sydney estuary, Australia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {188},

Abstract = {As coastal populations increase, considerable pressures are exerted on
   estuarine environments. Recently, there has been a trend towards the
   development and use of estuarine assessment schemes as a decision
   support tool in the management of these environments. These schemes
   offer a method by which complex environmental data is converted into a
   readily understandable and communicable format for informed decision
   making and effective distribution of limited management resources.
   Reliability and effectiveness of these schemes are often limited due to
   a complex assessment framework, poor data management and use of
   ineffective environmental indicators. The current scheme aims to improve
   reliability in the reporting of estuarine condition by including a
   concise assessment framework, employing high-value indicators and, in a
   unique approach, employing fuzzy logic in indicator evaluation. Using
   Sydney estuary as a case study, each of the 15 sub-catchment/sub-estuary
   systems were assessed using the current scheme. Results identified that
   poor sediment quality was a significant issue in Blackwattle/Rozelle
   Bay, Iron Cove and Hen and Chicken Bay while poor water quality was of
   particular concern in Duck River, Homebush Bay and the Parramatta River.
   Overall results of the assessment scheme were used to prioritise the
   management of each sub-catchment/sub-estuary assessed with
   Blackwattle/Rozelle Bay, Homebush Bay, Iron Cove and Duck River
   considered to be in need of a high priority management response. A
   report card format, using letter grades, was employed to convey the
   results of the assessment in a readily understood manner to estuarine
   managers and members of the public. Letter grades also provide
   benchmarking and performance monitoring ability, allowing estuarine
   managers to set improvement targets and assesses the effectiveness of
   management strategies. The current assessment scheme provides an
   effective, integrated and consistent assessment of estuarine health and
   provides an effective decision support tool to maximise the efficient
   distribution of limited management resources.},

Title = {Freshwater input and ocean connectivity affect habitats and trophic
   ecology of fishes in Arctic coastal lagoons},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Arctic coastal lagoons are important habitats for unique assemblages of
   diadromous and marine fishes. Many of these fishes are vital to the food
   security of rural and indigenous communities. However, human impacts on
   coastal Arctic habitats, as well as climate change, weaken ecosystem
   resiliency and threaten the sustainability of fish stocks as a component
   of local food security. Identifying how habitat characteristics
   influence fish ecology may allow for predictions of changes in fish
   abundance and availability in response to these threats, and may help
   illuminate strategies for responding to negative impacts. Consequently,
   we endeavored to link habitat characteristics likely to be most-impacted
   by climate change to fish assemblage trophic metrics in four lagoons
   within Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Alaska where subsistence
   fishing commonly occurs. This was done through calculating trophic
   metrics including mean nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13)
   stable isotope values from fish muscle tissue samples collected from the
   study lagoons. Lagoon habitat characteristics were quantified including
   ocean connectivity, freshwater input, and surface area using satellite
   imagery. Finally, associations between fish assemblage trophic metrics
   and habitat characteristics were evaluated using linear regressions, and
   trophic metrics were compared between lagoons with ANOVA and Tukey
   post-hoc tests. Model results showed that increased freshwater input
   resulted in longer duration of lagoon ocean connectivity. Additionally,
   longer duration of ocean connectivity was associated with an increase in
   mean delta N-15 and delta C-13 across all lagoon fish species. Finally,
   there were significant species-specific differences in fish trophic
   metrics among lagoons with varying habitat characteristics. Overall,
   freshwater input and ocean connectivity of coastal Arctic lagoons appear
   to be important drivers of fish trophic ecology, and should be carefully
   monitored in the face of anticipated changes in the region, to conserve
   important subsistence harvest species.},

Title = {Effects of Ascophyllum nodosum extract on Vitis vinifera: Consequences
   on plant physiology, grape quality and secondary metabolism},
Journal = {PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {139},
Pages = {21-32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Seaweed-based extracts have been recently employed as sustainable tools
   to improve abiotic stress tolerance and increase grape quality. However,
   the effect of these extracts on secondary metabolism compounds, that are
   fundamental for grape and wine quality, is still scarce. In the present
   study, the effects of foliar treatments with an Ascophyllum nodosum
   extract on physiological and biochemical parameters of Vitis vinifera
   (cv. Sangiovese) were investigated. We hypothesized an enhancement in
   the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in berry skins and in leaves
   in response to these treatments, effective in improve grape quality and
   help vines to cope with abiotic stresses. Gas exchanges, chlorophyll
   fluorescence and midday stem water potential on leaves treated with A.
   nodosum extract and non-treated control leaves, were monitored over two
   growing seasons at three phenological stages: full veraison, mid
   maturation and full maturation. In addition, anthocyanins, flavonols and
   hy-droxycinnamic acids were quantified both in berry skins and in
   leaves. The foliar treatments with A. nodosum increased photosynthesis
   and stomatal conductance in treated compared to control plants.
   Furthermore, extract treated vines were able to maintain the potential
   efficiency of photosystem II close to the optimal value even during the
   hottest periods. No effect of A. nodosum extract treatments was observed
   on stem water potential. A. nodosum applications delayed berry ripening,
   leading to a lower sugar content and a higher anthocyanin content in
   treated berry skins. Interestingly, treatments also affected the content
   and the partitioning of secondary metabolites in berry skins, as
   anthocyanins and flavonols contents were higher in treated compared to
   control plants, while the ratio of methoxylated to non-methoxylated
   anthocyanins was lower in treated than in control vines. Furthermore, A.
   nodosum extract-treated plants also had higher content of flavonols and
   hydroxycinnamic acids both in berry skins and in leaves and showed a
   reduction in the biosynthesis of methoxylated anthocyanins, which are
   usually accumulated in grapes under environmental constraints.
   Considering the challenges posed by climate change in the Mediterranean
   basin, the use of seaweed extracts might represent a sustainable tool to
   mitigate the increasing severity of drought, often associated to
   heat-waves, on the viticulture sector.},

Title = {Subarctic Cetaceans in the Southern Chukchi Sea Evidence of Recovery or
   Response to a Changing Ecosystem},
Journal = {OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {136-151},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The southern Chukchi Sea is one of the most productive areas in the
   world ocean. Over the past decade, there have been dramatic changes in
   this region in sea ice cover and in Bering Strait inflow, and it is now
   in the path of transpolar shipping and destinational ship traffic,
   including vessels supporting Arctic offshore oil and gas development and
   tourism, all of which are anticipated to increase with decreasing
   seasonal sea ice cover. Little research on cetaceans has been conducted
   in the southern Chukchi Sea, and most information on the occurrence of
   subarctic species (humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, fin whale
   Balaenoptera physalus, minke whale B. acutorostrata, and killer whale
   Orcinus orca) comes from the ships' logs of commercial whalers in the
   mid to late twentieth century and from observers stationed along the
   Chukotka Peninsula. Information on cetacean seasonal occurrence east of
   the International Date Line (IDL) in US waters is particularly scarce.
   To address this information gap, we compiled visual sightings and
   acoustic detections of subarctic cetaceans in the southern Chukchi Sea
   during summer and early autumn from 2009 to 2012. Humpback whales were
   common on both sides of the IDL in August and September. Fin and minke
   whales were widely distributed east of the IDL from July to September,
   and killer whales were seen sporadically but were the most widely
   dispersed of the four species. Comparisons of our results with
   historical records indicate that the incidence of subarctic cetaceans
   may be increasing in the southern Chukchi Sea. An increase in occurrence
   may simply be a post-commercial whaling recovery of whale numbers and
   seasonal range by each species, or it may reflect responses to ongoing
   climate change. Understanding current stock identity, spatial and
   temporal distribution, habitat preference, relative abundance, and
   potential impacts of climate change on these species will require
   cetacean-focused research in this region of the Arctic.},

Abstract = {Unconsolidated sands provide zones of high porosity and permeability
   important for freshwater aquifers, hydrocarbon production, and CO2
   sequestration. An understanding of the acoustics of unconsolidated sands
   enables the characterization of such formations using ultrasonics,
   borehole acoustics, and seismic methods. Inversion of ultrasonic
   compressional and shear velocities measured for unloading as a function
   of confining pressure for room-dry unconsolidated sands allows
   information on the mechanical properties of the grain contacts to be
   obtained using an approach based on the divergence theorem. This allows
   the effective compliance of sand to be written as the sum of the
   compliance of the pores and of the grain contacts, and it does not
   assume that the grains are identical spheres, in contrast to previous
   approaches. Grain contacts are found to be more compliant under shear
   than under normal compression, and the ratio of the normal-to-shear
   compliance decreases with decreasing confining pressure, implying that
   the shear compliance increases faster with decreasing confining pressure
   than the normal compliance. This is of importance in understanding the
   role of shear in the failure of unconsolidated sands, such as occurs in
   shallow water flow, sanding, and failure around injectors, where the
   change in stress is a function of the normal-to-shear compliance ratio
   of the grain contacts.},

Title = {A survey of floral traits, breeding systems, floral visitors, and
   pollination systems of the angiosperms of the Juan Fernandez Islands
   (Chile)},
Journal = {BOTANICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {67},

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {A survey of the reproductive features of the angiosperm flora of the
   Juan Fernandez Archipelago (Chile) is presented to provide a
   species-based review of reproduction and pollination, to identify
   generalizations associated with these systems, to understand the
   evolution of these features, and to utilize these data to promote
   conservation. The collection of original data was extensive, based on
   our own fieldwork, and was combined with data from existing literature.
   Data recorded include habit, sexual system, flower size, shape, and
   color, and the hypothesized pollination system of the first colonizers.
   In addition, the data on compatibility, presence and type of dichogamy,
   observed floral visitors, presence of floral rewards, and currently
   known pollination systems are summarized. Pairwise comparisons of
   different features are tested for statistical association.
   The flora is typically composed of perennials. The majority of the
   species have very small or small flowers. Inconspicuous flowers (i.e., a
   shape character describing flowers with no optical attraction) are
   widespread, as are dish-shaped flowers. Green is the most frequent
   flower color, followed by white and yellow. Most species are
   hermaphroditic, 9\% are dioecious, and 9\% are monoecious. Some 30\% of
   the species are protandrous and 7\% protogynous. Detailed studies of
   compatibility of about 14\% of the flora indicate that 85\% of these
   species are self-compatible (SC). Although most species studied are SC,
   their level of autogamy is low. Nevertheless, selfing mediated via
   geitonogamy is the most frequent mechanism of pollen transfer.
   Outcrossing is mainly achieved through dioecy and self-incompatibility
   (SI), promoted by dichogamy in the hermaphroditic flowers, and
   facilitated by wind pollination. About 55\% of the species offer nectar
   rewards, and only 2\% offer pollen rewards. Floral visitors are rare to
   uncommon: Two hummingbird species, one of them endemic, are considered
   as pollinators for 14 plant species. Flies, moths, and beetles are the
   native insect visitors to flowers, but they have been documented on only
   1 I plant species (7\%). Even insect visits to these few species were
   rarely observed. Given the infrequent, irregular, and imprecise nature
   of native insect association with flowers, there is no certainty that
   any of the species are truly insect pollinated. Two species of
   introduced ants and a new endemic bee were recorded as well; however,
   neither is likely currently important to the pollination of the native
   flora species.
   About 9\% of the extant flora is currently bird pollinated; and we
   hypothesize that 47\% is wind pollinated. However, we propose that most
   of the colonizers were ancestrally either insect or wind pollinated.
   There is association between a number of current floral features and the
   hypothesized pollination of colonizers. Therefore; to a large extent the
   flower color, shape, and size of the extant flora may express the
   pollination syndromes of colonizers rather than representing extant
   pollination. In addition, the presence of nectar in many species of
   extant flora does not necessarily indicate biotic pollination. Thus,
   studies of the reproductive biology on oceanic island plants need to be
   conducted species by species before broad generalizations can be made,
   because the observed features can be misleading.
   Possible changes in the pollination system were assessed by comparison
   of species for which there are reliable data with the hypothesized
   pollination of their colonist progenitors. The wind-or bird-pollinated
   species have retained the pollination system of the colonizers: In other
   instances, species seem to bear a different pollination system: from
   ancestral insect systems to current hummingbird- or wind-pollination
   systems. The lack of alternative means of biotic pollination seems to
   have led in a number of instances to anemophily-in essence a default
   pollination system. The lack of strong selection pressure for wind
   pollination and the relative youth of the archipelago may help explain
   why the features associated with wind pollination in these species are
   not so obvious.
   Because there are many recorded extinctions of vascular plants from
   islands versus those from continental areas, it is imperative to invest
   additional effort in protecting the remaining island species.
   Conservation or restoration programs cannot be effective without a deep
   and broad understanding of the reproductive biology of the plants. In
   order to conserve these plants, programs must involve a combination of
   reproductive and environmental measures. The ultimate fate of some
   species may depend on preserving the plant-hummingbird relationship,
   including the web of organisms that affect both plant and pollinator.
   The populations of introduced animals and weeds must be controlled.
   Experimentally produced allogamous seeds would enhance diversity in
   restoration programs. In addition, the preservation of habitat seems to
   be the central challenge to indirectly protect the unique island
   species.},

Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {7964-7977},
Abstract = {Mapping different types of sea ice that form, grow, and melt in polar
   oceans is essential for shipping navigation, climate change modeling,
   and local community safety. Currently, ice charts are manually generated
   by analysts at the Canadian Ice Service based on dual-polarized
   RADARSAT-2/RADARSAT Constellation Mission imagery on a daily basis.
   Inspired by the demand for a computer-based mapping system, we have
   developed an automatic sea-ice classification method that integrates
   spatial contexture (unsupervised segmentation) with textural features
   (supervised pixel-level labeling). First, the full-scene image is
   oversegmented, and the segments are merged into homogeneous regions
   across the entire scene. Second, pixel-based classifiers (support vector
   machine and random forest) are compared for their ability to label the
   generated homogeneous regions. Finally, the segmentation and labeling
   are combined using a proposed energy function. The proposed method was
   tested on 18 dual-polarization RADARSAT-2 scenes acquired over the
   Beaufort Sea. This dataset contains water, young ice, first-year ice,
   and multiyear ice covering melt, summer, and freeze-up seasons. The
   proposed method obtains an average classification accuracy of 86.33\%
   based on the leave-one-out validation. The experimental results show
   that the proposed method achieves promising classification results in
   both the quantity and quality measurements compared with benchmark
   methods. The robustness against incidence angle variance indicates that
   the proposed method is well qualified for operational sea-ice mapping.},

Title = {Understanding fisheries credit systems: potentials and pitfalls of
   managing catch efficiency},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {453-470},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Following implementation in a range of other resource sectors, a number
   of credit-like systems have been proposed for fisheries. But confusion
   exists over what constitutes these nascent fisheries credit' systems and
   how they operate. Based on a review of credit systems in other sectors,
   this study fills this gap by defining how credit systems function and
   what credits add to prevailing fisheries management. In doing so, we
   distinguish mitigation' and behavioural' fishery credits. Mitigation
   credits require resource users to compensate for unsustainable catches
   of target species, by-catch species or damaging practices on the marine
   environment by investing in conservation in a biologically equivalent
   habitat or resource. Behavioural credit systems incentivize fishers to
   gradually change their fishing behaviour to more sustainable fishing
   methods by rewarding them with, for instance, extra fishing effort to
   compensate for less efficient but more sustainable fishing methods. The
   choice of credit system largely depends on the characteristics of
   specific fisheries and the management goals agreed upon by managers,
   scientists and the fishing industry. The study concludes that fisheries
   credit systems are different but complimentary to other forms of
   management by focusing on catchability' or gear efficiency in addition
   to effort or catch quota, affecting overall economic efficiency by
   setting specific goals as to how fish are caught. Credit systems
   therefore incentivize specific management interventions that can
   directly improve stock sustainability, conserve habitat and endangered
   species, or decrease by-catch.},

   Light Spectral Responses},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Light enhanced calcification (LEC) is a well-documented phenomenon in
   reef-building corals. The main mechanism proposed for LEC is that
   photosynthetic CO2 uptake by the algal symbionts elevates the pH and
   thus enhances calcification. We evaluated the role of light and of
   photosynthesis on calcification by assessing the response of the corals
   Porites lutea and Acropora variabilis to different components of the
   light spectrum. Calcification and photosynthesis of both species
   decreased under ``lagoon{''} blue, green and red light (peaks at 500,
   550, and 600 nm, respectively). However, blue light (peak at 455 nm)
   enhanced calcification rates of P lutea and A. variabilis (up to 4.1-
   and 10.5-fold of dark values, respectively) reaching levels comparable
   to those measured under full spectrum illumination. However, contrary to
   our expectations, photosynthetic oxygen production was considerably
   reduced under blue light, to the extent that it remained below the
   compensation point even under illumination as high as 400 mu mol photons
   m(-2) s(-1). It is the first time that a direct effect of light not
   mediated by the photosynthetic process has been demonstrated to trigger
   LEC in corals. We propose that blue light signaling, and animal
   receptors thereof may be involved in the enhancement of calcification by
   hermatypic corals.},

Title = {Identifying and predicting occurrence and abundance of a vocal animal
   species based on individually specific calls},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers opportunities to collect data
   on the occurrence of vocal species for long periods of time, at multiple
   locations, and under a range of environmental conditions. Some species
   emit individually distinctive calls, including bottlenose dolphins
   (Tursiops truncatus) that produce signature whistles. Our study used PAM
   to determine the seasonal occurrence of bottlenose dolphins and utilized
   individually specific signature whistles to (1) track individuals
   spatially and temporally, (2) assess site fidelity off Maryland (MD),
   USA, (3) estimate the minimum abundance of dolphins in the study area,
   and (4) develop a dynamic habitat-based relative abundance model
   applicable as a real-time dolphin relative abundance prediction tool.
   Acoustic recorders were deployed at two sites offshore of Ocean City,
   MD, and at one site in the upper Chesapeake Bay, MD. Acoustic recordings
   from 2016 to 2018 were analyzed for signature whistles, and
   re-occurrences of individual whistles were identified using a
   combination of machine learning and manual verification. A habitat-based
   density model was created using the number of signature whistles
   combined with environmental conditions. A total of 1518 unique signature
   whistles were identified offshore of Maryland and in the upper
   Chesapeake Bay. There were 184 re-occurrences of 142 whistles, with a
   mean of 135 d between re-occurrences (range = 1-681 d). These repeated
   detections of the same individuals occurred most frequently at the site
   near Ocean City, MD, indicating the highest site fidelity.
   Re-occurrences were recorded among all three sites, indicating movement
   of dolphins between the Chesapeake Bay and off the Atlantic coast of
   Maryland. The weekly number of individual dolphins detected off the
   Atlantic coast was significantly related to two environmental variables:
   sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration. This habitat
   model could be used to predict relative dolphin abundance offshore of
   Maryland and inform management within the region, including in relation
   to offshore wind energy development and other stakeholders.},

Abstract = {This work can be considered a prequel to our previous paper on coral
   bleaching induced by global warming. We once again investigate, using
   Finsler geometry, dynamical energy budget theory and nonlinear modular
   mechanics, the origin of endosymbiosis, between reef-building corals and
   the algae. We assume their relationship starts out as entosymbiosis,
   with the algal organism living on the external surfaces of host coral
   exoskeleton, but with both gradually adapting to each other over
   evolutionary time-scales. Our main conclusion is that such an
   evolutionary conversion is possible and indeed is quite likely. (C) 2016

Title = {Passive cooling concept for onboard heat sources in aircrafts},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {402-413},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A passive cooling system based on heat pipe technology was tested
   in-flight in an Embraer test aircraft. Avionics thermal behavior was
   simulated by employing electrical resistances with input power ranging
   from 40 to 850 W. Heat is transported from the resistances to the
   evaporator of a recently patented heat exchanger system (HES) by
   intermediary heat transfer elements (IHTEs), consisting of one heat pipe
   and four thermosyphons. The HES consists of loop-thermosyphons with a
   shared evaporator connected to two parallel condensers, one at the
   fuselage and another within the air-conditioning system. The couplings
   between HES evaporator and IHTE condensers were designed to assure
   practical fitting and low contact resistance. Experiments were conducted
   with Mach numbers of 0.55 up to 0.78 at altitudes of 4.5, 9.1 and 10.6
   km, corresponding to air static temperatures of 0, -30 and -43 degrees
   C, respectively. IHTEs and HES behaviors were also investigated during
   roller coaster and G-load turn maneuvers. Heat sink changes surrounding
   the HES condensers owing to different altitudes hardly affect IHTEs.
   Heat pipe and thermosyphons with 0.7 m length can dissipate 120 W and
   500 W, respectively. Convection can be an alternative where heat
   conduction between avionics and IHTE evaporators is not possible. Two
   thermosyphons with evaporator fins dissipated 586 W with the air
   temperature within the convective system of about 80 degrees C. Aircraft
   maneuvers do not affect the thermal behavior of heat pipe technologies.
   Efficient thermal control of avionics is at hand. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {The surface sediments of Vembanad Lake, a tropical estuary on the west
   coast of India, were analyzed for carbon (TC, TOC, TIC), nitrogen (TN),
   amino acids and two amino sugars. C/N ratios for the surface sediments
   vary from 1.0-21.8, indicating terrestrial sources of organic matter.
   Various biogeochemical indicators based on amino acids such as
   Asp/beta-ala and Glu/gamma-aba ratios revealed that the organic matter
   in the 5- to 10-cm surface sediments was fresh and had not undergone
   extensive degradation. However, the Gluam/Galam ratio for surface
   sediments of Vembanad Lake varies from 0.4-2.1, indicating the dominance
   of bacterial biomass in the sediments. Organic matter in the sediments
   was found to be highly reactive, with a reactivity index ranging from
   2.4-7.4, suggesting rapid remineralization.},

Abstract = {Production of oil and gas in the Brazilian pre-salt faces several
   technical challenges and one of them that is a major concern is the
   presence of CO2 in high concentration. The aim of this work is to
   evaluate the fracture toughness of two nickel-containing steels as an
   alternative material to manufacture low-temperature toughness improved
   CO2 transporting pipelines for Enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Optical and
   scanning electron microscopies were employed to characterize the steels
   microstructures. Electron back scattered diffraction was used to
   estimate the effective grain size and the density of high-angle grain
   boundaries. Fracture toughness was determined by the use of the crack
   tip opening displacement methodology. The results indicated that for the
   as-rolled condition the large islands of the micro constituent M/A in
   the 5(1/2) Ni steel had a detrimental effect on fracture toughness at
   -100 degrees C, while finer M/A particles and lower effective grain size
   with higher density of high-angle grain boundaries in the 9 Ni steel
   turned its fracture toughness practically temperature independent.
   Additionally, heat treatment (quenching and tempering) has the potential
   to dissolve the M/A hard particles and consequently improve fracture
   toughness at low temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In a modern power system, Photovoltaic as distributed generated source
   is growing larger and it can cause a variety of problem. Most issued
   problem is an islanding phenomenon. In order to prevent islanding
   phenomenon, three kinds of active islanding detection methods have been
   studied. These are respectively to change magnitude, frequency, and the
   start phase of inverter output current. Among them, both frequency and
   start phase variation anti-methods make the islanding frequency drift
   away from the trip window of the frequency relay if an islanding is
   occurred. This paper presents a robust antiislanding method, which are
   consisted of a frequency variation method as AFD(Active Frequency Drift)
   method and a start phase variation method as SMS(Slip Mode frequency
   Shift) method. Cleady, the proposed antiislanding method shows the
   satisfied islanding detection ability to IEEE 1547 Standard. To validate
   the performance of the proposed method, simulation and experiment are
   performed. Possible islanding conditions are followed by the IEEE
   Standard 1547. The methodology presented in the paper can be extended to
   the other active antiislanding methods.},

Abstract = {A coupled solar photocatalytic-biological pilot plant system has been
   employed to enhance the biodegradability and complete mineralization of
   a biorecalcitrant industrial compound, alpha-methylphenylglycine,
   dissolved in distilled water and simulated seawater at 500 mg L-1. The
   pollutant was completely degraded by a solar photo-Fenton treatment in a
   75-L pilot plant made up of four compound parabolic collector (CPC)
   units. The catalyst concentration employed was 2 and 20 mg L-1 of Fe2+
   and the H2O2 concentration was kept in the range of 200-500 mg L-1. A
   Zahn-Wellens (Z-W) test applied to photo-treated samples demonstrated
   that intermediates produced within a short time of starting the
   photo-Fenton process were biodegradable. Consequently, the
   photocatalytic and biological processes were combined. Biodegradable
   compounds generated during the preliminary oxidative process were
   biologically mineralized in a 170-L aerobic immobilised biomass reactor
   (IBR), filled with 90-95 L propylene Pall (R) Ring supports colonized by
   activated sludge. Almost total mineralization (90\% overall total
   organic carbon removed) was attained in the combined treatment system
   (for both distilled and seawater experiments). Moreover, nitrification
   and denitrification phenomena were also observed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {To investigate the variation of irregular waves due to an Artificial
   Coral Reef (ACR), two-dimensional experiments on the wave steepness,
   wave period, and relative submergence were conducted. The results for
   the wave transmission coefficient under ACR installation indicated that
   the wave steepness and period conditions are closely related to wave
   attenuation, which has similar trends for general coastal structures,
   even under irregular wave conditions. Additionally, the total spectral
   energy decreased gradually, whereas an inconsistent peak-energy
   decrement occurred with a wave steepness of 0.032, which was expected
   because of spectral energy redistribution due to ACR. The correlation
   between the relative submergence and spectral energy was investigated
   via a spectral analysis. In high frequency domain (1.25 similar to 2.25
   f/f(p)), the composition ratio of spectral energy increased with larger
   relative submergence, whereas opposite trend was observed in low
   frequency domain (0.25 similar to 0.75 f/f(p)). The main findings of
   this study can provide basic knowledge for understanding irregular wave
   variation over the ACR.},

Title = {Biochar Addition Altered Bacterial Community and Improved Photosynthetic
   Rate of Seagrass: A Mesocosm Study of Seagrass Thalassia hemprichii},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows, as typical ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems, play critical
   ecological roles in the marine ecosystem and decline every year. The
   application of biochar in soil has been proposed as a potential soil
   amendment to improve soil quality and mitigate global climate change.
   The effects of biochar on soil bacterial activities are integrally
   linked to the potential of biochar in achieving these benefits. However,
   biochar has been rarely applied in marine ecosystems. Whether the
   application of biochar could work on the seagrass ecosystem remained
   unknown. In this study, we investigated the responses of sediment and
   rhizosphere bacterial communities of seagrass Thalassia hemprichii to
   the biochar addition derived from maize at ratios of 5\% by dry weight
   in the soil during a one-month incubation. Results indicated that the
   biochar addition significantly changed the sedimental environment with
   increasing pH, total phosphorus, and total kalium while total nitrogen
   decreased. Biochar addition significantly altered both the rhizosphere
   and sediment bacterial community compositions. The significant changes
   in rhizosphere bacterial community composition occurred after 30days of
   incubation, while the significant variations in sediment bacterial
   community composition distinctly delayed than in sediment occurred on
   the 14th day. Biochar application improved nitrification and
   denitrification, which may accelerate nitrogen cycling. As a stabilizer
   to communities, biochar addition decreased the importance of
   deterministic selection in sediment and changed the bacterial
   co-occurrence pattern. The biochar addition may promote seagrass
   photosynthesis and growth by altering the bacterial community
   compositions and improving nutrient circulation in the seagrass
   ecosystem, contributing to the seagrass health improvement. This study
   provided a theoretical basis for applying biochar to the seagrass
   ecosystem and shed light on the feasible application of biochar in the
   marine ecosystem. Graphical Abstract},

Title = {Role of reaction resistance in limiting carbon monoxide uptake in rabbit
   lungs (vol 84, pg 2066, 1998)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {86},

Abstract = {The contribution of reaction resistance to overall resistance to
   pulmonary carbon monoxide (CO) uptake {[}DLCO/(Theta(CO).Vc), where DLCO
   is lung CO diffusing capacity, Theta(CO) is CO uptake conductance of
   erythrocytes, and Vc is pulmonary capillary blood volume] was determined
   in 10 anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated rabbits. On
   the basis of the classical double-reciprocal equation of F. G. W.
   Roughton and R. E. Forster (J. Appl. Physiol. 11: 290-302, 1957),
   DLCO/(Theta(CO).Vc) was obtained by solving the relation
   DLCO/(Theta(CO).Vc) = 1 - 2/(DLNO/DLCO), where DLNO/DLCO represents the
   ratio between the respective single-breath diffusing capacities (DL) Of
   nitric oxide (NO) and CO. The lungs of eight rabbits were inflated,
   starting from residual volume, by using 55 ml of indicator gas mixture
   (0.2\% CO and 0.05\% NO in nitrogen). DL values were calculated by
   taking the end-tidal partial pressures of CO and NO as analyzed by using
   a respiratory mass spectrometer. The overall value was
   DLCO/(Theta(CO).Vc) = 0.4 +/- 0.025 (mean +/- SD). Because of the use of
   O-2-free indicator gas mixtures, the end-tidal O-2 partial pressures
   were similar to 21 Torr. In one other rabbit, the application of 0.2\%
   CO and 0.001\% NO yielded DLCO/(Theta(CO).Vc) = 0.39; in the tenth
   rabbit, however, inspiratory volume was varied, and an identical value
   was found at functional residual capacity. We conclude that the
   contribution of reaction resistance to overall resistance to pulmonary
   CO uptake is independent of the inspiratory NO concentration used,
   including, with respect to the pertinent literature, the conclusion that
   in rabbits, dogs, and humans this contribution amounts to 40\% when
   determined at functional residual capacity.},

Abstract = {In January 2001, we surveyed streams and ponds above 300 m a.s.l. in
   Taylor Valley, South Victoria Land, Antarctica. One pond was examined in
   detail. Organic materials covered nearly 100\% of the adjacent soil to
   5-20 m from the shore, with intermittent patches to 80 m. Organic matter
   averaged 257 g C/m(2), and totaled 1,388 kg organic C on the soil around
   the pond. Soil-moisture content (0.56-12.41\%) decreased with distance
   from shore, whereas pH (7.8-10.8) increased with distance. Electrical
   conductivity was lowest in the soils <10 m from the pond (416+/-94
   muS/cm). Mineral soil organic C and total N concentrations were greatest
   between 10 and 30 m from the edge of the pond (1.21+/-0.37 and
   0.13+/-0.05 mg/g soil, respectively). Soil invertebrates were present in
   only 50\% of samples and included tardigrades, rotifers, and two
   nematodes, Scottnema lindsayae and Plectus antarcticus. A
   non-parametric, discriminant function analysis based on soil moisture,
   soil organic carbon, and electrical conductivity correctly predicted
   87.0\% of sites that had invertebrates and 70.8\% of sites for which
   invertebrates were absent. Tardigrades, rotifers, and P. antarcticus
   were found only in the wettest soils nearest the pond whereas S.
   lindsayae was restricted to drier soils further from shore. Other ponds
   and streams also showed substantial accumulations of organic matter,
   suggesting that upland wetlands serve as resource islands in these polar
   deserts that provide a source of organic matter to nearby soils.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the innovative breakwater design and construction
   methodology for a new 400-foot-long breakwater at the Naval Air Station
   (NAS) Whidbey Island Fuel Pier located on Whidbey Island in Washington
   State. The breakwater was designed to enable construction within the
   challenging and highly restrictive existing conditions, environmental
   requirements, and construction scheduling constraints. The use of
   precast concrete construction was maximized to enable demolition of
   existing features and new construction within the permitted 7-month
   ``fish window{''} from July 15, 2015 to February 14, 2016. Other
   environmental constraints included the exclusive use of concrete piles,
   a limited number of piles overall, use of an impact hammer and jetting
   only for pile installation, avoidance of eel grass areas, and no use of
   a vibratory hammer for pile extraction or installation. Further, a
   functional breakwater was required to be in place by the beginning of
   the storm season on October 15, 2015 in the form of either a permanent
   installation or temporary shelter. The breakwater comprises precast
   prestressed concrete vertical and batter piles, precast concrete wave
   panels, and cast-in-place concrete pile caps. Restrictions on the number
   of piles required carefully optimizing the design of vertical and batter
   piles to balance the requirements of wave loads and seismic loads for
   long slender piles and cohesive soils. This project showcases design
   innovation and optimization resulting from the partnership between the
   design-build contractor and designer for an environmentally sensitive
   site that is home to at least four endangered species: salmon, southern
   resident killer whales, marbled murrelets (birds), and bull trout.},

Title = {Fully-autonomous Operation of an AC Micro-grid with Inherent Seamless
   Switching},
Journal = {RECENT ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL \& ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {222-232},
Abstract = {Background: Conventional micro-grids operate autonomously in islanded
   mode but they always rely on the utility grid for BUS voltage support
   and power balance in the grid-connected mode. This results in
   non-seamless mode switching, alternating operation strategy and power
   exchange fluctuation problems.
   Methods: An AC/DC/AC converter is utilized as the interface between the
   micro-grid and the utility grid. This enables the two entities to have
   different voltages in the grid-connected mode. The micro grid exchanges
   predefined amount of power with the utility grid in the grid-connected
   mode. The power amount is estimated based on power forecasting of local
   generations and loads with the consideration of the Sate of Charge (SOC)
   of the battery, and is updated and broadcasted every 15 minutes.
   Results: A 100kVA AC micro-grid with a rotating generator, battery
   storage and solar arrays is built on Matlab/Simulink for investigation.
   Results indicate that the battery can effectively balance the power flow
   and mode switching hardly causes distortions.
   Conclusion: The proposed micro-grid can operate autonomously in both
   grid-connected and islanded mode without relying on the utility grid.
   Seamless switching between operation modes can be achieved naturally.
   Constant power is exchanged with the power grid, which benefits the
   power dispatching algorithm of the power system.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore an appropriate load shedding scheme
   for enhancing frequency response of a low inertia power system. Amongst
   Australian states, the installed wind power generation capacity is the
   highest in South Australia. As such, a number of thermal power plants
   have been withdrawn from the generation mix. In addition, most of the
   South Australian wind power plants deploy variable speed wind machines.
   Therefore, these plants do not usually participate in frequency
   regulation. Furthermore, South Australia is connected to its adjacent
   state Victoria through a high voltage AC interconnection. During
   significant availability of wind generation and high power import
   through the interconnection, a few synchronous generators are committed
   in the South Australian network. Under such a situation, the loss of
   interconnection leaves South Australia islanded. Consequently, South
   Austrian system has to depend on conventional under frequency load
   shedding to recover the frequency excursion. However, this technique may
   not be able to stop the frequency decline in a very low inertia
   operating condition. To overcome this challenge, this paper utilizes a
   load shedding scheme, which is based on the initial rate of change of
   frequency as well as the magnitude of frequency deviation. Performance
   of this load shedding mechanism is also analysed when additional
   frequency support from variable speed wind machines are enabled in a low

Title = {Impact of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on fingernail clams

Abstract = {The demography of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and its
   impacts on native fingernail clams (Sphaeriidae) in Lake Michigan near
   Michigan City, Indiana were studied from 1992 to 1997 at 5, 10, and 15 m
   depths. Zebra mussel densities ranged from 0 to 6,209/m(,)(2) and were
   greatest at deeper stations. Size-frequency distributions suggest that
   initial colonization of the Michigan City area occurred in 1991, with
   adults typically living for 2 to 3 years. Abundance of adult populations
   may be limited by the sandy habitat typical of the areas studied and the
   occasional high-energy wave action in the shallow (5 m) near-shore zone
   of this area. Densities of fingernail clam ranged from 0 to 1,312/m(2)
   and were also greatest at deeper stations. Approximately half of the
   fingernail clams shells between 1 and 2 mm in size were used as
   substrate for attachment by juvenile and adult zebra mussels, while over
   90\% of the clams > 2 mm showed attachment by zebra mussels. Overall
   median densities of Sphaeriidae decreased from 832/m(2) to 13/m(2) at
   the 15 m depth and from 234/m(2) to 0/m(2) at the 10 m depth during the
   study. It appears that zebra mussel colonization caused a dramatic
   reduction of Sphaeriidae density by 1997 that may eventually result in
   their loss from the area.},

Abstract = {Taiwan is located in the Western Pacific where typhoons and earthquakes
   frequently strike. The environment and geological conditions are
   sensitive and vulnerable to these phenomena. In recent years, rapid
   socio-economic growth has increasingly put pressure on land development
   on the island of Taiwan, causing frequent conflicts over land in
   mountain, river, and sea areas. Additionally, the increasing impact of
   climate change has made the maintenance of a stable equilibrium of the
   ecosystem, ensuring the survival of the population, and the sustainable
   development of the nation, important issues that must be actively faced,
   taking into account limitations on land and resources. ``Doubly
   exposed{''} to globalization and global warming, Taiwan must actively
   ensure the balance between national land conservation for the future and
   economic development in its four regions. Taiwan must also coordinate
   regional development and effectively distribute resources among regions
   to achieve equal development and mitigate the challenges of resource
   shortages. Studies of carrying capacities have focused on environmental
   carrying capacity, recreational carrying capacity, and urban carrying
   capacity, mainly exploring the limits on population that are imposed by
   a single environmental system. Few studies of the amount of population
   that can be supplied by the land as part of the overall environmental
   system, the amount of available resources, the amount of consumption,
   the consumption differences and developmental issues, have been
   published. This study examines Taiwan's carrying capacity (resource
   supply side) from the perspective of ``land resources{''}, ``food
   resources{''}, and ``carbon emissions{''}. It determines the population
   size that can be supported by each resource to reveal the current levels
   of development of Taiwan's regions and future expected demands on each
   resource, and the carrying capacity of each resource in each region is
   compared with the ecological footprint (resource demand side) to support
   a discussion of regional adaptations. This study provides innovative
   thinking and methods to reduce resource shortages and the pressure that
   is imposed by climate change, to seek new opportunities for Taiwan's
   progress toward sustainable development.},

Title = {Evaluation the potential and energy efficiency of dual stage pressure
   retarded osmosis process},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {199},
Pages = {359-369},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Power generation by means of Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) has been
   proposed for harvesting the energy of a salinity gradient. Energy
   recovery by the PRO process decreases along the membrane module due to
   depleting of the chemical potential across the membrane and
   concentration polarization effects. A dual stage PRO (DSPRO) design can
   be used to rejuvenate the chemical potential difference and reduce the
   concentration polarization on feed solution. Several design
   configurations were suggested for the membrane module arrangements in
   the first and second stage of the PRO process. PRO performance was
   evaluated for a number of salinity gradients proposed by coupling Dead
   Sea water or Reverse Osmosis (RO) brine with seawater or wastewater
   effluent. Maximum specific energy of inlet and outlet feeds was
   calculated using a developed computer model to identify the amount of
   recovered and remaining energy. Initially, specific power generation by
   the PRO process increased by increasing the number of modules of the
   first stage. Maximum specific energy is calculated along the PRO module
   to understand the degradation of the maximum specific energy in each
   module before introducing a second stage PRO process. Adding a second
   stage PRO process resulted in a sharp increase of the chemical potential
   difference and the specific energy yield of the process. Between 10\%
   and 13\% increase of the specific power generation was achieved by the
   DSPRO process for the Dead Sea-seawater salinity gradient depending on
   the dual stage design configuration. For Dead Sea-RD brine, 12-16\%
   increase of the specific power generation was achieved by the dual stage
   PRO process. For Dead Sea-wastewater and RO brine-wastewater, a neutral
   and sometimes negative impact occurred when a second stage PRO process
   was introduced. We concluded that, for a given draw solution
   concentration, dual stage performs better than the conventional PRO
   process at high feed salinities, yet requires lower hydraulic pressure.

Title = {On the Accuracy of Three-Dimensional Actuator Disc Approach in Modelling
   a Large-Scale Tidal Turbine in a Simple Channel},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {To date, only a few studies have examined the execution of the actuator
   disc approximation for a full-size turbine. Small-scale models have
   fewer constraints than large-scale models because the range of
   time-scale and length-scale is narrower. Hence, this article presents
   the methodology in implementing the actuator disc approach via the
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) momentum source term for a 20-m
   diameter turbine in an idealised channel. A structured grid, which
   varied from 0.5 m to 4 m across rotor diameter and width was used at the
   turbine location to allow for better representation of the disc. The
   model was tuned to match known coefficient of thrust and operational
   profiles for a set of validation cases based on published experimental
   data. Predictions of velocity deficit and turbulent intensity became
   almost independent of the grid density beyond 11 diameters downstream of
   the disc. However, in several instances the finer meshes showed larger
   errors than coarser meshes when compared to the measurements data. This
   observation was attributed to the way nodes were distributed across the
   disc swept area. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the
   actuator disc was highly influenced by the vertical resolutions, as well
   as the grid density of the disc enclosure.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a novel integrated solar photovoltaic thermal absorption
   desalination system for freshwater and cooling production is proposed
   and analyzed thermodynamically. Ammonia-water pair is considered as a
   working fluid for the absorption system. Effect of average solar
   radiation for different months, time period of solar radiation
   availability in Abu Dhabi, salinity of seawater, and temperature of the
   seawater on energetic and exergetic COPs, production rate of freshwater,
   and overall performance of the system are investigated under different
   operating conditions. It is found that energetic and exergetic COPs,
   production rate of freshwater, energetic and exergetic utilization
   factors, and performance ratios vary greatly from one month to another
   because of the dynamic variation in solar radiation and its time of
   availability. The highest amount of freshwater is produced in the month
   of July as calculated to be 152kg/h for a collector area of 100m(2) and
   solar power of 4.8kW. The highest energetic and exergetic COPs and
   utilization factors are also obtained for the month of July. Moreover,
   the highest performance ratio is found to be 0.056 as obtained in the
   month of July when solar radiation intensity is highest as available for
   more than half of a day. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Carbon, iron, and aluminum responses to controlled water table
   fluctuations in sandy soil material},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS},

Abstract = {Seasonal fluctuating water tables are common in sandy coastal plain
   soils, but their role in soil organic carbon dynamics is uncertain.
   Seasonal saturation influences biogeochemical processes that affect fate
   of organic matter and metals. A column study was conducted to test
   hypotheses that shallow water table (SWT) fluctuations reduce CO2 loss
   (H1), increase leaching of dissolved organic C (DOC) and metals (Al and
   Fe) (H2), and result in greater net soil C storage (H3).
   The A- and E-horizon material of moderately well-drained sandy soils
   from five sites was collected for the study. Ten columns (two per site)
   of 90-cm height were packed to a thickness of 60 cm with E-horizon
   material, above which was packed 15 cm of A-horizon material from the
   same soil. Five columns were subjected to SWT treatments and five to
   deep water table (DWT) treatments. Upward CO2 flux was measured using a
   NaOH (1 M) trap. Metal and DOC-C concentrations in leachates and in
   water sampled at the surface of columns were measured. Soil samples from
   the columns were collected by depth at 5-6-cm increments and tested for
   total and organic C, metals, and < 50-mu m material distribution by WT
   treatment.
   Upward flux of CO2 was significantly less for SWT treatment. Higher DOC
   (for all events) and Fe concentrations (for first 18 days) were measured
   in SWT leachates as compared to DWT. Metal- and C concentrations were
   correlated (P < 0.0001) for surface pore water samples of SWT but not
   for DWT. Net loss of C was significantly less under SWT condition.
   Results indicate significant water-table effects on magnitude and
   direction of C flux (solution or gaseous) and < 50-mu m particle
   distribution for sandy coastal plain soils materials.
   Changes in water table depth can potentially alter not only net soil C
   storage but also the proportion of C converted to CO2 versus DOC.
   Differences in the proportion would have consequences for C dynamics in
   ecosystems dominated by soils with fluctuating water tables such as
   occur extensively in the coastal plain of the SE USA and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Some of the latest results of the simulation for the merger of black
   hole (1311)-neutron star (NS) binaries in full general relativity is
   presented. As the initial condition, we prepare a quasicircular state in
   which the BH is modeled by a moving puncture with no spin. The Gamma-law
   equation of state with Gamma = 2 and irrotational velocity field are
   used for modeling the NS. The BH mass is chosen to be approximate to
   4M(circle dot), whereas the rest-mass of the NS is approximate to
   1.4M(circle dot) and the radius is 13 km. The NS is tidally disrupted
   near the innermost stable orbit but more than similar to 90\% of the
   material is quickly swallowed into the BH and the resultant disk mass is
   approximate to 0.1M(circle dot). The thermal energy of the material in
   the disk increases by the shock heating occurred in the collision
   between the spiral arms. Our results indicate that the merger between a
   low-mass BH and its companion NS may form a central engine of
   short-gamma-ray bursts. Gravitational waveforms are also presented. We
   find that the amplitude of gravitational waves quickly decreases after
   the tidal disruption and the amplitude of the quasinormal mode ringing
   is small.},

Abstract = {Hazardous air pollutants, such as trace elements in particulate matter
   (PM), are known or highly suspected to cause detrimental effects on
   human health. To understand the sources and associated risks of PM to
   human health, hourly time-integrated major trace elements in
   size-segregated coarse (PM2.5-10) and fine (PM2.5) particulate matter
   were collected at the industrial city of Foshan in the Pearl River Delta
   region, China. Receptor modeling of the data set by positive matrix
   factorization (PMF) was used to identify six sources contributing to
   PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at the site. Dominant sources included
   industrial coal combustion, secondary inorganic aerosol, motor vehicles
   and construction dust along with two intermittent sources (biomass
   combustion and marine aerosol). The biomass combustion source was found
   to be a significant contributor to peak PM2 : 5 episodes along with
   motor vehicles and industrial coal combustion. Conditional probability
   function (CPF) analysis was applied to estimate the source locations
   using the PMF-resolved source contribution coupled with the surface wind
   direction data. Health exposure risk of hazardous trace elements (Pb,
   As, Si, Cr, Mn and Ni) and source-specific values were estimated. The
   total hazard quotient (HQ) of PM2.5 was 2.09, higher than the acceptable
   limit (HQ = 1). The total carcinogenic risk (CR) was 3.37 x 10(-3) for
   PM2.5, which was 3 times higher than the least stringent limit (1.0 x
   10(-4)). Among the selected trace elements, As and Pb posed the highest
   non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to human health, respectively.
   In addition, our results show that the industrial coal combustion source
   is the dominant non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk contributor,
   highlighting the need for stringent control of this source. This study
   provides new insight for policy makers to prioritize sources in air
   quality management and health risk reduction.},

Abstract = {Floating LiDAR is a new aspiring technology for replacing offshore
   meteorological masts for applications like offshore site assessment or
   power curve measurement. Since the beginning of the development of the
   first Floating LiDAR Systems (FLS) in the late 2000s, the systems are
   more and more maturing. The focus of current research is moving from the
   pure technology development to the application of the obtained data. As
   a result, procedures for assuring the measurement quality and the
   assessment of the data quality - or the quantification of estimated
   measurement uncertainty, respectively - is a key aspect for further
   increasing the confidence in the data. This is an important pillar for a
   further distribution of the technology, and for decreasing risks and
   costs for its application in offshore wind.
   In this paper, we introduce the methodologies of FLS verification and
   classification, with the goal to verify the measurement of individual
   FLS and study the characteristics of a certain type of LiDAR systems. A
   classification case study is presented, showing low effects of the buoy
   motion and sea states on the FLS measurement for the Fraunhofer LiDAR
   buoy. A detailed study of the interdependencies between influencing
   parameters and the possible correlations is presented as well.
   The robustness and issues of the classification methodology - originally
   defined for fixed LiDAR systems - is discussed. Especially the
   non-robustness of the bin-fitting is identified as an issue. Alternative
   methods for the sensitivity analysis within the classification process
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {With the continuous rise in CO2 emissions, the pH of seawater may
   decrease extensively in the coming centuries. Deep-sea environments are
   more vulnerable to decreasing pH since sediments in deep oceans below
   the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) are often completely devoid of
   carbonate particles. In order to assess the potential risk of heavy
   metal release from deep-sea deposits, the mobility of elements from
   ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and pelagic clays was examined by means
   of leaching experiments using phosphate buffer solutions ranging in pH
   from 7.1 to 8.6 (NBS scale). With decreasing pH, the results showed an
   enhanced leaching of elements such as Li, B, Mg, Si, Sc, Sr, Ba, Tl, and
   U, but a reduced leaching of V, Cu, Mo, Cd, and W. Elements in leachates
   originate mainly from exchangeable fractions, and tend to be affected by
   sorption-desorption processes. Concentrations of most elements did not
   exceed widely used international water quality criteria, indicating that
   changes in pH caused by future ocean acidification may not increase the
   risk of heavy metal release during deep-sea nodule mining operations.},

Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},

Volume = {438},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study analyzed the seasonal variation of sedimentary reservoirs in
   sandy beaches located at the insular margin of a tidal inlet (Itamaraca
   Island, Pernambuco, Brazil). We measured the sedimentary budget and
   identified the dominant coastal processes (accretion or erosion) from
   Dec/2017 to Dec/2018. In six field campaigns by a Remotely Piloted
   Aircraft System, digital terrain models and extracted cross shore
   profiles were obtained which allowed for the quantification of beach
   morphology variability by variations in sedimentary volume. The
   following three sectors were classified and analyzed according to their
   location and coastal alignment in relation to the tidal inlet: internal
   (O-L) intermediate (SW-NE), and external (SN) sectors. ERA Interim
   reanalysis data were used to evaluate the regional standards of ocean
   surface waves and wind, showing predominance of southeast (109 degrees
   and 124 degrees, respectively) and wave power with average peaks of
   46.5-51.8 kW/m (dry season) and 57-65.3 kW/m (rainy season). Sedimentary
   gain took place between Apr-Jul/2018, with Sep-Dec/2018 being the period
   of greatest loss. The internal sector showed positive sedimentary budget
   (+704.52 m(3)) with the prevalence of the accretion process, while both
   intermediate and external sectors lost about 5009 and 14,110 m(3),
   respectively, with the erosive process prevailing at the end of the
   studied period.},

Abstract = {The 1.2-MW La Ola photovoltaic (PV) power plant in Lanai, Hawaii, has
   been in operation since December 2009. The host system is a small island
   microgrid with peak load of 5 MW. Simulations conducted as part of the
   interconnection study concluded that unmitigated PV output ramps had the
   potential to negatively affect system frequency. Based on that study,
   the PV system was initially allowed to operate with output limited to
   50\% of nameplate power capacity to reduce the potential for frequency
   instability due to PV variability. Based on the analysis of historical
   voltage, frequency, and power output data at 50\% output level, the PV
   system has not significantly affected grid performance. However, it
   should be noted that the impact of PV variability on active and reactive
   power output of the nearby diesel generators was not evaluated.},

Abstract = {Spatial variation in process parameters can have a significant impact on
   parametric yield of integrated circuits. We present a test structure and
   measurement technique for statistical characterization of process
   variation with programmable spatial granularity. The proposed structure
   can measure spatial variation at a desired level of granularity by
   controlling the leakage and on-current state in different spatial
   regions through input vectors and measuring the corresponding quiescent
   (I-DDQ) currents at power supply ports. This minimally invasive and low
   overhead variation measurement approach can be extended to measure
   spatial variation profiles in actual product chips by leveraging the
   existing power delivery architecture and power control circuits such as
   voltage islands and power gating. Measurements on a test chip fabricated
   in a 65 nm process show nearly a 100\% leakage variation and 7\%
   on-current variation over a 558 mu m by 380 mu m silicon area with
   nearly 3X chip-to-chip leakage variation.},

Abstract = {Since industrialization global CO2 emissions have increased, and as a
   consequence oceanic pH is predicted to drop by 0.3-0.4 units before the
   end of the century a process coined ocean acidification. Consequently,
   there is significant interest in how pH changes will affect the ocean's
   biota and integral processes. We investigated marine picoplankton (0.2-2
   mu m diameter) community response to predicted end of century CO2
   concentrations, via a high-CO2 (similar to 750 ppm) large-volume (11 000
   l) contained seawater mesocosm approach. We found little evidence of
   changes occurring in bacterial abundance or community composition due to
   elevated CO2 under both phytoplankton pre-bloom/bloom and post-bloom
   conditions. In contrast, significant differences were observed between
   treatments for a number of key picoeukaryote community members. These
   data suggested a key outcome of ocean acidification is a more rapid
   exploitation of elevated CO2 levels by photosynthetic picoeukaryotes.
   Thus, our study indicates the need for a more thorough understanding of
   picoeukaryote-mediated carbon flow within ocean acidification
   experiments, both in relation to picoplankton carbon sources, sinks and
   transfer to higher trophic levels.},

Abstract = {The revised smooth particle hydrodynamics method based on the Riemann
   solution has been used to simulate the interaction process between waves
   and perforated caissons. In contrast to wave surfaces and opening
   boundaries of the flume under different wave conditions, the accuracy of
   the numerical wave flume is verified, and the numerical results are
   highly consistent with the linear regular wave theory. The reflection
   coefficient comparison between the values calculated from the smooth
   particle hydrodynamics method and the test data shows good agreement.
   The smooth particle hydrodynamics method adopted in this article can be
   employed to study the reflection coefficient of perforated caissons
   under conditions of non-overtopping, unbreaking waves. The effects of
   the related factors on the reflection coefficient are also investigated,
   including the relative dissipation chamber width B/L and the wave
   steepness H/L. The wave surface and velocity vector distribution of
   water particles surrounding the wave dissipation chamber are discussed,
   including the vortex flow and wave reflux caused by the wave dissipation
   chamber, which play a significant role in wave energy consumption. The
   results of this investigation can be used in the hydrodynamic design of
   perforated caissons and may provide a reference for offshore structural
   engineering structures.},

Abstract = {Our objective was to assess the potential of Cladocera from mountain
   lakes for climate reconstruction. We related Cladocera from surface
   sediments of Alpine lakes (1,502-2,309 m asl) to 29 abiotic
   environmental variables using statistical methods. The environmental
   dataset included water chemistry, lake depth, and bi-hourly
   water-temperature logs, which were used to assess mean monthly water
   temperatures, dates of freezing and breakup, spring and autumn mixing.
   We found 14 different Cladocera of the families Bosminidae, Daphniidae,
   and Chydoridae. Lakes without Cladocera (eight lakes) were cold and/or
   ultra-oligotrophic, whereas lakes with planktonic and littoral Cladocera
   (19 lakes) were warmer and/or less oligotrophic. Lakes with only
   littoral Cladocera (18 lakes) had intermediate water
   temperatures/trophy. Changes in Cladocera assemblages were related to
   changes in climate, nutrients, and/or alkalinity. We found a climate
   threshold at which Bosminidae disappeared in 95\% of the lakes. For
   climate-change research, we propose studying Cladocera along transects
   that include climatic thresholds.},

Abstract = {Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) including a mix of intact nanoparticle-Ag
   and `free' Ag+ pose high risks to benthic photoautotrophs, but the
   photosynthetic responses of benthic microbial aggregates to AgNPs still
   remain largely unknown. Here, periphyton and Nostoc were used to
   elucidate the photosynthetic responses of benthic algae community to
   intact nanoparticle-Ag and Ag+. During exposure, both intact
   nanoparticle-Ag and Ag+ imposed negative effects on photosynthesis of
   benthic algae, but via different pathways. Specifically, Ag+ had
   stronger effects on damaging the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) and
   thylakoid membrane than intact nanoparticle-Ag. Ag+ also suppressed
   electron transfer from QA to QB, and impaired phycobilisome. Intact
   nanoparticle-Ag inhibited the expression of PsbD and PsbL in PSII, but
   prompted the ROS scavenging capacity. In response to the stress of
   AgNPs, the benthic algae increased light energy absorption to maintain
   the electron transport efficiency, and up-regulated PSI reaction center
   protein (PsaA) to compensate the degraded PSII. These results reveal how
   intact nanoparticle-Ag and Ag+ influence electron transport, energy
   conversion and protein expression in the photosynthesis of periphyton,
   and provide deep insights into the responses of benthic photo-autotrophs
   to different components of AgNPs.},

Title = {Large-scale edge waves generated by hurricane landfall},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {Direct observations of the storm surge induced by Hurricane Wilma's
   landfall revealed a formation of a wave pulse propagating alongshore.
   The height of the wave pulse exceeded 1.5 m in the detided sea level.
   The duration of this wave pulse was similar to 6 h and the propagation
   speed was of O(10) m s(-1). This wave has been identified as an edge
   wave of large spatial and temporal scales. A set of numerical
   experiments has been conducted to delineate a generation of edge waves
   with large spatial and temporal scales by a fast-moving storm system.
   The model of the coastal ocean was set in a two-dimensional
   configuration with the continental shelf and slope topography
   reminiscent of the West Florida shelf. A moving cyclonic system in the
   gradient wind balance was prescribed analytically. In order to identify
   a long wave response in the model, a linear boundary problem was solved,
   yielding dispersion characteristics and a structure of the edge wave
   modes. A fast-moving storm system crossing the shelf at a right angle
   produces a nearly symmetrical response of two edge wave trains
   propagating both downstream (in the direction of a Kelvin wave) and
   upstream. Typically, zero-mode edge waves dominate the response. As the
   translation speed of the storm becomes lower, its Eulerian timescale
   becomes longer and the waves are more affected by the Earth's rotation.
   In that case, the wave energy propagates predominantly downstream. When
   the storm trajectory deviates from the normal approach, the edge wave
   response is not symmetric: most of the energy propagates in the
   direction of the alongshore component of the storm translation velocity.},

Title = {PHENOTYPIC VARIATION IN CONTRASTING TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENTS - GROWTH
   AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN PENNISETUM-SETACEUM FROM DIFFERENT ALTITUDES ON
   HAWAII},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Pages = {623-633},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Plasticity and genetic differentiation of growth, biomass allocation,
   and photosynthesis in response to temperature were investigated for
   populations of the introduced grass Pennisetum setaceum collected from
   different altitudes on the island of Hawaii.
   2. The temperature optimum for photosynthesis was similar (35-degrees-C)
   for plants collected from different altitudes and grown in growth
   chambers with low (25/13-degrees-C) and high (33/25-degrees-C)
   temperature environments, indicating that P. setaceum has limited
   potential for photosynthetic temperature acclimation. Plants grown in
   the low-temperature environment, however, had 16\% greater maximum
   photosynthetic rates on a leaf area basis than plants grown at the high
   temperature (25.4 and 21.4 mumol CO2 M-2 s-1, respectively).
   3. Greater photosynthetic rates for plants grown at the low temperature
   were accompanied by reduced specific leaf area and lower internal to
   ambient CO2 concentration ratios. Plants grown in the high-temperature
   environment, however, had greater leaf mass and leaf areas and
   accumulated 42\% more total biomass than plants grown in the
   low-temperature environment.
   4. Only total leaf area was significantly different among the
   populations. Plants collected from the high-altitude population produced
   the highest total leaf area, followed by plants from the mid- and
   low-altitude populations, respectively. Although some variation in
   photosynthetic capacity was found among genets, it was unpredictable and
   did not correspond to patterns of variation for growth and biomass
   traits.
   5. The extensive altitudinal distribution of P. setaceum on Hawaii,
   therefore, is a result of the broad ecological tolerance of individuals
   and not of local adaptation. Phenotypic plasticity for leaf
   photosynthesis and biomass allocation in response to differences in
   temperature may contribute to the success of this grass in these
   different habitats.},

Journal = {RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyse the effects of maritime and rail container
   transports on the economic growth in Turkey with annual data for the
   period 1991-2016 using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) based
   bounds testing approach. The empirical findings of the study show the
   existence of a cointegration between the variables. Additionally,
   according to the results of the analysis, there was no significant
   relationship between economic growth and rail container transport. On
   the other hand, maritime container transport has a positive and
   statistically significant impact on economic growth both in the short-
   and long-run. These findings could be used to develop an extensive and
   efficient container transport system which contributes more to
   international trade, thus to economic growth of Turkey.},

Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {269-279},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The IRONEX II in situ fertilization experiment showed decisively that
   availability of iron limits the growth of phytoplankton in equatorial
   Pacific surface waters. High-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) surface
   waters, potentially iron limited, are also found in the North Pacific
   and the Southern Ocean. A model of seawater iron geochemistry has been
   incorporated into a global ocean circulation and carbon cycle model and
   tuned to match the observed ocean Fe distribution. The model reproduces
   the observed HNLC areas in the equatorial Pacific and Southern Ocean but
   predicts nutrient depletion in the North Pacific (a region of high dust
   fluxes from Asia). The model is based on the idea that the
   concentrations of organic iron-binding ligands in seawater control the
   subsurface Fe concentration and predicts that a majority (70-80\%) of
   the global carbon export production can be sustained by upwelling of
   dissolved iron in seawater rather than by atmospheric deposition. The
   ocean iron cycle increases the efficiency of iron utilization in the
   biological pump, buffers new production against interannual fluctuations
   in iron deposition, and contributes several new intrinsic timescales to
   the ocean carbon cycle: several hundred years for the ocean iron
   concentration and perhaps several thousand for the concentration of
   ligand in the deep sea. Ocean recycling of Fe appears to play a major
   role in determining the strength of the biological pump in the ocean and
   the pCO(2) of the atmosphere.},

Title = {Prospects of artificial tree for solar desalination},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {18-25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Seawater and brackish water desalination provides a viable alternative
   to clean water supply for regions lacking fresh water sources or facing
   severe droughts. Current desalination technologies, however, are
   energy-expensive and environmentally unfriendly. Mimicking the natural
   transpiration process of mangrove trees that are able to survive in
   high-salinity environment, an artificial tree is conceived as a
   next-generation desalination system that can be entirely solar-powered
   and potentially achieve zero-liquid discharge and resource recovery. The
   artificial tree will float on saline water and be composed of synthetic
   roots that uptake and pretreat feed water, a synthetic trunk that lifts
   water up via capillary action through its microporous xylem, and
   synthetic leaves that efficiently convert sunlight to localized heat for
   water evaporation through their pores. Water vapor is condensed for
   clean water production while salt is collected for resource recovery or
   proper disposal. Science and technologies available and needed for
   realizing the artificial tree system are critically reviewed.},

Title = {Elevated CO2 Affects Predator-Prey Interactions through Altered
   Performance},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 6},
Abstract = {Recent research has shown that exposure to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2)
   affects how fishes perceive their environment, affecting behavioral and
   cognitive processes leading to increased prey mortality. However, it is
   unclear if increased mortality results from changes in the dynamics of
   predator-prey interactions or due to prey increasing activity levels.
   Here we demonstrate that ocean pCO(2) projected to occur by 2100
   significantly effects the interactions of a predator-prey pair of common
   reef fish: the planktivorous damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis and the
   piscivorous dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus. Prey exposed to elevated CO2
   (880 mu atm) or a present-day control (440 matm) interacted with
   similarly exposed predators in a cross-factored design. Predators had
   the lowest capture success when exposed to elevated CO2 and interacting
   with prey exposed to present-day CO2. Prey exposed to elevated CO2 had
   reduced escape distances and longer reaction distances compared to prey
   exposed to present-day CO2 conditions, but this was dependent on whether
   the prey was paired with a CO2 exposed predator or not. This suggests
   that the dynamics of predator-prey interactions under future CO2
   environments will depend on the extent to which the interacting species
   are affected and can adapt to the adverse effects of elevated CO2.},

Title = {Physical and Ecological Responses of Sandy Beaches to the 1997-98 El
   Nino},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {718-730},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {El Nino events elevate water levels, change wave direction and storm
   frequency, and provide an analogy to the likely impacts of climate
   change. Elevated sea levels intensify coastal erosion impacts affecting
   not only oceanfront property and recreational users, but also habitats
   and species that depend on the coast. This study examines physical and
   ecological responses to and recovery from the extreme 1997-98 El Nino
   along beaches of Isla Vista, California, a stretch of coastline
   dominated by unidirectional alongshore sediment transport.
   Using topographic light detection and ranging (LIDAR), physical
   measurements, and biological surveys we quantify physical changes and
   assess ecological responses. We quantify short-term reductions in beach
   widths (>60\%) and sand volumes (similar to 80\%). Although dune-backed
   beaches lost greater sand volumes, bluff-backed shorelines lost greater
   percentages of beach width. Four erosion hot spots were identified
   consistent with a pattern of beach reorientations.
   Macrophyte wrack abundance, a primary food for sandy beach ecosystems,
   was significantly correlated with dry sand beach width.
   Macroinvertebrate biomass was reduced and a decline in mean size of
   individuals persisted for several species. Abundance and species
   richness of shorebirds were lower during the El Nino.
   Beach segments and reorientations recovered at different times, on the
   basis of littoral drift direction, shoreline orientation, and wave
   exposure. The reorientation at the updrift beach impounded sand for >3
   years after the El Nino, catalysing an erosion wave that propagated
   downdrift affecting downcoast beaches. Recovery of the updrift beach led
   to the widest beach widths shown in the historic record, whereas the
   downdrift beach underwent continued erosion >6 years after the El Nino.
   Recovery of wrack abundance and shorebirds to pre-El Nino levels took >3
   years. Reductions in biomass and mean size of invertebrates were
   detected 2 years after the event. Recovery time lines provide
   information for coastal managers evaluating impacts and timing of
   erosion mitigation alternatives.},

Abstract = {In the Volga Federal district of Russia environmental management and
   landscape geography are considered inseparable from the protection of
   nature and environment. On the territory of the Mari Volga area and
   specially protected natural areas of the coastal strip of the Volga
   river, intensively used for recreation, you should know how to use
   recreational resources and what not to do. Focused provision of
   accumulated information is a necessary basis for the achievement of the
   professional interaction of specialists in the field of recreational
   geography, environmental management and forest management In this
   direction it is necessary to provide assistance in obtaining information
   needed to solve the problem of complex estimation of recreational
   resources on the basis of foreign and domestic publications.
   The system we developed recreational monitoring, including the
   reasonable norms of calculations of recreational capacity and ultimate
   load, a staged evaluation method degradirovali areas and bases,available
   results on the state of forest vegetation have been used for monitoring
   and inventory of anthropogenic landscapes in the coastal strip of the
   Volga river in the Volga Federal district. Potential customers will be
   the expected results for ministries and agencies involved in the
   management of natural resources, ecology, land use, forestry.
   Monitoring system of forest ecosystems as a comprehensive assessment can
   be inserted methodically and organizationally into a unified European
   system of regional monitoring of natural systems with the help of bio
   indication network in the framework of the International cooperative
   programme (ICP-forests).
   Thus the problem is solved. To determine the extent to which may affect
   the land, water, vegetation, fauna. And at the same time to preserve
   nature for future generations.},

Abstract = {This article gives a picture of recent studies on the phytobenthos of
   Sicily, paying particular attention to research carried out in the last
   10-15 years. Twenty new taxa have been described from Sicily, and
   floristic studies have recorded 823 taxa at the specific and
   infraspecific levels. Vegetational studies have been used to verify
   changes that have possibly occurred in Sicilian areas over the last 30
   years. Particular attention was also paid to 22 taxa considered to have
   been introduced into the Mediterranean Sea and which are found along the
   Sicilian coast. Applied research dealt mainly with management of the
   territory, promotion of a sustainable development model for the coastal
   zone, and using macroalgal communities to assess the quality of Sicilian
   waters. Finally, some suggestions for studies that should be carried out
   to increase phytobenthic knowledge of Sicilian coastal waters are made.},

Abstract = {Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) has been noticed during recent years from
   reservoirs that are at the end of their life plateau or in which
   production has been declined. Two of these EOR methods are as follows:
   carbonated water and smart water injection. In carbonated water
   injection method, CO2-contained water is injected in reservoirs in order
   to decrease free CO2 injection mobility, increase water viscosity, and
   store/remove produced greenhouse CO2 gas safely, and in smart water
   injection method, the ions in brine are modified in order to make
   controlled reactions with distributed ions on the surface of rock to
   cause more hydrocarbon recovery. In this paper, the combination of these
   two methods is investigated as hybrid smart carbonated water injection
   to find out the recovery factor change and effective mechanisms.
   Experimental core flooding setup is used for investigation of hybrid EOR
   injection applicability and mechanisms. Probable mechanisms are measured
   using different cores and five water samples are used for preparing
   carbonated water (at pressure of 2500 psi) including sea water (34 261
   ppm), river water (1329 ppm), one of Iranian reservoir formation water
   (FW) (163 711 ppm), 10 times diluted FW (0.1 FW), and 100 times diluted
   FW (0.01 FW). The effect of both brine content and volume of CO2 is
   determined during hybrid EOR assessment. The main mechanisms activated
   including pH variation, oil swelling, oil viscosity reduction, ion
   concentration variation in brine and porous media, and wettability
   alteration have been investigated. Hybrid method resulted in highest
   recovery (70\%) mainly due to ion exchange, wettability alteration, oil
   swelling, and permeability enhancement. In addition, type of salt
   concentration will affect recovery as 0.01 FW results in 8\% and 16\%
   additional oil recovery compared to sea and river waters, respectively.
   Coupling of CO2 and salts will increase recovery factor due to
   mechanisms activated by each of these factors as 0.01 FW results in 10\%
   more oil recovery compared to FW. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

Abstract = {Terrestrial productivity in semi-arid woodlands is strongly susceptible
   to changes in precipitation, and semi-arid woodlands constitute an
   important element of the global water and carbon cycles. Here, we use
   the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) to investigate the key
   parameters controlling ecological and hydrological activities for a
   semi-arid savanna woodland site in Maun, Botswana. Twenty-four
   eco-hydrological process parameters of a terrestrial ecosystem model are
   optimized against two data streams separately and simultaneously: daily
   averaged latent heat flux (LHF) derived from eddy covariance
   measurements, and decadal fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active
   radiation (FAPAR) derived from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor
   (SeaWiFS).
   Assimilation of both data streams LHF and FAPAR for the years 2000 and
   2001 leads to improved agreement between measured and simulated
   quantities not only for LHF and FAPAR, but also for photosynthetic CO2
   uptake. The mean uncertainty reduction (relative to the prior) over all
   parameters is 14.9\% for the simultaneous assimilation of LHF and FAPAR,
   8.5\% for assimilating LHF only, and 6.1\% for assimilating FAPAR only.
   The set of parameters with the highest uncertainty reduction is similar
   between assimilating only FAPAR or only LHF. The highest uncertainty
   reduction for all three cases is found for a parameter quantifying
   maximum plant-available soil moisture. This indicates that not only LHF
   but also satellite-derived FAPAR data can be used to constrain and
   indirectly observe hydrological quantities.},

Abstract = {The effects of a major storm event (Hurricane Gordon) on the
   biogeochemistry of Atlantic coastal and Gulf Stream waters were
   investigated during a research cruise in November 1991. Prestorm, NH4+,
   NO3-, and PO4-3 concentrations were consistently well below 1 mu M,
   whereas after the storm, nutrient concentrations were higher in the
   surface-water samples: >2 mu M, in some instances. Primary and secondary
   (bacterial) production were stimulated by factors of 5 and 2,
   respectively, up to 4 d following the storm. Bioassay experiments showed
   that additions of inorganic N stimulated chlorophyll a (Chl a)
   concentrations, (CO2)-C-14 fixation, and stable isotope fractionations
   both before and after the storm, but the addition of phosphate had a
   greater impact in post-storm experiments. The delta(15)N of particulate
   nitrogen (PN) varied from +5 to +1.5 parts per thousand before Gordon,
   then afterward attained a consistent value of +3.0 parts per thousand.
   Sedimentary organic delta(15)N values were similar to water-column
   organic N, and the delta(15)N Of dissolved NH4+ from surface sediments
   (+4.0 parts per thousand) almost matched the delta(15)N Of water-column
   particulates. These results indicate that storm-generated winds mixed
   sediments along with dissolved nutrients into surface waters, which
   supported a rapid increase in water-column primary production.},

Title = {Global multi-decadal ocean climate and small-pelagic fish population},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Ocean climate, environmental and biological conditions vary on several
   spatio-temporal scales. Besides climate change associated with
   anthropogenic activity, there is growing evidence of a natural global
   multi-decadal climate signal in the ocean-atmosphere-biosphere climate
   system. The spatio-temporal evolution of this signal is thus analyzed
   during the 20th century and compared to the variability of small-pelagic
   fish landings. It is argued that the low-frequency global ocean
   environment and plankton ecosystems must be modified such that
   small-pelagic populations vary accordingly. A small-pelagic global index
   or fishing `regime indicator series' RIS) i.e. a small-pelagic abundance
   indicator) is used. RIS is derived from fish landings data in the four
   main fishing areas in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Global RIS
   changes phase from positive to negative values) when SST multi-decadal
   anomalies are out-of-phase between the eastern Pacific and southern
   Atlantic. RIS also displays maxima during the mid-30s to early-40s and
   the late-70s to early-80s when the multi-decadal signal was
   approximately changing phases Tourre and White 2006 Geophys. Res. Lett.
   33 L06716). It is recognized that other factors may modulate fish
   stocks, including anthropogenic predation. Nevertheless it is proposed
   that variable climate and environment, and the low-frequency `global
   synchrony' of small-pelagic landings Schwartzlose et al 1999 S. Afr. J.
   Mar. Sci. 21 289-347), could be associated with the multi-decadal
   changes in global ocean climate conditions.},

Abstract = {Measurement of sediment deposition and erosion in coastal areas is a
   challenge due to soft shifting sediments, but is critical to assessing
   loss or restoration of coastal sediments and wetlands. The aim of this
   project was to design and construct a semi-autonomous boat with water
   depth measuring capabilities. It was intended to map the depth of
   coastal wetlands to determine erosion rates and assess coastal
   restoration effects. Depth-measuring equipment was incorporated into an
   autonomous pontoon boat powered by solar panels. The propulsion system
   consisted of two paddlewheels and two-way motors to allow movement and
   positioning for measurements. Modifications included a lightweight, hard
   coating on the pontoons and powder-coating the frame to extend their
   usable life. A microcontroller controlled the boat and captured depth
   data from sensors and location data with a GPS system. The depth
   measuring system consisted of a pulley and counter system that completed
   each measurement in less than 45 seconds. This allowed the boat to take
   approximately 400 measurements per day. Net accuracy was approximately 3
   cm in the tested configuration. The boat can continually measure the
   depth of specified areas in the wetlands; with this data, the change in
   depth can be monitored to see the effects of restoration projects.},

Abstract = {Oceania is a diverse region encompassing Australia, Melanesia,
   Micronesia, New Zealand, and Polynesia, and it contains six of the
   world's 39 hotspots of diversity. It has a poor record for extinctions,
   particularly for birds on islands and mammals. Major causes include
   habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, and overexploitation. We
   identified six major threatening processes (habitat loss and
   degradation, invasive species, climate change, overexploitation,
   pollution, and disease) based on a comprehensive review of the
   literature and for each developed a set of conservation policies. Many
   policies reflect the urgent need to deal with the effects of burgeoning
   human populations (expected to increase significantly in the region) on
   biodiversity. There is considerable difference in resources for
   conservation, including people and available scientific information,
   which are heavily biased toward more developed countries in Oceania.
   Most scientific publications analyzed for four threats (habitat loss,
   invasive species, overexploitation, and pollution) are from developed
   countries: 88.6\% of Web of Science publications were from Australia
   (53.7\%), New Zealand (24.3\%), and Hawaiian Islands (10.5\%). Many
   island states have limited resources or expertise. Even countries that
   do (e.g., Australia, New Zealand) have ongoing and emerging significant
   challenges, particularly with the interactive effects of climate change.
   Oceania will require the implementation of effective policies for
   conservation if the region's poor record on extinctions is not to
   continue.},

Abstract = {The present work revolves around the numerical simulation of floating
   offshore wind turbines, a promising technology for energy harnessing in
   deep water conditions. A reference 10MW wind turbine is studied, mounted
   on a commercial enhanced spar buoy, referred to as the WIND-bos
   platform. The focus is put on the hydrodynamic modeling. In particular,
   the Morison equation is used, accounting for a fixed set of
   coefficients. Those coefficients are initially estimated based on the
   literature, and subsequently calibrated through the comparison with
   experimental results on a scaled geometry. This allows to assess the
   modeling capabilities of the Morison approach, together with its
   challenges and limitations. Larger discrepancies between the numerical
   model and the experiments were assumed to be related to the geometrical
   particularities of the floating platform. In particular, the studied
   structure accounts for both large and slender members, potentially
   limiting the applicability of the method. It is shown that the
   deviations could be attributed to the frequency-variation of parameters
   such as the added mass, the radiation damping and viscous damping.
   Therefore, it is concluded that the agreement between the numerical
   model and the experiments could be improved by re-calibrating the
   coefficients for each of the studied sea states.},

Abstract = {A primary production model for the Barents Sea shows a hot spot of
   organic carbon settlement to the sea bed over 100 km long, a shallow
   pile of highly permeable sediments (mainly large Balanus, Mya and Pecten
   shell fragments over 1 cm in size) of glacial origin. Hydrodynamic flow
   models suggest an intensive, deep flow of near-bottom waters into the
   sediment. Depending on wave height, water in shallow (30 m depth) places
   may percolate more than 5 m into the sediment. During 10 days of stormy
   weather as much as 4 to 8 kg wet weight pelagic biomass can be processed
   per square metre through this extremely permeable sediment. Analogous
   processes known in coastal waters lead to intense biocatalytic phenomena
   and metabolism of organic carbon within the seabed, estimated here as
   more intense than surface consumption. Spitsbergenbanken may be acting
   as a huge sink for organic carbon and an important source of nutrients
   in one of the most productive areas of the North Atlantic.},

Abstract = {A regional climate model with high horizontal resolution (25 km) is used
   to downscale 20-year-long time slices of present-day (1980-1999) and
   future (2046-2065,2080-2099) Arctic climate, as simulated by the
   ECHAM5/MPI-OM general circulation model under the A1B emission scenario.
   Changes in simulated air temperature and derived indices at the end of
   the century indicate that significant impacts on permafrost conditions
   should be expected. But the magnitude of the change is regionally
   conditioned beyond what is obvious: Warm permafrost in the sporadic to
   discontinuous zone is threatened and may degrade or even complete thaw
   before the end of the century. A decrease in freezing and increase in
   thawing degree-days is interpreted as potential decrease in seasonal
   freeze depth and increase in active layer thickness (ALT). We show that
   for some regions increasing maximum summer temperature is associated
   with an increase of interannual temperature variability in summer, while
   in other regions decreased maximum summer temperatures are related to
   decreased variability. The occurrence of warm/cold summers and spells
   changes significantly in the future time slices using the present-day
   criteria for classification. Taken together this implies a regionally
   varying exposure to significant change in permafrost conditions. In
   addition to these aspects of the general warming trend that would
   promote an increase in ALT and a northward shift of the southern
   permafrost boundary, an analysis of the occurrence of warm summers and
   spells highlight some particularly vulnerable regions for permafrost
   degradation (e.g. West Siberian Plain, Laptev Sea coast, Canadian
   Archipelago), but also some less vulnerable regions (e.g. Mackenzie
   Mountains). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Despite the marked influence of relative humidity (RH) on ecosystems and
   human society, the spatiotemporal pattern of RH is far from clearly
   understood. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation in RH in
   Guangdong Province, South China, in the period of 1959-2017. The RH data
   were collected from 74 national standard meteorological stations. The
   spatiotemporal variation in RH was evaluated using rotate empirical
   orthogonal function (REOF) zoning, Mann-Kendall test, and wavelet
   transform methods. Based on the REOF decomposition situation of monthly
   RH field, Guangdong was divided into six subareas. The annual mean of RH
   in the whole province was 78.90\%. In terms of spatial variation,
   overall annual mean RH decreased from southwest to northeast in the
   province. Temporally, annual mean RH showed a declining trend in the
   last six decades. Particularly, the RH in the Pearl River Delta area
   declined at the rate of 1.349\%/10a. Mann-Kendall tests showed that
   mutation points of annual mean RH mostly appeared in the 1990s,
   especially in the early 1990s. Continuous wavelet transforms of annual
   mean RH displayed that inland subareas have similar cycle
   characteristics, and the east coast and Pearl River Delta have no
   significant period in most time domains. The results provide new
   understanding of RH variation in the last six decades in South China,
   which is valuable for detecting climate change, monitoring hazardous
   weather, and predicting future environmental change.},

Abstract = {Environmental problems associated with world's largest energy source
   namely fossil fuels are well known. In addition, petroleum and other
   nonrenewable energy sources are running out and will be depleted soon.
   However, many polymers are derived from petroleum. In the face of
   international movement away from oil-based polymers such as, general
   purpose polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, terephthalate, high
   density and low density polyethylene, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride,
   and towards a safe and sustainable future, major research labs in the
   world are trying to uncover the big breakthrough, particularly via
   utilizing natural/renewable agmresidues as a substrate for green
   biopolymers. Considering, non-edible lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) as a
   feedstock for bio-polymers production as it does not interfere with food
   security, generate no tailpipe emissions, and also lead to reduction in
   stubble burning. Among possible organic sources of biopolymers, micro-
   and macroalgae, provides a wide variety of proteins, lipids,
   polyphenols, and polysachharides which are currently employed for
   pharmaceutical, packaging, food, and biomedical applications. Current
   review summarizes the key insights on microbial biopolymer production
   from LCB and algal biomass by means of circular bioeconomy. Biobased
   approach will not only reduce the process cost but also generates
   economy for farmers globally and promotes innovation in domestic
   manufacturing.},

Abstract = {The ultraviolet (UV) spectral component of daylight on a clear day at
   mid-latitudes can significantly reduce phytoplankton pigments within a
   daylight period. Phytoplankton samples from Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan,
   dominated by cyanobacteria were incubated in quartz bottles under
   optical long band-pass filters (cutoff wavelength 420-305 nm) in
   daylight in June. After incubation, samples were filtered, and in vivo
   particle light absorption (380-700 nm) and pigment concentrations were
   measured. Solar ultraviolet-B irradiance (UV-B; 280-320 nm) was measured
   radiometrically. On sunny days the samples that were exposed to daylight
   UV light showed a relative decrease in particle absorption and pigment
   concentration after the incubation compared with samples exposed only to
   visible daylight. No such decrease was observed during an overcast day.
   The UV-B data did not show a clear relation with the degree of pigment
   reduction, suggesting that other environmental factors or the state of
   adaptation partially controlled the pigment decrease of phytoplankton
   under UV-B exposure. Neither specific spectral components of the
   absorption spectrum nor specific pigments were more easily degraded than
   others by solar UV light, although the ratio of zeaxanthin to
   chlorophyll a probably increased in cyanobacteria as a result of UV
   exposure.},

Title = {On the energy dissipation of jacket type offshore platforms with

Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {31},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In recent years, considerable amount of effort has been made to design
   earthquake resistant offshore structures in seismic active areas. In
   order to achieve this objective, all components of a typical structure
   should function properly to dissipate seismically-induced energy within
   the members. Among components of an offshore installation, braces are of
   significant importance as they contribute substantially to total energy
   dissipation of the structure. Buckling in compression and yielding in
   tension assist the process of energy absorption. Nevertheless, the
   functionality of braces is dependent upon their joints where joint-cans
   are included to avoid any brittle fracture and unpredicted failure
   mechanisms.
   In this paper, special attention is being paid to energy dissipation of
   jacket type offshore platforms with two different pile-leg interactions.
   A case study representing an offshore platform is studied both
   analytically and experimentally. Analytical models are validated step by
   step based on available experimental tests and observations on
   individual members. Several parameters such as cyclic behavior, maximum
   bearing load and most importantly energy dissipation of two different 2D
   frames are investigated. Results provide promising insights into design
   and fabrication of fixed platforms with different pile-leg interactions.

Abstract = {The four-box coupled atmosphere-ocean model of Marotzke is solved
   analytically, by introducing the approximation that the effect of
   oceanic heat advection on ocean temperatures is small (but not
   negligible) compared to the effect of surface heat fluxes. The solutions
   are written in a form that displays how the stability of the
   thermohaline circulation depends on the relationship between atmospheric
   meridional transports of heat and moisture and the meridional
   temperature gradient. In the model, these relationships are assumed to
   be power laws with different exponents allowed for the dependence of the
   transports of hear and moisture on the gradient. The approximate
   analytic solutions are in good agreement with Marotzke's exact numerical
   solutions, but show more generally how the destabilization of the
   thermohaline circulation depends on the sensitivity of the atmospheric
   transports to the meridional temperature gradient. The solutions are
   also used to calculate how the stability of the thermohaline circulation
   is changed if model errors are ``corrected{''} by using conventional
   flux adjustments. Errors like those common in GCMs destabilize the
   model's thermohaline circulation, even if conventional flux adjustments
   are used. However, the resulting errors in the magnitude of the critical
   perturbations necessary to destabilize the thermohaline circulation can
   be corrected by modifying transport efficiencies instead.},

Pages = {191-203},
Abstract = {This article proposes a probabilistic neural network based islanding
   detection technique for distributed generation considering multiple
   parameters in order to secure the detection of islanding for any
   possible network topology. This approach utilizes different parameters
   (features), such as rate of change of frequency, rate of change of
   voltage, rate of change of power, rate of change of frequency over
   power, total harmonic distortion (current), and rate of change of power
   factor, derived at the target distributed generation location and fed to
   the probabilistic neural network for automatic islanding detection.
   While comparing with other techniques, such as the radial basis function
   neural network and decision tree, the probabilistic neural network based
   technique is found to be highly effective in islanding detection. The
   proposed algorithm has been tested for simulation model, as well as the
   real-time digital simulator, and results indicate that the proposed
   method can reliably detect islanding conditions in the power
   distribution network with multiple distributed generation interface.},

Abstract = {Energy plays a major role in global economic landscape. The
   modernization of energy infrastructure otherwise called Power Grid, with
   integration of renewable energy sources like Solar, Wind have emerged as
   a key focus area across the world. The Smart grid vision generally
   describes a power system that is more intelligent, more decentralized
   and resilient, more controllable and better protected than todays grid.
   Integrated Communications becomes one of five key technologies for Smart
   Grid. In the SmartGrid evolution Microgrid enjoys major significance.
   Microgrid comprises of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) including
   Solar, Wind and tidal etc. on one side and a set of loads serviced by
   this energy generation on the other side. By using Microgrids and
   integrating renewable sources, we can satisfy the needs of residential,
   campus or community wide energy needs and since it is intended for local
   consumption, involves reduced capital. Microgrids being an emerging
   scenario, significant exploration on the use of new technologies is
   applied on these systems. In order to satisfy the reach and ability of
   communication in these networks including rural areas, it becomes a
   necessity to consider the Internet and Telecom based wireless networks.
   There are two specific trends in this area which are of interest, which
   are Internet Of Things (IoT) and Software Defined Networks. The Purpose
   of this Study is to explore these technologies in the context of
   Automation Systems considering the use cases from Microgrid Systems.},

Abstract = {Fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA) and an acid-extractable organic
   fraction were extracted from sediment samples taken during an aerobic
   slurry experiment.  Dissolved organic carbon was measured in the
   different extracts.  FAs and HAs were characterized by IR-spectroscopy
   and UV absorption measurements.  From sediment samples taken on the same
   days as those for organic extractions, Cu was extracted according to a
   sequential extraction procedure.  The extraction step using
   Na-dodecylsulphate (Dod) is thought to extract Cu associated with low
   molecular weight FAs and HAs.
   Changes with time in the characteristics of particulate organic matter
   and in the amounts of the different fractions were small.  The various
   results, however, pointed in the same direction.  The amount of FAs
   increased linearly with time.  Probably the molecular size of the FAs
   and HAs decreased with time.  The increases in FA and the decrease in
   molecular size of FAs and HAs resulted both in increasing complexation
   capacities of the organic acids with regard to Cu.  This coincided with
   the increase of Cu with time in the fraction extracted with Dod. 
   Moreover, the results indicated that during the degradation of organic
   matter FAs were formed out of HAs according to the so-called
   degradative-pathway theory.},

   article presents a numerical simulation and a field measurement to study
   the wave conditions in the nearshore island area for sea-crossing
   bridges. Pingtan Strait sea-crossing bridge site was selected as an
   example of nearshore island area. A 3-day high-energy wave event was
   measured and simulated using spectral wave model. The parameters of the
   numerical model were calibrated through the comparison with the field
   measured wave data. The spatial pattern of wave conditions along the
   bridge and the wave-breaking zone were analyzed based on the calibrated
   model. The analytical procedures suggested in the Chinese Code for
   nearshore wave prediction were finally testified through the comparison
   with numerical results. The research showed that (1) spectral wave model
   predicts the wave conditions in bridge site reasonably; (2) seabed
   terrain and islands significantly influence wave conditions, wave
   spatial pattern, and breaking wave zones; and (3) analytical wave
   simulation procedure recommended in the Code is not suitable to island
   area for sea-crossing bridge. This research allows a better
   understanding of wave conditions for sea-crossing bridge site and could
   provide useful reference for engineering practice.},

Title = {Exploring the financing and allocating schemes for the Chinese Green
   Climate Fund},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Abstract = {Chinese Green Climate Fund (GCF) is expected to launch by the government
   in the foreseeable future to support local governments in climate change
   adaption and mitigation. Lessons from experiences of international
   financing and allocating mechanisms provide valuable references for
   establishing the Chinese GCF. This study aims to explore the feasibility
   of several well-recognized schemes for financing and allocating the
   Chinese GCF among China's 30 provinces. These include: financing schemes
   of historical emission responsibility (HR), ability-to-pay (AP) and
   preference score compromises (PSC); as well as allocating schemes of
   carbon emissions intensity (CI), carbon emissions per capital (CC), GDP
   per capital (GC) and PSC. This study derives several important findings.
   Firstly, given different financing schemes, the coastal economically
   developed provinces including Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Zhejiang
   would collectively shoulder most of the financing responsibility (almost
   70\% in total) and play central roles in climate financing. Shandong
   province presents high financing responsibilities mainly due to its
   export trades of primary products which rely on the development of
   high-polluted industries. Other three provinces show high financing
   responsibilities mainly due to the rapid growth of their industries
   (petrochemical, steel, building materials, electric power, etc.) for
   economic development. Secondly, the inland economically backward
   provinces including Shanxi, Ningxia, Guizhou, Xinjiang, and Gansu would
   be the top five largest recipients of the funds, obtaining more than
   30\% of total disbursements. The innovations and contributions of the
   present study are as follows: Firstly, this paper systematically
   explored the feasibility and alternative schemes for Chinese GCF for the
   first time. Further, it introduces PSC methods based on diversified
   approaches to explore suitable financing and allocating schemes. The
   schemes proposed would establish theoretical foundations for the Chinese
   GCF and would also promote the development of other kinds of financing
   for China and countries with similar economic features.},

Title = {Northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge Hydrothermal Habitats: A Systematic Review
   of Knowledge Status for Environmental Management},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Highly specialised biota occurring at hydrothermally active vents on the
   northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (nMAR: from south of Iceland to the Equator)
   have been the subject of numerous research projects over the 36-year
   period since these habitats were first discovered in the region. When
   hydrothermal activity ceases, biota endemic to hydrothermally active
   habitats are lost, and a new biota colonise these sites. Little is known
   about the biota colonising hydrothermally inactive sulphide habitats on
   the nMAR, although these sites may be the target of deep-sea mining
   within the next decade. In this review, we seek to clarify the current
   knowledge of biological communities colonising hydrothermally active
   habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR. To achieve this, we
   (1) used a systematic review process to update the species list of
   benthic invertebrates associated with hydrothermally active habitats,
   (2) conducted a regional biogeographic analysis of hydrothermally active
   vent fields on the nMAR, (3) undertook a comprehensive literature review
   to provide a descriptive account of biological communities, and (4)
   identified key knowledge gaps in the current understanding of nMAR
   hydrothermally active and inactive ecosystems. Our updated species list
   increases the number of benthic invertebrates recorded from
   hydrothermally active habitats on the nMAR to 158 taxa. Our regional
   biogeographic analysis separates nMAR hydrothermal vent fields into
   distinct clusters based on depth/latitude and chimney composition. Vent
   fields close to the Azores (Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, Rainbow) formed a
   separate cluster from those at greater depths south of the Azores
   (Broken Spur, TAG, Snake Pit, Logatchev, and Ashadze-1). Moytirra,
   located north of the Azores, clustered separately, as did Lost City with
   its unique carbonate chimneys. We present detailed information on the
   biological communities at hydrothermally active and inactive habitats in
   this region, and discuss the information available on the diversity,
   ecosystem function, trophic relationships, connectivity, temporal
   variability, and resilience and recovery of these communities. Many
   knowledge gaps still exist, with detailed information needed on all
   aspects of the biological communities at hydrothermally active habitats
   and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR to understand and predict
   impacts from natural and human-induced disturbances in the region.},

Abstract = {The environmental and sodo-economic importance of coastal areas is
   widely recognized, but at present these areas face severe weaknesses and
   high-risk situations. The increased demand and growing human occupation
   of coastal zones have greatly contributed to exacerbating such
   weaknesses. Today, throughout the world, in all countries with coastal
   regions, episodes of waves overtopping and coastal flooding are
   frequent. These episodes are usually responsible for property losses and
   often put human lives at risk. The floods are caused by coastal storms
   primarily due to the action of very strong winds. The propagation of
   these storms towards the coast induces high water levels. It is expected
   that climate change phenomena will contribute to the intensification of
   coastal storms. In this context, an estirnation of coastal flooding
   hazards is of paramount importance for the planning and management of
   coastal zones. Consequently, carrying out a series of storm scenarios
   and analyzing their impacts through numerical modeling is of prime
   interest to coastal decision-makers. Firstly, throughout this work,
   historical storm tracks and intensities are characterized for the
   northeastern region of United States coast, in terms of probability of
   occurrence. Secondly, several storm events with high potential of
   occurrence are generated using a specific tool of DelftDashboard
   interface for Delft3D software. Hydrodynamic models are then used to
   generate ensemble simulations to assess storms' effects on coastal water
   levels. For the United States' northeastern coast, a highly refined
   regional domain is considered surrounding the area of The Battery, New
   York, situated in New York Harbor. Based on statistical data of
   numerical modeling results, a review of the impact of coastal storms to
   different locations within the study area is performed. (C) 2015

Title = {Impact of Sea Ice Melting on Summer Air-Sea CO2 Exchange in the East
   Siberian Sea},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {The role of sea ice melting on the air-sea CO2 flux was investigated at
   two ice camps in the East Siberian Sea of the Arctic Ocean. On average,
   sea ice samples from the two ice camps had a total alkalinity (TA) of
   similar to 108 and similar to 31 mu mol kg(-1) and a corresponding
   salinity of 1.39 and 0.36, respectively. A portion (18-23\% as an
   average) of these sea ice TA values was estimated to exist in the sea
   ice with zero salinity, which indicates the excess TA was likely
   attributed to chemical (CaCO3 formation and dissolution) and biological
   processes in the sea ice. The dilution by sea ice melting could increase
   the oceanic CO2 uptake to 11-12 mmol m(-2) d(-1) over the next 21 days
   if the mixed layer depth and sea ice thickness were assumed to be 18.5
   and 1.5 m, respectively. This role can be further enhanced by adding TA
   (including excess TA) from sea ice melting, but a simultaneous release
   of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) counteracts the effect of TA supply.
   In our study region, the additional impact of sea ice melting with close
   to unity TA:DIC ratio on air-sea CO2 exchange was not significant.},

Abstract = {The response of the benthic microbial community to a controlled
   sub-seabed CO2 leak was assessed using quantitative PCR measurements of
   benthic bacterial, archaeal and cyanobacteria/chloroplast 16S rRNA
   genes. Samples were taken from four zones (epicentre; 25 m distant, 75 m
   distant and 450 m distant) during 6 time points (7 days before CO2
   exposure, after 14 and 36 days of CO2 release, and 6, 20 and 90 days
   after the CO2 release had ended). Changes to the active community of
   microphytobenthos and bacteria were also assessed before, during and
   after CO2 release. Increases in the abundance of microbial 16S rRNA were
   detected after 14 days of CO2 release and at a distance of 25 m from the
   epicentre. CO2 related changes to the relative abundance of both major
   and minor bacterial taxa were detected: most notably an increase in the
   relative abundance of the Planctomycetacia after 14 days of CO2 release.
   Also evident was a decrease in the abundance of microbial 16S rRNA genes
   at the leak epicentre during the initial recovery phase: this coincided
   with the highest measurements of DIC within the sediment, but may be
   related to the release of potentially toxic metals at this time point.

Abstract = {This study examines experiences of grid operators to successfully
   integrate very high penetrations of wind and solar photovoltaic (PV)
   resources. The variability of these resources creates challenges in
   balancing the system generation and demand, and ensuring resource
   adequacy and essential reliability services. The inverter-based nature
   of wind and solar PV leads to challenges in frequency, transient, and
   small-signal stability. In this study, seven system operators
   demonstrate the ability to manage these challenges in a variety of power
   systems, from stand-alone island systems to larger island systems that
   are interconnected to neighbours, to balancing authorities that are
   strongly interconnected within very large synchronous systems. They
   operate within a variety of market constructs, from full regional
   transmission operators to vertically-integrated utilities. All are
   experiencing increases in the penetration of inverter-based, variable
   energy resources and finding creative solutions to these challenges.},

Abstract = {In the last five years, Australia has experienced a rapid deployment of
   household rooftop PV systems, to the extent that around 1.25 million
   households (15 \% of all households) now have rooftop PV systems.
   Experience from this ``social experiment{''} may provide useful insights
   for other countries considering similar scenarios. Indonesia has
   deployed PV systems since the 1970's with a hiatus caused by the Asian
   Financial Crisis in 1997. Significant deployment of PV systems
   recommenced after the turn of the century for both off-grid and
   grid-connected applications, with the grid-connected PV systems being
   connected to isolated diesel power systems on the smaller islands of the
   Indonesian archipelago. This paper discusses the nature of the
   Australian and Indonesian experiences with PV systems from technical,
   social, economic and policy perspectives, with the intention of
   providing insights to other countries contemplating similar scenarios. A
   key recommendation is to adopt a carefully planned and implemented
   strategy that avoids triggering a divisive cultural contest. (C) 2015

Abstract = {The Terra spacecraft (formerly identified as EOS AM-1) is the flagship
   in a planned series of NASA/GSFC Earth observing system satellites
   designed to provide information on the health of the Earth's land,
   oceans, air, ice, and life as a total ecological global system. It has
   been successfully performing its mission since a late-December 1999
   launch into a 705 km polar orbit. The spacecraft is powered by a single
   wing, flexible blanket array using single junction (SJ) gallium
   arsenide/ germanium (GaAs/Ge) solar cells sized to provide 5 year
   end-of-life (EOL) power of greater than 5000 W at 127 Volts. It is
   currently the highest voltage and power operational flexible blanket
   array with GaAs/Ge cells. This paper briefly describes the wing design
   as a basis for discussing the operation of the electronics and
   mechanisms used to achieve successful on-orbit deployment. Its orbital
   electrical performance to date will be presented and compared to
   analytical predictions based on ground qualification testing. The paper
   concludes with a brief section on future applications and performance
   trends using advanced multi-junction cells and weight-efficient
   mechanical components.},

   Pitch},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Vertical axis turbines, also called Darrieus turbines, present
   interesting characteristics for offshore wind and tidal applications but
   suffer from vibrations and a lower efficiency than the more conventional
   horizontal axis turbines. The use of variable pitch, in order to control
   the angle of attack of the blades continuously during their rotation, is
   considered in this study to overcome these problems. 2D blade-resolved
   unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are employed
   to evaluate the performance improvement that pitching blades can bring
   to the optimal performance of a three-straight-blade vertical axis tidal
   turbine. Three pitching laws are defined and tested. They aim to reduce
   the angle of attack of the blades in the upstream half of the turbine.
   No pitching motion is used in the downstream half. The streamwise
   velocity, monitored at the center of the turbine, together with the
   measurement of the blades' angle of attack help show the effectiveness
   of the proposed pitching laws. The decrease in the angle of attack in
   the upstream half of a revolution leads to a significant increase in the
   power coefficient (+40\%) and to a better balance of the torque
   generated in the upstream and downstream halves. Both torque and thrust
   ripples are therefore significantly reduced.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of maritime
   green supply chain management (MGSCM) on sustainable business
   performance. This paper addresses the complex dimensions of
   `sustainability' to be integrated into maritime supply chain activities
   with the existing green supply chain concept linking the concept with
   the extended bottom line dimensions of sustainable business operations.
   To achieve the objective, an online survey was administrated to various
   maritime supply chain companies in Malaysia. The findings confirmed that
   MGSCM practices indirectly facilitate sustainable economic,
   environmental, operational and social performance for these businesses.
   This paper presents practical suggestions for maritime practitioners
   that highlight the need to materialise green practices adoption in the
   maritime supply chain in the future.},

Title = {Vegetation Dynamics and Their Influencing Factors in China from 1998 to
   2019},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Vegetation is a critical component of ecosystems that is influenced by
   climate change and human activities. It is therefore of great importance
   to investigate trends in vegetation dynamics and explore how these are
   influenced by climate and human activities. This will help formulate
   effective ecological restoration policies and ensure sustainable
   development. As the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is
   strongly correlated with vegetation dynamics and may be used as a proxy
   measure for vegetation condition, the spatiotemporal characteristics of
   NDVI derived from SPOT/VEGETATION NDVI data in China over the 1998-2019
   period were assessed using the Mann-Kendall test and the Hurst exponent.
   The Pearson correlation analysis and residual analysis methods were
   employed to analyze the influencing factors of NDVI dynamics.
   Integrating the results of the Hurst exponent and the NDVI trend
   analysis, it was found that the majority area of China is presenting an
   increasing NDVI trend at present but is likely to reverse in the future.
   A significant positive correlation between the NDVI and temperature was
   observed on the southeast coast of China and the north Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau. Precipitation was the dominant factor affecting vegetation
   dynamics as indicated by a positive correlation with the NDVI for most
   parts of China except for the inland area in the Northwest and the
   Hengduan Mountains in Southwest China. Extreme temperature and extreme
   precipitation have also shown varying degrees of influence on vegetation
   dynamics at various locations. In addition, this study revealed trends
   of increasing NDVI, suggesting improved vegetation condition
   attributable to the implementation of ecological engineering projects.
   This study is helpful for studying the interaction mechanisms between
   terrestrial ecosystems and climate and for sustaining the ecological
   environment.},

Title = {Anthropogenic Transformation Disconnects a Lowland River From

Abstract = {Rivers transport carbon from continents to oceans. Surprisingly, this
   carbon has often been found to be centuries old, not originating from
   contemporary plant biomass. This can be explained by anthropogenic
   disturbance of soils or discharge of radiocarbon-depleted wastewater.
   However, land enclosure and channel bypassing transformed many rivers
   from anabranching networks to single-channel systems with overbank
   sediment accumulation and lowered floodplain groundwater tables. We
   hypothesized that human development changed the fluvial carbon towards
   older sources by changing the morphology of watercourses. We studied
   radiocarbon in the Elbe, a European, anthropogenically-transformed
   lowland river at discharges between low flow and record peak flow. We
   found that the inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and
   particulate organic carbon was aged and up to 1850 years old. The
   increment C-14 values remained low and invariant up to median
   discharges, indicating that the sources of modern carbon (fixed after
   1950) were disconnected from the river during half of the time. The
   total share of modern carbon in DOC export was marginal (0.04\%), 72\%
   of exported DOC was older than 400 years. This was in contrast to
   undisturbed forested subcatchments, 72\% of whose exported DOC was
   modern. Although population density is high, mass balances showed that
   wastewater did not significantly affect the increment C-14-DOC in the
   Elbe river. We conclude that wetlands and other sources of contemporary
   carbon were decoupled from the anthropogenically transformed Elbe stream
   network with incised stream bed relative to overbank sediments, shifting
   the sources of fluvial carbon in favor of aged stores.},

Title = {Design, construction, and operation of an actively controlled deep-sea

Abstract = {We describe the design, testing, and performance of an actively
   controlled deep-sea Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (dp-FOCE) system for the
   execution of seafloor experiments relating to the impacts of ocean
   acidification on natural ecosystems. We used the 880 m deep MARS
   (Monterey Accelerated Research System) cable site offshore Monterey Bay,
   California for this work, but the Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (FOCE)
   system concept is designed to be scalable and can be modified to be used
   in a wide variety of ocean depths and locations. The main frame is based
   on a flume design with active thruster control of flow and a central
   experimental chamber. The unit was allowed to free fall to the seafloor
   and connected to the cable node by remotely operated vehicle (ROV)
   manipulation. For operation at depth we designed a liquid CO2
   containment reservoir which provided the CO2 enriched working fluid as
   ambient seawater was drawn through the reservoir beneath the more
   buoyant liquid CO2. Our design allowed for the significant lag time
   associated with the hydration of the dissolved CO2 molecule, resulting
   in an e-folding time, tau, of 97 s between fluid injection and pH
   sensing at the mean local T=4.31 +/- 0.14 degrees C and pH(T) of 7.625
   +/- 0.011. The system maintained a pH offset of similar to 0.4 pH units
   compared to the surrounding ocean for a period of similar to 1 month.
   The unit allows for the emplacement of deep-sea animals for testing. We
   describe the components and software used for system operation and show
   examples of each. The demonstrated ability for active control of
   experimental systems opens new possibilities for deep-sea biogeochemical
   perturbation experiments of several kinds and our developments in open
   source control systems software and hardware described here are
   applicable to this end. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Wind is one of the major natural forest disturbances in Europe, and
   reduces the total economic (including carbon sequestration) value of
   forests. The aim of this study was to assess the financial benefit of
   silvicultural measures in young, pure, planted Norway spruce stands by
   reduction in the impact of wind damage over the rotation period. The
   analyzed measures are promptly applied precommercial thinning and
   low-density planting with improved plant material. Spatial information
   on factors affecting wind damage-wind climate and soil-were gathered and
   combined with the local growth model and empirical data from tree
   pulling experiments in Latvia to assess the economic value loss due to
   wind damage over a rotation period. Timely precommercial thinning and
   lower-density planting with improved plant material would ensure a
   positive net present value with an interest rate of 3\%, using
   conservative estimates. The financial benefit is highest in windier
   (coastal) regions and for the planting, followed by moderate thinning.
   The results demonstrate that, even without changing the dominant tree
   species, a considerable reduction in wind-damage risk can be achieved.},

Title = {COMPOSITION, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY OF PERACARID CRUSTACEANS ON A
   TRANSECT OF THE KOLBEINSEY RIDGE, NORTH OF ICELAND},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Composition, abundance, and diversity of Crustacea Peracarida were
   investigated on a transect across the Kolbeinsey Ridge, north of Iceland
   in summer 1992 during the M21/5 expedition with RV Meteor. This ridge is
   influenced by both the cold East Greenland Current as well as the warmer
   East Iceland Current, mixing with warmer Atlantic water. Sampling has
   been performed using an epibenthic sledge modified after Rothlishberg \&
   Pearcy (1977). Being one of the most important components of the
   macrobenthic epi- and suprafauna, composition, abundance, and diversity
   of peracarids was significantly different on western and eastern sides
   of the slope. Isopoda and Amphipoda were most frequent at all stations,
   followed by Cumacea and Tanaidacea. Mysidacea have only been sampled on
   the eastern slope. Abundance and diversity were highest on the two
   eastern stations in depths of 830-940 meters, values decreased on the
   deepest eastern station in 1100 meter depth and were also low on both
   western stations in 830 and 860 meters depth. These differences are
   probably due to sediment composition and to quality and quantity of
   organic carbon reaching the seafloor, rather than to differences in
   salinity or in hydrographic regimes. The high abundance of peracarid
   crustaceans, especially of epibenthic species, capable of burrowing
   within the first centimeters of sediment, indicate their high potential
   of bioturbation and also their importance for benthic carbon cycling.},

Title = {Observed tropical cyclone-driven cold wakes in the context of rapid
   warming of the Arabian Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY},
Abstract = {We present a detailed long-term (1997-2019) analysis of observed
   cyclone-induced surface cooling (or cold wake) in the Arabian Sea. Here,
   the analysis is performed for 33 cyclones that drove significant cooling
   at the sea surface in three different seasons: the pre-monsoon, monsoon
   and post-monsoon. Our study shows that cyclones can cool the sea surface
   up to 4.76 degrees C after their passage, depending on the intensity,
   duration and other factors that contribute to cooling. The monsoon and
   pre-monsoon cyclones show stronger cooling, but the post-monsoon
   cyclones exhibit a longer duration (8-10 days) of cooling and slower
   recovery time (15 days). In general, the pre- and monsoon cyclones
   exhibit a strong positive correlation with the Latent Heat Flux, whereas
   the post-monsoon cyclones show a higher correlation with Ekman Pumping
   Velocity, wind stress and intensity of cyclones. The cold wake composite
   analysis for the El-Nino, La-Nina and Normal years shows that
   cyclone-induced cooling is similar in El-Nino and La-Nina years, and the
   cooling is more dominant during the negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
   than that in the positive IOD years. Co-occurrence of positive IOD and
   La Nina events has led to more intense cyclones in recent decades. The
   power dissipation index, accumulated cyclone energy and oceanic heat
   content also show an increasing trend in AS and favour rapid
   intensification of cyclones. Since the drop in SST normally impedes
   cyclones from intensification, our study is important and the findings
   of this study will aid in tropical cyclone predictions. In response to
   rapid warming of Indian Ocean in recent decades, extreme events such as
   cyclones are expected to increase in the context of climate change.},

Title = {Foraging ecology of large pelagic fishes in the US South Atlantic:
   structured piscivory shapes trophic niche variation},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {631},

Abstract = {Sustainable management of marine fishery resources requires an
   understanding of the ecological relationships that contribute to
   community structure and population dynamics. In offshore marine
   ecosystems, the functional roles played by many large pelagic predators
   are poorly understood, yet this knowledge is essential to
   ecosystem-based management approaches. Here we report on the results of
   a multiyear (2010-2013) study to evaluate the trophic relationships
   within a guild of apex predatory fishes in the western Atlantic Ocean.
   Quantitative diet analyses were completed for wahoo Acanthocybium
   solandri, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, yellowfin tuna Thunnus
   albacares, and blackfin tuna T. atlanticus during multiple seasons.
   Fishes were the most important prey by mass for all predators during all
   seasons and occurred with high frequency; however, crustacean and
   molluscan prey were also important dietary components for most of the
   predators. The diversity of prey eaten was high, with nearly 50 unique
   families represented; yet, a few prey groups such as scombrid fishes
   (Auxis spp.), flying fish (exocoetids), and ommastrephid squids,
   occurred more universally and dominated the diets of some predators
   during certain seasons. Diet similarity was highest between dolphinfish
   and blackfin tuna and also between wahoo and yellowfin tuna, but was
   generally dependent on season and driven by overlap in fish prey.
   Importantly, the extent of piscivory and specialization on unique fish
   prey groups supported a structured piscivore guild within this pelagic
   ecosystem, leading to separation among trophic niches and reduced
   overlap in prey resources. Our findings provide a temporally (seasonal
   and inter-annual) extensive evaluation of the trophic relationships
   among large pelagic fish predators in the US South Atlantic, which
   should inform an ecosystem-based understanding of community dynamics and
   fishery impacts.},

Abstract = {A key requirement for managing commercial fisheries is understanding the
   geographic footprint of the resource, the level of exploitation and the
   potential impacts of changing climate or habitat conditions. The
   development of spatially explicit predictive models of species
   distributions combined with predictions of changing oceanographic
   conditions provides the opportunity to obtain new insights of
   species-habitat associations. Here, generalized linear models (GLMs)
   were used to model the abundance of two commercially important marine
   macro-invertebrates, blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra and long-spined sea
   urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii, along the coast of Victoria,
   Australia. We combined abundance data from fisheries independent diver
   surveys with environmental variables derived from bathymetric light
   detection and ranging (LiDAR) and oceanographic parameters derived from
   satellite imagery. The GLM was used to predict species responses to
   environmental gradients where reef complexity, sea surface temperature
   (SST) and depth were strongly associated with species distributions. The
   abundance of H.rubra declined with increasing summer SST. In comparison,
   the abundance of C.rodgersii increased with increasing winter SST. The
   GLM showed that the projected increase in ocean temperatures will likely
   lead to a decline in abundance across the H.rubra fishery. Conversely, a
   range expansion of C.rodgersii is likely due to the strengthening of the
   East Australian Current. For species that exhibit a high affinity to
   specific seascape features, this research demonstrated how recent
   advances in seabed mapping can allow the identification of areas with
   high conservation or fisheries value at a fine-scale relevant to
   resource exploitation across large geographic regions.},

Title = {Interactive effects of multiple stressors revealed by sequencing total
   (DNA) and active (RNA) components of experimental sediment microbial
   communities},

Abstract = {Coastal waterways are increasingly exposed to multiple stressors, e.g.
   contaminants that can be delivered via pulse or press exposures.
   Therefore, it is crucial that ecological impacts can be differentiated
   among stressors to manage ecosystem threats. We investigated microbial
   community development in sediments exposed to press and pulse stressors.
   Press exposures were created with in situ mesocosm sediments containing
   a range of `metal' concentrations (sediment contaminated with multiple
   metal(loid)s) and organic enrichment (fertiliser), while the pulse
   exposure was simulated by a single dose of organic fertiliser. All
   treatments and exposure concentrations were crossed in a fully factorial
   field experiment. We used amplicon sequencing to compare the sensitivity
   of the 1) total (DNA) and active (RNA) component of 2) bacterial (16S
   rRNA) and eukaryotic (18S rRNA) communities to contaminant exposures.
   Overall microbial community change was greater when exposed to press
   than pulse stressors, with the bacterial community responding more
   strongly than the eukaryotes. The total bacterial community represents a
   more time-integrated measure of change and proved to be more sensitive
   to multiple stressors than the active community. Metals and organic
   enrichment treatments interacted such that the effect of metals was
   weaker when the sediment was organically enriched. Taxa-level analyses
   revealed that press enrichment resulted in potential functional changes,
   mainly involving nitrogen cycling. Furthermore, enrichment generally
   reduced the abundance of active eukaryotes in the sediment. As well as
   demonstrating interactive impacts of metals and organic enrichment, this
   study highlights the sensitivity of next-generation sequencing for
   ecosystem biomonitoring of interacting stressors and identifies
   opportunities for more targeted application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A critical review on second- and third-generation bioethanol production
   using microwaved-assisted heating (MAH) pretreatment},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {152},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the pursuit of the 7th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the
   United Nations, it is driven to develop affordable, sustainable, and
   clean energy. Second (lignocellulosic) and third (microalgae and
   macroalgae) generation bioethanol appear to be the most favorable
   renewable feedstocks to meet SDG 7 pursuance. However, several feedstock
   pretreatments have shown process challenges in terms of yield and
   product inhibitors. Microwave-assisted heating (MAH) has gained positive
   attention as a novel alternative method for pretreatment heating in the
   global community due to its numerous advantages over conventional
   heating. Therefore, current studies and progress in MAH pretreatment for
   bioethanol production are critically reviewed. The effects of different
   parameters on MAH pretreatment are also examined. The application of MAH
   pretreatment demonstrates rapid reaction exhibiting remarkable
   improvement in sugar recovery and fewer inhibitors over conventional
   heating. Despite these advanced results, certain obstacles remain to be
   addressed and improved until it is ready for industrial scalability. It
   includes understanding the interaction and relationship between the
   different parameters like biomass loading, catalysts, temperature, power
   intensity, contact time, and pressure for reactor design. Moreover,
   factors such as the non-thermal effect, dielectric properties of
   different biomass materials, and controlled temperature need to be
   further explored and evaluated. Thus, continuous research and
   development efforts on MAH pretreatment are encouraged to become
   commercially feasible for the applications of bioethanol production.},

Title = {Validation of an advective-deterministic approach to short wave breaking
   in a surf-beat model},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {69-83},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An advective-deterministic approach (ADA) to model wave energy
   dissipation through breaking is presented. This is calibrated against
   experimental irregular wave data with a high spatial density of surface
   elevation records using a wave-group-forced surf-beat model, XBeach. In
   the ADA breaker model, wave breaking is turned on and off by specifying
   upper and lower values of the breaker parameter (the latter termed wave
   reforming as in Daily et al. (1985)) and the state of breaking is
   advected shoreward at the individual wave celerity. For the validation
   of the proposed ADA model, results are compared with the breaker
   formulation of Roelvink (1993) using 10 prototype field experiment cases
   and 32 laboratory flume experiment cases. The ADA breaker model shows
   good results for short wave height transformation and significant
   improvement is obtained for the fraction of breaking waves over the
   Roelvink (1993) formulation, with the modelled data quantitatively and
   qualitatively representing measurements. It is possible that the ADA
   wave breaking model could influence other surf zone processes such as
   low frequency wave generation and nearshore circulation patterns. (C)

Title = {Physics of island divertors as highlighted by the example of W7-AS},
Journal = {NUCLEAR FUSION},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {46},
Number = {8},
Pages = {807-819},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Based on theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experimental
   results, the paper outlines a self-consistent physics picture of the
   island divertor transport in W7-AS, as it emerges from the present
   understanding, documented over the past several years of theoretical and
   experimental research on the subject. Key function elements of a
   divertor, such as particle flux enhancement, neutral screening, impurity
   retention, thermal power removal via impurity line radiation and
   detachment, are examined for the island divertor and assessed with
   respect to tokamak divertors. The paper focuses on describing the global
   scrape-off layer (SOL) transport behaviour associated with the specific
   island topology and aims at illustrating the elementary differences and
   similarities in divertor physics between a tokamak and a typical helical
   device. Shown and analysed are also the correlation between the SOL and
   core plasma and the role of the island divertor for improving the global
   plasma performance. Discussion is mainly based on simple models and
   estimations, while three-dimensional modelling calculations serve only
   for control of self-consistency and for determining basic functional
   dependences not accessible otherwise. The island divertor physics is
   presented within a theoretical frame with most key issues, however,
   being related to experimental results.},

   Assessment in Kona, Hawaii},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {141},
Number = {12, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Payments for watershed management link upstream inhabitants whose
   actions affect water resources with downstream water users. This paper
   evaluates the effect of plausible shifts in watershed land use on
   hydrologic services on the Kona coast of Hawai'i Island by measuring
   vegetation effects on hydrologic fluxes, modeling land-use change impact
   on the water-supply aquifer, and evaluating the local water department's
   associated pumping expenses. Transitions between native and plantation
   forest will have a 25-40\% greater impact on the aquifer than the
   transition from pasture to either forest type. However, for all
   transitions, the value to the water department is just 2-5\% of the
   opportunity cost to landowners. To provide context for these findings,
   the effects of these land transitions on carbon storage, provision of
   native bird habitat, and land stewardship are assessed. Estimates show
   that delivery of other services does not always increase when water
   services increase and suggest that the value of impacts to these other
   services are greater than effects on water. In Kona, as in any watershed
   payment project, the particular physical and social context determines
   which services are valuable. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {Polysaccharides from seaweeds are widely used in various fields,
   including the food, biomedical material, cosmetic, and biofuel
   industries. Alginate, which is a major polysaccharide in brown algae,
   and the products of its degradation (oligosaccharides) have been used in
   stabilizers, thickeners, and gelling agents, especially in the food
   industry. Discovering novel alginate lyases with unique characteristics
   for the efficient production of oligosaccharides may be relevant for the
   food and pharmaceutical fields. In this study, we identified a unique
   alginate lyase derived from an alginate-utilizing bacterium, Shewanella
   species YH1. The recombinant enzyme (rAlgSV1-PL7) was produced in an
   Escherichia coli system and it was classified in the Polysaccharide
   Lyase family 7. The optimal temperature and pH for rAlgSV1-PL7 activity
   were around 45 degrees C and 8, respectively. Interestingly, we observed
   that rAlgSV1-PL7 retained over 80\% of its enzyme activity after
   incubation at 30 degrees C for at least 20 days, indicating that
   rAlgSV1-PL7 is a long-lived enzyme. Moreover, the degradation of
   alginate by rAlgSV1-PL7 produced one to four sugars because of the broad
   substrate specificity of this enzyme. Our findings suggest that
   rAlgSV1-PL7 may represent a new commercially useful enzyme.},

Abstract = {The energetics of eddy-mean flow interactions along two western boundary
   currents of the North Pacific, the Kuroshio and Ryukyu Currents, are
   systematically investigated using 22 years of numerical data from the
   Ocean General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator (OFES). For the
   time-mean and time-varying flow fields, all the energy components and
   conversions exhibit inhomogeneous spatial distributions. In the two
   currents, complex cross-stream and along-stream variations are seen in
   the eddy-mean flow energy conversions. East of Taiwan, the kinetic
   energy is mainly transferred from the mean flow to the eddy field
   through barotropic instability, whereas the baroclinic energy
   conversions form a meridional dipole structure caused by the topographic
   constraint. In the northern area, particularly, the eddy field drains
   2.25 x 10(8) W of kinetic energy and releases 2.82 x 10(8) W of
   available potential energy when interacting with the mean flow,
   indicating that mesoscale eddies impinging on the Kuroshio decay with
   baroclinic inverse energy cascades. In the Ryukyu Current, inverse
   energy conversions from the eddy field to the mean flow also dominate
   the power transfer in the subsurface layer. The eddy field transfers
   0.16 x 10(8) W of kinetic energy and 1.89 x 10(8) W of available
   potential energy to the mean flow, suggesting that meososcale eddies
   play an important role in maintaining the velocity and hydrographic
   structure of the current. In other areas, both barotropic and baroclinic
   instabilities contribute to the generation of eddy kinetic energy with
   the latter one providing more than 3 times as much power as the former
   one.},

Abstract = {Catalysis of electrochemical redox reactions is an important goal in
   photoelectrochemistry because even small overvoltages diminish the
   efficiency of photoelectrochemical devices immensely. This is true for
   many economically interesting reactions, like e.g. the water splitting
   reaction leading to oxygen and hydrogen, where hydrogen acts as a
   storable, high grade chemical energy carrier. Most of these gas
   evolution reactions showing a rather complicated two or even more
   electron charge transfer kinetics occur with much lower overvoltages at
   appropriate metal electrodes. Therefore many scientists tried to
   catalyze electrochemical reactions by depositing catalytic metals onto
   the surface of the semiconductor electrodes. But here, classical methods
   for metallization e.g. evaporation or electrochemical deposition lead to
   the formation of a so called Schottky contact for the
   metal/semiconductor interface which in contrast to the
   electrolyte/semiconductor junction causes very high loss currents. In
   consequence, these high loss currents drastically decrease the
   efficiency of such photoelectrochemical solar cells.
   In contrast, the currentless deposition of colloidal metal particles
   forming multiple nano contacts (MNCs) allows to diminish the overvoltage
   for the hydrogen evolution reaction without increasing the loss currents
   at the metal/semiconductor interface. Our own investigations were
   performed with colloidal gold and platinized colloidal gold particles
   (between 6 and 100 nm in diameter) deposited onto single crystalline
   p-type gallium arsenide (pGaAs) electrodes. This method of metallization
   allows to vary the density and size of metal islands independently. The
   colloidal metal particles and the electrode surfaces modified with MNCs
   were characterized by SEM, TEM and STM investigations. Theoretical and
   experimental investigations prove that due to the three dimensional
   diffusion towards the MNCs, a surface coverage of less than 1 \% is
   necessary to obtain current densities as high as those obtained for the
   full surface area.
   The high catalytic activity of MNCs for the light induced hydrogen
   evolution reaction has been demonstrated by recording
   photocurrent/potential curves under illumination in slightly acidic
   solutions. Moreover, impedance spectroscopy investigations of p-GaAs
   electrodes covered with gold MNCs (performed in the dark) prove that the
   loss currents at the MNC/semiconductor interfaces can be decreased by
   about five orders of magnitude compared to metal/semiconductor
   interfaces prepared by electrochemical metal deposition.
   The negligible small loss currents at the MNC/semiconductor interfaces
   enable to use colloidal metal particles as real catalysts for
   electrochemical reactions at semiconductor electrodes.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the relationship between gravity and infragravity
   energy with swash oscillations as well as the model's ability to
   reproduce the transformation of the wave as it approaches the shore on a
   dissipative beach. For this purpose, numerical experiments were
   conducted in a dissipative beach from Cartagena, Colombia. Mean free
   surface measurements were carried out for 2 days in February 2014 by
   installing a cross-shore array of pressure sensors, as well as a Fourier
   analysis from these measurements to identify frequency components that
   characterize the waves and the energy associated with them. To implement
   the numerical modelling, the SWASH model (The Simulation WAves till
   Shore is a numerical model that resolves nonlinear shallow-water
   equations) was set up by using the bathymetric profile of Bocagrande
   Beach obtained during the field campaign. The results of this numerical
   modelling enabled the study of the infragravity energy growth mechanism
   and the evolution of gravity energy as the wave approaches the shore, as
   well as the relationship between gravity and infragravity energy with
   swash oscillations. Overall, the results show that the model is able to
   reproduce the significant wave height and significant wave height
   associated with infragravity energy; moreover, the model is able to
   accurately describe processes of energy dissipation and energy transfer.
   Furthermore, through a spectral analysis applied to the swash
   oscillations time series it was possible to find that saturation occurs
   at low-frequency significant swash height and high-frequency significant
   swash height as the significant wave height increases, since its
   increase is not linear with respect to the signficant wave height
   incident.},

Title = {Alternative protocols for the production of more sustainable agar-based

Journal = {ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Agar-based extracts from Gelidium sesquipedale were obtained by applying
   a conventional hot water treatment and alternative ultrasound- and
   microwave-assisted methods, with and without the application of an
   alkaline pre-treatment. The alkaline pre-treatment produced refined
   extracts with higher purity; however, extraction yields increased from
   2?5\% to 7?19\% by omitting this step. In particular, the
   ultrasound-assisted extraction allowed reducing 4-fold the extraction
   time, while keeping constant or even increasing the yield (up to 19\%
   for the 1 h extraction) with respect to the conventional protocol.
   Interestingly, the presence of proteins and polyphenols conferred the
   semi-refined extracts a relatively high antioxidant capacity (19?24 ?mol
   TE/g extract). The refined extract produced by the standard protocol
   formed the strongest hydrogels (>1000 g/cm2). On the other hand, the
   semi-refined extracts produced by the alternative protocols formed
   slightly stronger hydrogels (337?438 g/cm2) than the refined
   counterparts (224?311 g/cm2), due to their greater molecular weights of
   the former ones. LCA assessment showed lower global warming potential
   for the semi-refined extracts, especially the ultrasound-assisted
   extraction, hence highlighting the potential of this method to produce
   more sustainable agarbased extracts for food-related applications.},

Abstract = {Due to the geographical peculiarities of the sea islands, we often
   encounter the difficulty that some coastlines are hard to reach or to
   identify. Thus a specific measurement method cannot be implemented
   effectively, which affects the integrity and precision of island
   coastline surveying. In this paper, we use the digital elevation Model
   (DEM) by LIDAR date. However, The elevations acquired by an Airborne
   LIDAR system are ellipsoid heights, which is different from the National
   Vertical Datum 1985 in existing island coastline. For this reason, a
   regional quasi-geoid model is constructed with the geometric method,
   using the EGM2008 gravity field model and GPS/Leveling data. We manage
   to transform ellipsoid heights to normal heights from observations, and
   construct the DEM which is based on National Vertical Datum 1985.
   Finally island coastlines are extracted from the reference DEM and the
   associated tidal model and compared with that from GPS-RTK measurements.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the construction of a novel lamp raft for the purse
   seine fishery and its evaluation in real conditions for 14 days during a
   six-month period in a freshwater ecosystem (Lake Trichonis, Greece). A
   simple, but durable and inexpensive design was constructed comprising a
   LED lamp producing green light, powered by a 12 V battery which is
   charged by a photovoltaic panel to make the device autonomous concerning
   its electric power needs. The new lamp raft showed very good technical
   performance in the field and was found to be more effective at
   attracting fish than traditional lamp rafts, resulting in higher catch
   rates for the target fish species (Atherina boyeri). The increase in
   catch varied between 33.3\% and 157.1\%, with an overall increase of
   67.3\%. This excellent performance, along with simplicity, durability,
   and the zero operational cost, makes this raft an interesting candidate
   to replace the traditional lamp rafts used in purse seine fishery not
   only in the particular lake for which it was designed, but also in other
   freshwater and marine ecosystems around the world. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Impacts of Pervasive Climate Change and Extreme Events on Rocky
   Intertidal Communities: Evidence From Long-Term Data},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Annual surveys of the abundance of intertidal invertebrates and
   macroalgae have been made at between 70 and 100 rocky intertidal
   time-series sites around the United Kingdom coastline since 2002 under
   the MarClim project. The data provide a unique opportunity to
   investigate the impacts of both pervasive climate change and their
   punctuation by extreme events on intertidal species. After the extreme
   storm events in the 2013/2014 winter season and the record heatwaves in
   the summers of 2018 and 2020, MarClim surveys recorded both physical and
   biological changes to rocky shore habitats. Subsequent surveys
   reassessed the effects on community structure via analysis of those
   species that resisted storm damage, those species that returned after
   the extreme storm events, and species that opportunistically occupied
   vacant habitat after storm-induced species loss. In addition, biannual
   storm damage surveys documenting communities recovery were carried out
   in the spring and winter of each year from 2014 to 2020 at three MarClim
   sites in north Cornwall (Crackington Haven, Trevone, and St. Ives),
   which experienced different types of abiotic and biotic damage resulting
   from these storms. Impacts of heatwaves and cold spells on the abundance
   of species were determined by regression on frequencies of event per
   year. Species of invertebrates and macroalgae generally declined in
   years of more frequent winter cold spells and summer heatwaves, while
   winter heatwaves and summer cold spells had similar numbers of positive
   and negative effects across species. Winter warm spells tended to have a
   more negative effect on cold-affinity species than on warm-affinity
   species. No abrupt shift was recorded after the 2013/2014 storms. Whilst
   a short-term change in some species was recorded in quantitative quadrat
   surveys, the biological communities returned to the long-term species
   composition and abundance within 2 years. The heatwave events caused
   sublethal heat damage in macroalgae, evidenced as dried areas of tissue
   on many individuals, with mortality-induced reductions in the abundance
   of only a few invertebrate species, recorded in Scotland and southwest
   England after the heatwave events in 2018 and 2020. MarClim and
   storm-damage surveys indicate that there have been no sustained impacts
   from either extreme thermal or storm events across the rocky intertidal
   communities, and biodiversity has not been significantly altered as a
   result. The abundance and biogeographical distributions of rocky
   intertidal species and communities around the United Kingdom are being
   driven by longer-term, large scale, pervasive change in environmental
   conditions, with a gradual shift towards dominance of Lusitanian species
   from the early 2000s in responses to warming of the marine climate.},

Title = {Receiver Function Seismology},
Journal = {IZVESTIYA-PHYSICS OF THE SOLID EARTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},

Pages = {12-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The results of application of the receiver function technique are
   briefly reviewed. In the mantle transition zone, the topography of the
   main seismic boundaries is evaluated with a resolution of about 3 km in
   depth and a lateral resolution of about 200 km. The variations of the
   depth of the main boundaries have the maximal amplitude reaching tens of
   kilometers. Thinning of the mantle transition zone in the hot spots and
   the respective increase in temperature by similar to 100 degrees C is
   established. In several regions, two low-velocity layers are revealed in
   the mantle transition zone: one directly above the 410-km seismic
   discontinuity and another at a depth of 450 to 500 km. The origin of the
   first layer is associated with dehydration in the mantle plumes in the
   process of the olivine-wadsleyite phase transformation. The increase in
   the velocity of S-waves in the base of the second layer may explain the
   observations of the so-called 520-km boundary. The traditional approach
   to the studies of the structure of the crust and upper mantle is based
   on using the surface waves. Receiver functions can provide higher
   resolution at the same depths when a combination of P-and S-wave
   receiver functions is used. This type of results was obtained for
   Fennoscandia, Kaapvaal craton, Indian shield, Central Tien Shan, Baikal
   rift zone, the Azores, Cape Verde Islands, and the western
   Mediterranean. S-receiver functions were used in the study of the lunar
   crust. The joint inversion of P-and S-receiver functions provides robust
   estimates of the parameters of the seismic boundaries, including weak
   discontinuities such as the lithosphere-asthenosphere interface of
   cratons. The parameters determined from receiver functions include the
   P-wave to S-wave velocity ratio. In a few regions, a very high (>2.0)
   velocity ratio is observed in the lower crust that may indicate the
   presence of a fluid with a high pore pressure. Receiver functions allow
   estimating the parameters of the azimuthal anisotropy as a function of
   depth. The change of the parameters with depth makes it possible to
   distinguish the active anisotropy associated with recent deformations
   from the frozen anisotropy-the effect of the past tectonic processes.},

Title = {Impacts of Autumn-Winter Tibetan Plateau Snow Anomalies on North
   Atlantic-Europe and Arctic Climate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Previous empirical studies have indicated strong influences of autumn
   and winter Tibetan Plateau (TP) snow cover extent (SCE) anomalies on the
   winter Pacific-North American (PNA) and also East Atlantic
   teleconnection patterns over the North Atlantic and Europe. Our early
   numerical experiments reproduced an observed wintertime PNA response to
   an extensive heavy TP snow anomaly. This study further investigates
   impacts of autumn-winter TP snow anomalies on North Atlantic-Europe and
   Arctic climate. Expressing snow conditions as snow water equivalent
   (SWE), observational analysis shows that the principal component time
   series associated with the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF1)
   pattern of autumn TP SWE anomalies is significantly correlated to a
   remote equivalent barotropic tripole structure in winter, which
   resembles the negative phases of two teleconnections, North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) at the surface and West Atlantic (WA) in the
   mid-troposphere. This indicates that the hydrological effect of TP SWE
   differs from the albedo effect of TP SCE in snow-atmosphere
   teleconnections. Numerical experiments using autumn TP SWE EOF1 and its
   persistent changes in winter as idealized snow forcing in a coupled
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation model simulate a winter negative
   NAO/WA response over the North Atlantic-Europe sector and a negative
   Arctic Oscillation over the Northern Hemisphere similar to observations.
   The NAO/WA responses result from mechanisms of horizontal propagation of
   stationary Rossby wave energy and a transient eddy feedback. Results
   also indicate that heavy TP SWE induces significant Eurasia cooling, and
   a consistent pattern of Arctic sea ice anomalies, demonstrating
   widespread Northern Hemispheric impacts of TP snow anomalies.},

Abstract = {Social media platforms, such as Twitter, are an increasingly important
   source of information and are forums for discourse within and between
   interest groups. Research highlights how social media communities have
   amplified movements such as the Arab Spring, \#MeToo, and Black Lives
   Matter. But environmental digital discourse remains underexplored. In
   the present article, we apply automated text analysis to 200,000 Twitter
   users in several countries following leading environmental
   nongovernmental organizations. Some issues such as public action to
   decarbonize society or species conservation were discussed more
   intensely than agriculture or marine conservation. Our results
   illustrate where environmental discourse diverges and converges on
   Twitter across countries, states, and characteristics, such as political
   ideology. Using the coterminous United States as a case study, we
   observed that the prominence of issues varies across states and, in some
   cases, covaries with political ideology across counties. Our findings
   show paths forward to characterizing environmental priorities across
   many issues at unprecedented scale and extent.},

Title = {Contrasting effects of black carbon amendments on PAH bioaccumulation by

Abstract = {Two sediment matrices with different characteristics were amended with
   chars from different sources for bioaccumulation assay with
   filter-feeding Chironomus plumosus larvae. Chars greatly decreased
   porewater concentrations of PAHs (C-iw) measured using polyethylene
   devices in sediments. In organic rich sediment matrix-based systems
   where suspended char particles were absent, PAH concentrations in larvae
   (C-iB) were significantly correlated with C-iW, and there was no
   difference in water-based bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) between
   different treatments, suggesting that water absorption was the main
   contaminant uptake route for larvae. In organic poor sediment
   matrix-based systems where suspended char particles were present, poor
   Pearson correlation between C-iB and C-iW was found, but there was a
   significant linear increase of BAF values with char contents, which
   indicated that ingestion of suspended char particles could also be
   important for PAH bioaccumulation. Therefore, we need to rethink of the
   effectiveness and risks for the application of black carbon to
   sediment/soil remediation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   carbon (NPC), derived from metal organic framework (MOF), was
   synthesized and fabricated as solid phase microextraction (SPME) device.
   The morphological modulated structure of the NPC, with enhanced
   effective adsorption sites produced by the pointed and sharp edges,
   could improve the extraction efficiencies of the NPC. Comparing with the
   unmodulated one, NPC with morphological modulation possessed higher
   extraction efficiencies (2 flod) as well as accelerated sampling rates
   (5 flod) on benzene series compounds (BTEX), improving the sensitivity
   of the sampling method (limits of detection ranged from 0.08 ng L-1 to
   0.36 ng L-1). Moreover, it was also the first time that the moisture
   sensitive MOF-derived NPC was exploited as the SPME adsorbent. In
   general, this study was expected to be an important advance in
   broadening the approaches on designing a superior SPME adsorbents not
   only emphasizing on the specific surface area as well as porosity but
   also the morphology. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The classical route for second-generation ethanol from lignocellulosic
   biomass is hampered by high process costs, fostering the development of
   alternative strategies such as simultaneous saccharification and
   fermentation (SSF). However, the lack of compatible enzyme cocktails
   poses a challenge. In this study, the enzymeEmBgl from the marine
   bacteriumExiguobacterium marinumwas rationally identified based on
   structural and phylogenetic analyses, known desirable properties of
   close orthologs, and the ecological niche of its organism source.EmBgl
   is a multifunctional and glucose-tolerant enzyme that efficiently
   hydrolyzes cello-oligosaccharides due to a positive-subsite region that
   can accommodate long cello-oligosaccharides without imposing steric
   impediments. The efficacy ofEmBgl in an SSF process was demonstrated
   using pretreated sugarcane bagasse as feedstock, yielding 28 g L(-1)of
   ethanol in 30 h. The distinguishing functional properties ofEmBgl and
   its successful utilization in an SSF process highlight its potential in
   biotechnological applications in which lignocellulose deconstruction is
   desirable under milder temperatures (c) 2020 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {We investigated the dynamics of carbonate system which was greatly
   modulated by a river plume and coastal upwelling in July 2014 and July
   2015 at the east coast of Hainan Island where a fringing reef
   distributes inshore. By using a three end-member mixing model, we
   semiquantitatively estimated the removal of dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC) mediated by biological production in the river plume and upwelled
   water to be 13 +/- 17 and 15 +/- 16 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. The
   enhanced organic production was mainly responsible for these DIC
   consumptions in both two regimes, however, nearly a half of DIC removal
   was attributed to biocalcification in the plume system while it was
   negligible in the upwelling system. Furthermore, the modeled results
   over reefs revealed that river plume and coastal upwelling were two
   major threats of acidification to coral communities at the east coast of
   Hainan Island during cruises. In comparison, the biological contribution
   to acidification was limited for balancing between organic production
   and biocalcification during July 2014 cruise, whereas the acidification
   was greatly intensified by organic degradation during July 2015 cruise.
   It was verified that naturally local acidification (physical and
   biological processes) played a major role in great pH decreases on a
   short-term scale, leading to coastal waters more vulnerable to
   anthropogenic ocean acidification (uptake of atmospheric CO2) by
   reducing buffering capacity of waters. Finally, effects of acidification
   associated with other local threats on a fringing reef were further
   depicted with a conceptual model.},

Abstract = {Cases of death during heat waves are most commonly due to respiratory
   and cardiovascular diseases, with the main contribution from the
   negative effect of heat on the cardiovascular system. In an attempt to
   control the body temperature, the body's natural instinct is to
   circulate large quantities of blood to the skin. However while trying to
   protect itself from overheating, the body actually harms itself by
   inducing extra strain on the heart. This excess strain has the potential
   to trigger a cardiac event in those with chronic health problems, such
   as the elderly.
   Those in the U.S.A. between the ages of 65 and 74 are at a higher risk
   of mortality during heat waves when they are single, have a history of
   chronic pulmonary disease, or suffer from a psychiatric disorder. In the
   older group, 75+, single people are again more vulnerable as well as
   women.
   The relationship of mortality and temperature creates a J-shaped
   function, showing a steeper slope at higher temperatures. Records show
   that more casualties have resulted from heat waves than hurricanes,
   floods, and tornadoes together. The significance of this is that the
   U.S. suffers the highest damage total from natural catastrophes
   annually. Studies held from 1989-2000 in 50 U.S. cities recorded 1.6\%
   more deaths during cold temperature events, as opposed to a staggering
   5.7\% increase during heat waves.
   People are at risk when living in large metropolitan areas, especially
   those mentioned above, due to the heat island effect. Urban areas suffer
   heat increases from the combination of global warming effects as well as
   localized heat island properties. It is flawed to claim that the
   contribution of anthropogenic heat generation to the heat island effect
   is small. Analyzing the trend of extreme heat events (EHEs) between 1956
   and 2005 showed an increase on average of 0.20 days/year, on a 95\%
   confidence interval with uncertainty of +/- 0.6. This trend follows the
   recorded data for 2005 with 10 more heat events per city than in 1956.
   Compact cities experience an average of 5.6 days of extreme heat
   conditions annually, compared to that of 14.8 for sprawling cities. The
   regional climate, city populace, or pace of population growth however
   does not affect this effect.
   Statistics from the U.S. Census state that the U.S. population without
   air conditioning saw a drop of 32\% from 1978 to 2005, resting at 15\%.
   Despite the increase in air conditioning use, the positive affects of it
   may have run their course as a critical point may have been reached. A
   study done by Kalkstein through 2007 proved that the shielding effects
   of air conditioning reached their terminal effect in the mid-1990s.
   Heat-related illnesses and mortality rates have slightly decreased since
   1980, regardless of the increase in temperatures. This may be in part to
   the increase in availability of air conditioning, and other protective
   measures, to the public. Protective factors have mitigated the danger of
   heat on those vulnerable to it, however projecting forward the heat
   increment related to sprawl may exceed physiologic adaptation
   thresholds.},

Journal = {ANNALES SOCIETATIS GEOLOGORUM POLONIAE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {84},

Abstract = {Integrative studies of sedimentary and palaeontological topics for
   unconformity surfaces are useful in basin analysis. A middle Bathonian
   unconformity surface in the Ammonitico Rosso facies cropping out in the
   La Mola Unit (Subbetic Domain, Betic External Zone) was studied by
   integrating ichnological, palaeotectonic, and sedimentological analyses
   to decipher sea-level, tectonic, and palaeogeographic conditions during
   its development. The trace-fossil assemblage mainly consists of the
   Glossifungites (Thalassinoides, Arenicolites, and Gastro-chaenolites)
   and Trypanites ichnofacies elements. Probable Ophiomorpha represents
   previous softground stages, Thalassinoides and Arenicolites were formed
   in firmground, Gastrochaenolites reflects an evolved firmground or early
   hardground, and Trypanites can be attributed to an incipient hardground.
   The degree of firmness, relative sea-level position, and continuity of
   deposition were related. The softground stage corresponds to a fall in
   relative sea level and continued deposition. The firmground
   (semi-consolidated substrate) probably reflects an extremely low sea
   level characterized by non-deposition, whereas the incipient hardground
   stage indicates an initial phase of relative sea-level rise, with an
   increase in marine current energy. The presence of two neptunian dyke
   systems reflects significant tectonic activity related to the
   transtensional deformation that affected the South Iberian Palaeomargin.
   Lateral variations in sedimentological and ichnological features
   recorded at similar discontinuity surfaces in nearby areas were
   considered and related to differences in bottom topography, with
   associated changes in sedimentation, and to the variable duration of the
   hiatus.},

Title = {Embayment morphometrics, granulometry and carbonate mineralogy of sandy
   beaches in the Maltese Islands},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {432},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The beach and shoreface sediments in the Maltese Islands have
   accumulated in under-filled accommodation space conditions like many
   temperate and tropical island carbonate beach and shelf environments.
   Nevertheless, Maltese beach sediments show anomalously low biogenic
   carbonate content compared to other carbonate beaches. Fourteen
   carbonate sandy beaches in the Maltese Islands were sampled to examine
   the relationships between geological controls on both coastal lithology
   and configurations of bays and beaches and, grain characteristics
   described by granulometry and mineralogy. The provenance of the medium
   to coarse-grained beach sand is mainly from the erosion of coastal and
   shelf Cenozoic limestone that produces lithoclasts of low-magnesium
   calcite, with an additional 20 +/- 10\% biogenic grains derived from
   marine carbonate productivity. The relationships between geological
   controls and beach sediments are used to establish a general model of
   sedimentation along the Maltese shelf area. Mean beach sand size is
   controlled by the degree of embayment, decreasing where bays are
   narrower and longer, whereas sediment provenance affects granulometry by
   the contribution of biogenic grains to the coarse and fine grain size
   fractions. The mineralogy of the biogenic sediment fraction in beaches
   is mainly high-magnesium calcite and aragonite, with the latter
   decreasing significantly where coastal clay is found within or close to
   bays.},

Title = {Temperature-Driven Hydrocarbon Generation-Expulsion and Structural
   Transformation of Organic-Rich Shale Assessed by in situ Heating SEM},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {Mud shale can serve as source or cap rock but also as a reservoir rock,
   and so the development of pores or cracks in shale has become of great
   interest in recent years. However, prior work using non-identical
   samples, varying fields of view and non-continuous heating processes has
   produced varying data. The unique hydrocarbon generation and expulsion
   characteristics of shale as a source rock and the relationship with the
   evolution of pores or cracks in the reservoir are thus not well
   understood. The present work attempted to monitor detailed structural
   changes during the continuous heating of shale and to establish possible
   relationships with hydrocarbon generation and expulsion by heating
   immature shale samples while performing in situ scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) imaging and monitoring the chamber vacuum. Samples were
   heated at 20 degrees C/min from ambient to 700 degrees C with 30 min
   holds at 100 degrees C intervals during which SEM images were acquired.
   The SEM chamber vacuum was found to change during sample heating as a
   consequence of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion. Two episodic
   hydrocarbon expulsion stages were observed, at 300 and 500 degrees C. As
   the temperature was increased from ambient to 700 degrees C, samples
   exhibited consecutive shrinkage, expansion and shrinkage, and the amount
   of structural change in the vertical bedding direction was greater than
   that in the bedding direction. At the same time, the opening, closing
   and subsequent reopening of microcracks was observed. Hydrocarbon
   generation and expulsion led to the expansion of existing fractures and
   the opening of new cracks to produce an effective fracture network
   allowing fluid migration. The combination of high-resolution SEM and a
   high-temperature heating stage allowed correlation between the evolution
   of pores or cracks and hydrocarbon generation and expulsion to be
   examined.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, two-dimensional (2DH) morphodynamic modeling systems
   were developed to simulate the morphological changes due to the combined
   action of waves, tides and winds. In spite of some significant
   successes, they are unable to predict complex morphological behaviors,
   such as inlet infillings in highly dynamic environments during winter
   energetic wave conditions. For these reasons, the state of the art in
   morphodynamic modeling tends to evolve towards three-dimensional (3D)
   modeling systems. In this context, the present study focuses on the
   development of an unstructured 3D coupled wave-current model taking into
   account the vertical structure of radiation stresses based on recent
   theoretical developments. The model is applied to the common breakwater
   test case and succeeds efficiently to reproduce the wave-driven
   circulation behind the breakwater. The study investigates also the
   vertical structure of the flow and the wave-induced setup along a
   cross-shore profile. The undertow is well-predicted by the model in the
   surf zone and the wave-induced setups predicted by the 3D model are
   about 30-40\% greater than those simulated by a 2DH approach. This
   important aspect could be relevant in storm surge and inundation studies
   for which the quality of the predictions could be strongly improved by
   using a 3D fully coupled wave-current model.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Carbon nanofibers were grafted onto mesoporous carbon spheres to produce
   ``sea urchin-like{''} mesoporous carbon with a nanofiber content of 25
   wt.\%. Because of its combined features of high electronic conductivity
   and efficient electrolyte transport, the sea urchin-like mesoporous
   carbon assembled in electric double layer capacitors shows outstanding
   high-rate performance with a voltammetric scan rate as high as 3000 mV
   s(-1). Ac impedance analysis shows that this method of carbon nanofiber
   grafting promotes electronic percolation and ionic transportation in the
   carbon electrode, reducing the capacitive relaxation time to less than
   one fourth of its original value. Electrochemical oxidation in sea
   urchin-like mesoporous carbon produces a capacitance increase of ca.
   200\% while retaining high electronic and ionic conductivities in the
   electrode. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Water desalination can offer a potential solution for water scarcity.
   Additionally, desalination technologies that mainly consume electric
   energy, such as reverse osmosis, can expand the market for electric
   utilities. Despite such benefits, the main question around desalination
   remains to be its economic competitiveness. To evaluate the
   cost-effectiveness of water desalination, this paper calculates two
   well-known engineering economic metrics: net present value (NPV) and
   levelized cost of water (LCOW), as applied to large-scale water
   desalination loads. The paper offers insights on the economic
   competitiveness of water desalination, compared to its alternatives,
   i.e., fresh surface and groundwater. The use of NPV is viewed as a
   planning tool, and LCOW is viewed as an operations tool, which has some
   significance in project planning. The paper discusses the nexus between
   operations and planning and offers some contemporary insight into the
   deployment of desalination worldwide. Additionally, the paper offers
   analysis on the economic benefits of integrating water desalination load
   in power systems, both from the point of view of desalination plant
   owners and electric utilities.},

Title = {An Innovative Multifunctional Buoy Design for Monitoring Continuous
   Environmental Dynamics at Tianjin Port},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {171820-171833},
Abstract = {The Tianjin port plays a relevant role in driving both ship navigation
   and the weather and climate of the area. To better understand the
   underlying peculiarities of this area, several in-service coastal ocean
   system and facilities have been constructed, at present, the whole
   coastal ocean systems at Tianjin port have been improved, however, they
   cannot meet the safety requirements of traffic management and
   navigational safety. Marine buoys have the unreplaceable advantages of
   long-term, real-time, reliable capabilities and trivial environmental
   restrictions to monitor the marine dynamics. Here an innovative
   multifunctional buoy prototype is proposed to continuously measure
   meteorological and oceanographic parameters at a high spatial and
   temporal resolution, which can ensure navigation safety at Tianjin Port.
   Solar panels and battery module are personalized to ensure electric
   supply to the buoy system. An independent ARM (Advanced RISC
   Machine)-based module is affiliated to maintain the stability of the
   data acquisition and communication module. Buoy platform based on Beidou
   difference is proved to be an effective approach for the tide
   measurement. Additionally, a web-designed software for data acquisition
   is integrated for the visualization purpose. Finally, in-field recording
   test at Tianjin port will be performed to verify effectiveness of our
   system on monitoring environment dynamics. It turns out that our buoy
   prototype functions as a reliable and energy favorable electrical device
   and shed light on the development of effective measurement instruments
   working under unpredictable and harsh marine environment.},

Abstract = {The trace fossil assemblages from the Upper Cretaceous Neyzar Formation
   are described for the first time from Kopet-Dagh, Iran, enhancing the
   record of this fossil group in the Cretaceous of the Middle East.
   Thirty-one ichnogenera have been identified in open marine successions:
   Agrichnium, Asteriacites, Asterosoma, Bergaueria, Chondrites,
   Cylindrichnus, Halopoa, Helminthopsis, Gordia, Gyrochorte, Laevicyclus,
   Lockeia, Megagrapton, Nereites, Neonereites, Ophioichnus, Ophiomorpha,
   Palaeophycus, Phycodes, Phycosiphon, Planolites, Protovirgularia,
   Rhizocorallium, Rosselia, Scolicia, Sinusichnus, Skolithos,
   Spongeliomorpha, Taenidium, Teichichnus, and Thalassinoides. The Neyzar
   Formation accumulated on a gently dipping shelf dominated by storm- and
   fair weather-wave processes and includes shelf, lower offshore, upper
   offshore, lower shoreface-proximal offshore, middle-upper shoreface and
   foreshore deposits. Identification and interpretation of ichnological
   signatures and the spatial arrangement of sedimentary structures in the
   successions are used to further refine sedimentary interpretations of
   parameters such as wave energy, substrate properties, the nature of the
   available food supply, variability in sedimentation rates and proximal
   distal trends of the wave-dominated shoreface offshore complex. The
   prevalent palae-oceanographic situation during the deposition of the
   studied successions was ideal for tropical storms, thus promoting
   tempestite deposition and the occurrence of a tropical and subtropical
   trace fossil suite. According to this study, increasing mobility and
   infaunality with more complex trace systems or sophisticated feeding
   strategies, climax population strategies and the high diversity,
   associated with rapid increase in the abundance and depth of infaunal
   structures, indicate a major reorganization of the shallow-marine
   benthic communities that occurred in response to the Mesozoic marine
   revolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Aggregations of organisms, ranging from zooplankton to whales, are an
   extremely common phenomenon in the pelagic zone; perhaps the best known
   are fish schools. Social aggregation is a special category that refers
   to groups that self-organize and maintain cohesion to exploit benefits
   such as protection from predators, and location and capture of resources
   more effectively and with greater energy efficiency than could a
   solitary individual. In this review we explore general aggregation
   principles, with specific reference to pelagic organisms; describe a
   range of new technologies either designed for studying aggregations or
   that could potentially be exploited for this purpose; report on the
   insights gained from theoretical modelling; discuss the relationship
   between social aggregation and ocean management; and speculate on the
   impact of climate change. Examples of aggregation occur in all animal
   phyla. Among pelagic organisms, it is possible that repeated
   co-occurrence of stable pairs of individuals, which has been established
   for some schooling fish, is the likely precursor leading to networks of
   social interaction and more complex social behaviour. Social network
   analysis has added new insights into social behaviour and allows us to
   dissect aggregations and to examine how the constituent individuals
   interact with each other. This type of analysis is well advanced in
   pinnipeds and cetaceans, and work on fish is progressing. Detailed
   three-dimensional analysis of schools has proved to be difficult,
   especially at sea, but there has been some progress recently. The
   technological aids for studying social aggregation include video and
   acoustics, and have benefited from advances in digitization,
   miniaturization, motion analysis and computing power. New techniques
   permit three-dimensional tracking of thousands of individual animals
   within a single group which has allowed novel insights to within-group
   interactions. Approaches using theoretical modelling of aggregations
   have a long history but only recently have hypotheses been tested
   empirically. The lack of synchrony between models and empirical data,
   and lack of a common framework to schooling models have hitherto
   hampered progress; however, recent developments in this field offer
   considerable promise. Further, we speculate that climate change, already
   having effects on ecosystems, could have dramatic effects on
   aggregations through its influence on species composition by altering
   distribution ranges, migration patterns, vertical migration, and oceanic
   acidity. Because most major commercial fishing targets schooling
   species, these changes could have important consequences for the
   dependent businesses.},

   (composition, crystal size and texture) were prepared by hydrothermal
   synthesis using either one or a mixture of two templates. Transient
   operando DRIFTS-MS measurements revealed that the sample's hydrophobic

   sample's moisture tolerance during repetitive adsorption/desorption
   cycles. This knowledge is fundamental to achieve the rational design of

Pages = {104-130},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ecological and socioeconomic aspects of subterranean hydrosystems have
   changed during the past 40-50 years. The major environmental pressures
   (mainly anthropogenic ones) impact the quantity and quality of
   groundwater resources and the state of subsurface ecosystems, and it is
   expected that the environmental pressures on groundwater will continue,
   at least until 2025, unless new environmental policies change this state
   of affairs. The world demographic increase and the general rise of water
   demand constitute one of the major environmental pressures on
   groundwater ecosystems especially in less developed countries in Africa,
   Asia and South America. Specific human activities leading to the
   depletion of groundwater reserves include agricultural practices,
   landscape alteration, urbanization demand for domestic and public
   drinking water, various industrial activities such as thermoelectric
   production and mining, and the rise of tourism in coastal areas. Climate
   change is contributing to the water crisis too, especially in areas with
   and climate and/or in some humid monsoonal countries. The overload of
   aquifers with pollutants derived from agriculture (fertilizers and
   pesticides), from industry (release of hydrocarbon chemicals, especially
   spills), from waste and industrial waters, from domestic and industrial
   landfills, from the infiltration of pollutants from surface and from the
   intrusion of saline water affect groundwater quality. The dangerous
   increase in contaminated subsurface sites with chemicals and microbial
   pathogens brings with it health risks to humans. Changes of redox
   condition in groundwater zones, changes of biological diversity,
   vegetation changes with modification of agriculture practices and
   impacts at the biosphere scale, such as the increase in the
   concentration of nitrous oxides in the atmosphere, all impact
   groundwater ecosystems. Groundwater ecosystems must be better
   investigated and understood. Economic, social and ecological lines of
   thinking have to be combined in order to achieve meaningful policies for
   the sustainable development of groundwater reserves and for the
   protection of subsurface ecosystems. Practical measures and ideas for
   the development of policies up to the 2025 time-horizon should improve
   the sustainable usage of the world's groundwater resources.},

Title = {Mazes and meso-islands: Impact of Ag preadsorption on Ge growth on
   Si(111)},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {94},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {The preadsorption of Ag on Si(111) drastically changes the growth of Ge.
   In a temperature range from 400 degrees C to 650 degrees C, Ag
   adsorption on Si leads to the formation of a root 3x root 3-R 30 degrees
   reconstruction that exhibits a maze-like morphology on the mesoscopic
   scale, as observed by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and
   low-energy electronmicroscopy. This maze morphology can be attributed to
   a surface roughening on an atomic scale, induced by the re-arrangement
   of top layer atoms during the 7x7 to root 3x root 3-R 30 degrees
   transition. The subsequent deposition of Ge results in the formation of
   a wetting layer, the evolution of which has been found to be governed by
   the Ag/Si(111)-root 3x root 3-R 30 degrees template's maze structure, as
   the latter offers a high density of heterogeneous nucleation sites. Upon
   further Ge growth, three-dimensional islands with diameters in the
   micrometer range are formed, which exhibit a large and flat (111) top
   facet. X-ray photoemission electron microscopy reveals that during Ge
   growth, Ag is segregating to the surface very efficiently.
   Grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy
   have been used to study the composition, strain state and defect
   structure of the Ge islands in dependence of the growth temperature. The
   strain induced by lattice mismatch is found to be largely relaxed
   (80-90\% relaxation) in the investigated growth temperature range from
   400 to 600 degrees C, which is confirmed by high-resolution LEED
   measurements. As a main relaxation mechanism, the formation of
   interfacial misfit dislocations has been identified. Interdiffusion of
   Si into the Ge islands becomes more and more pronounced for increasing
   growth temperature, whereas the formation of twinned Ge regions can
   drastically be suppressed at higher temperature.},

Title = {An innovative block partition and equivalence method of the wave scatter
   diagram for offshore structural fatigue assessment},
Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {12-28},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The fatigue assessment plays an increasing role for the offshore
   structural safety. Many fatigue assessment methods have been developed
   for this purpose. Among those methods, the time domain method is
   regarded as the most accurate method but less adopted in practice due to
   time consuming. In order to improve the efficiency of the time domain
   method, an innovative block partition and equivalence method of the wave
   scatter diagram is developed for offshore structural fatigue assessment.
   After the wave scatter diagram is partitioned into several blocks, the
   newly developed method, involves determination of the equivalent wave
   height, wave period and occurrence probability of the representative sea
   states based on modified energy equivalent principle. The equivalent
   wave period of the representative sea state is calculated via the
   spectral moment formula in which the equivalent spectral moments of zero
   and second order are obtained based on the weighted averaging principle.
   Combining with the determined wave period, the equivalent significant
   wave height can be determined by reversing the wave spectrum integral
   formula, where the equivalent wave energy of a divided block of the wave
   scatter diagram is modified by introducing a factor to compensate the
   effect of low-and high-amplitude cycles fatigue damage. The equivalent
   occurrence probability is equal to the summation of the original sea
   states' occurrence probability within the divided block. The developed
   method has the advantage of preserving the stochastic characteristics of
   the short term sea states within the divided block during determining
   the representative sea state. At the same time the newly developed
   method has no limitation on block partition and can be applied on
   different offshore structure. Two structural models, a fixed mono-pile
   platform and a floating semi-submersible platform, are demonstrated in
   the numerical examples. Results indicate that the newly developed method
   is robust, computationally affordable, and accurate within engineering
   expectations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Edge-guided Composition Network for Image Stitching},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {118},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Panorama creation is still challenging in consumer-level photography
   because of varying conditions of image capturing. A long-standing
   problem is the presence of artifacts caused by structure inconsistent
   image transitions. Since it is difficult to achieve perfect alignment in
   unconstrained shooting environment especially with parallax and object
   movements, image composition becomes a crucial step to produce
   artifact-free stitching results. Current energy-based seam-cutting image
   composition approaches are limited by the hand-crafted features, which
   are not discriminative and adaptive enough to robustly create structure
   consistent image transitions. In this paper, we present the first
   end-to-end deep learning framework named Edge Guided Composition Network
   (EGCNet) for the composition stage in image stitching. We cast the whole
   composition stage as an image blending problem, and aims to regress the
   blending weights to seamlessly produce the stitched image. To better
   preserve the structure consistency, we exploit perceptual edges to guide
   the network with additional geometric prior. Specifically, we introduce
   a perceptual edge branch to integrate edge features into the model and
   propose two edge-aware losses for edge guidance. Meanwhile, we gathered
   a general-purpose dataset for image stitching training and evaluation
   (namely, RISD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EGCNet
   produces plausible results with less running time, and outperforms
   traditional methods especially under the circumstances of parallax and
   object motions.

Title = {Ectopic Expression of a Transmembrane Protein KaCyt b(6)from a Red
   SeaweedKappaphycus alvareziiin Transgenic Tobacco Augmented the
   Photosynthesis and Growth},
Journal = {DNA AND CELL BIOLOGY},
Abstract = {Cytochrome b(6)f complex is a thylakoid membrane-localized protein and
   catalyses the transfer of electrons from plastoquinol to plastocyanin in
   photosynthetic electron transport chain. In the present study,Cytochrome
   b(6)(KaCyt b(6)) gene fromKappaphycus alvarezii(a red seaweed) was
   overexpressed in tobacco. A 935 base pair (bp) longKaCyt b(6)cDNA
   contained an open reading frame of 648 bp encoding a protein of 215
   amino acids with an expected isoelectric point of 8.67 and a molecular
   mass of 24.37 kDa. TheKaCyt b(6)gene was overexpressed in tobacco under
   control of CaMV35S promoter. The transgenic tobacco had higher electron
   transfer rate and photosynthetic yield over wild-type and vector control
   tobacco. TheKaCyt b(6)tobacco also exhibited significantly higher
   photosynthetic gas exchange (P-N) and improved water use efficiency. The
   transgenic plants had higher ratio of P(N)and intercellular CO2.
   TheKaCyt b(6)transgenic tobacco showed higher estimates of photosystem
   II quantum yield, higher activity of the water-splitting complex, PSII
   photochemistry, and photochemical quenching. The basal quantum yield of
   nonphotochemical processes in PSII was recorded lower inKaCyt
   b(6)tobacco. Transgenic tobacco contained higher contents of carotenoids
   and total chlorophyll and also had better ratios of chlorophyll a and b,
   and carotenoids and total chlorophyll contents hence improved
   photosynthetic efficiency and production of sugar and starch. TheKaCyt
   b(6)transgenic plants performed superior under control and greenhouse
   conditions. To the best of our knowledge through literature survey, this
   is the first report on characterization ofKaCyt b(6)gene fromK.

Year = {2005},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {809-822},

Abstract = {The post spawning behaviour of sea trout Salmo irutia was studied over a
   2 year period in the river and estuary of the River Fowey, south-west
   England. Forty-five sea trout kelts were trapped immediately after
   spawning in December and intraperitoneally tagged with miniature
   acoustic transmitters. The subsequent emigration into coastal waters was
   monitored using acoustic receivers deployed throughout the river
   catchment. The levels of gill Na(+)K(+)ATPase activity in sea trout
   kelts sampled at the same time as the tagged fish were within the range
   of 2.5 to 4.5 mu mol Pi per mg protein per h indicating that the
   post-spawning fish were not physiologically adapted to salt water. The
   tagged kelts were resident in fresh water between 4 and 70 days before
   entering the estuary. Sixty two per cent of the tagged kelts
   subsequently migrated successfully into coastal waters, with a higher
   success rate for male fish (75\%) than females (58\%). There was a
   significant size related difference in the run-timing of the kelts with
   the larger fish moving more quickly into coastal waters after spawning
   than smaller fish. Seaward migration within fresh water was
   predominantly nocturnal and generally occurred in conjunction with
   increasing river discharge and rising water temperature. Migration
   through the estuary continued to be predominantly nocturnal and occurred
   during an ebbing tide. Residency within the estuary varied amongst
   individuals although it was invariably short, with most fish moving out
   into coastal waters within one to two tidal cycles. Five tagged kelts
   returned from the coastal zone and re-entered fresh water during April
   and June. Marine residence time varied between 89 and 145 days (mean 118
   days) and the minimum estimated marine survival was c. 18\%. One of
   these sea trout was subsequently recaptured after successfully spawning
   in the vicinity where it had been previously tagged demonstrating a
   degree of spawning site fidelity. (c) 2005 Crown copyright.},

Title = {Sulfidization processes in seasonally hypoxic shelf sediments: A study
   off the West coast of India},
Journal = {MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Continental shelves are the major sites for organic carbon burial and
   sulfate reduction. Organic carbon degradation and sulfidization along
   continental shelves are expected to play a significant role in global
   carbon-sulfur-iron (C-S-Fe) cycles. Here we report sediment pore-water
   chemistry and iron-sulfur speciation in two short cores SSK-42/9 and 10
   collected off Malvan from the seasonally hypoxic shelf region off the
   west coast of India (WCI) at water depths of 30 and 13 m respectively.
   Concentration profiles of pore-water SO42-, NH4+, DIC, Sigma HS- and
   depth-integrated sulfate reduction rates (J(SO4)) suggest a variable
   influence of sedimentation rates, the composition of organic matter
   (marine and terrestrial) and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) on the
   pore-fluid chemistry. Chromium reducible sulfur (CRS) and organic-bound
   sulfur (OBS) are the detectable solid-phase sulfur species in the
   studied sediment cores. Sulfur content and isotope ratios of chromium
   reducible sulfur (CRS) and organic-bound sulfur (OBS) phases produced
   via HS-/S-x(2-) pathways (sulfidization and sulfurization) show
   contrasting profiles in SSK42/9 and 10, apparently influenced by the
   availability of reactive iron, the relative significance of early and
   late diagenetic processes, source of OBS (detritus of marine origin and
   sulfurized organic molecules) and diffusion of Sigma HS- produced via
   AOM across the SMTZ. The marked influence of AOM-driven sulfate
   reduction and the diffusion of isotopically enriched hydrogen sulfide
   across the sulfatemethane transition zone (SMTZ) is apparent from the
   delta S-34(CRS) profiles in SSK-42/10. Sediment TOC/TS ratios recorded
   in this study are significantly less than that of average modern marine
   surface sediments (2.8:1) underlying oxygenated water and this is
   attributed to the enhanced sulfidization and burial of iron-sulfur
   minerals in the seasonally hypoxic regions. Since the inner shelf of WCI
   experiences seasonal alternation from normoxia to hypoxia which may have
   a profound influence on the benthic community structure, nature, and
   depth of bio-turbation/bioirrigation, we propose that the impact of
   these processes need to be studied at a significantly higher resolution
   for better understanding C-S-Fe biogeochemical cycle.},

Title = {Sediment Bypassing Pathways between Tidal Inlets and Adjacent Beaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {This study investigated the sediment transport pathways in three sandy
   barrier, tidal inlet systems through sediment tracking within a
   numerical model that simulates hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. The
   three tidal inlet systems, Coos Bay, Oregon, Shark River Inlet, New
   Jersey, and John's Pass, Florida, represented high-, medium-, and
   low-wave energy regimes for U.S. inlets (Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of
   Mexico Coasts, respectively). Three methods employed to define sediment
   pathways from the results of a numerical morphology model were
   evaluated: (1) morphodynamic interpretation, (2) mean transport vectors
   across the modeled inlet, and (3) sediment tracer migration. The
   sediment tracing methodology employed in this study allowed for an
   evaluation of the sediment transport pathways between the various
   morphologic features of a tidal inlet, as well as their respective
   processes that drive the exchange of sediments. Characterizing and
   correlating the dominant and subdominant, or seasonal, sediment pathways
   between tidal inlet morphologic features (sediment reservoirs) can
   improve long-term models of an inlet sediment system. Divergences in
   pathways to subfeature shoals of a complex tidal inlet shoal, such as
   the updrift and downdrift shoals of an ebb-tidal delta, can be resolved
   through tracking sediment migration. The results of this study
   illustrate the value of including sediment-tracking techniques in
   simulating sediment bypassing and the potential of this application to
   inform coastal engineering and design modifications to the sediment
   reservoirs of tidal inlet systems.},

Title = {Nitrogen removal through sediment denitrification in the Yangtze Estuary

   summertime},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {795},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Nitrogen nutrient surplus is the main cause of a series of environmental
   problems in the Yangtze Estuary and its adjacent East China Sea (ECS).
   Denitrification plays an important role in controlling nitrate dynamics
   and fate in estuarine and coastal environments. We investigated the
   natural and potential rates of denitrification in the sediments of the
   Yangtze Estuary and ECS via slurry incubation experiments combined with
   acetylene inhibition techniques to reveal its contributions to total
   nitrogen reduction in this hypereutrophic continental shelf area. Key
   environmental factors, such as the sediment grain size, sediment
   extractable inorganic nitrogen (NH4+, NO3- and NO2-), sediment organic
   carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), isotopic compositions (delta C-13 and
   delta N-15), etc., were also investigated to determine the main factors
   controlling the denitrification processes. The measured rates of
   denitrification ranged from 0.39 to 28.49 ng N g(-1).h(-1). The total
   nitrogen removed by denitrification in the study area was 3.7 x 10(10) g
   during August. In total, at least 3.3\% of the external inorganic
   nitrogen transported annually into the estuary could be removed by the
   denitrification processes in the study area. The sediment
   denitrification rates correlated significantly with the extractable
   ammonium and delta N-15 values of surface sediments, indicating that
   coupled nitrificationdenitrification processes may play an important
   role in nitrogen removal. Almost undetectable levels of nitrate in the
   sediment further revealed that nitrate supply, regardless of diffusion
   from the overlying water or production by sediment nitrification
   processes, is the bottleneck for denitrification. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Warmer and wetter conditions will reduce offspring production of
   hawksbill turtles in Brazil under climate change},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to impact animals that are heavily reliant on
   environmental factors, such as sea turtles, since the incubation of
   their eggs, hatching success and sex ratio are influenced by the
   environment in which eggs incubate. As climate change progresses it is
   therefore important to understand how climatic conditions influence
   their reproductive output and the ramifications to population stability.
   Here, we examined the influences of five climatic variables (air
   temperature, accumulated and average precipitation, humidity, solar
   radiation, and wind speed) at different temporal scales on hawksbill sea
   turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) hatchling production at ten nesting
   beaches within two regions of Brazil (five nesting beaches in Rio Grande
   do Norte and five in Bahia). Air temperature and accumulated
   precipitation were the main climatic drivers of hawksbill hatching
   success (number of eggs hatched within a nest) across Brazil and in Rio
   Grande do Norte, while air temperature and average precipitation were
   the main climatic drivers of hatching success at Bahia. Solar radiation
   was the main climatic driver of emergence success (number of hatchlings
   that emerged from total hatched eggs within a nest) at both regions.
   Warmer temperatures and higher solar radiation had negative effects on
   hatchling production, while wetter conditions had a positive effect.
   Conservative and extreme climate scenarios show air temperatures are
   projected to increase at this site, while precipitation projections vary
   between scenarios and regions throughout the 21st century. We predicted
   hatching success of undisturbed nests (no recorded depredation or
   storm-related impacts) will decrease in Brazil by 2100 as a result of
   how this population is influenced by local climate. This study shows the
   determining effects of different climate variables and their
   combinations on an important and critically endangered marine species.},

Abstract = {The production of bio-succinic acid (bio-SA) from biomass has the
   potential to partially replace some petrochemicals, reduce climate
   change by capturing carbon dioxide, and provide a cleaner environment by
   managing waste streams. This study evaluates the economics,
   environmental impact, risk assessment, and optimal processing route of
   bio-SA production from multiple feedstocks (first, second, and
   third-generation), including (1) glucose, (2) corn stover, (3) glycerol,
   and (4) seaweed. A superstructure-based optimization model consisting of
   39 processing alternatives with a technology readiness level of 7-9 is
   developed, and the optimal topology for bio-SA production by
   maximization of the net present value under deterministic and stochastic
   conditions is identified. Once optimization is completed, the framework
   provides clear guidance for multi-criteria analysis, including the
   technical, economical, and environmental aspects of the biorefinery. The
   results indicate that glycerol is the best feedstock and corn stover is
   the second to best, producing bio-SA at selling prices of 1.6-1.9 USD
   per kg and 1.7-2.0 USD per kg, respectively, through their optimal
   processing pathways. Saccharina japonica (seaweed) is less suitable for
   large-scale bio-SA production due to the high cost of seaweed and the
   inability of enzymes to hydrolyze alginate, which is one of the major
   carbohydrate fractions (25-30 wt\%) of this feedstock. The environmental
   results indicate that the optimal pathway from glycerol is the most
   environmentally friendly process, followed by optimal processing
   pathways from substrates such as corn stover, glucose, and S. japonica.},

Journal = {DESALINATION},

Abstract = {This study investigates seawater desalination by coupling cyclopentane
   hydrate formation and capacitive deionization processes. High induction
   time, low conversion of water to hydrate, and low ion removal efficiency
   are the challenges of the hydrate desalination process. In order to
   reduce the cost of hydrate formation, cyclo-pentane was used as a
   hydrate former. Also, the promotion effects of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and
   magnetic field on the cyclopentane hydrate formation in pure water,
   seawater, and synthetic saline waters containing NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and
   MgCl2 at different concentrations were investigated. The results showed
   that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and magnetic field could improve the
   hydrate formation and the effect of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is greater than
   the magnetic field. However, the promoting effect on the induction time
   and removal efficiency was intensified when the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and
   the magnetic field were used simultaneously. The results of hydrate
   formation in seawater showed that the induction time in the presence of
   0.07 wt.\% Fe3O4 nanoparticles, magnetic field, and simultaneous use of
   both of them were reduced by 89, 22, and 92\%, respectively. The ion
   removal efficiency reached 79\% for Na+ and higher than 99\% for K+,
   Ca2+, and Mg2+ when capacitive deionization was used as post-treatment.},

Title = {Wintertime precipitation variability over the Arabian Peninsula and its

Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {47},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {2443-2454},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The climate variability on Earth is strongly influenced by the changes
   in the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical oceans.
   More specifically, the inter-annual climate variability in the tropics
   as well as extra-tropical areas has large impact due to the anomalous
   SSTs in the tropical Pacific coupled with the El Nio Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) through atmospheric teleconnections. However, the
   effect of ENSO on Middle Eastern region, specifically the Arabian
   Peninsula (AP) is marginally explored in previous studies. Hence, this
   study explicitly focuses on the assessment of ENSO variability and its
   winter climate teleconnections to the AP using the Community Atmospheric
   Model Version 4.0 (CAM4) simulations and Reanalysis datasets. ENSO
   teleconnections are also evaluated based on two sensitivity experiments
   (ENSO-related and ENSO-unrelated) using the CAM4 model. It is observed
   that during El Nio years the peninsular region receives more rainfall
   through enhanced moisture transport associated with anomalous westerly
   winds from adjoining Seas. The Rossby wave energy propagation in the
   atmosphere underlies important teleconnections involving ENSO. It is
   also noticed that there exist a distinct change in the phase of the
   Rossby wave pattern during El Nio and La Nia years which further causes
   the shift in the position of the jet stream over the Middle East.},

Title = {More coral, more fish? Contrasting snapshots froma remote Pacific atoll},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are in decline across the globe as a result of
   overexploitation, pollution, disease and, more recently, climate change.
   The impacts of changes in coral cover on associated fish communities can
   be difficult to predict because of the uneven dependence of reef fish
   species on corals for food, shelter or the three-dimensional structure
   they provide. We compared live coral cover, reef fish community metrics,
   and their associations in two surveys of the lagoon of the remote atoll
   of Mataiva (French Polynesia) carried out 31 years apart. In contrast to
   the general pattern of decreasing coral cover reported for many parts of
   the Indo-Pacific region, live coral cover increased 6-7 fold at Mataiva
   between 1981 and 2012, and fish density nearly doubled. The stable
   overall reef fish species richness belied a significant shift in
   community structure. There was little overlap in community composition
   across years, and fish assemblages in 2012 were more homogeneous in
   composition than they were in 1981. Changes in species abundance were
   not clearly related to species-specific reliance on corals. The strong
   positive relationships between live coral cover and fish diversity and
   abundance noted in 1981, when coral cover rarely exceeded 10\%, were no
   longer present in 2012, when coral cover rarely fell below this value.
   The most parsimonious explanation for these contrasting relationships is
   that, over the combined range of coral cover observed in the 1981 and
   2012 snapshots, there is a rapidly asymptotic relationship between coral
   and fish. Our results, and other data from the south and west Pacific,
   suggest that fish diversity and abundance might accumulate rapidly up to
   a threshold of approximately 10\% live coral cover. Such a relationship
   would have implications for our expectations of resistance and recovery
   of reef fish communities facing an increasingly severe regime of coral
   reef disturbances.},

Title = {A new measurement technique for the estimation of core shear strain in
   closed sandwich structures},
Journal = {COMPOSITE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {319-334},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sandwich structures have been widely used for many years in applications
   such as aircraft panels, marine-craft hulls, racing car bodies and
   spacecraft solar arrays. Most sandwich panel designs include a
   lightweight core such as paper honeycomb or closed cell foam encased
   between two face plates, and in the case of aircraft panels constructed
   from carbon fibre reinforced plastics, the core is bevelled and edge pan
   plies are included to totally enclose the core. This type of design
   restricts access to the core making it almost impossible for the
   engineer to measure the shear strain developed in the core during
   in-service static or dynamic loading. This paper introduces a new
   measurement technique whereby the shear strain in the core can be
   estimated from face plate measurements using a linear finite difference
   approximation. The estimation method is presented and supported by
   calculations on a statically loaded sandwich beam. Static and dynamic
   experiments were conducted in order to validate the technique using a
   honeycomb sandwich beam instrumented with strain gauges on the core and
   face plates. The results showed excellent agreement between measured and
   estimated core shear strain for sandwich configurations with thin face
   plates, such as those encountered in aircraft and marine-craft
   constructions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fourteen manganese nodules and three ferromanganese crusts from the
   Indian Ocean were analysed for major and minor elements and the 14
   naturally occurring rare earth elements (REE). The REE were analysed by
   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The samples were
   selected systematically from the Western Indian Ocean and the Central
   Indian Basin, to represent a seamount top, slope, an abyssal hill,
   siliceous sediment affected by terrigenous influx, a highly productive
   siliceous environment, red clay and carbonate sedimentary domains.
   Although REE zonation is observed in one oriented nodule, with relative
   enrichment in the top, evidence of top-bottom fractionation appears to
   have been obliterated as a result of the nodules being turned over.
   Correlations between Ca, P, Fe and REE in nodules suggest that the REE
   primarily reside in the iron oxyhydroxide and phosphatic phases. An
   authigenic origin is attributed to these elements. The nodules and
   crusts from the Western Indian Ocean and the shallower depths of the
   Central Indian Basin are delta-MnO2 rich, and are characterized by high
   concentrations of REE and higher positive cerium anomalies. These two
   areas are in the realm of cold Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which may
   enhance the oxidative scavenging of Ce by particles and its subsequent
   incorporation into manganese nodules. All the nodules and crusts show
   Gd-Tb anomalies. A diagenetic nodule with a palagonitic, smectite-rich
   nucleus exhibits an unusual heavy REE (HREE) enrichment with no
   significant Ce anomaly.},

Abstract = {In the present study, a geothermal driven multi-generation system for
   electric power, heating, cooling and hydrogen production is introduced.
   The proposed system is based on an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), where
   n-pentane is used as the working fluid. Within the study, it is aimed to
   evaluate the impact of geothermal source flow rate/temperature, ambient
   temperature and turbine inlet pressure on the energetic and exergetic
   performance of different system components. Besides, the overall first
   and second law efficiencies of the multi-generation system for different
   operating conditions are determined. In the investigated system,
   generated electricity can be partially used for domestic needs while the
   rest is proposed to be used for hydrogen production through an
   electrolysis process. Heat recovered from the ORC is also utilised for
   driving a single-effect absorption chiller (SEAC) for producing heating
   and cooling. The study results showed that the optimum mass flow rate
   and temperature of the geothermal source are 11.88 kg/s and 483.2 K,
   respectively. For the optimised operating conditions of the proposed
   multi-generation system, overall energetic and exergetic efficiencies
   were determined as 0.56 and 0.41, respectively.},

Abstract = {Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is an important process in the
   marine nitrogen cycle. However, little is known about the distribution,
   diversity and abundance of anammox bacteria in inland river ecosystems.
   Here, we found the presence of diverse anammox bacteria in a freshwater
   river the Qiantang River, Zhejiang Province (China). The phylogenetic
   analysis of 16S rRNA genes showed that Brocadia genus, Kuenenia genus,
   Scalindua genus and three new anammox bacterial clusters could be
   detected together in Qiantang River sediments, suggesting a higher
   anammox bacterial diversity in the Qiantang River ecosystem than in open
   ocean environments where only Scalindua genus was detected. Brocadia and
   Kuenenia appeared to be the most common anammox bacterial genera in the
   Qiantang River. Redundancy analysis showed that the sediment organic
   carbon (OrgC) content had significant influence on the distribution of
   anammox bacteria in Qiantang River sediments. Pearson correlation
   analyses showed that OrgC content significantly influenced the anammox
   bacterial diversity. The results of real-time quantitative PCR showed
   spatial variations of anammox bacterial abundances which were highly
   correlated with the sediment total inorganic nitrogen content. These
   results demonstrated the distribution of diverse anammox bacteria and
   the influences of environmental factors on anammox bacterial communities
   in Qiantang River sediments.},

Abstract = {Benefiting from the abundant solar energy and the emergence of
   photothermal conversion equipment, solar-driven water evaporation has
   shown great potential in seawater desalination. One common problem for
   solar-thermal evaporation is that the salt crystallized on the surface
   of solar absorbers during the seawater evaporation process will
   significantly deteriorate the continuity and efficiency of the
   evaporation process. In most reports, efforts have been made to transfer
   the accumulated salts, while the studies on preventing salt
   crystallization, which leads to better continuity of the production, are
   limited. Herein, a spontaneous salt-preventing solar-thermal water
   evaporator was designed, utilizing a dual-mode water transfer structure
   consisting of in-plane diffusion and in-tube migration. The dual-mode
   structural system gave rise to uniform and continuous water transfer,
   efficiently suppressing the salt concentration in the evaporator. As a
   result, salt crystallization was scarcely found on the surface of the
   evaporator under 1 sun irradiation for an ultralong time (200 h),
   demonstrating its high efficiency in inhibiting salt crystallization. In
   addition, the small contact area between the water and the evaporator
   could reduce the heat loss during the solar-thermal evaporation process,
   which further improved the water evaporation rate (1.64 kg in(-2)
   h(-1)).},

Title = {Aggregates production in Poland and other selected countries - an
   analysis of dependence on cement production},
Journal = {GOSPODARKA SUROWCAMI MINERALNYMI-MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {59-74},
Abstract = {The growth of the global population, urbanization as well as economic
   and industrial development, affect the continuously increasing demand
   for mineral aggregates. The current assessed global production of
   mineral aggregates amounts to 50 billion Mg/year, which statistically
   approximates 6.5 Mg per an inhabitant of the globe. In terms of
   consumption volume, water is the only raw material ahead of aggregates.
   Despite such a great scale, in many countries and regions the extraction
   and production of aggregates belong to the least regulated sector of
   human activity. This refers particularly to the countries of Asia,
   Africa, and North America, where both the resources and the extraction
   of aggregates, particularly of sand and gravels, are either not
   monitored and registered. it significantly increases the negative impact
   on the natural environment, due to the destruction of riverbeds and
   oxbows, coastal erosion, drying up cultivation areas, etc. In the
   reports, local terminology of aggregates often functions, which makes it
   difficult to compare them and prepare appropriate balances. in order to
   regulate the unfavorable situation, one of the main conclusions of the
   Report (UNEP 2019) is the need of implementing a common requirement to
   plan and monitor the process of extraction of natural resources. The
   paper presents the possibility of forecasting the extraction and
   producing aggregates based on the consumption of cement, i.e. the basic
   building material. Although the analyzed coefficient of mineral
   aggregate production per unit of cement consumption (production) varies,
   its advantage is the fact that the production of cement is identified
   and taken into account in balances of industrial production of the
   majority of countries, whereas such identification for mineral aggregate
   production are still lacking.},

Title = {Implications of sea-level rise in a modern carbonate ramp setting},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {304},
Pages = {64-73},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {This study addresses a gap in our understanding of the effects of
   sea-level rise on the sedimentary systems and morphological development
   of recent and ancient carbonate ramp settings. Many ancient carbonate
   sequences are interpreted as having been deposited in carbonate ramp
   settings. These settings are poorly-represented in the Recent The study
   documents the present-day transgressive flooding of the Abu Dhabi
   coastline at the southern shoreline of the Arabian/Persian Gulf, a
   carbonate ramp depositional system that is widely employed as a Recent
   analogue for numerous ancient carbonate systems. Fourteen years of
   field-based observations are integrated with historical and recent
   high-resolution satellite imagery in order to document and assess the
   onset of flooding. Predicted rates of transgression (i.e. landward
   movement of the shoreline) of 2.5 m yr(-1) (+/- 02 m yr(-1)) based on
   global sea-level rise alone were far exceeded by the flooding rate
   calculated from the back-stepping of coastal features (10-29 m yr(-1)).
   This discrepancy results from the dynamic nature of the flooding with
   increased water depth exposing the coastline to increased erosion and,
   thereby, enhancing back-stepping. A non-accretionary transgressive
   shoreline trajectory results from relatively rapid sea-level rise
   coupled with a low-angle ramp geometry and a paucity of sediments. The
   flooding is represented by the landward migration of fades belts, a
   range of erosive features and the onset of bioturbation. Employing
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Church et al., 2013)
   predictions for 21st century sea-level rise, and allowing for the
   post-flooding lag time that is typical for the start-up of carbonate
   factories, it is calculated that the coastline will continue to
   retrograde for the foreseeable future. Total passive flooding (without
   considering feedback in the modification of the shoreline) by the year
   2100 is calculated to likely be between 340 and 571 m with a flooding
   rate of 3.40-8.64 m yr(-1). However, adopting the observation that
   global sea-level rise only accounts for 15\% of the recorded shoreline
   retreat, this figure rises dramatically to a total likely dynamic
   flooding (considering modifications to the shoreline) of between 23 and
   3.8 km. Loss of microbial and mangal habitats will subject the exposed
   shoreline to increasing erosion. Shoreline retreat will threaten
   existing coastal infrastructure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The isolated outlier of Visean (Mid Mississippian) limestones and
   sandstones near Corwen, North Wales, UK, provides a critical constraint
   on regional tectonic and palaeogeographical models. The late Asbian to
   Brigantian succession comprises a series of shoaling-upwards cycles
   (parasequences). These were the product of forced, glacioeustatic
   regressions and have boundaries that testify to emergence, karstic
   dissolution and soil formation on a low gradient carbonate platform
   prior to flooding and the resumption of marine deposition. The
   recognition of two of the main marker beds within the North Wales Visean
   succession (Main Shale and Coral Bed) together with a newly applied
   foraminiferal and algal biozonation allow the outlier succession to be
   correlated with other Visean outcrops in the region and more widely
   throughout the British Isles. In revealing regional thickness and facies
   variations, these comparisons show that the outlier succession was
   deposited landward of the early Asbian shoreline in a region of enhanced
   subsidence localized along the Bala Lineament. The Corwen Outlier
   suggests that, within narrow gulfs associated with the region's major
   tectonic lineaments, Mississippian carbonate facies extended farther
   south into the contemporary hinterland of older rocks and that, in
   response to Brigantian climate change, these topographic features likely
   also influenced fluvial catchments supplying siliciclastic sediment to
   the platform's landward margin and, subsequently, Namurian deltas.
   Contrary to earlier suggestions, Visean outcrop patterns, facies
   distributions and thicknesses in the vicinity of the Bala Lineament can
   be explained without the need to invoke extensive post-depositional
   lateral displacements. BGS (c) NERC 2013. Geological Journal (c) John

Title = {Simulated impact of double-diffusive mixing on physical and

Abstract = {A global ocean circulation model coupled with a simple marine ecosystem
   model including the biogeochemical cycles and air-sea fluxes of oxygen
   and carbon dioxide is used to investigate the impact of double-diffusive
   mixing on upper ocean physical and biogeochemical properties. By
   comparing results for two different parameterizations of
   double-diffusive mixing, we also examine the sensitivity of our
   estimates to the particular representation of this process in general
   circulation models. Differences between the two parameterizations
   considered turned out to be much smaller than the difference with
   respect to a model run without double- diffusive mixing. For both
   parameterizations, the impact on upper ocean temperatures and salinities
   is relatively small (+/- 1 degrees C, +/- 0.25 psu regionally and 0.04
   degrees C, 0.01 psu as global rms difference over the top 50 m) and
   changes in surface heat flux amount to 0.05 W m(-2) globally. However
   primary production and export production in the oligotrophic subtropics
   are found to increase by up to 80\% and 120\%, respectively, when double
   diffusion is switched on in the model. Double- diffusive nutrient supply
   generates an additional oceanic carbon uptake of about 0.4 g C m(-2)
   year(-1), amounting to 0.14 Gt C year(-1) globally.},

Title = {Removal of metal ions from dilute solutions by sorptive flotation},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-235},
Abstract = {The removal of soluble ionic species, such as toxic metal cations or
   oxyanions, from dilute aqueous solutions, as most waste waters are, was
   investigated in laboratory-scale experiments (batch and continuous mode)
   by applying the sorptive flotation process. This method involves the
   preliminary abstraction or scavenging of metal ions using proper
   `'sorbents'', which exist at the fine or ultrafine particle-size range,
   followed by a subsequent flotation stage for the separation of
   metal-loaded sorbent particles from the treated (cleaned) solution. The
   main flotation techniques for the generation of the necessary bubbles
   (dissolved air, dispersed, and electrolytic) were applied effectively.
   The examined sorbents for the initial stage of the process could be of
   either inorganic nature, conventional (powdered activated carbon and
   zeolites) or industrial solid byproducts originated in the mineral
   industry, or of a biological nature (biosorbents), such as those
   produced during fermentations, in sewage treatment plants (sludge), etc.
   As a result of the process application, purified water is produced
   (underflow) as well as a foam concentrate; the recovery and recycling of
   removed species is also possible from the latter, leading to an overall
   clean technology. if required, the sorbents may also be reused and
   recycled after the application of a suitable metal eluant, which can
   also be considered to reveal to a certain extent the disposal problem of
   solid wastes.},

Title = {The Effect of Wind-Wave-Current Interaction on Air-Sea Momentum Fluxes

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1019-1034},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this paper, the wind-wave-current interaction mechanisms in tropical
   cyclones and their effect on the surface wave and ocean responses are
   investigated through a set of numerical experiments. The key element of
   the authors' modeling approach is the air-sea interface model, which
   consists of a wave boundary layer model and an air-sea momentum flux
   budget model. The results show that the time and spatial variations in
   the surface wave field, as well as the wave-current interaction,
   significantly reduce momentum flux into the currents in the right rear
   quadrant of the hurricane. The reduction of the momentum flux into the
   ocean consequently reduces the magnitude of the subsurface current and
   sea surface temperature cooling to the right of the hurricane track and
   the rate of upwelling/downwelling in the thermocline. During
   wind-wave-current interaction, the momentum flux into the ocean is
   mainly affected by reducing the wind speed relative to currents, whereas
   the wave field is mostly affected by refraction due to the spatially
   varying currents. In the area where the current is strongly and roughly
   aligned with wave propagation direction, the wave spectrum of longer
   waves is reduced, the peak frequency is shifted to a higher frequency,
   and the angular distribution of the wave energy is widened.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recent foraminiferal assemblages are identified in 70 grab samples from
   20-380 m depth in the Pontine Archipelago (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). All
   broken and relict tests of benthic foraminifera and other bioclastic
   sediments were counted for each sample, in order to provide a more
   complete description of the benthic community. Hierarchical cluster
   analysis (HCA) was performed on the relative abundances (live + dead) of
   53 taxa of benthic foraminifera that were common in the samples. Q-mode
   HCA recognizes three distinct foraminiferal biofacies, each associated
   with a particular bioclastic lithofacies: 1) the
   Asterigerinata-Lobatula-Rosalina biofacies occurs at 20-150 m and is
   dominated by benthic foraminifera, most notably epiphytic species such
   as Asterigerinata mantilla, Lobatula lobatula, and Rosalina brad vi;
   other bioclasts include rhodoliths, bryozoans, and echinoid spines,
   which constitute the rhodalgal lithofacies; 2) the Cassidulina carinata
   biofacies at intermediate depths of 100-250 m includes benthic and
   planktonic foraminifera among branches of bryozoans that constitute the
   bryomol lithofacies; also present are high percentages of reworked
   glauconitic tests of shallow-water taxa (e.g., Elphidium, Lobatula, and
   Asterigerinata), possibly related to Late Quaternary sea-level
   stillstands; 3) the Uvigerina-Bulimina biofacies at 200-380 m, that is
   characterized by Uvigerina mediterranea and Bulimina marginata; in
   addition to benthic and planktonic foraminifera, it has a molechfor
   lithofacies of bivalves and gastropods.},

Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to develop and improve the thermal
   and radiative performance of solar cookers. A solar cooker has been
   designed, constructed and experimentally analyzed to achieve this goal.
   The designed system contains three narrow, adjustable flat mirrors that
   are mounted on a parabolic curved substrate in order to concentrate the
   reflected solar beam onto the absorber plate. The efficiency of this
   system depends on many variables that were kept fixed with the exception
   of the parabolic mirror position and operation time. The response
   surface method was used as the basis of the design and analysis of the
   experiments. The analysis of the results provided the mathematical
   function of the effective and overall efficiencies based on the
   experimental variables that can be adopted to optimize the mirror
   positions at any given time. As a result, a new system was developed
   with adjustable mirrors that yields 32.07\% and 35.5\% increase in the
   effective and overall efficiencies, respectively. The results have been
   validated by variance analysis and comparing theoretical and
   experimental efficiency. The experiments were carried out in Mashhad,
   Iran at latitude 37, longitude 54, and a height of 985 m above sea
   level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Pages = {73-85},

Abstract = {The Sivas Tertiary Basin is located on top of the Late Cretaceous
   Neotethys ophiolitic nappes which were abducted onto both the Pontic
   belt and the Tauric platform. Organic facies characters of Tertiary
   units in this basin have been determined by means of total organic
   carbon (TOC) analysis, rock-eval pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance data
   and organic petrography investigation. The total organic carbon content
   (TOC) of fine grained sediments from the Eocene (Kozluca and Bozbel
   Formations) are between 0.05 and 2.26\% indicating that these formations
   are poor to moderate in organic matter. Rock-eval analysis yield low
   hydrogen index (HI) and high oxygen index (OI) values for all samples.
   The dominant organic matter is type III kerogen and the
   hydrocarbon-generating potential is thus very low. The vitrinite
   reflectance (R-o) value is between 0.30 and 0.93\%. In the Sivas
   Tertiary Basin, the Oligocene sediments from the Selimiye Formation are
   characterized by a low TOC content (0.05-1.72\%) and hydrogen index
   (21-47 mg HC/g TOC). The vitrinite reflectance of Oligocene sediments is
   0.38-0.64\%. The total organic carbon content (TOC) for Miocene
   sediments (Hafik and Karacaoren Formation) is 0.07-1.46\%. The organic
   matter content is richer in the Miocene sediments of the Karacaoren
   Formation marine shelf than in the sediments of the Hafik Formation
   terrestrial. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the prospects of available renewable energy resources
   along with various private and government future project plans to
   incorporate renewable energy sources and its potentials in perspective
   of Bangladesh. In an arising country like Bangladesh demand for energy
   will be burgeoning. Present day, in Bangladesh dearth of energy is
   ubiquitous and near about 70\% of its population is excluded from access
   to electricity and bulk of the people are living in rural areas. Among
   several renewable energy resources, the application of solar Photo
   Voltaic (PV) is renowned although the largest plant based on renewable
   energy goes into hydroelectricity. Additionally, wind, biogas, mini
   hydro and tidal are also well known. A plan has been initiated by the
   Government of Bangladesh (GOB) to generate 5\% of the total energy from
   renewable energy resources within 2015 and 20\% by the year of 2020.
   Through the approved renewable energy policy, the GOB is devoted to
   facilitate investment in both public and private sectors in renewable
   energy projects to substitute contemporaneous non-renewable energy
   resources and escalate the contributions of renewable energy based
   electricity generation. With this context, review of recent activities
   on concurrent renewable energy resources is imperative as well as to
   explore potentials of the resources. However, not all renewable energy
   sources are suitable to install indiscriminately in all regions, rather
   there are certain parameters to choose a source of RER for efficacy.
   After reading this paper, an investor will get significant information
   about current scenario and steering for future involvement of renewable
   energy sources in Bangladesh. Furthermore, this paper will be
   instrumental to select optimum efficacious renewable energy sources for
   a particular region.},

   reefs has been challenging owing to a paucity of long-term ecological
   data and high frequency of disturbances. Here we investigate community
   re-assembly and the bio-physical drivers that determine the capacity of
   coral reefs to recover following the 1998 bleaching event, using
   long-term monitoring data across four habitats in Palau. Our study
   documents that the time needed for coral reefs to recover from bleaching
   disturbance to coral-dominated state in disturbance-free regimes is at
   least 9-12 years. Importantly, we show that reefs in two habitats
   achieve relative stability to a climax community state within that time
   frame. We then investigated the direct and indirect effects of drivers
   on the rate of recovery of four dominant coral groups using a structural
   equation modelling approach. While the rates of recovery differed among
   coral groups, we found that larval connectivity and juvenile coral
   density were prominent drivers of recovery for fast growing Acropora but
   not for the other three groups. Competitive algae and parrotfish had
   negative and positive effects on coral recovery in general, whereas wave
   exposure had variable effects related to coral morphology. Overall, the
   time needed for community re-assembly is habitat specific and drivers of
   recovery are taxa specific, considerations that require incorporation
   into planning for ecosystem management under climate change.},

Title = {A floating platform of concrete for offshore wind turbine},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2011},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {A floating platform concept is introduced in this paper for offshore
   wind turbine. A vertical cylinder on the top of an elliptical sphere
   forms the principal configuration of the platform. The analysis of the
   dynamic performance of an example platform with 5 MW wind turbine by
   means of the well-established linear theory for the dynamics of marine
   constructions in waves shows that the platform is able to secure the
   normal function of the wind turbine in waves up to rough sea state and
   has the required dynamic performance for survival in extreme waves by
   adopting a survival ballast condition. An important feature of this
   concept is that reinforced concrete can be used as cost-efficient
   construction material so that the service life, several times longer
   than similar steel constructions can be obtained despite of the marine
   corrosive and erosive environment. Thus, this kind of platform can
   become competitive in the economical, sustainable, and
   environment-friendly aspect. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {In this paper, a model for implementation of sea passage operational
   scenarios in the context of simulation-based design of ships is
   presented. To facilitate the transition towards more energy-efficient
   shipping, the ability to evaluate and understand ship and ship system
   behaviour in operational conditions is central. By introducing an
   optimization model in virtual testing frameworks, operational scenarios
   can be generated that enhances scenario relevance and testing abilities.
   The optimization for simulation approach provides speed and course
   commands based on an optimization framework which factors in the
   operational considerations and sea state conditions in the area of
   operation. Impact on the understanding of ship system performance using
   simulation is assessed in a case study where a sea passage over the
   North Pacific is replicated for varying operational scenarios and
   seasons. It is found that the variation of operational scenario,
   affecting the sea state and speed relation, causes significant
   differences in required power and fuel consumption estimates. Sea
   passage control is found to be an important dimension in virtual testing
   approaches.},

Title = {Effect of mixed leaf litter of four mangrove species on shrimp post
   larvae (Penaeus monodon, Fabricius, 1798) performance in tank and
   mesocosm conditions in Bangladesh},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Mangrove leaf litter is a potential source of nutrients for shrimp post
   larvae. To introduce mangrove trees in shrimp farms it is necessary to
   identify the combination of trees which is most beneficial for shrimp.
   The present study evaluated the effects of mixed leaf litter of four
   mangrove species (Avicennia officinalis (Ao), Sonneratia apetala (Sa),
   S. caseolaris (Sc) and Heritiera fomes (Hf) on shrimp post larvae
   performance and water and soil quality. Leaf litter with and without
   supplemental feed was applied to shrimp culture tanks according to a 4 x
   2 factorial design and followed by testing a subset of treatments in
   mesocosm pond conditions. Shrimp post larvae of 15-days old (PL15) with
   an average weight of 0.01 g were used for both experiments, each with a
   4-week duration without water exchange. Under controlled conditions in
   the tanks, leaf litter and feed resulted in 22 to 32\% higher weight
   gain of PL shrimp than combined weight gain realized when receiving only
   leaf litter or only feed, indicating synergism. Based on this, the pond
   experiment was designed with combined application of leaf litter and
   feed. The pond experiment resulted in higher shrimp weight gain than
   realized in the tanks. In tanks, the highest average individual weight
   gain of PL was observed for the leaf litter mixture SaAoHf (0.23 g)
   followed by SaScHf (0.21 g), ScAoHf (0.21 g) andSaScAoHf (0.20 g).
   Paralleling the results of the tank experiment, SaAoHf leaf litter also
   gave the highest average individual weight gain (1.2 g) of PL shrimpin
   the ponds but other leaf litter treatments followed by SaScAoHf (0.95
   g), ScAoHf (0.84 g) and SaScHf (0.69 g) leaf litter. The different
   mixtures of mangrove leaf litter also resulted in significant
   differences in biological oxygen demand (BOD5), phytoplankton and
   zooplankton concentrations in pond water and organic carbon in soil.
   Both phytoplankton (P < 0.01, Pearson correlation r = 0.910)and
   zooplankton (P < 0.05, r = 0.535) abundance was positively correlated to
   shrimp weight gain. The low feed conversion ratio (FCR) in the
   treatments combining leaf litter and supplemental feed as compared to
   treatments using only feed indicated extra food benefits for shrimp PL
   from decomposing leaf litter. Overall, mixed mangrove leaf litter had a
   positive effect on shrimp performance and this effect was highest for
   SaAoHf leaf litter.

   core data},
Journal = {CLIMATE OF THE PAST},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {353-366},
Abstract = {As pointed out by the forth assessment report of the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change, IPCC-AR4 (Meehl et al., 2007), the contribution
   of the two major ice sheets, Antarctica and Greenland, to global sea
   level rise, is a subject of key importance for the scientific community.
   By the end of the next century, a 3-5 degrees C warming is expected in
   Greenland. Similar temperatures in this region were reached during the
   last interglacial (LIG) period, 130-115 ka BP, due to a change in
   orbital configuration rather than to an anthropogenic forcing. Ice core
   evidence suggests that the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) survived this warm
   period, but great uncertainties remain about the total Greenland ice
   reduction during the LIG. Here we perform long-term simulations of the
   GIS using an improved ice sheet model. Both the methodologies chosen to
   reconstruct palaeoclimate and to calibrate the model are strongly based
   on proxy data. We suggest a relatively low contribution to LIG sea level
   rise from Greenland melting, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5m of sea level
   equivalent, contrasting with previous studies. Our results suggest an
   important contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to the LIG highstand.},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Global warming and rising sea levels are increasingly causing major
   problems for low lying Pacific and Indian Ocean island nations. The
   Republic of Kiribati in the South Pacific is currently in a dire
   situation, and increasing levels of international aid will be required
   to maintain the population at its current standard of living. This paper
   describes a sustainable artificial island, designed for the inhabitants
   of South Tarawa, the capital island of the Republic of Kiribati. Design
   targets were to improve infrastructure, services and quality of life for
   the inhabitants, to increase island sustainability and to minimise
   construction costs. Transition to an artificial island is a feasible
   option with significant international support, and would enable survival
   for the population of South Tarawa with minimum disruption to their
   current lifestyle. Its construction and population would require a large
   leap of faith by both the financiers and the inhabitants, but it has the
   potential to provide a range of economic, social and environmental
   benefits both for the population and for the country. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Optimal resilient operation of hub energy system considering uncertain
   parameters},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The high potential of hub energy in power systems has considerable
   profits to improve resiliency and sustainability of system. Variable
   energy sources embedded in multi-carrier energy systems could be used to
   propose a robust operation model for improve resiliency of multi-carrier
   systems during high risk time intervals such as extreme weather
   condition. Thermal energy sector could be rescheduled for storing heat
   generated by combined heat and power (CHP) units and boilers in certain
   periods to coordinate with electrical sector when required. Such
   cooperation increase operator's capability to manage electrical grid
   during time intervals with high uncertainty of outages due to extreme
   weather condition. Accordingly, in this paper an information gap
   decision theory (IGDT) method is used to model uncertainty of power
   outages in optimal system operation. By applying the IGDT method,
   distribution network operator is able to employ an appropriate
   methodology to have a robust optimal operation. Also, such methodology
   leads to make suitable decisions during high risk time intervals such as
   extreme weather condition. The simulation results proved that proposed
   model improves the performance and resilience of system by cooperation
   between thermal and electrical sectors. Also, the chance of electrical
   grid for successful islanding process increased by reduction in power
   imbalance during high risk time intervals. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {CasaNova is a city district in the southern part of Bolzano, which
   consists of 950 apartments hosting about 3000 inhabitants. The
   apartments' owners are both IPES, the local Institute for Social housing
   of South Tyrol, and some cooperatives.
   The approach adopted during the district's design phase included the
   urban planning concept, the energy concept and the architectural
   competitions for individual lots. The urban planning concept was
   developed by an interdisciplinary team coordinated by Frits van Dongen
   from Amsterdam. The team planned the construction of the eight
   ``castles{''}, namely a built-up area consisting of three or four
   buildings placed around a shared green space.
   The energy concept includes three main objectives: (1) reducing the
   energy needs for heating, (2) rationalizing the use of traditional
   energy sources and (3) using renewable energy sources. In order to
   achieve such objectives, the concept was based on two levels. The first
   level was focused on the connection of the buildings to a district
   heating system with heat recovery from an incinerator. The second level
   defined guidelines on energy requirements for each lots. The CasaNova
   district was also included within the campaign ``Sustainable Energy
   Europe (SEE){''} promoted in Italy by the Ministry of Environment, Land
   and Sea. The City, the Province and the district itself were considered
   as good examples of implementation of energy efficiency and use of
   renewable sources to reduce CO2 emissions, at national level.
   As a concrete action within the partnership with the Italian Ministry of
   Environment, The European Academy of Bozen/Bolzano (EURAC) monitored the
   actual energy performance of the district, in the context of the
   implementation of the SEE campaign. The whole monitoring campaign was
   aimed to assess both the actual energy performance of buildings,
   comparing them with the design values (potential), and the level of
   indoor comfort in some sample apartments analyzed using different
   parameters such as the air quality, temperature and humidity.
   Monitoring results showed that the buildings have total primary energy
   consumptions very different from each other (ranging from 79 kWh/m(2)y
   to 172 kWh/m(2)y), and with a meaningful gap compared with the predicted
   ones, as calculated in the design phase, reaching in some cases values
   more than double (+167\%). According to EURAC evaluation, the main cause
   of this issue has been identified in tenants' behavior, especially on
   their non-optimal use and maintenance of the building and facilities.
   The paper shows how the buildings with simpler constructive solutions
   consume less energy than the complex ones. This difference, is mainly
   due to the difficulties encountered by the tenants on managing complex
   technologies in their flat, especially on mechanical ventilation.
   Indeed, the implementation of these technologies requires behavioral
   changes on those lodgers accustomed to live in the ``classic{''} Italian
   house. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Responses and Recovery of Salt Marsh Vegetation and Birds in
   Southeastern Massachusetts to Two Hydrologic Events: a Tidal Restoration

Abstract = {Allens Pond, a coastal lagoon in southeastern Massachusetts, was
   subjected to two major hydrological events in the 2000s. The first was a
   culvert widening to increase tidal flushing in an attempt to stop the
   spread of the invasive plant, Phragmites australis. The second, four
   years later, was a complete inundation of the surrounding salt marsh due
   to the closure of a tidal inlet. The effect of these events on salt
   marsh vegetation was monitored using transects and on the marsh avian
   community using point counts. The inundation event, although limited to
   one growing season, had a more pronounced negative effect on marsh
   organisms than the restoration. Saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina
   alterniflora, took approximately three years to recover to
   pre-inundation abundance. Salt marsh hay, Spartina patens, had still not
   recovered five years after the inundation. This supports the idea that
   this high marsh plant is particularly sensitive to prolonged inundation.
   There was no measurable effect of either the hydrological restoration or
   the inundation event on P. australis. Saltmarsh sparrows declined 79\%
   in the years immediately following the inundation, then recovered to
   their pre-inundation level in about eight years. Seaside sparrows
   declined 49\% immediately following the inundation event and recovered
   after eight years, although there was a great deal of variation. Willets
   were only affected in the year immediately after the inundation. Our
   results from this flooding incident at Allens Pond provide insight into
   the potential impact of rising sea levels on estuarine plant and avian
   communities.},

Title = {Isolation and characterization of agar-digesting Vibrio species from the

Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {119},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Gracilariopsis heteroclada Zhang et Xia (Gracilariaceae, Rhodophyta) is
   one of the most studied marine seaweeds due to its economic importance.
   This has been cultivated extensively on commercial scale in the
   Philippines and other Asian countries. However, sustainable production
   of G. heteroclada in the Philippines could not be maximized due to the
   occurrence of rotten thallus disease. Thus, isolation and
   characterization of agar-digesting bacteria from the rotten thalli of G.
   heteroclada was conducted. A total of seven representative bacterial
   isolates were randomly selected based on their ability to digest agar as
   evidenced by the formation of depressions around the bacterial colonies
   on nutrient agar plates supplemented with 1.5\% NaCl and liquefaction of
   agar. Gram-staining and biochemical characterization revealed that
   isolates tested were gram-negative rods and taxonomically identified as
   Vibrio parahaemolyticus (86-99.5\%) and Vibrio alginolyticus
   (94.2-97.7\%), respectively. It is yet to be confirmed whether these
   agar-digesting vibrios are involved in the induction and development of
   rotten thallus disease in G. heteroclada in concomitance with other
   opportunistic bacterial pathogens coupled with adverse environmental
   conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Benthic nutrient fluxes along an estuarine gradient: influence of the
   pinnid bivalve Atrina zelandica in summer},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {288},
Pages = {151-164},
Abstract = {Benthic nutrient fluxes (BNF) can supply 30 to 100\% of the nutrient
   requirements of benthic and pelagic algae in an estuary, and can, thus,
   potentially sustain benthic and pelagic primary production within the
   estuarine food web. While BNF can be influenced by microbial processes,
   epibenthic suspension-feeding bivalves have the potential to alter
   fluxes by their influence on the community composition of surrounding
   macrofauna and benthic boundary conditions, and their feeding
   activities. In Mahurangi Harbour, New Zealand, the large suspension
   feeding pinnid Atrina zelandica (hereafter referred to as Atrina)
   occupies large areas of the harbour floor. Consequently, Atrina have the
   potential to substantially influence the BNF and, thus, primary
   production, and the food supply to the filter feeding community within
   the harbour, including the rack-farmed Pacific oyster aquaculture
   industry. Mahurangi Harbour is almost always isohaline, but exhibits a
   strong gradient in suspended sediment concentration, which declines from
   head to mouth. As Atrina increase their rate of pseudofaeces production
   with increases in suspended sediment concentration, we conducted in situ
   light and dark paired benthic chamber experiments with and without
   Atrina at 4 stations along this turbidity gradient, to determine their
   effect on BNF. Our results showed substantially greater BNF from Atrina
   beds than bare sediments. We also found greater net BNF (difference
   between Atrina beds and bare sediment) in the less turbid water under
   dark conditions, but enhanced water column nutrient supply in the more
   turbid water in light, due to Atrina excretion of ammoniacal nitrogen
   (NH4-N). On an areal basis, we estimate that BNF from Atrina beds may
   account for up to 80\% of the nutrient supply for pelagic primary
   production and, thus, they are of major importance to the sustainability
   of aquaculture in this harbour.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the last few years, one of the most important challenges of power
   technologies has been the integration of traditional energy production
   systems and distributed energy resources. Large-scale photovoltaic
   systems and wind farms may decrease the quality of the electrical grid
   service, mainly due to voltage and frequency peaks and fluctuations.
   Besides, new functionalities, such as the operation in islanded mode of
   some portions of the medium-voltage grid, are more and more required. In
   this respect, a model predictive control for voltage and frequency
   regulation in interconnected local distribution systems is presented. In
   the proposed model, each local system represents a collection of
   intelligent buildings and microgrids with a large capacity in active and
   reactive power regulation. The related model formalization includes a
   linear approximation of the power flow equations, based on stochastic
   variables related to the electrical load and to the production from
   renewable sources. A model predictive control problem is formalized, and
   a closed-loop linear control law has been obtained. In the results
   section, the proposed approach has been tested on the Institute of
   Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE) 5 bus system, considering
   multiple loads and renewable sources variations on each local system.},

Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {This study aims to develop a new approach for design and evaluation of
   renewable energy sources-based energy supply system using different
   energy demand scenarios and an optimization model. To achieve this goal,
   we first generate six scenarios by the combination of different supply
   and demand options. We then develop a new optimization model for
   identifying the optimal system configuration by minimizing the total
   energy cost subject to various constraints. We apply the proposed
   approach to the design problem of energy system of Jeju Island, Korea.
   We evaluate the different scenario-based systems of Jeju Island using
   economic metrics including net present cost, levelized cost of energy
   and annual energy expenses. The sensitivity of major process and
   economic parameters, and different meteorological data on the annual
   energy expenses is also discussed. As a result, the levelized energy
   cost was estimated to range from 0.53 to 134 \$/kWh according the
   examined scenarios. We analyzed that the centralized energy production
   by the hybrid use of wind and solar energy is the most affordable
   system. We also identified the key cost driver in the distributed and
   centralized energy production systems; i.e., the capital cost of the
   wind turbine and the energy storage facilities, respectively. (C) 2017

Abstract = {This paper describes the application of magnetotelluric (MT) method to
   investigate Bjorko impact structure located at west of Stockholm,
   Sweden. This structure has formed in crystalline rocks ca. 1.2 Ga ago
   and located relatively close to the district heating infrastructure of
   the Stockholm region, as the largest district heating system in Europe.
   Since impact structures mostly contain fractured rock volumes in the
   form of breccia formations, the occurred brecciation zones in this
   region are more favorable potential targets for geothermal
   investigations. The main objective is evaluating the capability of the
   study area to have potential for geothermal resources by mapping the
   subsurface structure. To image electrical characteristic of underground
   layers, 1D and 2D bimodal inversions of TE and TM modes of MT data are
   performed. The results are also compared with the outputs of the
   inversion of the determinant data (yielding a direction independent
   average of the subsurface conductivity) along the same profiles, proving
   good accordance of the outputs. The processed resistivity sections at
   depth along with measuring various rock physical properties across two
   drilled boreholes at Bjorko and Midsommar islands localized two
   conductors at depths of 1 km and from 2.5 to 4.5 km, which may be
   attributed to be a potential zone for geothermal energy retrieval.},

Title = {Preparation and thermal characteristics of eutectic fatty acids/Shorea

Journal = {APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {In this study, two types of fatty acid based composite phase change
   material (CPCM) have been prepared by mixing-impregnation method.
   Myristic acid/palmitic acid/sodium palmitate (MA/PA/SP) and myristic
   acid/palmitic acid/sodium stearate (MA/PA/SS) were used as base eutectic
   PCMs and Shorea javanica (SJ) was used as a porous material to improve
   the thermal conductivity and thermal performance of CPCM. Thermal
   properties, thermal conductivity, and thermal stability of prepared
   CPCMs were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   thermal analysis, thermal conductivity analysis, and simultaneous
   thermal analyzer (STA). Furthermore, a chemical compatibility analysis
   has been done using Fourier transform infra-red spectrophotometer
   (FT-IR) and a fabricated test rig was used to determine thermal
   performance. It was seen that CPCMs with addition of 3 wt.\% SJ
   presented a good improvement on thermal conductivity without any
   significant effect on thermal properties. No chemical reaction between
   initial eutectic fatty acids and SJ occurred as evidenced by FT-IR and
   CPCMs show a good thermal stability as well. Therefore, it is concluded
   that addition of Shorea javanica (SJ) into fatty acid eutectic CPCMs is
   appropriate to improve the thermal performance of CPCM and it can be
   acceptable for use as porous material for other PCMs. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Fuel burn rates of commercial passenger aircraft: variations by seat
   configuration and stage distance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {137-147},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aircraft fuel consumption is a very large component of airline costs.
   Fuel burn is also very important because it is highly correlated with
   emissions and contributes directly to transport externalities. This
   paper calibrates fuel burn in kilos per seat per nautical mile for
   aircraft using the EMEP/EEA aircraft inventory database. We then employ
   the model with OAG flight schedule data to evaluate fuel burn by flight
   routes and aircraft types at a global scale. The paper shows comparative
   fuel use among different distance based markets as well as among a
   variety of routes in the long-haul market. The results show geographical
   heterogeneity of fuel burn rates among a variety of routes, while
   controlling for seat configuration and stage distance. The paper finds
   that stage lengths centered on 1500-2000 NM have the lowest fuel burn
   rates under current technology, fleet composition, and seat
   configuration. These findings, together with comments on the viability
   of long range flights provide better understandings not only for the
   carbon taxation debates but also for operational efficiency of current
   aviation markets. The lower rates for moderate distance flights seems to
   favor networks without extreme links, and supports the use of a hub
   connection scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Accurate detection of DNA methylation at specific gene transcription
   sites is important to identify potential tumor formation since this
   epigenetic alteration may result in silencing of tumor suppressor genes
   that protect against tumor formation or that repair damaged DNA. Current
   technologies used in DNA methylation detection are complicated and time
   consuming. This work presents the first nanowire field effect transistor
   (FET) based biosensor technology which achieves simple and
   ultra-sensitive electronic DNA methylation detection and avoids
   complicated bisulfite treatment and PCR amplification. The promoter of
   the p16(INK) gene, a tumor suppressor gene, is the target DNA in the
   detection model. The target DNA was captured and concentrated with
   magnetic beads, and released to the sensing surface of a nano-FET
   through a reversible binding process. The methylated p16(INK) promoter
   was recognized and bound to monoclonal anti-5-methylcytosine antibodies
   which were immobilized on the nano-FET sensing surface. The presence of
   the target DNA molecules induced electronic charge and changed the
   electronic properties of the nano-transistor from which detectable
   electronic signals are generated. The electronic charge based DNA
   methylation detection is simple and ultra-sensitive with the potential
   for low cost. The detection sensitivity was achieved at 2.5 x 10(-19)
   mol with no false positives observed. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {All the solar powered cookers presently available in the world market
   are of the so-called `'Reflector Box'' type. Despite the fact that they
   have been presented, for a good few years, to the market and are very
   simple and low cost they have not managed to establish any meaningful
   and noticeable presence in a viable commercial sense. This fact is even
   more in evidence in those markets they are primarily designed for. The
   reasons to the lack of commercial success for the reflector box type
   cookers are analysed in some details. The assessment of general features
   and performance of the reflector box type cooker led to the design of
   the Fast Response Storage Type Cooker presented in this paper.
   The new cooker is the result of combination of non-tracking compound
   parabolic reflector, fast response heat pipes, high-quality and low-cost
   thermal insulator, low-loss thermal storage battery, glass to metal
   seals, vacuum technology and bimetal automatic switches. It is capable
   of storing the solar energy during the day to facilitate cooking during
   the evenings and nights. A prototype is made and the performance of the
   elements of the system are presented It shows how the `'waste-energy''
   of the cooker can be used for other applications.},

Title = {Experiencing nature at Weedon Island Nature Preserve: discourses of
   duality, willful blindness and ecological nobility},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {Weedon Island Nature Preserve in Florida houses an educational center,
   which displays a visual and rhetorical narrative of local ecology and
   the lifeways of the region's Indigenous inhabitants. We conduct
   rhetorical and narrative analysis to examine how the exhibits construct
   the relationship between Indigenous people and the land. We conclude
   that while park exhibits do not replicate stereotypes of ecological
   nobility (Hamel, Annual Review of Anthropology, 36(1), 177-190, 2007),
   they represent Indigenous people as existing only in the past and fail
   to adequately connect to contemporary Native nations living in the area.
   Secondly, we analyze how park exhibits approach the fact that the park
   shares its ``island{''} with a Duke Energy gas-fired power plant. This
   juxtaposition of human use of fossil fuels for energy consumption and
   the desire to preserve local ecosystems presents challenges for the
   curators of the park's environmental discourses, which ultimately
   ignores the power plant and fails to engage with issues of fossil fuel
   use or climate change. Visitor experiences in the park render the power
   plant nearly invisible. Indeed, we argue visitors and curators'
   ``willful blindness{''} (a deliberate act of ignoring the presence of a
   dissonant element in the environmental narrative of environmental
   purity, i.e., Carr \& Milstein, Geoforum, 122, 183-192 2021) erases the
   presence of the plant. Educational opportunities to address the source
   of climate change are lost, as are possibilities for bringing local
   Native people out of the dustbin of the past and into the living
   present.},

Title = {Phytoplankton biomass and production in the southeastern Beaufort Sea in
   autumn 2002 and 2003},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {377},
Pages = {63-77},
Abstract = {The phytoplankton community of the Mackenzie shelf and the Amundsen Gulf
   (southeastern Beaufort Sea) was characterized (e.g. chlorophyll a
   biomass, primary production and taxonomy) during autumn 2002 (23
   September to 14 October) and 2003 (30 September to 14 November). Spatial
   differences were evident, particularly in early autumn. Total
   phytoplankton biomass and the contribution of large cells (>5 mu m) to
   biomass were higher in the Amundsen Gulf than on the Mackenzie shelf.
   The community of autotrophic cells (>10 mu m) was numerically dominated
   by diatoms in the Amundsen Gulf and by dinoflagellates on the Mackenzie
   shelf. The abundance of chlorophytes revealed the influence of the
   Mackenzie River on the Mackenzie shelf. Contrary to 2002, when all
   measurements were from early October, the phytoplankton community of the
   Amundsen Gulf in 2003 presented the characteristics of a late bloom,
   which presumably peaked in late September. In early autumn, however,
   primary production rates were similar for both years, averaging 75 mg C
   m(-2) d(-1). High primary production-to-biomass ratios and overall
   dominance of small cells (<5 mu m) suggest that pelagic production in
   the southeastern Beaufort Sea was sustained by active recycling. During
   autumn 2003, a temporal decrease in phytoplankton biomass and primary
   production likely resulted from decreasing light availability. Overall,
   the autumnal primary production estimated in this study, from
   mid-September to the end of October, could increase the annual primary
   production previously estimated for the Beaufort Sea by 15\%.},

Abstract = {The assessment of aliphatic hydrocarbons was performed in the Sergipe
   River estuarine system, northeastern Brazil. Aliphatic hydrocarbons
   concentration ranged from 9.9 ug g(-1) up to 30.8 ug g(-1) of dry
   sediment. The carbon preference index (CPI, based on nC(24) to nC(34)
   range), indicated predominance of petrogenic input in two of the sites
   analyzed (P4 and P5). The unresolved complex mixture (UCM) was found to
   be present in seven of the nine sites sampled (except for P4 and P5).
   Overall, the results of this work suggest that there is a mix of organic
   matter sources to the sediment. Although the coast of Sergipe has an
   intense off shore petroleum exploration and the Sergipe River crosses
   the entire city of Aracaju, the capital city of Sergipe, non-significant
   anthropogenic fingerprint was assessed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {An Evaluation of Plotless Sampling Using Vegetation Simulations and
   Field Data from a Mangrove Forest},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {In vegetation science and forest management, tree density is often used
   as a variable. To determine the value of this variable, reliable field
   methods are necessary. When vegetation is sparse or not easily
   accessible, the use of sample plots is not feasible in the field.
   Therefore, plotless methods, like the Point Centred Quarter Method, are
   often used as an alternative. In this study we investigate the accuracy
   of different plotless sampling methods. To this end, tree densities of a
   mangrove forest were determined and compared with estimates provided by
   several plotless methods. None of these methods proved accurate across
   all field sites with mean underestimations up to 97\% and mean
   overestimations up to 53\% in the field. Applying the methods to
   different vegetation patterns shows that when random spatial
   distributions were used the true density was included within the 95\%
   confidence limits of all the plotless methods tested. It was also found
   that, besides aggregation and regularity, density trends often found in
   mangroves contribute to the unreliability. This outcome raises questions
   about the use of plotless sampling in forest monitoring and management,
   as well as for estimates of density-based carbon sequestration. We give
   recommendations to minimize errors in vegetation surveys and
   recommendations for further in-depth research.},

Abstract = {CaCO3, and biogenic opal in the western equatorial Atlantic from
   time-series sediment traps deployed between 550 and 850 m water depth at
   the equator (WAO degrees), 4 degrees S (WAL4 degrees S) and 7 degrees S
   (WA7 degrees S). In addition, species composition and downward fluxes of
   diatoms and silicoflagellates were determined. Significant seasonal
   variations in export production were observed between the equator and
   WA4 degrees S, and were substantially diminished at WA7 degrees S
   (oligotrophic site). CaCO3 dominates sedimentation, followed by
   lithogenic particle and biogenic opal. Diatom and siliconflagellate
   maxima coincide with the southernmost position of the Intertropical
   Convergence Zone (January-March), and with the equatorial upwelling
   season of July-September, mainly reflected at WA4 degrees S, where mean
   diatom and silicoflagellate fluxes are highest. Interannual variability
   may be more common than generally assumed for oligotrophic central-ocean
   gyres. On a yearly basis, total particle and CaCO3 fluxes covary and
   show opposite latitudinal trends: high annual fluxes at WA4 degrees S in
   1994 correspond with low values at WA7 degrees S, and vice versa for
   1993 and 1995. Annual diatom and silicoflagellate fluxes, observed only
   at the oligotrophic site WA7 degrees S, were one order of magnitude
   higher in 1993 than those of 1994 and 1995. Lightly silicified, small
   diatoms of the Nitzschia bicapitata group are the most abundant
   contributors to the diatom flux. Because these organisms are not
   preserved in the sedimentary record, significant discrepancies between
   trapped and preserved assemblages were seen. A substantial enrichment of
   the moderately robust species, representative of the period of low
   diatom export, characterizes the assemblages of the surface sediments.
   Differences in total particle and diatom fluxes between the western and
   eastern basins of the equatorial Atlantic reflect basin to basin
   asymmetry with W-E increase in primary productivity estimates, organic
   carbon fluxes, and silicate content in the subsurface waters, and the
   W-E shallowing of the thermocline depth, Despite flux differences,
   siliceous phytoplankton species composition remained constant along the
   equatorial Atlantic. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study explores the stricter cap on the sulfur content in marine
   fuel implemented in seas in north-western Europe in 2015. The analysis
   is built on a difference-in-differences design that compares outcomes in
   coastal areas before and after the tightening of the sulfur cap, to the
   outcomes in control areas over the same period. The results show that
   the new sulfur cap reduced annual average ambient concentrations of
   sulfur dioxide (SO2) in coastal areas by 22 percent and levels of fine
   particulate matter (PM2.5) by 6 percent, compared to control areas. In
   the subsample with available air quality readings, the sulfur cap led to
   a 7 percent reduction in the risk of low birthweight in coastal areas.
   The estimated improvements provide a benchmark for assessing the
   benefits of tightening sulfur standards in other settings.},

Title = {Disentangling drivers of the abundance of coral reef fishes in the

Abstract = {Aim Understanding the drivers of the structure of coral reef fish
   assemblages is vital for their future conservation. Quantifying the
   separate roles of natural drivers from the increasing influence of
   anthropogenic factors, such as fishing and climate change, is a key
   component of this understanding. It follows that the intrinsic role of
   historical biogeographical and geomorphological factors must be
   accounted for when trying to understand the effects of contemporary
   disturbances such as fishing. Location Comoros, Madagascar, Mozambique
   and Tanzania, Western Indian Ocean (WIO). Methods We modeled patterns in
   the density and biomass of an assemblage of reef-associated fish species
   from 11 families, and their association with 16 biophysical variables.
   Results Canonical analysis of principal coordinates revealed strong
   country affiliations of reef fish assemblages and distance-based linear
   modeling confirmed geographic location and reef geomorphology were the
   most significant correlates, explaining 32\% of the observed variation
   in fish assemblage structure. Another 6\%-8\% of variation was explained
   by productivity gradients (chl\_a), and reef exposure or slope. Where
   spatial effects were not significant between mainland continental
   locations, fishing effects became evident explaining 6\% of the
   variation in data. No correlation with live coral was detected. Only 37
   species, predominantly lower trophic level taxa, were significant in
   explaining differences in assemblages between sites. Main Conclusions
   Spatial and geomorphological histories remain a major influence on the
   structure of reef fish assemblages in the WIO. Reef geomorphology was
   closely linked to standing biomass, with ``ocean-exposed{''} fringing
   reefs supporting high average biomass of 1,000 kg/ha, while
   ``lagoon-exposed fringing{''} reefs and ``inner seas patch complex{''}
   reefs yielded substantially less at 500kg/ha. Further, the results
   indicate the influence of benthic communities on fish assemblages is
   scale dependent. Such insights will be pivotal for managers seeking to
   balance long-term sustainability of artisanal reef fisheries with
   conservation of coral reef systems.},

Abstract = {Desertification and land degradation are common processes in arid and
   semi-arid regions of Kazakhstan, especially southern parts, where areas
   are covered by a great variety of desert types. In deserts, soil-forming
   processes take place in conditions of severe water shortage, and high
   level of soil degradation and desertification. The main natural factors
   for these processes are a flat terrain, a high degree of arid climate,
   soil salinity, carbonate content, a lack of structure and low natural
   soil fertility. However, the anthropogenic factors of desertification
   and soil degradation became dominant last decades.
   The study considers the actual problems of natural and anthropogenic
   factors of desertification and land degradation within Kazakhstan. The
   desertification of huge territories is accompanied by soil
   contamination, waterlogging by surface water and groundwater, soil
   salinization, erosion (water, wind), degradation of vegetation cover,
   dehumidification and a decrease in general regional biological capacity.
   Analysis of the current status of the soil cover has shown intensive
   land degradation 43 \% of the territory of Kazakhstan is subjected to
   degradation in significant degree; over 14 \% of pastures have reached
   an extreme degree of degradation or are completely degradated. The Aral
   Sea region, Northern Caspian Sea and Southern Balkhash deserts can be
   observed as areas of intensive soil desertification, salinization and
   deflation processes. As well as the desertification process are
   progressing in the irrigated soils of the deltas of Syrdarya, Shu, Ile
   and Karatal rivers.},

Abstract = {Collisions with tall anthropogenic structures (power lines, wind
   turbines, communication towers, and buildings) are a regular cause of
   mortality for nocturnal avian migrants. To better understand
   relationships between weather and migrant collision risk, we compared
   nocturnal hourly mean barometric pressure, temperature, relative
   humidity, wind direction, and wind speed to avian passage rates
   (targets/km/h) and flight heights during I year of spring and fall
   migrations near a recently reconstructed transmission line crossing
   Kittatinny Ridge, New Jersey, using 2 marine radars. We {[}build lower
   spring flight heights associated with decreasing barometric pressures,
   temperatures. and relative humidity across all wind directions. Spring
   flight heights showed the strongest decreases with increasing wind
   speeds for headwinds and crosswinds while flight heights slightly
   increased with stronger tailwinds. Spring passage rates increased with
   lower relative humidity and higher temperatures. With increasing wind
   speeds, spring passage rates declined faster with headwinds and
   crosswinds, and only slightly with tailwinds. We found lower fall flight
   heights with decreasing temperatures and relative humidity, but the
   relationships varied by wind direction. The lowest flight heights
   occurred under tailwind and crosswind conditions. Increasing fall
   passage rates were associated with increasing barometric pressures and
   when wind speeds were lowest. Fall passages rates declined with higher
   wind speeds but were more gradual under tailwinds and crosswinds when
   compared to headwinds. Overall, 2-4\% of birds migrated under conditions
   that would have placed them at risk of collision with the transmission
   lines. Similar studies conducted along migratory pathways could he used
   to predict nights where birds exhibit low flight heights around other
   obstacles along their migration path. These predictions could improve
   detection rates for carcass searches documenting relatively rare
   collision events. For sites with topographic features likely to
   concentrate nocturnal migrants, radar studies could be conducted before
   siting towers so that impacts to migratory birds could be avoided at
   these sites.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, managers and local communities have been turning to
   active restoration as a mechanism to recover damaged reefs affected at
   an unprecedented rate because of climate change, anthropogenic
   activities, and natural events, such as outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns
   starfish (COTS) Acanthaster spp. A coral restoration experiment was
   conducted in the southern Gulf of California (24 degrees N, 110 degrees
   W) starting in December 2017. By early 2018, unusually high numbers of
   Acanthaster cf. solaris appeared at the restoration plots causing
   significant coral mortality. Fragment survivorship was significantly
   influenced by site with corals at Roca Swan showing a longer survival
   probability time {[}297.43 (SE 16.38) d] compared to El Corralito
   {[}133.81 (SE 7.73) d]. From April 2018 to June 2019, average abundance
   of A. cf. solaris had surpassed 800 ind ha(-1) at three sites, and their
   feeding resulted in high fragment mortality ranging from 39\% at Roca
   Swan to 88\% at El Corralito-a strong contrast to other restored reefs
   along the eastern Pacific where starfish were absent and annual fragment
   mortality was <15\%. La Paz Bay was the first area in the eastern
   tropical Pacific to suffer an A. cf. solaris outbreak in 2017-2018,
   severely hindering success of coral restoration programs.},

Abstract = {Duplex stainless steels are excellent materials for industrial
   applications and their use has increased in the oil, chemical, petroleum
   (offshore), and electric power industries. Pitting resistance equivalent
   (PRE) is the first parameter used to characterise the pitting and
   crevice corrosion resistance. Nevertheless, there are other aspects to
   be considered, such as the precise values of the PRE in the alpha and
   gamma phases and the selective corrosion processes that may occur at
   grain boundaries. This paper indicates that alpha/gamma and alpha/sigma
   interfaces are preferential sites for the nucleation and growth of pits
   and for consequent selective corrosion, with increasing tendency in the
   ferritic phase. In addition, the selective dissolution potential is more
   reactive (and therefore, is of greater significance) than the pitting
   potential.},

Abstract = {The Three Gorges Project has been subject to intense debates regarding
   its benefits and costs. The environmental impacts of this huge project
   have been an important focus of these debates since the project planning
   stage. After the operation of the Three Gorges Dam at full capacity at
   the end of 2008, new environmental and ecological issues are emerging.
   This paper gives a brief description of the Three Gorges Project and its
   environmental impact assessment process, as well as major efforts to
   control environmental problems brought about by the project. From the
   long and complicated evaluation process, it is clear that there are
   large uncertainties and competing opinions regarding the benefits and
   costs, especially the ecological and environmental ones, of the project
   even after great research effort. Emphasis here is given to the
   environmental challenges including: (1) water quality control; (2) water
   and sediment regulation; (3) biodiversity conservation in the riparian
   and aquatic ecosystems; (4) environmentally friendly dam operation and
   regional sustainable development. Opportunities often grow out of the
   challenges. The Three Gorges Project provides opportunities for
   grand-scale experiments on the environmental, ecological, and
   socio-economic impacts of large dams. Local, national, and international
   concerted efforts and concrete actions should be directed to the
   mitigation and control of the negative impacts as well as securing the
   positive contributions of the project across scales.},

Abstract = {In the literature, an inconsistency exists between estimates of
   biotically-effected carbon export inferred from large-scale geochemical
   studies (Jenkins 1982; 47 gC m(-2) a(-1)) and local measurements of
   turbulent nutrient supply (Lewis et al. 1986; 4 gC m(-2) a(-1)) in the
   eastern subtropical North Atlantic. Nutrient supply to the upper ocean
   by turbulent mixing is reexamined using local standard oceanographic
   measurements and high-resolution vertical profiles of nutrients averaged
   over a large region directly comparable to that investigated by Jenkins
   (1982).
   Turbulent fluxes induced by internal waves and salt fingering,
   respectively, are separated according to Gregg (1989) and Zhang et al.
   (1998). Nutrient transport into the nutrient-consuming surface layer by
   salt fingering is more than fivefold higher than transport due to
   internal-wave induced turbulence. Still, this cannot resolve the
   above-mentioned apparent inconsistency, even if additional physical
   transport mechanisms such as eddy pumping, advection and horizontal
   diffusion are accounted for. Estimated nitrate fluxes due to vertical
   turbulent diffusion are 0.05-0.15 mol m(-2) a(-1), corresponding to 4-11
   gC m(-2) a(-1). Observed NO3/PO4 turbulent flux ratios of up to 23 are
   interpreted as the imprint of N-2 fixation.},

Title = {Consideration of species community composition in statistical analyses

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {431},
Pages = {83-96},
Abstract = {Diseases are increasing in marine ecosystems, and these increases have
   been attributed to a number of environmental factors including climate
   change, pollution, and overfishing. However, many studies pool disease
   prevalence into taxonomic groups, disregarding host-species composition
   when comparing sites or assessing environmental impacts on patterns of
   disease presence. We used simulated data under a known environmental
   effect to assess the ability of standard statistical methods (binomial
   and linear regression, ANOVA) to detect a significant environmental
   effect on pooled disease prevalence with varying species abundance
   distributions and relative susceptibilities to disease. When one species
   was more susceptible to a disease and both species only partially
   overlapped in their distributions, models tended to produce a greater
   number of false positives (Type I error). Differences in disease risk
   between regions or along an environmental gradient tended to be
   underestimated, or, even in the wrong direction, when highly susceptible
   taxa had reduced abundances in impacted sites, a situation likely to be
   common in nature. Including relative abundance as an additional variable
   in regressions improved model accuracy, but tended to be conservative,
   producing more false negatives (Type II error) when species abundance
   was strongly correlated with the environmental effect. An analysis of
   field data on bleaching from the Florida Keys, FL, USA, affirmed general
   results of model simulations. Investigators should be cautious of
   underlying assumptions about species similarity in susceptibility and
   species composition when interpreting pooled data on disease risk.},

Title = {Island detection methods and grid current control methods in SPV-based
   energy systems},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMBIENT ENERGY},
Abstract = {Nowadays, greater penetration of distributed power generation sources
   (DPGSs), which includes both conventional and renewable energy sources,
   is taking place, with clear evolution of active grids, i.e. with energy
   storage systems, there is a possibility to work in an island mode and
   can be linked to a flexible transmission system, but due to this
   complexity, the requirements depend on the size and the level of
   integration. Monitoring of grid is a crucial part, and detection of
   possible islanding is very important, and in the case of low-power DPGSs
   like photovoltaic (PV) sources, it is termed as anti-islanding
   requirement and islanding detection is required in such cases. In
   future, smart micro grid (SMG) is the scenario i.e. capable of switching
   automatically to stand-alone operation during grid faults and
   reconnecting to the grid immediately after the fault is cleared. For
   this to happen, detection of islanding is important since it is not
   possible to predict the level of connection and information exchange
   reliability. Islanding detection is attained with attention towards
   amplitude and frequency variation of the grid voltages, and the
   performance of islanding detection relies on reliability, selectivity
   and minimum perturbation with reference to effects on grid voltage
   amplitude, and the frequency of the non-detection zone (NDZ) is defined.},

Abstract = {Producing hydrogen by water electrolysis is a promising technology in
   the field of energy conversion. Considering the low reserves of the pure
   water, hydrogen from seawater electrolysis has more value in practical
   application. At present, the development of high-efficient and stable
   hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
   electrocatalysts is the top priority for seawater splitting. Herein, the
   electrochemical reactions mechanism involved in seawater splitting are
   systematically summarized. In addition, we sum up the current strategies
   for preparing highly active and stable electrocatalysts for seawater
   splitting from the aspects of morphological and structural engineering,
   heterostructure component modulation, and heteroatom doping. Besides the
   above discussed content, perspective and challenges of designing

Abstract = {The new research reported in this special issue of Fisheries
   Oceanography expands our understanding of the Aleutian Archipelago
   ecosystem. Yet our knowledge remains very limited, while the use of this
   ecosystem for commercial activities, recreation and other purposes
   expands. Given this situation, how can we sustain the ecosystem services
   (food, fuel, fibers as well as spiritual, recreational, educational and
   other non-material benefits to society) of this region? The region has a
   mixed history; healthy populations of many species exist, but so do
   species extinctions (e.g. Steller sea cow, Hydrodamalis gigas) and
   population depletions, including the sea otter (Enhydra lutris), Steller
   sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), whiskered auklets (Aethia pygmaea),
   Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), and red king crabs (Paralithodes
   camtschaticus), associated with human impacts. The solution to our
   limited knowledge in this poorly studied region is increased funding for
   ecosystem research, including its responses to climate change and human
   impacts. Knowledge is not sufficient, however; a change in management
   approach is also needed. We emphasize the need to maintain a broader set
   of ecosystem services objectives rather than the traditional narrower
   focus on commercial fishery yields. To do so, we recommend the
   development of an integrated ecosystem services management plan for the
   Aleutian Islands. Such a plan requires that state and federal regulatory
   agencies coordinate with a broad stakeholder community involving sectors
   of commercial and recreational fishing, subsistence, conservation, oil
   and gas development, coastal development, shipping, tourism, and others.},

Title = {Population genetic structure of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus)
   in the Irish Sea and implications for the effectiveness of the first
   British marine protected area},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {183},
Pages = {287-293},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Levels of self-recruitment within and connectivity among populations are
   key factors influencing marine population persistence and stock
   sustainability, as well as the effectiveness of spatially explicit
   management strategies such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In the
   United Kingdom (UK), Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel was designated
   a No-Take Zone (NTZ) in 2003 and became the UK's first Marine
   Conservation Zone (MCZ) in 2009. This NTZ is expected to represent an
   additional resource for the sustainable management of the European
   lobster (Homarus gammarus) fishery. As the first step in a genetic
   monitoring program, this study aimed to investigate population genetic
   structure of lobster within and between the Irish Sea and Bristol
   Channel and in doing so to assess the functioning of the Lundy NTZ in
   the context of connectivity and other genetic parameters. Analysis of
   microsatellite data indicated that lobsters within the study area are
   genetically homogeneous and supports the view of a single panmictic
   population wherein the Lundy NTZ is highly connected. Levels of genetic
   variability were universally high with no evidence of differences for
   the NTZ. Furthermore, there was no evidence of recent genetic
   bottlenecks, and estimates of effective population sizes were infinitely
   large. The results suggest that if current management and breeding stock
   sizes are maintained genetic drift will not be strong enough to reduce
   neutral genetic diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Structural controls, temperature-pressure conditions and fluid evolution
   of orogenic gold mineralisation at the Betam mine, south Eastern Desert,
   Egypt},
Journal = {MINERALIUM DEPOSITA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Betam gold deposit, located in the southern Eastern Desert of Egypt,
   is related to a series of milky quartz veins along a NNW-trending shear
   zone, cutting through pelitic metasedimentary rocks and small masses of
   pink granite. This shear zone, along with a system of discrete shear and
   fault zones, was developed late in the deformation history of the area.
   Although slightly sheared and boudinaged within the shear zone, the
   auriferous quartz veins are characterised by irregular walls with a
   steeply plunging ridge-in-groove lineation. Shear geometry of rootless
   intra-folial folds and asymmetrical strain shadows around the quartz
   lenses suggests that vein emplacement took place under a brittle-ductile
   shear regime, clearly post-dating the amphibolite-facies regional
   metamorphism. Hydrothermal alteration is pervasive in the wallrock
   metapelites and granite including sericitisation, silicification,
   sulphidisation and minor carbonatisation. Ore mineralogy includes
   pyrite, arsenopyrite and subordinate galena, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite
   and gold. Gold occurs in the quartz veins and adjacent wallrocks as
   inclusions in pyrite and arsenopyrite, blebs and globules associated
   with galena, fracture fillings in deformed arsenopyrite or as thin,
   wire-like rims within or around rhythmic goethite. Presence of
   refractory gold in arsenopyrite and pyrite is inferred from microprobe
   analyses. Clustered and intra-granular trail-bound aqueous-carbonic
   (L-CO2+L-aq +/- V-CO2) inclusions are common in cores of the less
   deformed quartz crystals, whereas carbonic (L-CO2 +/- V-CO2) and aqueous
   H2O-NaCl (L+V) inclusions occur along inter-granular and trans-granular
   trails. Clathrate melting temperatures indicate low salinities of the
   fluid (3-8 wt.\% NaCl eq.). Homogenisation temperatures of the
   aqueous-carbonic inclusions range between 297 and 323 degrees C,
   slightly higher than those of the intra-granular and inter-granular
   aqueous inclusions (263-304 degrees C), which are likely formed during
   grain boundary migration. Homogenisation temperatures of the
   trans-granular H2O-NaCl inclusions are much lower (130-221 degrees C),
   implying different fluids late in the shear zone formation. Fluid
   densities calculated from aqueous-carbonic inclusions along a single
   trail are between 0.88 and 0.98 g/cm(3), and the resulting isochores
   suggest trapping pressures of 2-2.6 kbar. Based on the
   arsenopyrite-pyrite-pyrrhotite cotectic, arsenopyrite (30.4-30.7 wt.\%
   As) associated with gold inclusions indicates a temperature range of
   325-344 degrees C. This ore paragenesis constrains f(S2) to the range of
   10(-10) to 10(-8.5) bar. Under such conditions, gold was likely
   transported mainly as bisulphide complexes by low salinity
   aqueous-carbonic fluids and precipitated because of variations in pH and
   f(O2) through pressure fluctuation and CO2 effervescence as the ore
   fluids infiltrated the shear zone, along with precipitation of carbonate
   and sericite. Wallrock sulphidation also likely contributed to
   destabilising the gold-bisulphide complexes and precipitating gold in
   the hydrothermal alteration zone adjacent to the mineralised quartz
   veins.},

Title = {Extreme spatial heterogeneity in carbonate accretion potential on a
   Caribbean fringing reef linked to local human disturbance gradients},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {12},
Pages = {4092-4104},

Abstract = {The capacity of coral reefs to maintain their structurally complex
   frameworks and to retain the potential for vertical accretion is vitally
   important to the persistence of their ecological functioning and the
   ecosystem services they sustain. However, datasets to support detailed
   along-coast assessments of framework production rates and accretion
   potential do not presently exist. Here, we estimate, based on gross
   bioaccretion and bioerosion measures, the carbonate budgets and
   resultant estimated accretion rates (EAR) of the shallow reef zone of
   leeward Bonaire - between 5 and 12 m depth - at unique fine spatial
   resolution along this coast (115 sites). Whilst the fringing reef of
   Bonaire is often reported to be in a better ecological condition than
   most sites throughout the wider Caribbean region, our data show that the
   carbonate budgets of the reefs and derived EAR varied considerably
   across this 58 km long fringing reef complex. Some areas, in particular
   the marine reserves, were indeed still dominated by structurally complex
   coral communities with high net carbonate production (>10 kg CaCO3 m(-2)
   year(-1)), high live coral cover and complex structural topography. The
   majority of the studied sites, however, were defined by relatively low
   budget states (<2 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1)) or were in a state of net
   erosion. These data highlight the marked spatial heterogeneity that can
   occur in budget states, and thus in reef accretion potential, even
   between quite closely spaced areas of individual reef complexes. This
   heterogeneity is linked strongly to the degree of localized land-based
   impacts along the coast, and resultant differences in the abundance of
   reef framework building coral species. The major impact of this
   variability is that those sections of reef defined by low-accretion
   rates will have limited capacity to maintain their structural integrity
   and to keep pace with current projections of climate change induced
   sea-level rise (SLR), thus posing a threat to reef functioning and
   biodiversity, potentially leading to trophic cascades. Since many
   Caribbean reefs are more severely degraded than those found around
   Bonaire, it is to be expected that the findings presented here are
   rather the rule than the exception, but the study also highlights the
   need for similar high spatial resolution (along-coast) assessments of
   budget states and accretion rates to meaningfully explore increasing
   coastal risk at the country level. The findings also more generally
   underline the significance of reducing local anthropogenic disturbance
   and restoring framework building coral assemblages. Appropriately
   focussed local preservation efforts may aid in averting future
   large-scale above reef water depth increases on Caribbean coral reefs
   and will limit the social and economic implications associated with the
   loss of reef goods and services.},

Abstract = {Climate change is having a myriad of effects on Arctic ecosystems, yet
   understanding how these changes will influence the spatiotemporal
   dynamics of harvest in northern commercial fisheries remains unclear.
   Furthermore, stock mixing continues to complicate fisheries management
   in Arctic Canada, especially for anadromous stocks, but data on the
   extent and degree of stock mixing for the majority of northern fisheries
   are scarce. Here, we used a multiyear (2015-2019) acoustic telemetry
   data set to test the utility of acoustic telemetry as a potential tool
   for inferring stock mixing in the Arctic Char Salvelinus alpinus
   commercial fishery in Cambridge Bay (Nunavut). We also assessed the
   effect of annual variation in environmental variables (river breakup and
   marine ice conditions) on the potential contribution of discrete stocks
   to commercial harvest at several fisheries. We found that stock mixing
   during the commercial harvest is common in both marine and freshwater
   fisheries during the summer/open-water season, with virtually all stocks
   potentially being susceptible to harvest at any given commercial
   fishery. Additionally, in some fisheries, the vulnerability of different
   stocks to harvest was influenced by annual differences in marine ice and
   river breakup conditions. We discuss options for fisheries management,
   including a potential quota-transfer system, and highlight how changing
   environmental and climatic conditions may have an effect on the
   commercial harvest of Arctic Char in the region. Overall, the results of
   this study demonstrate the utility of acoustic telemetry for informing
   mixed-stock fisheries while highlighting the complex and pervasive
   nature of stock mixing in Canada's largest Arctic Char commercial
   fishery.},

Abstract = {Utilizing solar energy to evaporate seawater or sewage to improve water
   quality is an environment-friendly and sustainable water treatment
   technology, which has been widely concerned. However, there are still
   many challenges for efficient solar vapor generation, such as incapable
   free floating, low water-transfer rates, low energy efficiency, serious
   salt precipitation, and short service life. Herein, photothermal
   conversion nanofibrous aerogels (PTCNFAs) with vertically aligned
   microchannels inside are fabricated. Because of the orderly framework
   structure and the good hydrophilicity, the PTCNFAs show excellent
   underwater compressive fatigue durability (nearly no plastic deformation
   after 50 compressive cycles) and water-transfer rate (0.5 cm s(-1) in
   the first second). Furthermore, the surface temperature of the PTCNFAs
   could rise from 28 to 94 degrees C in air, after being irradiated for 30
   s by 1 sun. Benefiting from the excellent mechanical properties, high
   water-transfer rates, and outstanding photothermal properties, the
   PTCNFAs are more convenient in application and exhibit an efficient
   solar water evaporation rate (2.89 kg m(-2) h(-1)), while the energy
   efficiency under 1 sun is about 90.3\%. This work provides a new
   approach to design and fabricate the solar steam generation materials
   for water treatment.},

Abstract = {People's values and attitudes regarding the natural world determine the
   level of care with which they approach the use of natural resources. We
   studied how human relationships with nature influence people's actions,
   using western redcedar (Thuja plicata), a major forest tree of
   northwestern North America, as a study system. Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with eleven Northwest Coast Indigenous plant
   experts and eleven ecologists and foresters of mixed European descent
   with an ecologically-oriented perspective in coastal British Columbia.
   The transcripts were analyzed using NVivo qualitative data analysis
   software for emerging themes. Results demonstrate more commonalities
   than differences between the two groups; they both expressed a
   personal-often spiritual-connection with nature and both value long-term
   and interdisciplinary management strategies. First Nation individuals
   have a unique spiritual relationship with western redcedar that is
   linked to both everyday and ceremonial practices, while
   ecologically-based foresters and ecologists have personal and academic
   relationships broadly with nature. They have similar environmental
   concerns of damage from industrial forestry practices, particularly the
   loss of old growth forests, and the negative effects of climate change.
   Our results support the assertion that First Nation perspectives are
   equally scholarly as the foresters' perspectives are reverential, and
   people from varied cultural backgrounds can care for the environment in
   similar ways. Moreover, an interdisciplinary approach that unifies
   science with Indigenous teachings can encourage a new moral framework
   for forestry management that values resources beyond commodification.},

Abstract = {The distribution of inorganic carbon and the CO2 exchange between
   atmosphere and water along the Guadalquivir Estuary (SW Iberian
   Peninsula) have been evaluated, on the basis of field observation
   performed from 2000 to 2003. The study consisted of the measurement of
   Total Alkalinity (TAlk), pH, continuous underway CO2 partial pressure
   (pCO(2)), dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll. The Guadalquivir river water
   is rich in TAlk and DIC and its behaviour is mainly conservative along
   the salinity gradient. Estuarine waters were CO2 oversaturated in all
   the samplings in space and time. It has been suggested some
   biogeochemical processes affecting the water pCO(2) such as the CO2 flux
   to the atmosphere, aerobic respiration of organic matter, and carbonate
   dissolution. The average CO2 flux to the atmosphere is 85.2 mmol m(-2)
   d(-1) and the total CO2 emission to the atmosphere is 3.2 mol C 106
   d(-1). Ventilation of riverine CO2 can contribute to the emission of CO2
   from inner estuaries although this factor seems highly variable among
   European estuaries. It has been estimated that, in the Guadalquivir
   Estuary, 34\% of the total inorganic carbon exported is emitted to the
   atmosphere. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We studied conservation paradigms of small-scale artisanal fishers and
   other actors involved in the conservation of the Bahia Blanca Estuary
   (BBE)-a Southwestern Atlantic estuary under anthropogenic pressures
   (conservationists, NGOs, individuals in the private sector and the port
   consortium). We focused on the relationship between fishers and
   non-human entities (e.g., animals, tides, lunar cycles, etc.) from
   alternative conservation paradigms according to Palsson's schema
   (orientalism, paternalism, communalism). We also explored the ecological
   knowledge of fisher communities to identify possible conservation
   strategies. Using an ethnographic approach, we identified communalism as
   the dominant paradigm within the fisher communities as opposed to the
   paternalistic and orientalist approaches of conservationists and
   industry employees in the BBE. Fishers demonstrated a broad knowledge on
   the effects of climate change on fish stocks and pollution on ocean
   environments and biota, which gillnets avoid catching juveniles and
   threatened species, and landscape changes over the long-term period,
   among others areas that could be useful for conservation of these
   changing coastal ecosystems. We conclude that understanding local
   perspectives and practices is essential for a democratic exchange among
   different bodies of knowledge to conserve marine ecosystems.},

Title = {Evaluation of Gas Hydrate Formation Temperature for

Abstract = {Naturally occurring gas hydrates are of great importance as a strategic
   energy source. Hydrates affect coastal sediment stability, global
   climate change, and ocean carbon cycling. It is vital to understand the
   thermodynamic conditions of gas hydrates to control/manage and inhibit
   hydrate formation. A variety of equations of state (EOSs) have been
   utilized to model the thermodynamic behaviors of gas hydrates. In this
   study, the perturbed chain statistical association fluid theory
   (PC-SAFT) equation of state combined with van der Waals and Platteuw
   model is employed to determine the clathrate hydrate formation
   temperature of pure gases (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, isobutane,
   carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide) and binary and ternary systems of
   hydrate gases. In addition, the gas hydrate formation conditions are
   investigated where methanol, ethanol, glycerol, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and
   MgCl2 as inhibitors are present. The UNIQUAC model is utilized in this
   work to obtain the hydrate formation conditions in systems with
   inhibitors. The interaction parameters between water, alcohols, salts,
   and gases are considered in the thermodynamic modeling. The long-range
   interaction contribution term is also incorporated in the model to
   determine the hydrate formation temperature in the presence of salts and
   alcohols. To achieve more accurate results, the association contribution
   is taken into account to calculate the residual Helmholtz energy. It is
   found that the PC-SAFT equation of state is able to predict the hydrate
   formation conditions with high precision. The comparison between the
   calculated and experimental data reveals that the average absolute error
   in this study is generally lower lower than that in the earlier works.
   The modeling strategy employed in this research study can be applicable
   to forecast the thermodynamic behaviors of natural or synthetic gas
   hydrates within a broad range of process conditions.},

Abstract = {Interactions between phytoplankton species shape their physiological and
   evolutionary responses. Yet, studies addressing the evolutionary
   responses of phytoplankton in changing environments often lack an
   explicit element of biotic interactions. Here, we ask (1) how the
   presence of a locally adapted phytoplankton species will affect an
   invading phytoplankton species' evolutionary response to a
   physiologically challenging environment; (2) whether this response is
   conserved across environments varying in quality; and (3) which traits
   are associated with being a successful invader under climate change
   scenarios. In a conceptual first step to disentangle these broad
   questions, we experimentally evolved populations of fresh- and seawater
   phytoplankton in a novel salinity (the freshwater green algae
   Chlamydomonas in salt water, and the marine Ostreococcus in freshwater),
   either as mono-cultures (colonizers) or as co-cultures (invaders:
   invading a novel salinity occupied by a resident species, for example,
   Chlamydomonas invading salt water occupied by resident Ostreococcus) for
   200 generations. We superimposed a temperature treatment (control (22
   degrees C), mild warming (26 degrees C), drastic warming (32 degrees C),
   and fluctuating (22 degrees C/32 degrees C) warming) as a representative
   aspect of climate change with the potential to ameliorate or deteriorate
   existing environmental conditions. Invaders had systematically lower
   extinction rates and evolved overall higher growth rates, as well as
   broader salinity and temperature preferences than colonizers. The
   invading species' evolutionary responses differed from those of
   colonizers in a replicable way across environments of differing quality.
   The evolution of small cell size and high reactive oxygen species
   tolerance may explain the invaders' higher fitness under the scenarios
   tested here.},

Abstract = {The interaction of large-scale oceanic flows with remote island chains
   can lead to turbulent wakes, enhanced vorticity production, and
   significant increases in biological productivity. This study showcases
   the range of flow conditions captured by surface current mapping
   high-frequency (HF) radar systems deployed around the main island group
   of Palau in the western Pacific. The radar array captures strong tidal
   and inertial flows, both near- and offshore, as well as the spatial and
   temporal variability associated with the synoptic geostrophic flow
   interacting with the island group. Surface currents measured by HF radar
   are significantly correlated to currents in the upper 100 m of the ocean
   water column, as observed with a concurrent mooring, such that the
   resulting surface spatial maps provide insight on the wake flows of the
   island across a significant portion of the upper ocean. Composite
   averages of eastward and westward incident flow show flow-splitting and
   reconnection 60 km upstream and downstream of the island group,
   respectively. Surface current variability observed by the radar array
   includes topographically blocked flow, flow separation and acceleration
   through passages in the island chain, eddy dipole structure, and coastal
   eddies with Rossby numbers of 5. The range of variability near the
   island chain is reflective of the complex incident flow, which
   encounters Palau from all directions and changes on timescales of hours
   to weeks. A high-resolution model qualitatively agrees with the HF radar
   observations and shows vorticity filaments generated downstream of the
   island passages.},

Title = {Carbon and oxygen isotopic composition and foraminifers of condensed

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {The basinal facies of the Lopingian Zechstein Limestone in SW Poland
   consists of thin (often less than 1m thick) limestones and/or dolomites,
   often containing the Kupferschiefer (few tens of centimetres thick) at
   their base, and local thick (up to 90m) reefal carbonates. The C-13
   curve of these basal Zechstein deposits strongly suggests that even when
   the Kupferschiefer is lacking, the thin (condensed) sequences record the
   entire interval of the Zechstein prior to the onset of evaporite
   deposition, in contrast to the thick reef sequences which lack the
   characteristic C-13 curve for the lowermost part of the Zechstein. The
   calcite samples show considerable ranges of O-18 values. If the maximum
   O-18 values are considered to be the closest to the pristine original
   ones and if O-18(water) value=0 is assumed, then the calculated range of
   palaeotemperatures for the Kupferschiefer and Zechstein Limestone
   calcite ranges from 19 to 34 degrees C. The faunal restriction, common
   dwarf foraminifers and the predominance of lagenids in the foraminiferal
   assemblage indicate continual dysaerobic conditions and possibly
   elevated salinity of seawater during deposition of thin basinal
   Zechstein Limestone deposits. The mixing of shallow and deeper waters in
   the stratified Zechstein Basin caused by upwelling could result in
   prolific carbonate precipitation in reefs located at the slope of the
   marginal carbonate platform of the Zechstein Limestone and in isolated
   reefs related to palaeohighs within the basin; however, there is no
   isotopic record of eventual upwelling. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Title = {Differential thermal tolerance and energetic trajectories during
   ontogeny in porcelain crabs, genus Petrolisthes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {79-85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Thermal tolerance limits of marine intertidal zone organisms are
   elevated compared to subtidal species, but are typically just slightly
   higher than maximal habitat temperatures. The small thermal safety
   margins maintained by intertidal zone organisms suggest that high
   thermal tolerance is associated with a physiological cost. If true, we
   hypothesize that species that transition between intertidal zone and
   planktonic habitats during ontogeny, will adjust their thermal tolerance
   accordingly to capitalize upon potential energy savings while in a
   thermally benign habitat. We tested this hypothesis in porcelain crabs
   that transition between the thermally stressful, intertidal zone as
   embryos, to the thermally benign pelagic zone as larvae, and back at
   settlement. We found the more thermally tolerant, mid-intertidal zone
   species, Petrolisthes cinctipes, and the less thermally tolerant,
   subtidal zone species, Petrolisthes manimacilis, exhibited reduced
   thermal tolerance (LT50) in the transition from embryos to larvae. This
   was associated with an increased oxygen consumption rate in both
   species, though P. cinctipes exhibited a significantly greater increase
   in oxygen consumption. P. cinctipes also showed an increase in thermal
   tolerance in settled juveniles compared to pelagic zoea I larvae,
   resulting in an overall V-shaped thermal tolerance relationship during
   ontogeny, while in P. manimaculis thermal tolerance was significantly
   lower in juveniles compared to zoea I. In neither species were these
   changes (zoea I to juvenile) associated with a significant change in
   metabolism. While embryos and juveniles of P. cinctipes have thermal
   tolerance limits near intertidal habitat thermal maxima (similar to 32.5
   degrees C), all three life-history stages in P. manimaculis (especially
   embryos and larvae) exhibit considerable thermal safety margins. The
   mechanisms underlying this ``excess{''} thermal tolerance in P.
   manimacilis embryos are unknown, but suggest that patterns of thermal
   tolerance in early life history stages are species-specific. (c) 2012

Title = {Influence of Acacia mangium on Soil Fertility and Bacterial Community in
   Eucalyptus Plantations in the Congolese Coastal Plains},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Productivity and sustainability of tropical forest plantations greatly
   rely on regulation of ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling, i.e.,
   the link between plant growth, nutrient availability, and the microbial
   community structure. So far, these interactions have never been
   evaluated in the Acacia and Eucalyptus forest planted on infertile soils
   in the Congolese coastal plains. In the present work, the soil bacterial
   community has been investigated by metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA
   bacterial gene in different stands of monoculture and mixed-species
   plantation to evaluate the potential of nitrogen-fixing trees on
   nutrient and bacterial structure. At the phylum level, the soil
   bacterial community was dominated by Actinobacteria, followed by
   Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Acidobacteria. A principal coordinate
   analysis revealed that bacterial communities from pure Eucalyptus,
   compared to those from plantations containing Acacia in pure and
   mixed-species stands, showed different community composition
   (beta-diversity). Regardless of the large variability of the studied
   soils, the prevalence of Firmicutes phylum, and lower bacterial richness
   and phylogenic diversity were reported in stands containing Acacia
   relative to the pure Eucalyptus. Distance-based redundancy analysis
   revealed a positive correlation of available phosphorus (P) and
   carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio with bacterial community structure. However,
   the Spearman correlation test revealed a broad correlation between the
   relative abundance of bacterial taxa and soil attributes, in particular
   with sulfur (S) and carbon (C), suggesting the important role of soil
   bacterial community in nutrient cycling in this type of forest
   management. Concerning mixed plantations, a shift in bacterial community
   structure was observed, probably linked to other changes, i.e.,
   improvement in soil fertility (enhanced P and C dynamics in forest floor
   and soil, and increase in soil N status), and C sequestration in both

   attributes, especially C, S, available P, and C/N ratio at a lesser
   extent, in driving the soil bacterial community in mixed-species
   plantations and its potential to improve soil fertility and to sustain
   Eucalyptus plantations established on the infertile and sandy soils of

Abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles, and in particular autonomous underwater
   gliders, represent a rapidly maturing technology with a large
   cost-saving potential over current ocean sampling technologies for
   sustained (month at a time) real-time measurements.
   In this paper we give an overview of the main building blocks of an
   underwater glider system for propulsion, control, communication and
   sensing. A typical glider operation, consisting of deployment, planning,
   monitoring and recovery will be described using the 2003 AOSN-II field
   experiment in Monterey Bay, California.
   We briefly describe recent developments at NRC-IOT, in particular the
   development of a laboratory-scale glider for dynamics and control
   research and the concept of a regional ocean observation system using
   underwater gliders.},

Abstract = {Phytoplankton mortality (herbivory) and bacterivory were examined
   experimentally in West Neck Bay and Coecles Harbor, Long Island, NY,
   from April through September 1998. Small algae (<5 <mu>m diameter)
   dominated phytoplankton communities in both ecosystems throughout much
   of the summer, and most microzooplankton (<200 <mu>m) were also small
   (<40 <mu>m) for that category, Generally, plankton abundances were
   indicative of eutrophic ecosystems, Oscillations in standing stocks and
   mortality of prey indicated tight coupling of growth and grazing
   mortality in both bays. Phytoplankton mortality rates accounted for the
   removal of 14 to 65\% of total phytoplankton standing stocks daily,
   while bacterivory accounted for the removal of 14 to 88\% of total
   bacterial standing stocks daily. Carbon consumption was estimated from
   phytoplankton and bacterial removal rates and from conversion to carbon
   from chlorophyll (phytoplankton) or cell number (bacteria). These
   calculations indicated that carbon consumption due to bacterivory
   constituted an average of 21 and 47\% of carbon consumption due to
   herbivory in West Neck Bay and Coecles Harbor, respectively. Total
   carbon consumption (bacterivory + herbivory) revealed high energy flux
   through the nano- and microzooplankton assemblages of these estuarine
   environments.},

Abstract = {Cold and snowy spells are compound extreme events with the potential to
   cause high socioeconomic impacts. Gaining insight into their dynamics in
   climate change scenarios could help anticipating the need for adaptation
   efforts. We focus on winter cold and snowy spells over Italy,
   reconstructing 32 major events in the past 60 years from documentary
   sources. Despite warmer winter temperatures, very recent cold spells
   have been associated with abundant and sometimes exceptional snowfall.
   Our goal is to analyse the dynamical weather patterns associated with
   these events and understand whether those patterns would be more or less
   recurrent in different emission scenarios using an
   intermediate-complexity model (the Planet Simulator, PlaSim). Our
   results, obtained by considering RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5
   end-of-century equivalent CO2 concentrations, suggest that the
   likelihood of synoptic configurations analogous to those leading to
   extreme cold spells would grow substantially under increased emissions.},

Title = {Stochastic inversion of InSAR data to assess the probability of pressure

Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {We carried out stochastic inversions of InSAR data to assess the
   probability that pressure perturbations resulting from CO2 injection
   into well KB-502 at In Salah penetrated into the lower caprock seal
   above the reservoir. We employed inversions of synthetic data to
   evaluate the factors that affect the vertical resolution of overpressure
   distributions, and to assess the impact of various sources of
   uncertainty in prior constraints on inverse solutions. These include
   alternative pressure-driven deformation modes within reservoir and
   caprock, the geometry of a sub-vertical fracture zone in the caprock
   identified in previous studies, and imperfect estimates of the rock
   mechanical properties. Inversions of field data indicate that there is a
   high probability that a pressure perturbation during the first phase of
   injection extended upwards along the fracture zone 150 m above the
   reservoir, and less than 50\% probability that it reached the Hot Shale
   unit at 1500 m depth. Within the uncertainty bounds considered, we
   conclude that it is very unlikely that the pressure perturbation
   approached within 150 m of the top of the lower caprock at the Hercynian
   Unconformity. The results are consistent with previous deterministic
   inversion and forward modeling studies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published

Title = {Regenerated primary production dominates in a periodically upwelling
   shelf ecosystem, northeast New Zealand},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {1-21},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {We present the first field measured primary production values for an
   intermittently upwelling shelf ecosystem in the Hauraki Gulf, northeast
   New Zealand. Phytoplankton uptake rates of C-13 and N-15 were used to
   determine the relative importance of new ((NO3-)-N-15) versus
   regenerated nutrients ((NH4+)-N-15 and N-15-urea) to productivity, and
   to test the hypothesis that the upwelling system supports high export of
   organic material, acting as a net sink for CO2. From early spring to
   early summer (1996-1997), deep NO3--rich waters upwelled onto the shelf
   and into the inner gulf, producing a short-lived low-level predominantly
   NO3--fuelled bloom (surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) > 1.0 mg m(-3)) in
   early spring. From late spring onwards, mixed layer NO3- concentrations
   were depleted to often lower levels than NH4+ and urea (similar to 0.1
   mmol m(-3)), with mid-water chl-a maxima associated with the top of the
   nitracline fuelled predominantly by regenerated nutrients. By late
   summer, upwelling had ceased, with intrusions of low-nutrient
   subtropical oceanic surface water producing oligotrophic conditions.
   NH4+ and urea uptake nearly always exceeded NO3- uptake throughout the
   euphotic zone, even within the nitracline, with relative preference
   index (RPI) estimates giving RPIUrea > RPINH4+ > RPINO3-, and low uptake
   f ratios (generally f<0.3), supporting the physiological preference of
   phytoplankton for reduced forms of nitrogen. Despite periods of
   upwelling producing relatively high levels of integrated NO3- (typically
   25-150 mmol NO3- m(-2)) across the shelf from early spring to early
   summer, the highest integrated total production (1266 mg C m(-2)d(-1))
   and specific uptake rates of C/chl-a were obtained in late summer. In
   the inner gulf and on the mid-shelf, these higher late summer production
   rates coincided with low integrated chl-a biomass and NO3- inventories.
   There was no correlation of chl-a with C uptake in either surface waters
   (r(2)=0.0115), or in the euphotic zone (r(2)=0.0232) for the compiled
   data set, raising potential issues of using chl-a data in this region
   for modelling primary production. Caveats and problems associated with
   using the new production paradigm, f ratios and e ratios to calculate
   carbon export from highly dynamic coastal systems are discussed.
   Contrary to our hypothesis of NO3--fuelled production in this upwelling
   system through the spring-to-summer transition, we found relatively high
   primary production levels were supported by regenerated nutrients most
   likely derived from the breakdown of NO3- sourced in the nitracline. The
   resulting pattern of persistent low nutrient uptake f ratios (f <0.3),
   punctuated only by a brief episode of new production in early spring
   (f=0.53, outer shelf), resulted in new production accounting for 10-20\%
   of total inorganic nitrogen production, producing low organic material
   export. In situ oxidation was the primary fate of carbon on the
   northeast New Zealand continental shelf, where 80-90\% of the carbon
   fixed by phytoplankton was remineralised in the euphotic zone. (C) 2011

   vicariance. Our main finding is that the size and shape evolution of
   both investigated species is strongly influenced by temperature, despite
   their different ecology. The surface dweller Trilobatus sacculifer
   conserved the same shape on both sides of the Isthmus for most of the
   studied interval, and diverged only recently when the environment
   diverged on both sides of the Isthmus. The shape response is a
   combination of a change in mean shape and in percentage of morphotypes
   occurring within T. sacculifer. This suggests a minor role of vicariance
   and the potential to react to changes in the local environment through
   ecotypic or plastic variation. This interpretation is corroborated by
   extensive phenotypic variability in the absence of genetic
   differentiation today in this species. The shape of the deeper-living
   species Gt. tumida, in contrast, diverged on both sides of the Isthmus
   at a time that coincides with the cut-off of the connection of its
   habitat. This divergence combines a response to temperature and to
   location, suggesting local adaptation in response to vicariance. These
   different reactions highlight both a high potential for adaptation, but
   also sensitivity to temperature variations. The species-specific
   responses to environmental pressures indicate the difficulty in
   upscaling from one species to foraminifers in general. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   RSB, weighing 107 g on an initial mean body weight, were given a

   The RF1 steadily grew but showed lower final mean body weight, feed
   efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, apparent protein retention and
   final gastral and enteral organ-somatic indices than the RSB. The RF1,
   on the other hand, had higher apparent lipid retention, hepatosomatic
   index, lipid contents of abdominal cavity, carcass and hepatopancreas,
   and enzyme activities of hepatic aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
   aminotransferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and
   fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase on the final day of the rearing period. No
   significant differences between RF1 and RSB were found in final
   hematocrit value, hemoglobin content, plasma total protein level, and
   blood glucose. These results indicated that RF1 was characterized by
   slightly lower growth performance than RSB, due to small digestive

Abstract = {Melanoidins, condensation products formed from protein and
   polysaccharide precursors, were once thought to be an important
   geological sink for organic carbon. The active microbial recycling of
   the precursors, coupled with an inability to demonstrate the formation
   of covalent linkages between amino acids and sugars in melanoidins, has
   shaped a powerful argument against this view. Yet, melanoidins may still
   be an abundant source of macromolecules in fossil biominerals such as
   shells, in which the proteins and polysaccharides are well protected
   from microbial degradation. We have modelled diagenetic changes in a
   biomineral by heating at 90-degrees-C mixtures of protein,
   polysaccharides, and finely ground calcite crystals in sealed glass
   vials. Changes to the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V)
   were monitored by means of gel electrophoresis and immunology. In the
   presence of water, BSA was rapidly hydrolyzed and remained
   immunologically reactive for less than 9 h. Under anhydrous conditions
   the protein was immunologically reactive for the whole period of the
   experiment (128 1 h), unless mono- or disaccharide sugars were also
   present. In the presence of these reactive sugars, browning, a discrete
   increase in molecular weight of the protein, and a concomitant loss of
   antigenicity confirmed that the sugars were attaching covalently to the
   protein, forming melanoidins. The de novo formation of products
   cross-reactive with antibodies raised against organic matter isolated
   from the shells of a fossil mollusc (Mercenaria mercenaria) indicated
   that at least in part the model simulated natural diagenesis. We roughly
   estimate that, at the global scale, 2.4 x 10(6) tonnes of calcified
   tissue matrix glycoproteins is processed annually through the melanoidin
   pathway. This amount would be equivalent to 7 per mil of the total flux
   of organic carbon into marine sediments.},

   internal solitary wave over a bottom step},

Abstract = {Waveform deformation and breaking are widespread phenomena when internal
   solitary waves (ISWs) encounter changing topographies, which have been
   observed in many parts of oceans. In this study, experiments are
   performed in a series of combinations of bottom step topographies with
   different heights and ISWs in different amplitudes within a two-layer
   stratified fluid system. According to experimental results, the
   evolution processes of ISWs over the bottom step are classified into
   four typical regimes as the wave-step interaction varying from weak to
   strong, which are the transmission regime, transitional regime, breaking
   regime, and reflection regime, corresponding to the evolution patterns
   of steady passage, deformation, breaking, and strong reflection,
   respectively. To describe the intensity of wave-step interaction, a new
   improved interaction parameter is proposed, which takes both relative
   amplitude of ISWs and relative topography changes into consideration,
   and achieved better effectiveness in defining the boundaries between
   different regimes. In terms of energy properties, with the wave-step
   interaction becoming stronger, the transmission ratio keeps decreasing
   throughout all regimes, while the reflection wave starts to appear since
   the breaking regime and its energy keeps increasing. At the critical
   point between the breaking regime and reflection regime, the reflection
   ratio equals the transmission ratio, and the energy loss ratio reaches
   its maximum. Published under license by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {Guest exchange in clathrates is a complex activated phenomenon of the
   guest host cage interaction on the molecular-scale level. To model this
   process, we develop a mathematical description for the nonequilibrium
   binary permeation of guest molecules during gas replacement based on the
   microscopic ``hole-in-cage-wall{''} diffusive mechanism. The transport
   of gas molecules is envisaged as a series of jumps between occupied and
   empty neighboring cages without any significant lattice restructuring in
   the bulk. The gas exchange itself is seen as two-stage swapping
   initiated by almost instantaneous formation of a mixed hydrate layer on
   the hydrate surface followed by a much slower permeation-controlled
   process. The model is constrained by and validated with available
   time-resolved neutron diffraction data of the isostructural CH4 guest
   replacement by CO, in methane hydrate; a process of possible importance
   for the sequestration of CO2 with concomitant recovery of CH4 in marine
   gas hydrates.},

Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {459},

Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Organic-rich, fine-grained sedimentary rocks, such as black shales, are
   important geochemical archives providing information on the evolution of
   seawater composition and biological activity over the past 3 billion
   years. While biological productivity and sedimentation rates greatly
   affect the organic matter content in these rocks, mechanisms linking
   these two processes remain poorly resolved. Here, we examine the
   interactions of clay minerals with the marine planktonic cyanobacterium
   Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. We suggest that clays settling through the
   water column could influence carbon and trace metal burial in three
   ways: (1) the interaction of reactive clay surfaces with the bacterial
   cells increases organic matter deposition via mass increase in a
   seawater growth medium by several orders of magnitude; (2) reactive
   bacterial cells become completely encased within a clay shroud,
   enhancing the preservation potential of this organic matter; and (3) the
   trace metal content of the biomass buried along with metals sorbed to
   the clay particles contributes to the trace metal concentrations of the
   black shale precursor sediments. Significantly, our findings imply that
   the chemical composition of ancient, organic-rich, fine-grained deposits
   are not only archives of ancient seawater composition and redox state,
   but they also provide a record of the degree of biological activity in
   the water column through geological time.},

Title = {Carbon and carbonate metabolism in coastal aquatic ecosystems},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {405-434},
Abstract = {The coastal zone is where land, ocean, and atmosphere interact. It
   exhibits a wide diversity of geomorphological types and ecosystems, each
   one displaying great variability in terms of physical and biogeochemical
   forcings. Despite its relatively modest surface area, the coastal zone
   plays a considerable role in the biogeochemical cycles because it
   receives massive inputs of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients, is
   among the most geochemically and biologically active areas of the
   biosphere, and exchanges large amounts of matter and energy with the
   open ocean. Coastal ecosystems have therefore attracted much attention
   recently and are the focus of several current national and international
   research programs (e.g. LOICZ, ELOISE). The primary production,
   respiration, calcification, carbon burial and exchange with adjacent
   systems, including the atmosphere, are reviewed for the major coastal
   ecosystems (estuaries, macrophyte communities, mangroves, coral reefs,
   and the remaining continental shelf). All ecosystems examined, except

   the global carbon cycle both during pristine times and at present is
   difficult to assess due to the limited metabolic data available as well
   as because of major uncertainties concerning the magnitude of processes

Title = {The 2006 California Heat Wave: Impacts on Hospitalizations and Emergency
   Department Visits},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {117},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-67},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate models project that heat waves will increase in
   frequency and severity. Despite many studies of mortality from heat
   waves, few studies have examined morbidity.
   OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigated whether any age or
   race/ethnicity groups experienced increased hospitalizations and
   emergency department (ED) visits overall or for selected illnesses
   during the 2006 California heat wave.
   METHODS: We aggregated county-level hospitalizations and ED visits for
   all causes and for 10 cause groups into six geographic regions of
   California. We calculated excess morbidity and rate ratios (RRs) during
   the heat wave (15 July to 1 August 2006) and compared these data with
   those of a reference period (8-14 July and 12-22 August 2006).
   RESULTS: During the heat wave, 16,166 excess ED visits and 1,182 excess
   hospitalizations occurred statewide. ED visits for heat-related causes
   increased across the state {[}RR = 6.30; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   5.67-7.01], especially in the Central Coast region, which includes San
   Francisco. Children (0-4 years of age) and the elderly (>= 65 years of
   age) were at greatest risk. ED visits also showed significant increases
   for acute renal failure, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, electrolyte
   imbalance, and nephritis. We observed significantly elevated RRs for
   hospitalizations for heat-related ill-nesses (RR = 10.15; 95\% CI,
   7.79-13.43), acute renal Failure, electrolyte imbalance, and nephritis.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 2006 California heat wave had a substantial effect on
   morbidity, including regions with relatively modest temperatures. This
   suggests that population acclimatization and adaptive capacity
   influenced risk. By better understanding these impacts and population
   vulnerabilities, local communities can improve heat wave preparedness to
   cope with a globally warming future.},

Title = {Optimal Port Microgrid Scheduling Incorporating Onshore Power Supply and
   Berth Allocation Under Uncertainty},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {313},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The high environmental impacts of maritime transportation have led to an
   increasing interest in adopting electricity as the ideal energy source
   within the sector. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated
   day-ahead scheduling algorithm to jointly optimize the seaside/yard
   operation and the port energy system management within one unified
   framework by harnessing the synergy between two of the most prominent
   maritime electrification techniques: onshore power supply and microgrid.
   We formulate the joint scheduling problem as a twostage model. In the
   first stage, the port authority determines the optimal berth allocation
   for the incoming vessels considering their cargo volumes, energy
   demands, and the availability of OPS facility and cargo handling
   equipment (i.e., quay/yard cranes). In the second stage, acting as the
   port microgrid operator, the port authority determines the optimal
   day-ahead scheduling of the container handling activities and operation
   of port microgrid assets for each time slot. Uncertainty from renewable
   energy generation and port load forecast is also incorporated in the
   problem formulation. The simulation-based case study shows that the
   proposed joint scheduling algorithm is capable of enhancing energy
   independence, system-wide efficiency, operational reliability, and
   economy of the port microgrid in comparison with the conventional berth
   allocation strategy. We hope our work provides insights into how
   electrification can help the maritime sector reinforce its commitment to
   sustainability while remaining competitive.},

   Seawater Evaporation Enhancement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Solar-driven seawater evaporation for seawater desalination is the
   effective and sustainable solution to utilize solar energy. We designed
   a hybrid photothermal material composed of Au-H2Ti2O5 nanowires on Ti
   foam with outstanding photothermal conversion performance to meet the
   requirement of freshwater shortage. Herein, H2Ti2O5 nanowires were grown
   on the surface of Ti foam as the substrate and water transfer layer by
   the hydrothermal method, and then Au nanospheres were deposited on
   H2Ti2O5 nanowires with the assistance of UV light reduction. The results
   indicated that the Au-10 material prepared with Au nanosphere deposition
   of 10 cycles exhibited the excellent solar absorption and photothermal
   ability, the water evaporation rate and conversion efficiency achieved
   4.6800 kg m(-2) h(-1) and 58.76\% under 5 sun irradiation, which was
   2.07 times that of the sample without Au deposition. More importantly,
   the Au-10 showed high stability in the seawater evaporation with nearly
   lossless photothermal efficiency. The described design strategy of
   Au-H2Ti2O5 photothermal materials is simple, effective and repeatable,
   which is suitable for the practical solar-evaporation application. (C)

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biodegradable polylactic acid material is manufactured from lactic acid,
   mainly produced by microbial fermentation. The high production cost of
   lactic acid still remains the major limitation for its application,
   indicating that the cost of carbon sources for the production of lactic
   acid has to be minimized. In addition, a lack of source availability of
   food crop and lignocellulosic biomass has encouraged researchers and
   industries to explore new feedstocks for microbial lactic acid
   fermentation. Seaweeds have attracted considerable attention as a carbon
   source for microbial fermentation owing to their non-terrestrial origin,
   fast growth, and photoautotrophic nature. The proximate compositions
   study of red, brown, and green seaweeds indicated that Gracilaria sp.
   has the highest carbohydrate content. The conditions were optimized for
   the saccharification of the seaweeds, and the results indicated that
   Gracilaria sp. yielded the highest reducing sugar content. Optimal
   lactic acid fermentation parameters, such as cell inoculum, agitation,
   and temperature, were determined to be 6\% (v/v), 0 rpm, and 30 degrees
   C, respectively. Gracilaria sp. hydrolysates fermented by lactic acid
   bacteria at optimal conditions yielded a final lactic acid concentration

Abstract = {Background: Throughout most of the second half of this century, progress
   in respiratory life support was dominated by modernization of the
   mechanical ventilator. We have now entered an era in which the
   fundamental physiology of lung function can be manipulated to improve
   lung performance in hope of reducing morbidity and mortality and thereby
   decreasing the cast of intensive care.
   Main Findings: Despite its almost alien technology, perfluorocarbon
   tidal liquid breathing is an effective means to support respiration in
   normal and surfactant deficient lungs. A second, technique,
   perfluorocarbon associated gas exchange (PAGE), has recently been shown
   effective in normal lungs and in several animal models of lung disease.
   Both techniques appear to improve pulmonary function when pulmonary
   surface tension is elevated.
   Conclusions: PAGE improves lung function and poses opportunities to
   reduce pulmonary morbidity and diminish the cost of intensive care.
   The availability of bottled oxygen, and the development of positive
   pressure breathing devices revolutionized pulmonary medicine and ushered
   in the modern era of intensive care.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},

Abstract = {Dust aerosols that are not deposited over oceans are able to
   significantly reduce the solar energy available at the sea surface.
   Here, the impact of dust aerosols on the photosynthetically available
   radiation (PAR) at the sea surface and on the associated oceanic primary
   production (PP) is quantified over the subtropical Atlantic Ocean based
   on a ten-year time series of satellite observations. The ten-year
   average value of the attenuation of both PAR and PP due to dust aerosols
   is high (similar to 15\%). The comparisons with predictions suggested
   that the decrease of PP might be similar to 35\% in the case of intense
   episodic events (i.e., dust aerosols optical depth > 0.6). Therefore,
   dust aerosol events could significantly alter the organic carbon budget
   of the underlying oceanic ecosystems. The analysis of the interannual
   variations of the relative reduction of primary production (Delta PP/PP)
   due to dust aerosols showed that the evolution of Delta PP/PP does not
   exhibit any major trend of variation within the entire study area over
   the decade. However, a significant tendency (0.22\% per year) is found
   near Africa in summer. Thus, dust aerosol events might induce a major
   decrease of the marine productivity the next centuries. The radiative
   forcing of dust aerosols on the sea surface needs to be accounted for in
   coupled atmosphere-ocean models for calculating correctly the primary
   production. A more extensive analysis of the aerosol radiative budget is
   also required to better understand the link between the atmospheric and
   oceanic processes driving the primary production over dust aerosol
   areas.},

Abstract = {The levels of polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs),
   polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls
   (DL-PCBs), non-dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (NDL-PCBs), and
   polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in fish collected from two marine
   offshore farming plants were determined. Each sample was constituted by
   specimens of the same size collected at the same time in four different
   seasons along the farming year. The feeds given were of industrial
   origin and the plants were positioned in two different sites
   respectively exposed to different environmental characteristics. A
   chemometric approach was applied to interpret the subtle differences
   observed in fish body burdens across the three chemical groups taken
   into consideration. The approach consisted in a stepwise multivariate
   process including a hierarchical cluster analysis (CA) and a linear
   discriminant analysis (DA). The two main clusters determined by CA were
   subjected to the canonical DA, backward and forward selection procedures
   to select the best discriminative functions. A clear temporal and
   spatial discrimination was found among the samples. Across the three
   chemical groups, the monthly separation seemed to depend on the growth
   process and the main exposure was due to the feed. In addition, the two
   plants differed significantly from the environmental point of view and
   the most important discriminating group of chemicals were the NDL-PCBs.
   The approach resulted really effective in discriminating the subtle
   differences and in individuating suggestions to improve the quality of
   culturing conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {New 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and global cyclostratigraphic calibration
   provide high-resolution insights into the timing of geochemical
   fluctuations across oceanic anoxic event II (OAE II). Five new 40Ar/39Ar
   data from a single section in western Canada suggest an age of 96.4 +/-
   1 Ma for the Cenomanian-Turonian (C-T) boundary. This is similar to3
   m.y. older than previously dated. Time-series analysis (e.g., wavelet
   transform) reveals that OAE II was synchronously deposited worldwide
   over a period of similar to 320 k.y. The preservation and stationarity
   of Milankovitch cyclicity in sections across the Atlantic indicates that
   no major fluctuations in sedimentation rate occur across the OAE II,
   except for a minor shortterm decrease in the rate just before the C-T
   boundary. A delta C-13(org) increase of >2 parts per thousand took place
   at the beginning of OAE II over a period of similar to 110 k.y., and
   likely represents a period of worldwide excessive organic carbon burial
   during transgression, leading to a C-12 depletion of seawater and
   sedimentation. This interval was followed by a three-step decrease to
   pre-OAF II delta C-13 values.},

Abstract = {Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are being promoted as the
   materials of 21st century because of their superior corrosion
   resistance, excellent thermo-mechanical properties, and high
   strength-to-weight ratio. For over 25 years, the Constructed Facilities
   Center at West Virginia University (CFC-WVU) has been conducting
   research on fundamentals of engineering and material sciences,
   innovation and development including field implementation of FRP
   composite components and systems for infrastructure applications with
   emphasis on the enhancement of performance, serviceability and
   durability over conventional materials. This paper will provide an
   overview on advanced FRP composites for; 1) highways and bridges
   including recent pre-fabricated pavement application, 2) utility poles,
   3) pipelines, 4) renewable energy harvesting, 5) harsh environmental
   applications such as chimneys/flues, 6) rapidly deployable housing, 7)
   natural composites for green buildings, 8) decking for marine and naval
   structures, 9) advanced retrofitting, and 10) others. The Center has
   been involved in building a number of structures in the field using FRP
   composites. Those structures are being monitored for their structural
   response and durability and have been performing outstandingly,
   demonstrating remarkable advantages including cost effectiveness. Last,
   future research directions on materials for civil engineering innovation
   and structures are presented with emphasis on durability and
   sustainability.},

Title = {Effect of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) invasion on blue mussel

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},

Volume = {21},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The invasive round goby has established a viable population within
   9years of its first introduction to Lithuanian coastal waters (SE Baltic
   Sea). During its expansion phase, abundances increased 23-fold, which
   led to the near complete eradication of its main prey, the blue mussel,
   at <20m depth. The round goby population showed a stabilizing trend
   after blue mussel biomass was depleted; however, their abundance has not
   declined. The round goby feeds efficiently on newly settled mollusks,
   causing a severe constraint for blue mussel recovery. Changes in blue
   mussel availability and size structure induced a dietary shift in
   wintering long-tailed duck towards fish prey. An energetically dense
   food source sustains a good body condition in long-tailed ducks, however
   the change in trophic position (from 3.1 to 4.3 trophic level) suggests
   the potential for a reduction in their carrying capacity. Results from
   this study also show that coastal habitats with low and unpredictable
   population dynamics of blue mussel become less attractive wintering
   sites for long-tailed duck in the Baltic Sea. We also document a
   cascading effect of invasive species in the food web.},

Abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is a process through which
   groundwater and solutes are transferred from coastal aquifers into the
   oceans. Generally, the SGD is composed of two basic components: (1)
   fresh groundwater, FSGD; and (2) recirculated seawater, RSGD. Radon, a
   naturally occurring geochemical tracer, is a useful tool to evaluate the
   SGD in coastal areas. This study aims to evaluate the impact of wind
   waves on each components of submarine groundwater discharge. We
   monitored temporal fluctuations of seawater Rn-222 concentration at
   Shiranui and Minamata bays, where elevated seawater Rn-222 concentration
   spatial distribution observed during our previous studies. The
   measurements were conducted in coastal seawater where the connected
   coastal aquifer water table is very shallow. Additionally, a seawater
   model was applied to evaluate the seawater Rn-222 concentration that
   originates from rivers in the study area. The Rn-222 inventory in the
   study area implies that the groundwater advection is one of the major
   sources of Rn-222 in the seawater. The obtained dataset suggests that
   the seawater Rn-222 concentration increases, but the salinity decreases
   during windy periods. This means that more fresh groundwater contributes
   to dilute the recirculated seawater (RSGD) during windy conditions.
   Therefore, when the sea is windy and seawater waves propagate onshore,
   the fresh groundwater flux may increase where shallow coastal aquifers
   exist.},

Abstract = {Degradation of humic acids extracted from seabed sediments, that were
   collected from two different locations in Japan, was carried out using
   an ozone treatment technique. Degradation was evaluated by UV(254) and
   VIS(400) absorbance, high performance size exclusion chromatography
   (HPSEC) and total organic carbon (TOC). Sediment was collected from Ago
   Bay, Mie prefecture and Ariake Bay, Fukuoka prefecture, Japan. After the
   ozone treatment, a decrease in absorbance of humic acids was observed
   over a wide range of pH. The UV(254) absorbance of all humic acids
   showed a significant decrease. Furthermore, under neutral pH, more than
   80\% degradation was achieved for both sediments, with an initial humic
   acid concentration of 30 mg L(-1). The total organic carbon (TOC)
   content of ozone-dosed solutions showed no significant changes. The
   decrease in the molecular weight of humic acids was evaluated using the
   values obtained by high performance size exclusion chromatographic
   (HPSEC) analysis. Humic acids in extracted solutions were related to the
   key materials in the sediment, which result from the semi-closed sea
   environment. Significant environmental improvement can be expected from
   the use of this technology. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   tsunami events using the estimation of surface current changes. Several
   ocean radar systems, operating in the upper HF band, were already
   optimized for tsunami alerting and installed for real-time tsunami
   monitoring at the coast. If the shelf extends tens of kilometers off the
   coast then the first appearance of tsunami waves can be monitored at the
   shelf quite early. On May 25, 2018, an HF SW phased-array radar system,
   operating in the lower HF band (6.9 MHz), detected strong changes in
   measured radial currents at distances up to 60 km off the coast. The
   system tracked the tsunami-like current pattern in the Bight of Benin.
   The wave propagation coincided with an atmospheric cold front passage.
   No earthquake occurred at that time but a strong atmospheric disturbance
   was present and it is the most likely reason for the detected
   disturbance. This localized event could be classified as a
   meteorological tsunami (meteotsunami). It is important to note that this
   is the very first detection of meteotsunami in the whole West African
   region. This detection showed the capability of the radar to measure
   unusual surface current velocities induced by tsunami waves using the
   lower part of the HF band. The detection of this tsunami-like event has
   shown good applicability of HF phased-array radar technology for
   offshore tsunami monitoring and providing safe navigation, in real-time.
   At the same time, it has been shown that a single HF SW radar system,
   originally optimized for vessel tracking at very long ranges using a
   proper output power, transmitter's noise optimization and integration
   time, can also be utilized as a component of Tsunami early warning
   systems (TEWS).},

Title = {Littoral habitats as major nursery areas for fish species in estuaries:
   a reinforcement of the reduced predation paradigm},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {649},
Pages = {219-234},

Abstract = {For many decades, the role of estuaries as important nursery areas for
   fishes was accepted as fact by scientists and environmental managers. At
   the turn of the 21st century, a question mark was raised in relation to
   the reduced predation component of the nursery function, with some
   scientists contending that both large and small piscivorous fish species
   had access to the estuarine habitats that juvenile fishes in estuaries
   occupied. If true on a global scale, the nursery designation for these
   habitats would be compromised and the long-held paradigm that estuaries
   are important nursery areas for fishes would need to be revised. In this
   review, I examine the nature of fish nursery areas in estuarine littoral
   habitats from a mainly predation perspective and, based on a variety of
   ichthyofaunal and avifaunal studies, come to the conclusion that apart
   from a few selected estuarine systems, there is limited predation on
   juvenile fishes in these particular areas. This, coupled with the
   abundant suitable food resources for juvenile fish from different
   trophic categories, shelter from high-energy marine wave action and
   biological connectivity between a variety of submerged and emergent
   macrophyte communities, renders shallow estuarine littoral areas ideal
   nursery areas for the juveniles of mostly euryhaline marine fish
   species, the dominant component of estuarine ichthyofaunas globally. In
   addition, there are strong indications from the fossil record that these
   littoral estuarine nursery areas have been functioning since the
   Devonian, more than 350 million years ago.},

Abstract = {This thematic issue on Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) Large Marine
   Ecosystems (LMEs) focuses attention on a major geographic area of the
   world, where the goods and services of 10 LMEs are serving the needs of
   a population of over 500 million people inhabiting the region. The
   stressors affecting the sustainable development of the LAC-LMEs are
   negatively impacting the economies of the bordering countries from
   overfishing, pollution, nutrient overenrichment, habitat degradation,
   biodiversity loss and climate change. The papers presented in this issue
   represent a cross-section of assessment studies underway by marine
   scientists, policy makers and resource managers in the region in a
   movement to introduce ecosystem based management (EBM) practices for
   stressed LMEs. This movement is supported in part by an independent
   international financial entity, the Global Environment Facility (GEF),
   which exists to help meet the objectives of the international
   environmental conventions and agreements. The movement has been

   microgrid system},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Energy management of the grid connected microgrid (MG) systems with low
   cost using a novel hybrid algorithm is implemented in this paper. The
   novel proposed hybrid technique is the combined performance of both the
   Random Forest (RF) and Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) algorithm and in
   this way it is named as RFCRO. Optimum operation of micro-sources for
   decreasing the electricity production cost by hourly day-ahead and
   real-time scheduling is the main objective of the paper. The proposed
   hybrid technique is to manage the power flows between the energy sources
   and the grid. To achieve this point, demand response and minimum cost of
   energy are determined. This technique is involved with the mathematical
   optimization problems that necessitate more than one fitness function to
   be optimized simultaneously. By using the inputs of MG-like wind
   turbine, photovoltaic array, battery, and fuel cell with corresponding
   cost functions, the RF is employed to predict the load demand. CRO
   clarifies the squirrel in optimizing the configuration of MG based on
   the load demand. The proposed hybrid technique is implemented in
   MATLAB/Simulink working platform and compared with other solution
   techniques like BFOANN, ALO, GOAPSNN, and RBFNN-SSA technique. The
   comparison result reveals that the superiority of the proposed technique
   confirms its ability to solve the problem.},

Title = {Long-term trends in the abundance of an estuarine fish and relationships
   with El Nino climatic impacts and seagrass meadows reduction},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {261},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {El Nin similar to o events and their climatic effects vary markedly in
   intensity due to several factors related to oceanographic and
   atmospheric conditions in the Pacific equatorial ocean. As a result of
   fluctuations in the climate system, rainfall and temperature deviate
   from average conditions which causes severe biological, economic and
   social impacts worldwide. In this study, long-term (23 years)
   standardized monthly sampling of Brazilian silverside, Atherinella
   brasiliensis, resident fish that inhabits the shallow waters of a
   subtropical estuary, was performed to investigate the temporal
   variability in its abundance and relationship with local and regional
   environmental factors associated with El Nin similar to o events and
   temporal changes in seagrass meadows biomass. We investigated the
   following hypotheses: (i) A. brasiliensis abundance has presented a
   long-term decreasing trend, (ii) El Nin similar to o events with higher
   intensities are related to a higher decrease in the species abundance in
   the estuary and (iii) the decline in A. brasiliensis abundance is
   influenced by reduction of seagrass meadows, which serve as attachment
   sites for developing embryos of this species. Time series analysis
   revealed a statistically significant decrease in the abundance of A.
   brasiliensis, which was characterized by marked decline between 1996 and
   2004 followed by a relative stability between 2005 and 2019. Generalized
   linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that its abundance decreased during
   high rainfall and lower salinity conditions associated with moderate and
   very strong El Nin similar to o events, but not during neutral and weak
   events. An additional GLMM also revealed significant effects of seagrass
   biomass on the fish abundance. In fact, years with marked decline in the
   fish abundance coincided with lower or absence of seagrass biomass in
   the estuary, especially between 1997 and 2005. Hence, negative climatic
   impacts on A. brasiliensis abundance may have been intensified by
   synergistic effects caused by periods of reduction in seagrass meadows.
   These findings raise concerns for conservation, especially when we
   consider that the studied species is ubiquitous in southwestern Atlantic
   estuaries and that climate disturbances such as El Nin similar to o are
   expected to become more frequent in the future due to rising ocean
   temperatures driven by global warming.},

Abstract = {Wendelstein 7-X is a low-shear stellarator with an island divertor,
   formed by natural magnetic islands at the plasma edge and ten modular
   divertor units for particle and energy exhaust. For the island divertor
   concept to work properly, the device is optimized for small internal
   currents. In particular, the bootstrap current is minimized. Previous
   studies predicted a thermal overload of the targets at a particular
   location, due to the slow evolution of the toroidal net current in the
   initial phase of certain otherwise desirable high-power discharges. The
   present numerical study explores the neoclassical predictions for the
   bootstrap current in more detail and demonstrates, as a proof of
   principle, that a path from low density and low heating power to high
   density and full heating power exists, on which the bootstrap current
   remains constant. This offers the possibility to reach the predetermined
   toroidal net current at low heating power, where no overload will occur
   in the transient phase.},

Title = {Dynamic Security Optimization for N-1 Secure Operation of Hawai'i Island
   System With 100\% Inverter-Based Resources},

Abstract = {Reliable power system operation with 100\% inverter-based resources
   (IBRs) is an unsolved and challenging problem. One of the most
   challenging factors is ensuring power system stability after N-1
   contingencies. This paper presents a promising solution using an
   operator support system (OSS) to enable stable operation of power system
   with up to 100\% IBR generation. The OSS consists of two components.
   First is dynamic security assessment to evaluate the system resiliency,
   and identify critical N-1 contingencies that could endanger the system.
   The second component, as the key technology behind the OSS, is dynamic
   security optimization (DSO). The DSO optimizes the control parameters of
   generators and inverters to improve the stability of the system towards
   the identified N-1 contingencies. The key to system with 100\% IBRs, as
   emphasized in many recent studies, is to establish the grid frequency
   reference using grid-forming (GFM) inverters. We show through
   high-fidelity Electro-Magnetic-Transient (EMT) simulations of the future
   generation models of Hawai'i Island system with 100\% IBR capacity that
   a system with 100\% IBRs can be operated stably with the help of GFM
   inverters, and appropriate controller parameters can be found by DSO for
   the inverters. The DSO is verified via 28 critical N-1 contingencies of
   Hawai'i Island system identified by Hawaiian Electric. The simulation
   results verify the effectiveness of DSO, and show significant stability
   improvement from DSO.},

Abstract = {A 2000year simulation forced by the external forcings of the last two
   millennia is carried out with the Community Earth System Model. We
   compare climate changes over China between the peak Sui-Tang warm period
   (Sui-TangWP; 650-700 A.D.) and Song-Yuan warm period (Song-YuanWP;
   950-1000 A.D.), which were two key culturally, economically, and
   educationally prosperous eras in Chinese history. The simulation
   indicates warm conditions in both periods, but the warmth is mainly seen
   in East China in the peak Sui-TangWP, and over the whole of China in the
   peak Song-YuanWP. The warming in the peak Sui-TangWP is attributed to
   the localized increase of atmospheric net energy with favorable heat
   transport, whereas the peak Song-YuanWP results from the increase of
   global solar radiation. The annual mean precipitation anomalies in the
   peak Sui-TangWP exhibit a meridional dipole pattern over East China,
   with enhanced precipitation in the region south of the Yangtze River and
   decreased precipitation to the north. In the peak Song-YuanWP, the
   precipitation enhances over most parts of China. The precipitation
   anomalies are largely attributed to the water vapor transport anomalies
   associated with monsoon circulation changes. The simulated climate
   changes are broadly consistent with reconstructions, but the magnitude
   is greatly underestimated. Based on the simulation and reconstructions,
   we suggest that the Sui-TangWP may have been a regional phenomenon in
   China, while the Song-YuanWP was a reflection of
   global/hemispheric-scale warm events that took place at the same time.},

Title = {Bacterial Community Structure in Two Permafrost Wetlands on the Tibetan

Abstract = {Permafrost wetlands are important methane emission sources and fragile
   ecosystems sensitive to climate change. Presently, there remains a lack
   of knowledge regarding bacterial communities, especially methanotrophs
   in vast areas of permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau in Northwest China
   and the Sanjiang Plain (SJ) in Northeast China. In this study, 16S
   rRNA-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 454 pyrosequencing were used to
   identify bacterial communities in soils sampled from a littoral wetland
   of Lake Namco on the Tibetan Plateau (NMC) and an alluvial wetland on
   the SJ. Additionally, methanotroph-specific primers targeting
   particulate methane monooxygenase subunit A gene (pmoA) were used for
   qPCR and pyrosequencing analysis of methanotrophic community structure
   in NMC soils. qPCR analysis revealed the presence of 10(10) 16S rRNA
   gene copies per gram of wet soil in both wetlands, with 10(8) pmoA
   copies per gram of wet soil in NMC. The two permafrost wetlands showed
   similar bacterial community compositions, which differed from those
   reported in other cold environments. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria ,
   and Chloroflexi were the most abundant phyla in both wetlands, whereas
   Acidobacteria was prevalent in the acidic wetland SJ only. These four
   phyla constituted more than 80 \% of total bacterial community diversity
   in permafrost wetland soils, and Methylobacter of type I methanotrophs
   was overwhelmingly dominant in NMC soils. This study is the first major
   bacterial sequencing effort of permafrost in the NMC and SJ wetlands,
   which provides fundamental data for further studies of microbial
   function in extreme ecosystems under climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Ocean waves have a profound impact on navigation, offshore operations,
   recreation, safety, and the economic vitality of a nation's maritime and
   coastal communities. This study demonstrates that ships equipped with
   geodetic GPS and a radar gauge can provide accurate estimates of sea
   state. The Research Vessel (R/V) Kilo Moana recorded 1-Hz data for the
   entire period of a 10-day cruise around the Hawaiian Islands. Solving
   for precise kinematic positions for the ship and combining these
   solutions with the ranges from the ship to the sea surface provided by
   the radar gauge, it was possible to retrieve 1-Hz estimates of the sea
   surface elevation along the cruise track. Converting these into
   estimates of significant wave height, strong agreement was found with
   wave buoy measurements and hindcast wave data. Comparison with buoy data
   indicates the estimates have errors on the order of 0.22 m, or less than
   11\% of the wave height. Using wave model predictions of the dominant
   directions, the data were processed further to correct for the Doppler
   shift and to estimate the dominant wave period. Although relatively
   noisy in locations where the predicted wave directions are expected to
   be poor, in general these estimates also show a good agreement with the
   wave buoy observations and hindcast wave estimates. A segment of the
   cruise that formed a circuit allowed for testing the consistency of the
   ship-based estimates and for determining a dominant wave direction,
   which was found to agree closely with model predictions.},

Title = {New records of seaweeds and filamentous cyanobacteria from Trindade
   Island: an updated checklist to support conservation guidelines and
   monitoring of environmental changes in the southern Atlantic
   archipelagos},
Journal = {SCIENTIA MARINA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {84},
Number = {3},
Pages = {227+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Oceanic islands are natural laboratories for investigating species
   diversity and richness patterns. Changes in abiotic parameters may
   induce shifts in marine biota. Seaweeds are recognized as bioindicators,
   though those from remote tropical islands have been rarely studied. This
   study updates the diversity, richness and distribution of macroalgae
   from Trindade, a Brazilian volcanic island located 1140 km off the
   coast. Biotic data, obtained in a global database and in situ and
   compiled in a new records list, were associated with abiotic parameters.
   Conservation and ecological issues were discussed in the context of the
   observed greater richness, expansion of the distributional range and low
   endemism. A total of 141 species were identified, including 60 new
   records and 20 taxa of filamentous cyanobacteria. The greater richness,
   including potential cryptogenic species, may primarily be associated
   with past incomplete samplings, current new techniques and combined
   taxonomical methods, including molecular analysis for cryptic species.
   However, on the macroscale. this study provides information for the
   re-evaluation of aspects of endemism, connections and biogeographical
   distribution shifts of seaweed assemblages, considering environmental
   changes. In addition, this updated checklist establishes a baseline for
   further comparative studies, reinforcing the hypothesis that
   biogeographical isolation can be disrupted by meteorological and
   oceanographic shifts, altering dispersal patterns and resulting in
   higher ecosystems connectivity.},

Title = {Evaluating the environmental impacts of recycling wind turbines},
Journal = {WIND ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {316-326},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wind power is one of the fastest growing renewable energy sources. The
   wind turbines have an expected design lifetime in the range of 20 to 25
   years after which decommissioning is expected. The trend in the wind
   turbine industry is that the turbines increase in size-especially when
   considering offshore wind turbines in the 7 to 8 MW size range. Life
   cycle assessments show that the materials used for manufacturing the
   turbines accounts for 70 to 80\% of the environmental impact, so
   ensuring optimal recycling at the end-of-service-life is of economic and
   environmental interest and in line with the principles of transitioning
   towards a circular economy. The decommissioning and recycling process is
   analysed in this paper, with special considerations given to the
   environmental aspects of a theoretical 100\% recyclability scenario.
   This includes cradle-to-gate life-cycle inventory analysis of the
   materials, embedded energy, and CO2-equivalent emissions. The findings
   show that established recycling methods are present for most of the
   materials and that recycling of a 60 MW wind park at end-of-service-life
   provides environmental benefits as well as lowering the natural resource
   use and securing resources for use in the future. The saved energy is
   estimated to approximately 81 TJ. The reduction in emissions related to
   the recycling of wind turbine material totals approximately 7351 ton
   CO2.},

Abstract = {Predator loss and climate change are hallmarks of the Anthropocene yet
   their interactive effects are largely unknown. Here, we show that
   massive calcareous reefs, built slowly by the alga Clathromorphum
   nereostratum over centuries to millennia, are now declining because of
   the emerging interplay between these two processes. Such reefs, the
   structural base of Aleutian kelp forests, are rapidly eroding because of
   overgrazing by herbivores. Historical reconstructions and experiments
   reveal that overgrazing was initiated by the loss of sea otters, Enhydra
   lutris (which gave rise to herbivores capable of causing bioerosion),
   and then accelerated with ocean warming and acidification (which
   increased per capita lethal grazing by 34 to 60\% compared with
   preindustrial times). Thus, keystone predators can mediate the ways in
   which climate effects emerge in nature and the pace with which they
   alter ecosystems.},

Title = {The identification of 100 ecological questions of high policy relevance
   in the UK},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {617-627},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Evidence-based policy requires researchers to provide the answers to
   ecological questions that are of interest to policy makers. To find out
   what those questions are in the UK, representatives from 28
   organizations involved in policy, together with scientists from 10
   academic institutions, were asked to generate a list of questions from
   their organizations.
   2. During a 2-day workshop the initial list of 1003 questions generated
   from consulting at least 654 policy makers and academics was used as a
   basis for generating a short list of 100 questions of significant policy
   relevance. Short-listing was decided on the basis of the preferences of
   the representatives from the policy-led organizations.
   3. The areas covered included most major issues of environmental concern
   in the UK, including agriculture, marine fisheries, climate change,
   ecosystem function and land management.
   4. The most striking outcome was the preference for general questions
   rather than narrow ones. The reason is that policy is driven by broad
   issues rather than specific ones. In contrast, scientists are frequently
   best equipped to answer specific questions. This means that it may be
   necessary to extract the underpinning specific question before
   researchers can proceed.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Greater communication between policy
   makers and scientists is required in order to ensure that applied
   ecologists are dealing with issues in a way that can feed into policy.
   It is particularly important that applied ecologists emphasize the
   generic value of their work wherever possible.},

Title = {A consistent and verifiable macroscopic model for the dissolution of

Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Direct injection of liquid CO2 into the ocean has been proposed as one
   method to reduce the emission levels Of CO2 into the atmosphere. When
   liquid CO2 is injected (normally as droplets) at ocean depths > 500 in,
   a solid interfacial region between the CO2 and the water is observed to
   form. This region consists of hydrate clathrates and hinders the rate of
   dissolution Of CO2 . It is, therefore, expected to have a significant
   impact on the injection of liquid CO2 into the ocean. Up until now, no
   consistent and predictive model for the shrinking of droplets Of CO2
   under hydrate forming conditions has been proposed. This is because all
   models proposed to date have had too many unknowns. By computing rates
   of the physical and chemical processes in hydrates. via molecular
   dynamics simulations, we have been able to determine independently some
   of these unknowns. We then propose the,most reasonable model and use it
   to make independent predictions of the rates of mass transfer and
   thickness of the hydrate region. These predictions are compared to
   measurements, and implications to the rates of shrinkage Of CO2 droplets
   under varying flow conditions are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {The structural interpretation of the Sora and North Sora sub-basins are
   conducted using up-to ca. 75 cross-sections to determine major
   structures. The purpose of this study is to better understand the
   structural development of the Sora and North Sora Sub-Basins. Seismic
   lines conducted at 1990, 1997, 2006 supported by KNOC (Korea National
   Oil Cooperation) and well data are re-interpreted in terms of fault
   geometries and key horizons considering basin-type and tectonic
   evolution. The results show that both Sora and North Sora Sub-Basins
   experience similar geological evolution since Cenozoic. However, the
   NE-trending regional structures beneath the Late Cretaceous unconformity
   are different as results of faulted depression controlled by Yandang
   movement. Trap geometries are formed before end of the late Mid-Miocene
   contractional deformation. Reactivated rift-related structures are
   preserved in North Sora Basin. However, syn-rift growth pattern is not
   observed within the Sora Basin, indicating that it might be a depression
   at the end of Cretaceous. These results will provide better
   understanding on the geometric and kinematic basin evolution history,
   which might help to develop new potential petroleum play concept that
   can apply to the site survey for Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS)
   storage.},

   and within Beaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Grain size on the surface of natural beaches has been observed to vary
   spatially and temporally with morphology and wave energy. The
   stratigraphy of the beach at Duck, North Carolina, USA was examined
   using 36 vibracores (similar to 1-1.5 m long) collected along a
   cross-shore beach profile. Cores show that beach sediments are finer
   (similar to 0.3 mm) and more uniform high up on the beach. Lower on the
   beach, with more swash and wave action, the sand is reworked, segregated
   by size, and deposited in layers and patches. At the deepest measurement
   sites in the swash (similar to-1.4 to -1.6 m NAVD88), which are
   constantly being reworked by the energetic shore break, there is a thick
   layer (60-80 cm) of very coarse sediment (similar to 2 mm). Examination
   of two large trenches showed that continuous layers of coarse and fine
   sands comprise beach stratigraphy. Thicker coarse layers in the trenches
   (above mean sea level) are likely owing to storm erosion and storm surge
   elevating the shore break and swash, which act to sort the sediment.
   Those layers are buried as water level retreats, accretion occurs and
   the beach recovers from the storm. Thinner coarse layers likely
   represent similar processes acting on smaller temporal scales.},

Title = {Utilization of bioresources for sustainable biofuels: A Review},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {205-214},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The global energy demand has been increasing rapidly due to depletion of
   fossil fuels, continuous growth of world population and industrialized
   economy. India has surpassed to Japan and Russia and become the third
   largest oil consumer in the world. Unfortunately, India's primary energy
   consumption has increased due to reduced oil and gas production. The
   increased consumption of imported oil could lead to turbulence in
   economic growth. Due to increasing demand of oil fuels and consequent
   impact of global warming issues, development of alternate energy is a
   top priority in research and developments sector. The bioenergy produced
   from the biomass is being a sustainable alternate energy source which
   received high acceptance in various sectors include public, industries
   and government policies. from the Government, public, industries and
   researches for its sustainability. This review focuson bioprospecting of
   biomass from terrestrial and marine resources for non conventional
   energy production and the stepping stones of biofuel for near future.
   These carbohydrates can be converted into various forms of biofuels
   either directly or indirectly by exploiting microorganisms. However, the
   production process and chemical transformation is being an expensive
   process and therefore commercial supply of biofuel in largescale is not
   yet successful. Hence an economic and efficient production process is
   essential to commercialize biomass based biofuels. This article
   highlights the overview of sustainable and renewable resources for
   biofuel and stepping stones of biofuel commercialization.},

Abstract = {Observations of tidal currents in the St. Lucie Inlet were performed to
   map the temporal variation in the spatial structure of flow through
   several Inlet cross sections. These high-resolution measurements of
   tidal current velocities were obtained using a vessel-mounted Acoustic
   Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) coupled with a GPS-based integrated
   navigation system. The inlet was traversed every 45 minutes through a
   complete lunar semi-diurnal tidal cycle (12.4 hours) in late August
   1997. The ADCP provided discrete vertical current profiles along each
   transect line with a vertical resolution of 20 cm (5 independent
   vertical measurements per meter bf water depth) and a horizontal
   resolution of approximately 5 meters (dependent upon vessel speed and
   averaging interval). The near-complete coverage of the Inlet cross
   lection during this survey allowed for accurate calculation of total
   volume discharges through a complete semi-diurnal tide cycle. Analysis
   of the survey data showed current energy focused in the deeper southern
   and center channels of the Inlet. The south channel was characterized as
   `flood dominant', with stronger flood currents than ebb currents, which
   tend to transport sediments into the inlet interior. The center channel
   was characterized as `ebb dominant', with stronger ebb currents than
   flood currents, tending to move sediments out of the Inlet to form an
   ebb tide shoal. The geometry of the waterway and hard structures
   appeared to modify the spatial structure of the tidal currents through
   the Inlet cross section.},

Abstract = {In his study, we use a combination of multivariate statistical methods
   to understand the relationships of PM2.5 with local meteorology and
   synoptic weather patterns in different regions of China across various
   timescales. Using June 2014 to May 2017 daily total PM2.5 observations
   from similar to 1500 monitors, all deseasonalized and detrended to focus
   on synoptic-scale variations, we find strong correlations of daily PM2.5
   with all selected meteorological variables (e.g., positive correlation
   with temperature but negative correlation with sea-level pressure
   throughout China; positive and negative correlation with relative
   humidity in northern and southern China, respectively). The spatial
   patterns suggest that the apparent correlations with individual
   meteorological variables may arise from common association with synoptic
   systems. Based on a principal component analysis of 1998-2017
   meteorological data to diagnose distinct meteorological modes that
   dominate synoptic weather in four major regions of China, we find strong
   correlations of PM2.5 with several synoptic modes that explain 10 to
   40\% of daily PM2.5 variability. These modes include monsoonal flows and
   cold frontal passages in northern and central China associated with the
   Siberian High, onshore flows in eastern China, and frontal rainstorms in
   southern China. Using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region as a case
   study, we further find strong interannual correlations of regionally
   averaged satellite-derived annual mean PM2.5 with annual mean relative
   humidity (RH; positive) and springtime fluctuation frequency of the
   Siberian High (negative). We apply the resulting PM2.5-to-climate
   sensitivities to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate
   projections to predict future PM2.5 by the 2050s due to climate change,
   and find a modest decrease of similar to 0.5 mu g m(-3) in annual mean
   PM2.5 in the BTH region due to more frequent cold frontal ventilation
   under the RCP8.5 future, representing a small ``climate benefit{''}, but
   the RH-induced PM2.5 change is inconclusive due to the large inter-model
   differences in RH projections.},

Title = {Control of carbonate sedimentation and reef growth in Llandovery
   sequences on the northwestern margin of the Yangtze Platform, south
   China},
Journal = {GONDWANA RESEARCH},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The later Telychian (late Llandovery, Silurian) sea-level highstand was
   a suitable setting for global carbonate deposition and reef growth in
   epeiric seas. However, evidence from the northwest margin of Yangtze
   Platform indicates that small carbonate platforms developed in
   rapidly-subsiding small basins and were principally controlled by muddy
   clastic input. In particular, sediments of the Ningqiang Formation, late
   Telychian, usually more than 2000 m thick, are mostly shales, but eight
   major units of discontinuous (15 km maximum width) and relatively thin
   (120 m maximum thickness) reef-bearing carbonates, which developed when
   the sedimentation rate apparently lessened, occur within a relatively
   short time interval. This interval is between upper griestonensis to
   spiralis-grandis graptolite biozones, estimated as a c. 2 Ma duration.
   More than 30 small- to medium-scale patch reefs occur in several parts
   of the sequence, but only within the carbonate units. Shelly faunas
   common throughout the sequence reveal water depth to have been shallow
   during deposition of the Ningqiang Formation equivalent to BA2-3, which
   has a depth range from low intertidal to the base of the photic zone.
   BA3 is interpreted as being no more than 60 m deep (Boucot, 1975), which
   is above normal wave base, frequently affected by storms (Chen et al.,
   1996), and is regarded as optimum depth for high diversity of Silurian
   faunas (Boucot, 1975; Brett,1991). Thus, the rate of sediment
   accumulation kept pace with basement subsidence, and was a substantial
   factor for limiting reef growth. Sharp contacts between carbonate units
   and shales indicate that carbonate units are constrained by frequent
   inputs of terrigenous debris, as the major cause for termination of
   carbonate deposition. Therefore, carbonate platforms, and reefs they
   contained, formed during times when sediment input to the basin lessened
   and ended when it increased; present evidence does not allow correlation
   to modeled dry episodes, and we interpret the control to be principally
   tectonic. Overall, sedimentation in the region was terminated by the end
   of Telychian time by tectonic uplift of the Yangtze Platform; the
   southwestward migration of palaeocoastline shows this progression.
   Sedimentation ceased until Middle Devonian time. Ludlow marine
   transgression has been recognized in the offshore area of Ningjiang Bay.},

Abstract = {While local and wavelet-based methods have mostly been applied to single
   time records of wave data, Donelan et al. (1996) derived and applied the
   Wavelet Directional Method (WDM) to small arrays of wave elevation
   recorders. After a short review of the Morlet wavelet transform applied
   to random signals, the WDM is revisited and compared to a Local Triplet
   Analysis (LTA) where the wavelet transform replaces the discrete Fourier
   transform in the directional analysis. The sampling statistics of the
   WDM and LTA are summarized, assuming that the wave records are weakly
   stationary stochastic processes. All methods show consistent results
   when applied to real data. Time-averaged local estimates of common wave
   parameters closely fit the estimates from the standard analysis.
   Frequency-averaged local wave directions show considerable variation
   and, in addition, the local directional spread tends to take a
   significant drop during the passage of large wave groups. The methods
   are illustrated using offshore directional wave data from the Ekofisk
   field in the North Sea.},

Abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is a key component in explaining the
   megadiversity of tropical forests. Despite its importance, knowledge
   about local drivers of environmental heterogeneity remains a challenge
   for ecologists. In Neotropical forests, epiphytic tank bromeliads store
   large amounts of water and nutrients in the tree canopy, and their tank
   overflow may create nutrient-rich patches in the soil. However, the
   effects of this nutrient flux on environmental heterogeneity and plant
   community structure in the understory remain unexplored. In a Brazilian
   coastal sandy forest, we investigated the effects of the presence of
   epiphytic tank bromeliads on throughfall chemistry, soil chemistry, soil
   litter biomass, light, and seedling community structure. In the presence
   of epiphytic tank bromeliads, the throughfall nitrogen concentration
   increased twofold, the throughfall phosphorus concentration increased
   threefold, and the soil patches had a 3.96\% higher pH, a 50\% higher
   calcium concentration, and 11.88\% less light. By altering the
   availability of soil resources and conditions, the presence of
   bromeliads partially shifted the available niche spaces for plant
   species and indirectly affected the structure of the seedling
   communities, decreasing their diversity, density, and biomass. For the
   first time, we showed that the presence of tank bromeliads in the canopy
   can create characteristic soil patches in the understory, affecting the
   structure of seedling communities via fertilization. Our results reveal
   a novel local driver of environmental heterogeneity, reinforcing and
   expanding the key role of tank bromeliads both in nutrient cycling and
   plant community structuring of Neotropical coastal sandy forests.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {189},

Abstract = {Impact of agricultural activities on groundwater can be determined from
   the concentration of nutrients present in groundwater. This study was
   carried out with the aim to assess the minor ions content of groundwater
   and to identify its sources, spatial, and seasonal variations in a part
   of the Cauvery River basin, southern India. Groundwater samples were
   collected from July 2007 to September 2009 and were analyzed for minor
   ions. These ions were in the order of dominance of nitrate> phosphate>
   bromide> fluoride> ammonium= nitrite> lithium. The concentration of ions
   tends to increase towards the coast except for fluoride. Increased
   concentration of ions identified in shallow wells than in deep wells
   with an exception of few locations indicates the impact of human
   activities. Relatively high concentration of agriculture-sourced nitrate
   was identified which pose a threat to groundwater suitability for
   agriculture and domestic usage. Combined influence of use of
   agrochemicals, improper sewage disposal, aquaculture activities,
   seawater intrusion due to heavy pumping near the coast, and natural
   weathering of aquifer materials are the major sources. Also, fine grain
   sediments of this area aid in poor flushing of the ions towards the sea
   resulting in accumulation of higher concentration of ions. A sustainable
   management strategy is essential to control the concentration of these
   ions, especially nitrate. Reduced use of fertilizers, increasing the
   rainfall recharge for diluting the pollutants in groundwater and
   maintaining the river flow for sufficiently longer period to reduce
   dependence on groundwater for irrigation can help to improve the
   situation.},

Abstract = {Given the evidence from past experience, the coastal city of Hong Kong
   would be vulnerable to a variety of hazards that could be exacerbated by
   climatic change, including potential increases in typhoons, landslides,
   floods (both storm surges and rainstorms), and droughts, as well as the
   threat of future sea level rise. The greatest death tolls in the past
   have been inflicted during typhoon-induced storm surges. During two
   unnamed typhoons, in 1906 and 1937, the death tolls were 10,000 and
   11,000, respectively. In contrast, death tolls associated with
   landslides and other hazards were relatively small. Under a climatic
   change scenario of an increase in frequency and severity of typhoons and
   rainstorms, and rising sea level, the vulnerable areas of Hong Kong can
   be identified. The shift in development from hillslope areas to coastal
   land reclamations over the last 25 years is a matter of concern.
   Although the hillslopes are susceptible to landslides during rainstorms,
   virtually all landslides can be traced to some important anthropogenic
   causes and are preventable with appropriate measures. In the coming
   decades, the low-lying areas created through coastal land reclamations
   could be susceptible to flooding during storm surges and rainstorms and
   as the sea level rises. These areas are also where there is high density
   urban and industrial development, and the vulnerability is the greatest.
   High seawalls to protect the reclaimed areas from storm surge flooding
   and sea level rise may increase the risk of rainstorm flooding. To
   reduce vulnerability, a combination of better monitoring, planning,
   protection, maintenance, and warning is proposed for adaptation.
   Monitoring is needed not only to detect future sea level changes but
   also to identify areas with the greatest risk.},

Title = {Global Research Trends on Shale Gas from 2010-2020 Using a Bibliometric
   Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the last few decades, shale gas resources have attracted much global
   attention as potential sources for clean and affordable energy. Due to
   this fact, coupled with the increasing energy shortfall, shale gas has
   become an increasingly attractive energy prospect from both an
   environmental and economic perspective. This development has led to the
   rapid growth in the number of researchers and publications in the field
   of shale gas. Although there are few review articles on the state of
   research on shale gas, the literature lacked a bibliometric analysis.
   This study is intended to fill the research gap by carrying out a
   bibliometric analysis of 9247 shale gas articles that were published
   between 2010 and 2020. The Web of Science database was used to collect
   the data. The analysis was performed to identify the most productive
   authors, institutions, countries, and sources, and to visualize existing
   collaborations as well as provide valuable information which could form
   the basis for establishing future collaboration. The analysis results
   revealed that Li J has the highest number of publications on shale gas
   whereas Loucks RG is the most cited author. The top three countries with
   the highest number of publications in shale gas research are China, USA,
   and Canada, while the China University of Petroleum (Beijing), China
   University of Geosciences, and Southwest Petroleum University China were
   the three top institutions with the highest number of publications.
   Fuel, International Journal of Coal Geology, and Marine and Petroleum
   Geology are the journals with the highest number of published articles
   on shale gas. The keyword analysis indicated that shale gas, hydraulic
   fracturing, pore structure, permeability, adsorption, kinetics,
   pyrolysis, organic matter, thermal maturity, and numerical simulation
   are the predominant research topics. This showed the multi-dimensional
   and multi-faceted character of the shale gas field. Besides, it appeared
   to be an exciting topic for further study that is based on a detailed
   evaluation of the shale gas literature. In fact, shale gas, hydraulic
   fracturing (fracking), CO2 sequestration, kinetic, gas adsorption,
   diffusion, and simulation are becoming emerging research hotspots. The
   bibliometric analysis that was presented in this study has revealed
   valuable information about the most active institutions and countries,
   and the most influential authors in the field of shale gas which could
   form the basis for establishing future collaboration. Furthermore, it
   can help researchers to understand the global research trend in shale
   gas as well as provide references for establishing future research
   directions.},

Title = {Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on
   biogeochemical cycling},
Journal = {PHOTOCHEMICAL \& PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {286-300},
Abstract = {This report assesses research on the interactions of UV radiation
   (280-400 nm) and global climate change with global biogeochemical cycles
   at the Earth's surface. The effects of UV-B (280-315 nm), which ate
   dependent on the stratospheric ozone layer, on biogeochemical cycles are
   often linked to concurrent exposure to UV-A radiation (315-400 nm),
   which is influenced by global climate change. These interactions
   involving UV radiation (the combination of UV-B and UV-A) are central to
   the prediction and evaluation of future Earth environmental conditions.
   There is increasing evidence that elevated UV-B radiation has
   significant effects on the terrestrial biosphere with implications for
   the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and other elements. The cycling of
   carbon and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen can be affected by
   UV-B-mediated changes in communities of soil organisms, probably due to
   the effects of UV-B radiation on plant root exudation and/or the
   chemistry of dead plant material falling to the soil. In and
   environments direct photodegraclation can play a major role in the decay
   of plant litter, and UV-B radiation is responsible for a significant
   part of this photodegraclation. UV-B radiation strongly influences
   aquatic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and metals cycling that affect a wide
   range of life processes. UV-B radiation changes the biological
   availability of dissolved organic matter to microorganisms, and
   accelerates its transformation into dissolved inorganic carbon and
   nitrogen, including carbon dioxide and ammonium. The coloured part of
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the penetration of UV radiation
   into water bodies, but CDOM is also photodegraded by solar UV radiation.
   Changes in CDOM influence the penetration of UV radiation into water
   bodies with major consequences for aquatic biogeochemical processes.
   Changes in aquatic primary productivity and decomposition due to
   climate-related changes in circulation and nutrient supply occur
   concurrently with exposure to increased UV-B radiation, and have
   synergistic effects on the penetration of light into aquatic:
   ecosystems. Future changes in climate will enhance stratification of
   lakes and the ocean, which will intensify photodegradation of CDOM by UV
   radiation. The resultant increase in the transparency of water bodies
   may increase UV-B effects on aquatic biogeochemistry in the surface
   layer. Changing solar UV radiation and climate also interact to
   influence exchanges of trace gases, such as halocarbons (e.g., methyl
   bromide) which influence ozone depletion, and sulfur gases (e.g.,
   dimethylsulfide) that oxidize to produce sulfate aerosols that cool the
   marine atmosphere. UV radiation affects the biological availability of
   iron, copper and other trace metals in aquatic environments thus
   potentially affecting metal toxicity and the growth of phytoplankton and
   other microorganisms that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling.
   Future changes in ecosystem distribution due to alterations in the
   physical and chemical climate interact with ozone-modulated changes in
   UV-B radiation. These interactions between the effects of climate change
   and UV-B radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic,
   systems may partially offset the beneficial effects of an ozone
   recovery.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {337-347},

Abstract = {Whitings in the Bahamas have remained a sedimentological enigma for the
   last 80 years. Their formation has been prescribed to three major
   schools of thought: (a) resuspension of bottom sediment, (b) direct
   precipitation from bank water, and (c) biological mediation. This paper
   reports on field evidence to support the formation of two classes of
   whitings. The first class of whitings are those that have been reported
   in the literature extensively for the past 80 years. These whitings
   occur in deeper bank water (5-15 m) and are formed through the tidal
   oscillations of bank water through sediment-filled blue holes. The fish
   suspension model, hypothesized but not demonstrated for whiting
   occurrences out on the open banks, may apply to near-shore whiting
   events. Sediment-filled blue hole distributions have also been
   calculated for the Bahamian platforms and there should be more than
   2,500 sediment-filled blue holes on Great and Little Bahama Banks. This
   large number of sediment-filled blue holes on the Bahamian banks more
   than adequately accounts for the density of whitings and explains their
   point source nature and occurrence at the same locations through time.},

Volume = {106},
Number = {C10},

Abstract = {As a first step toward numerical modeling of global internal tides, we
   clarify the distribution of the M-2 internal tide in the Pacific Ocean
   using a three-dimensional primitive equation numerical model. The
   numerical simulation shows that energetic internal tides are generated
   over the bottom topographic features in the Indonesian Archipelago, the
   Solomon Archipelago, the Aleutian Archipelago, and the Tuamotu
   Archipelago, the continental shelf slope in the East China Sea, and the
   mid-oceanic ridges such as the Izu-Ogasawara Ridge, the Hawaiian Ridge,
   the Norfolk Ridge, the Kermadec Ridge, and the Macquarie Ridge. The
   calculated spatial patterns of the M-2 internal tide around the Hawaiian
   Ridge and the Izu-Ogasawara Ridge agree well with the TOPEX/ Poseidon
   altimetric observation. The conversion rate from the M-2 surface to
   internal tide energy integrated over the whole model domain amounts to
   338 GW (1 GW = 10(9) W), 84\% of which are found to be generated over
   the prominent topographic features mentioned above. Reflecting the
   spatial distribution of the prominent topographic features in the
   Pacific Ocean, the energy level of the M-2 internal tide in the western
   and central Pacific is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that in the
   eastern Pacific. This remarkable asymmetry shows that extensive
   microstructure measurements in the western and central Pacific are
   indispensable to determining the representative value of diapycnal
   mixing rates in the global ocean.},

Title = {Immune Responses to Influenza Virus and Its Correlation to Age and
   Inherited Factors},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae of enveloped
   viruses and are an important cause of respiratory infections worldwide.
   The influenza virus is able to infect a wide variety species as diverse
   as poultry, marine, pigs, horses, and humans. Upon infection with
   influenza virus the innate immunity plays a critical role in efficient
   and rapid control of viral infections as well as in adaptive immunity
   initiation. The humoral immune system produces antibodies against
   different influenza antigens, of which the HA-specific antibody is the
   most important for neutralization of the virus and thus prevention of
   illness. Cell mediated immunity including CD4(+) helper T cells and
   CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells are the other arms of adaptive immunity induced
   upon influenza virus infection. The complex inherited factors and age
   related changes are associated with the host immune responses. Here, we
   review the different components of immune responses against influenza
   virus. Additionally, the correlation of the immune response to age and
   inherited factors has been discussed. These determinations lead to a
   better understanding of the limitations of immune responses for
   developing improved vaccines to control influenza virus infection.},

Abstract = {Estuaries have the highest primary productivity of all ecosystems, yet
   the soils in estuarine environments have been largely overlooked in C
   sequestration studies. This research quantified organic C stored in the
   top 1 m of soils from the Taunton Bay estuary in Hancock County, Maine.
   Taunton Bay is centrally located within Maine's Island-Bay Coastal
   Complex, a physiographic region that encompasses 47\% of the state's
   coastline. Riverine inputs of sediments and sediment-associated organic
   matter to this and most Maine estuaries are quite low. These estuary
   soils form by incremental additions of reworked glaciofluvial marine
   sediments and estuarine organic matter to the soil surface. The organics
   are protected from decomposition by anaerobic conditions. As sea level
   rises, the estuary area increases by inundating and submerging the soils
   at its edges. The average concentration of soil organic C in the top 1 m
   of these estuary soils is 2.4\% and the average soil bulk density is
   0.67 g cm(-3). The organic C content is 136 Mg C ha(-1), which is
   greater than the C content in the top 1 m of Maine's upland soils. These
   results suggest that systematically quantifying and dating the C in
   estuarine soils will provide valuable data for use in regional and
   global C budgets and climate models.},

Abstract = {A native isolate of the colonial benthic diatom Staurosirella pinnata
   was cultivated for biosilica production. The silicified cell walls
   (frustules) were used as a source of homogeneous and structurally
   predictable porous biosilica for dye trapping and random laser
   applications. This was coupled with the extraction of lipids from
   biomass showing potential to fabricate photoactive composite materials
   sustainably. The strain was selected for its ease of growth in culture
   and harvesting. Biosilica and lipids were obtained at the end of growth
   in indoor photobioreactors. Frustules were structurally characterized
   microscopically and their chemistry analyzed with Fourier Transform
   Infrared Spectroscopy. Frustule capacity of binding laser dyes was
   evaluated on a set of frustules/Rhodamine B (Rho B) solutions and with
   respect to silicon dioxide and diatomite by Fluorescence Spectroscopy
   demonstrating a high affinity for the organic dye. The effect of dye
   trapping property in conveying Rho B emission to frustules, with
   enhancement of scattering events, was analyzed on Rho B doped
   polyacrylamide gels filled or not with frustules. Amplified spontaneous
   emission was recorded at increasing pump power indicating the onset of a
   random laser effect in frustule filled gels at lower power threshold
   compared to unfilled matrices.},

Abstract = {The results of oxygen and carbon stable isotope investigations of eight
   Eemian lacustrine sediments from Poland are presented. The values of
   delta O-18 changed from ca. -11 to -1 parts per thousand and delta C-13
   values oscillated between -3.5 and + 7.0 parts per thousand. The
   isotopic record correlated well with pollen, cladoceran, and diatom
   data. The evolution of the palaeolakes in Poland was reconstructed. The
   palaeolakes originated during the final phase of the Wartanian (Late
   Saalian) Glaciation. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of that time
   reflect the input of detrital carbonates into the basins. The boundary
   between the glaciation and the interglacial period is expressed by a
   significant decrease in delta O-18 and delta C-13 values. During the
   early Eemian, a positive trend in delta O-18 values confirms the gradual
   climatic changes. The Eemian optimum is characterized by constant delta
   O-18 and delta C-13 values. During the Early Vistulian (Weichselian)
   Glaciation, the palaeolake declined. The varying delta O-18 values
   likely reflect frequent changes in water balance between precipitation
   and evaporation associated with an influence of marine circulation. The
   fluctuations of the isotopic curves in the upper parts of the
   successions (the post-optimum) were caused by a shallowing of the basin
   by infilling with sediments. The observed shifts in the isotopic Curves
   are due to the proximity of the Baltic Sea and earlier strong oceanic
   influences. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Solar steam generation is a renewable, environmentally friendly and
   low-cost technology for seawater desalination and wastewater
   remediation. Highly efficient solar evaporation from pure water has been
   achieved using advanced artificial architectures and hydrophilic light
   absorption materials, while the long-term steady work for high salinity
   water desalination becomes a non-negligible problem when it comes to
   practical use. In terms of this issue, a hydrophobic MXene membrane,
   which contains a salt-blocking delaminated Ti3C2 nanosheet layer with
   trimethoxy(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl)silane modification for sunlight
   harvesting and a piece of commercial filter membrane for water supply,
   is proposed in this work. With high light utilization, high stability,
   abundant evaporating channels, rapid water transport through the filter
   membrane and salt-blocking on the MXene membrane, the as-fabricated
   self-floatable device achieves a solar evaporation rate of 1.31 kg m(-2)
   h(-1) and a solar steam conversion efficiency of 71\%, and stability
   under high salinity conditions under one sun over 200 hours, ensuring
   the highly efficient and long-term stable photothermal transduction for
   water purification from seawater and wastewater containing organic dyes
   and heavy metals. The hydrophobic surface enabled salt-blocking MXene
   membrane is proved to be an effective, efficient and stable photothermal
   material for solar desalination.},

Abstract = {The effects of soil drought on the leaf gas exchange variables of a
   stomatal conductance model are assessed in the case of woody plants,
   based on a meta-analysis of data sets available from the literature. For
   the first stage, 32 data sets obtained in well-watered conditions are
   analysed. For the second stage, we analyse four data sets including a
   soil drying cycle under present and doubled atmospheric CO2
   concentration (350 and 700 mumol mol(-1), respectively) for two tree
   species, maritime pine and sessile oak. Interesting relationships
   emerge, which suggest that woody plants may adopt one or two strategies
   when facing drought. A simple parameterisation of the effects of soil
   drought is proposed to account for the two types of drought responses
   which are: drought-avoiding (maritime pine) and drought-tolerant
   (sessile oak). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The toxicity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is closely related to their
   physico-chemical characteristics as well as the physico-chemical
   parameters of the media where CNTs are dispersed. In a climate change
   scenario, changes in seawater salinity are becoming a topic of concern
   particularly in estuarine and coastal areas. Nevertheless, to our
   knowledge no information is available on how salinity shifts may alter
   the sensitivity (in terms of biochemical responses) of bivalves when
   exposed to different CNTs. For this reason, a laboratory experiment was
   performed exposing the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum, one of the
   most dominant bivalves of the estuarine and coastal lagoon environments,
   for 28 days to unfunctionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube MWCNTs
   (Nf-MWCNTs) and carboxylated MWCNTs (f-MWCNTs), maintained at control
   salinity (28) and low salinity 21. Concentration dependent toxicity was
   demonstrated in individuals exposed to both MWCNT materials and under
   both salinities, generating alterations of energy reserves and
   metabolism, oxidative status and neurotoxicity compared to
   non-contaminated clams. Moreover, our results showed greater toxic
   impacts induced in clams exposed to f-MWCNTs compared to Nf-MWCNTs. In
   the present study it was also demonstrated how salinity shifts altered
   the toxicity of both MWCNT materials as well as the sensitivity of R.

Abstract = {India is a major emitter of mercury to the environment, mainly due to
   emissions from coal-fired power plants. Consumption of fish and rice,
   two important pathways for human exposure to mercury, is particularly
   high in South India. Here, we report concentrations of total mercury in
   hair (THghair) in 668 participants from South India. Three cities were
   covered: (i) a city on the east coast with four active coal-fired
   thermal power plants (Nellore), (ii) a city on the west coast with no
   major mercury source (Vasco da Gama), and (iii) a metropolitan city in
   the interior with no major mercury source (Hyderabad). Geometric mean of
   THghair of the entire study population is 0.14 mu g/g (95\% confidence
   interval, CI: 0.13-0.15 mu g/g). Significant predictor variables are
   age, fish consumption, and occupations such as dental studies,
   subsistence fishing, and artisanal goldsmithing (which is different from
   artisanal scale gold mining) Our results support the hypothesis that
   people living in a city with active coal-fired power plants may have
   higher THghair than those in cities with no major mercury source.},

Abstract = {An efficient methodology based on low temperature microwave-induced
   pyrolysis has been developed for syngas production from macroalgae. The
   protocol provided unprecedented hydrogen production, with switchable
   H-2/CO ratios depending on pyrolysis conditions which were found to
   remarkably improve conventional pyrolysis experiments even at
   significantly higher temperatures (400 vs. 800 degrees C). Arcing
   effects under microwave irradiation, which result in an interesting
   observed pseudo-catalytic effect promoted by the metal oxides contained
   in macroalgae, seem to account for the improved results.},

   Desalination using Low-Grade Heat},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development
   of sustainable desalination and zero-discharge processes because of its
   possibility of recovering 100\% water and the potential for integration
   with low-grade heat, such as solar energy. However, the conventional
   membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing
   its practical application. Here, ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes
   are reported by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top
   edges of a highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates
   short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The
   process avoids the challenging pore-generation and substrate-transfer
   processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the
   direct-contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair
   of 65/25 degrees C, the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average
   water flux of 421.7 L m(-2) h(-1) with over 99.8\% salt rejection, which
   is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes.
   The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed
   characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using
   water from the Red Sea heated under direct sunlight radiation show that
   the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 L m(-2) h(-1) from 8 am
   to 8 pm, showing a great potential for real applications in seawater
   desalination.},

Title = {Influences of fish on food web structure and function in mountain lakes},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1572-1583},

Abstract = {Introduction of new fish species to lakes that contain fish is known to
   disrupt food webs, but few studies have quantified the effects of
   introduced fish on flow of organic matter and mechanisms governing food
   web structure in historically fishless lakes. Contrasting flow of
   organic matter and food web structure in macroinvertebrate communities
   in lakes with and without fish provides an opportunity to characterise
   resiliency of macroinvertebrate food web function when there are changes
   in community composition and reductions in biomass. Organic matter flow
   and food web structure were characterised in six lakes with and six
   lakes without fish at high elevation in the southern Rocky Mountains of
   Colorado, U.S.A. Carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were used
   to determine the proportionate contribution of organic matter from
   primary organic matter sources (periphyton, phytoplankton, terrestrial
   plants) to consumers including herbivores and higher trophic levels.
   Contributions of organic matter sources to macroinvertebrates were
   combined with estimates of littoral macroinvertebrate production in
   quantifying the contribution of each primary source to total
   invertebrate production. Although introduced fish altered community
   composition, body size, and biomass, they did not alter contributions of
   the organic matter sources to production of macroinvertebrates. The
   dominant resources contributing to macroinvertebrate production were
   periphyton and phytoplankton, which combined contributed to 80\% of
   macroinvertebrate production. Despite occupying the highest trophic
   position (difference in delta N-15 relative to primary sources), fish
   did not alter trophic structure of littoral macroinvertebrate
   communities in maximum macroinvertebrate trophic position and community
   trophic position. Community trophic position weighted by production for
   macroinvertebrates was related to macroinvertebrate production per unit
   area but was independent of lake area. In lakes with fish, maximum
   macroinvertebrate trophic position was similar to that of lakes without
   fish because large predators (predaceous beetles and dragonflies) were
   replaced by small predators (tanypod chironomids). The present study
   indicates that macroinvertebrate food webs can exhibit resilience to
   introduced or invasive fish even when there are changes in community
   composition and biomass. This suggests that changes in structure (e.g.
   biomass, community composition) associated with introduced or invasive
   species do not necessarily equate to changes in food web function (e.g.
   flow of organic matter, maximum trophic position). Further, the present
   study suggests that although maximum trophic position has been shown to
   increase with lake size for lakes containing fish, the pattern is
   unlikely to extend to lakes without fish. The relationship between lake
   size and maximum trophic position for lakes containing fish may occur
   because fish have expandable niches associated with high motility and
   indeterminate growth, in contrast to macroinvertebrates.},

Abstract = {Notoscopelus resplendens is an abundant myctophid in the region of the
   Central-Eastern Atlantic. As with a majority of other myctophid species,
   this species performs vertical migration, playing a key role in the
   oceanic food web and in carbon sequestration. We examined the
   reproductive biology of N. resplendens based on 579 specimens caught
   between 1997 and 2002 off the Canary Islands. We found that the maximum
   standard length (SL) was lower than the size reported by other authors.
   The sex ratio was not different from 1:1. The average size at first
   maturity (L-50) was higher in females (60.34 mm SL) than in males (56.61
   mm SL). The gonadosomatic index (GSI) at 50\% sexual maturity in females
   was higher than that in males. The reproductive activity was observed
   from January to April, while from May onwards, the majority of fish
   caught were in the process of maturation. The macroscopic scale of
   maturation was validated through the histological analysis of the
   ovarian development. The batch fecundity was related to the standard
   length, with an average of 1068.69 +/- 369.84 eggs/spawn. These first
   data obtained for N. resplendens indicated that it is a batch spawner
   with asynchronous ovarian development.},

   Recovering Waste Heat Onboard an Offshore Service Vessel},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Recent regulatory developments in the global maritime industry have
   signalled an increased emphasis on the improvement of energy efficiency
   onboard ships. Among the various efficiency enhancement options,
   recovering waste heat using the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has been
   studied and identified as a promising one in many earlier studies. In
   this paper, a marine application of ORC for waste heat recovery will be
   discussed by performing the first law thermodynamic analysis based on
   the operating profile and machinery design data of an offshore service
   vessel (OSV) and defining four standard cycle configurations that
   include simple, recuperated, dual heat source, and with intermediate
   heating. The use of five hydrocarbon working fluids that are suitable
   for shipboard usage comprising cyclopentane, n-heptane, n-octane,
   methanol and ethanol are examined. The economic analysis found that
   annual fuel saving between 5\% and 9\% is possible and estimated a
   specific installation cost of \$5000-8000 USD /kW. Among the various
   options, the methanol ORC in a simple cycle configuration is found to
   have the shortest payback time relatively balancing between annual fuel
   saving and total module cost. Finally, the simple cycle ORC running on
   methanol is further examined using the second law entropy generation
   analysis and it is found that the heat exchangers in the system
   accounted for nearly 95\% of the overall entropy generation rate and
   further work is recommended to reduce this in the future.},

Abstract = {Organic matter is the dominant pool of reduced carbon in marine and
   freshwater systems. Mineralization of organic matter is largely
   attributed to complex and diverse microbial communities that mediate
   degradation and ultimately yield the terminal respiratory product,
   carbon dioxide (CO2). The factors that constrain the lability and
   degradation of organic matter remain unclear, but they involve a complex
   interplay between structural and chemical properties of the compounds,
   physical properties of the matrices, and the functional potential of the
   microorganisms that are present. To investigate these relationships, we
   developed a novel bioreactor system-called Isotopic Carbon
   Respirometer-Bioreactor (IsoCaRB)-that permits real-time monitoring of
   microbial CO2 production rates and collects sequential samples of this
   CO2 for off-line isotopic analyses (C-13, C-14). Application of this
   system to organic-rich sediments from Salt Pond, MA reveals that organic
   matter is oxidized both abiotically and microbially, and that the
   pattern of microbial respiration by the native sediment community is
   complex, accessing different carbon substrates over the course of
   incubation. Isotopic measurements show modern organic matter of
   progressively older ages (<= ca. 50 yr) is consumed, and this material
   has variable origins (salt marsh grasses, terrestrial, and marine
   organic matter). Collectively, the IsoCaRB system provides coupled
   insights into the sources, ages, and inherent biological and abiotic
   reactivity of natural organic matter.},

Abstract = {When Osborne and Burch {[}1] reported their observations of
   large-amplitude, long internal waves in the Andaman Sea that conform
   with theoretical results from the physics of nonlinear waves, a new
   research field on ocean waves was immediately set out. They described
   their findings in the frame of shallow-water solitary waves governed by
   the K-dV equation, which occur because of a balance between nonlinear
   cohesive and linear dispersive forces in a fluid. It was concluded that
   the internal waves in the Andaman Sea were solitons and that they
   evolved either from an initial waveform (over approximately constant
   water depth) or by a fission process (over variable water depth). Since
   then, there has been a great deal of progress in our understanding of
   Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs), or solitons in the ocean, particularly
   making use of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems. While
   two layer models such as those used by Osborne and Burch {[}1] allow for
   propagation of fundamental mode (i.e. mode-1) ISWs, continuous
   stratification permits the existence of higher mode internal waves. It
   happens that the Andaman Sea stratification is characterized by two (or
   more) maxima in the vertical profile of the buoyancy frequency N(z),
   i.e. a double pycnocline, hence prone to the existence of mode-2 (or
   higher) internal waves. In this paper we report solitary-like internal
   waves with mode-2 vertical structure co-existing with the large well
   know mode-1 solitons. The mode-2 waves are identified in satellite SAR
   images (e.g. TerraSAR-X, Envisat, etc.) because of their distinct
   surface signature. While the SAR image intensity of mode-1 waves is
   characterized by bright, enhanced backscatter preceding dark reduced
   backscatter along the nonlinear internal wave propagation direction (in
   agreement with Alpers, 1985 {[}2]), for mode-2 solitary wave structures,
   the polarity of the SAR signature is reversed and thus a dark reduced
   backscatter crest precedes a bright, enhanced backscatter feature in the
   propagation direction of the wave. The polarity of these mode-2
   signatures changes because the location of the surface convergent and
   divergent zones is reversed in relation to mode-1 ISWs. Mode-2 ISWs are
   identified in many locations of the Andaman Sea, but here we focus on
   ISWs along the Ten Degree Channel which occur along-side large mode-1
   ISWs. We discuss possible generation locations and mechanisms for both
   mode-1 and mode-2 ISWs along this stretch of the Andaman Sea, recurring
   to modeling of the ray pathways of internal tidal energy propagation,
   and the P.G. Baines {[}3] barotropic body force, which drives the
   generation of internal tides near the shallow water areas between the
   Andaman and Nicobar Islands. We consider three possible explanations for
   mode-2 solitary wave generation in the Andaman Sea: (1) impingement of
   an internal tidal beam on the pycnocline, itself emanating from critical
   bathymetry; (2) nonlinear disintegration of internal tide modes; (3) the
   lee wave forming mechanism to the west of a ridge during westward tidal
   flow out of the Andaman Sea (as originally proposed by Osborne and Burch
   for mode- 1 ISWs). SAR evidence is of critical importance for examining
   those generation mechanisms.},

Title = {Effects of mechanical fracturing and experimental trampling on Hawaiian
   corals},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {377-384},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In situ trampling occurred under experimental conditions to quantify the
   differences in the responses to anthropogenic trampling in four dominant
   species of Hawaiian corals, Porites compressa, Porites lobata, Montipora
   capitata, and Pocillopora meandrina. Trampling was simulated daily for a
   period of nine days at which time further breakage was minimal. Forty
   treatment colonies produced 559 fragments. Trampling was followed by an
   11-month recovery period.
   Coral colony and fragment mortality was low. All four species were
   highly tolerant of inflicted damage, suggesting that some species of
   corals can withstand limited pulse events that allow time for recovery.
   Growth rates following trampling were significantly lower in the
   treatment groups for three of the four species. This study demonstrated
   that very few trampling events can produce significant changes in growth
   even after a long recovery period.
   Survivorship of fragments is clearly size- and species-dependent in M.
   capitata and P. compressa. Smaller fragments (<5 cm) had higher
   mortality than larger fragments (>5 cm). High breakage rates for M.
   capitata and P. compressa are consistent with the nearshore, low-energy
   regions they inhabit-the same environment frequented by skin divers and
   waders.
   Mechanical tests were conducted to determine tensile and compressive
   strengths. Pocillopora meandrina exhibited the strongest skeletal
   strength, followed in decreasing order by Porites lobata, Porites
   compressa, and Montipora capitata. The skeletal strength obtained from
   the experiments correlate with the wave energy present in the
   environments in the regions they inhabit, suggesting that structural
   strength of corals is an adaptive response to hydraulic stress.},

Abstract = {Soil and litter organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were measured
   across a dune chronosequence on Sapelo Island, Georgia, U.S.A., to
   characterize ecosystem development and nutrient cycling during primary
   succession. As successional theory predicts, litter biomass and soil
   organic matter increased with dune age. The proportion of nutrients
   contained in the litter also increased with dune age. No litter was
   present in the grass-dominated foredunes, whereas in the forested dunes
   litter accounted for 37\%, 17\%, and 0.11\% of the ecosystem (soil plus
   litter) C, N, and P, respectively. Soil C and N pools increased from the
   foredunes to older dune classes. Surface soil (0-10 cm) plant-available
   N (NH4+, NO3-) increased from the foredunes to middunes, whereas soil P
   showed little change with dune age. Nitrogen was highly limiting across
   the chronosequence. Total soil N ranged from 0.006\% (per gram of dry
   soil) in the foredunes to 0.087\% in the middune. Soil N : P was less
   than 1.3 across all sites, also suggesting N limitation of plant
   productivity. Plant-available NO3- and total N concentrations in soil
   and ecosystem (litter plus soil) pools were greater in the middunes,
   where the N-fixing shrub Morella cerifera was present, than in either
   the foredunes or forested dunes. Our results suggest that the
   development of dune nutrient cycles is controlled by both successional
   age and colonization by N-fixing species.},

   inter-departmental cooperation leading to a coherent strategy.
   Furthermore, building on the results of the inclusive process - the
   Local Agenda 21 (LA21) approach the Plan was developed based on four
   strategic themes, with more than 220 actions implemented. An economic
   study was carried out to analyse the cost of the Local Action Plan, and
   research was conducted to develop future reduction scenarios, to
   consider the potential impact of different climate protection actions.
   The integration of the Local Agenda 21 process and climate protection

Abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the potential for impacts of ocean
   acidification on North Atlantic deep-sea ecosystems in response to IPCC
   AR5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Deep-sea biota is
   likely highly vulnerable to changes in seawater chemistry and sensitive
   to moderate excursions in pH. Here we show, from seven fully coupled
   Earth system models, that for three out of four RCPs over 17\% of the
   seafloor area below 500m depth in the North Atlantic sector will
   experience pH reductions exceeding -0.2 units by 2100. Increased
   stratification in response to climate change partially alleviates the
   impact of ocean acidification on deep benthic environments. We report on
   major pH reductions over the deep North Atlantic seafloor (depth >500 m)
   and at important deep-sea features, such as seamounts and canyons. By
   2100, and under the high CO2 scenario RCP8.5, pH reductions exceeding
   -0.2 (-0.3) units are projected in close to 23\% (similar to 15 \%) of
   North Atlantic deep-sea canyons and similar to 8\% (3 \%) of seamounts -
   including seamounts proposed as sites of marine protected areas. The
   spatial pattern of impacts reflects the depth of the pH perturbation and
   does not scale linearly with atmospheric CO2 concentration. Impacts may
   cause negative changes of the same magnitude or exceeding the current
   target of 10\% of preservation of marine biomes set by the convention on
   biological diversity, implying that ocean acidification may offset
   benefits from conservation/management strategies relying on the
   regulation of resource exploitation.},

Title = {A 100\% wind, water, sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy plan for
   Washington State},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {75-88},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study analyzes the potential and consequences of Washington State's
   use of wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) to produce electricity and
   electrolytic hydrogen for 100\% of its all-purposes energy (electricity,
   transportation, heating/cooling, industry) by 2050, with 80-85\%
   conversion by 2030. Electrification plus modest efficiency measures can
   reduce Washington State's 2050 end-use power demand by similar to
   39.9\%, with similar to 80\% of the reduction due to electrification,
   and can stabilize energy prices since WWS fuel costs are zero. The
   remaining demand can be met, in one scenario, with similar to 35\%
   onshore wind, similar to 13\% offshore wind, similar to 10.73\%
   utility-scale PV, similar to 2.9\% residential PV, similar to 1.5\%
   commercial/government PV, similar to 0.65\% geothermal, similar to 0.5\%
   wave, similar to 0.3\% tidal, and similar to 35.42\% hydropower.
   Converting will require only 0.08\% of the state's land for new
   footprint and similar to 2\% for spacing between new wind turbines
   (spacing that can be used for multiple purposes). It will further result
   in each person in the state saving similar to\$85/yr in direct energy
   costs and similar to\$950/yr in health costs {[}eliminating similar to
   830 (190-1950)/yr statewide premature air pollution mortalities] while
   reducing global climate costs by similar to\$4200/person/yr (all in 2013
   dollars). Converting will therefore improve health and climate while
   reducing costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Processes involved in calcite and aragonite precipitation during
   carbonate chimney formation on Conical Seamount, Mariana Forearc:
   Evidence from geochemistry and carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {55-64},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Samples were collected from two carbonate chimneys on the summit of
   Conical Seamount, a serpentine diapir in the Mariana Forearc, by
   JAMSTECs Shinkai 6500 submersible. The chimneys are composed of calcite,
   aragonite and an amorphous phase. The calcite and aragonite were
   precipitated under conditions of carbonate saturation, but the processes
   are complex in detail. Stained thin sections from samples of both
   chimneys demonstrate that the aragonite formed during the initial stage
   of growth, mainly in the presence of seawater with relatively high
   concentrations of Mg, while the calcite formed later in fractures in the
   aragonite framework, where rising vent fluids effectively diluted any
   seawater present, thus reducing the amount of Mg available during
   carbonate growth. A staining technique was used to differentiate between
   calcite and aragonite prior to analysis of various isotopes (delta C-13,
   delta O-18, Delta C-14, and Sr-87/Sr-86) in each mineral, which provide
   clues to the processes involved in their formation. Radiocarbon
   activities (Delta C-14) and strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) are
   significantly different between the aragonite and calcite. These results
   suggest that the calcite and aragonite were precipitated at different
   stages in the formation of the chimney. Since the Delta C-14 in each
   mineral is strongly depleted compared with ambient seawater, both
   calcite and aragonite precipitation must have been affected by vent
   fluids (cold seepage) that contained ``dead carbon{''} derived from the
   serpentinization that is taking place under Conical Seamount. These
   isotopic analyses (Delta C-14 and Sr-87/Sr-86) enabled us to estimate
   the amount of mixing of ambient seawater and vent fluids during
   precipitation of the calcite and aragonite. However, the calculated
   amounts of mixing for aragonite precipitation are not in good agreement,
   and this is probably due to the low concentrations of Sr in the vent
   fluid. The low abundance of Sr within the vent fluid suggests that the
   amount of mixing calculated with Delta C-14 provides a better indication
   of the true mixing ratios of seawater to cold seepage during calcite and
   aragonite precipitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Vertical Fine-Scale Distribution of Calanus sinicus in the Yellow Sea
   Cold Water Mass During the Over-Summering Process},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Calanus sinicus, a temperate copepod with a lethal temperature >27
   degrees C, is one of the key species in Chinese coastal marine
   ecosystems. The C. sinicus population increases in spring and declines
   in early summer annually due to increasing water temperature. Numerous
   C. sinicus individuals then congregate in the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass
   (YSCWM) and remain under the thermocline from early summer to early
   autumn. Development and reproduction is halted in this cold and foodless
   bottom water and they avoid ascending to the hot surface water, which is
   regarded as an over-summering strategy. Based on discrete water sampling
   approaches, previous studies demonstrated that higher chlorophyll a (Chl
   a) levels appeared in the mixed hot surface water layer; however, the
   subsurface chlorophyll a maximum layer (SCML) has seldom been described.
   In the present study, various probes and a visual plankton recorder
   (VPR) were used to determine the fine vertical distributions of
   environmental factors and C. sinicus. VPR observations showed the
   ecological responses in fine scale and indicated that few C. sinicus
   individuals ascend at night, the main population preferred to remain
   below the SCML all day long. The results demonstrated that a constant
   thin SCML existed in the YSCWM area, and that the SCML location
   coincided with or was beneath the thermocline and halocline layers,
   where the temperature was suitable for C. sinicus. The relationship
   between abundance and Chl a, showed the diel vertical migration trend of
   C. sinicus to feed at night in the YSCWM area. In addition to
   temperature as a main influencing factor, dissolved oxygen
   concentrations and column depth were also influencing factors.
   Therefore, in addition to avoiding high surface temperature, energy
   supplement may be an important driving force confining the diel vertical
   migration of C. sinicus in the Yellow Sea in summer.},

Abstract = {Temperate Australia has a speciose highly endemic algal flora. This
   study explored the influence of geographical isolation between islands,
   depth and exposure to ocean swells on the diversity of macroalgae in the
   Recherche Archipelago (Western Australia). Macroalgae were harvested
   (0.25-m(2) quadrats) from sites at two exposures (sheltered and exposed
   to wave energy), three depths (< 10, 10-20, and 21-28m), and two island
   groups (three islands within Esperance Bay and three islands outside the
   bay). A total of 220 species were collected. Species richness and
   biomass were significantly different at the smallest spatial scale (0.25
   m(2)), and density of overstory species decreased with depth. Results
   from analysis of similarity tests suggested that macroalgal assemblages
   differed with depth, exposure and to a lesser extent with island group.
   Assemblage differences were often associated with particular overstory
   or understory taxa and not the entire assemblage composition. Average
   species richness (.) 0.25 m(-2) ranged from 13 to 29 species, typically
   with a few species contributing more than 50\% of average biomass.
   Species richness was maintained by species turnover at the 0.25-m(2)
   spatial scale. Our results suggest that richness in temperate Australia
   is maintained by turnover of broadly distributed species. More dominant
   species in assemblages were associated with differences in depth and
   exposure to ocean swells. Our findings support the hypothesis of a
   geographical transition of dominant species from kelp-dominated in the
   west to a fucalean-dominated assemblage in the Recherche Archipelago and
   east of the Great Australian Bight.},

Title = {Population substructure and space use of Foxe Basin polar bears},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {14},
Pages = {2851-2864},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change has been identified as a major driver of habitat change,
   particularly for sea ice-dependent species such as the polar bear (Ursus
   maritimus). Population structure and space use of polar bears have been
   challenging to quantify because of their circumpolar distribution and
   tendency to range over large areas. Knowledge of movement patterns, home
   range, and habitat is needed for conservation and management. This is
   the first study to examine the spatial ecology of polar bears in the
   Foxe Basin management unit of Nunavut, Canada. Foxe Basin is in the
   mid-Arctic, part of the seasonal sea ice ecoregion and it is being
   negatively affected by climate change. Our objectives were to examine
   intrapopulation spatial structure, to determine movement patterns, and
   to consider how polar bear movements may respond to changing sea ice
   habitat conditions. Hierarchical and fuzzy cluster analyses were used to
   assess intrapopulation spatial structure of geographic position system
   satellite-collared female polar bears. Seasonal and annual movement
   metrics (home range, movement rates, time on ice) and home-range
   fidelity (static and dynamic overlap) were compared to examine the
   influence of regional sea ice on movements. The polar bears were
   distributed in three spatial clusters, and there were differences in the
   movement metrics between clusters that may reflect sea ice habitat
   conditions. Within the clusters, bears moved independently of each
   other. Annual and seasonal home-range fidelity was observed, and the
   bears used two movement patterns: on-ice range residency and annual
   migration. We predict that home-range fidelity may decline as the

Title = {Role of reaction resistance in limiting carbon monoxide uptake in rabbit

Abstract = {The contribution of reaction resistance to overall resistance to
   pulmonary carbon monoxide (CO) uptake {[}DLCO(Theta(CO).Vc), where DLCO
   is lung CO diffusing capacity, Theta(CO) is CO uptake conductance of
   erythrocytes, and Vc is pulmonary capillary blood volume] was determined
   in 10 anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated rabbits. On
   the basis of the classical double-reciprocal equation off. G. W.
   Roughton and R. E. Forster (J. Appl. Physiol. 11: 290-302, 1957),
   DLCO/(Theta(CO).Vc) was obtained by solving the relation
   DLCO/(Theta(CO).Vc) = 1 - 2/(DLNO/ DLCO), where DLNO/DLCO represents the
   ratio between the respective single-breath diffusing capacities (DL) of
   nitric oxide (NO) and CO pulmonary capillary blood. The lungs of eight
   rabbits were inflated, starting from residual volume, by using 55 ml of
   indicator gas mixture (0.2\% CO and 0.05\% NO in nitrogen). DL values
   were calculated by taking the end-tidal partial pressures of CO and NO
   as analyzed by using a respiratory mass spectrometer. The overall value
   was DLCO/ (Theta(CO).Vc) = 0.4 +/- 0.025 (mean +/- SD). Because of the
   use of O-2-free indicator gas mixtures, the end-tidal O-2 partial
   pressures were similar to 21 Torr. In one other rabbit, the application
   of 0.2\% CO and 0.001\% NO yielded DLCO/(Theta(CO).Vc) = 0.39; in the
   tenth rabbit, however, inspiratory volume was varied, and an identical
   value was found at functional residual capacity. We conclude that the
   contribution of reaction resistance to overall resistance to pulmonary
   CO uptake is independent of the inspiratory NO concentration used,
   including, with respect to the pertinent literature, the conclusion that
   in rabbits, dogs, and humans this contribution amounts to 40\% when
   determined at functional residual capacity.},

Title = {Trace metals and organic carbon in sediments of the northeastern Chukchi
   Sea},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {18-31},

Abstract = {Concentrations of Al, Fe and selected trace metals (As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cr,
   Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, V, Zn) in surface sediments from the
   northeastern Chukchi Sea (NECS) varied considerably as a function of
   sediment texture (i.e., grain size); however, essentially all metals,
   when normalized to Al, were present at natural, background values. Total
   organic carbon content ranged from 0.06-1.56\% with a marine origin for
   at least two-thirds of the organic matter at each station based on delta
   C-13 values and C/N ratios. Recent sedimentation rates from Cs-137 and
   Pb-210 dating were 0.03-0.14 cm yr-1. Corresponding vertical
   distributions for most metals in age-dated sediment cores showed >
   100-yr records of uniform metal/AI ratios, including Pb and Hg.
   Concentrations of As, Mn and Cd were modified in surface sediments at a
   few stations by early chemical diagenesis. Surveys around two
   exploratory oil and gas drilling sites that were occupied in 1989 showed
   that Ba concentrations were as high as 10,000 mu g g(-1) within 200 m of
   one drilling site relative to background values of similar to 700 mu g
   g(-1). Barium enrichment was from barite, a drilling mud additive that
   was discharged to the seafloor. Above background concentrations of Cu,
   Hg, Pb and Zn also were found in sediments from 3-4 stations within 200
   m of the two drilling sites. At present, sediments in the NECS are
   essentially pristine with respect to trace metals of anthropogenic
   origin, excluding small areas around drilling sites. These data should
   be of value for detecting and tracking future chemical changes in the
   sediments of the NECS, particularly in light of planned oil and gas
   exploration and production as well as environmental changes that may be
   associated with climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) is widespread compound in the aquatic and
   terrestrial environment, and used mainly as an ingredient in cement in
   the construction industry. Innovative `natural cement' has been proposed
   as a green building material for use in many applications. Chemical
   cement has contains chemicals with environmentally detrimental effects,
   such as acids and sulphates. Thus, microbial Induced Calcite
   Precipitation (MICP) using urea hydrolysis applications has emerged as a
   promising process, due to its low cost, high quality, energy saving
   benefits, and environmentally protective properties. However, the
   limited understanding and low number of ureolytic bacterial strains
   impedes application. Therefore, this study examines several aspects of
   urease, employing ureolytic bacteria isolated from coastal soil from
   different locations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Characterisation of the
   isolates, is described by growth pattern and next-generation sequencing
   of 16S rDNA. Ureolytic strains isolated are Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus
   sp., Brevibacillus sp, and Micrococcus luteus 2030. These strains show
   fundamentally different abilities for producing urease with rapid
   increases in pH. In this study, additional environmental bacteria were
   screened for their ability to produce urease, which is employed for
   (MICP) and provides further knowledge on the role of bacterial strains
   and their applications in the environmental fields.},

Title = {Tracking annual changes of coastal tidal flats in China during 1986-2016

Abstract = {Tidal flats (non-vegetated area), along with coastal vegetation area,
   constitute the coastal wetlands (intertidal zone) between high and low
   water lines, and play an important role in wildlife, biodiversity and
   biogeochemical cycles. However, accurate annual maps of coastal tidal
   flats over the last few decades are unavailable and their
   spatio-temporal changes in China are unknown. In this study, we analyzed
   all the available Landsat TM/ETM +/OLI imagery (-44,528 images) using
   the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and a robust
   decision tree algorithm to generate annual frequency maps of open
   surface water body and vegetation to produce annual maps of coastal
   tidal flats in eastern China from 1986 to 2016 at 30-m spatial
   resolution. The resulting map of coastal tidal flats in 2016 was
   evaluated using very high-resolution images available in Google Earth.
   The total area of coastal tidal flats in China in 2016 was about 731,170
   ha, mostly distributed in the provinces around Yellow River Delta and
   Pearl River Delta. The interannual dynamics of coastal tidal flats area
   in China over the last three decades can be divided into three periods:
   a stable period during 1986-1992, an increasing period during 1993-2001
   and a decreasing period during 2002-2016. The resulting annual coastal
   tidal flats maps could be used to support sustainable coastal zone
   management policies that preserve coastal ecosystem services and
   biodiversity in China.},

Title = {Photovoltaic-grid hybrid power fed pump drive operation for curbing the
   intermittency in PV power generation with grid side limited power
   conditioning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {82},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Existing pump drive systems are fed from the grid. In case grid fails,
   it takes time to restart the pump drive, and unnecessarily power is
   wasted in restarting. Moreover, to reduce the burden on the grid and
   also to curb the intermittency a hybrid configuration is proposed in
   which PV system is integrated with grid to cater the pump load
   operation. Even if the grid fails, the PV system works in islanded mode
   to cater the pump load at the permissible limit depending on the
   generation by PV system alone in the absence of storage systems. To
   establish a bidirectional power flow a voltage source converter (VSC)
   based grid coupling is considered which also provide limited power
   conditioning to utilize the capacity of VSC at maximum to solve Grid
   power quality issues like unbalance current, harmonics, etc. The
   synchronous reference frame (SRF) method is used for current
   decomposition for determining the limited compensation to be provided by
   the grid coupled VSC, based on its unutilized capacity. MATLAB based
   simulation and experimental results show the efficient working of hybrid
   configuration in both grid connected mode and islanded mode with limited
   power conditioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The underlying philosophy of pressure retarded osmosis (PRO)-reverse
   osmosis (RO) hybrid technology is the assumption of the availability of
   `fresh' water for the purpose, which gets severely affected once the
   fresh-water streams undergo seasonal salinity variations. In the present
   article, the authors have tried to understand the overall feasibility of
   PRO-RO combination in such estuarine systems with appreciable variation
   of seasonal salinity. The article first discusses the feasibility of
   pretreating the feed of PRO using RO and later understanding the
   feasibility of PRO as supplemental technology to existing RO units. It
   was found that pretreating the PRO feed in such estuarine systems was
   energetically infeasible. However, PRO as supporting technology was
   found to produce energy of around 0.0994 kWh for 50\% recovery. It was
   also concluded that with a fraction of RO permeate used for PRO, energy
   savings increase for estuarine systems with seasonal salinity
   variations.},

Abstract = {Saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico is one important factor in
   the destruction of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) swamps
   along the Louisiana Gulf Coast, USA. Recent restoration efforts have
   focused on identification of baldcypress genotypes with greater
   tolerance to saline conditions than previously reported. To date, salt
   tolerance investigations have not been conducted under saline field
   conditions. In 1996, therefore, three plantations mere established with
   10 half-sib genotype collections of baldcypress in mesohaline wetlands.
   Tree survival and growth were measured at the end of two growing
   seasons, and foliar ion concentrations of Na, Cl, K, and Ca and
   available soil nutrients were measured during the 1996 growing season.
   In general, soil nutrient concentrations exceeded averages found in
   other baldcypress stands in the southeastern United States. Seedlings
   differed among sites in all parameters measured, with height, diameter,
   foliar biomass, and survival decreasing as site salinity increased.
   Average seedling height at the end of two years, for example, was 196.4
   cm on the lowest salinity site and 121.6 cm on the highest. Several
   half-sib families maintained greater height growth increments (ranging
   from 25.5 to 54.5 cm on the highest salinity site), as well as lower
   foliar ion concentrations of K, Cl, and Ca. Results indicate that
   genotypic screening of baldcypress may improve growth and vigor of
   seedlings planted within wetlands impacted by saltwater intrusion.},

Abstract = {Assessing future changes in the suitability of the climate niche for
   interacting species across different trophic levels can identify direct
   and indirect effects of climate change that may be missed using
   single-species approaches. We use ensembles of species distribution
   models based on a dynamically down-scaled regional climate model to
   project the future suitability of climate for the Swift Parrot (Lathamus
   discolor), its primary food and habitat resources (Tasmanian Blue Gum
   (Eucalyptus globulus) and Swamp Gum (E. ovata)), and an introduced nest
   predator, the Sugar Glider (Petaurus breviceps). These results are
   combined with layers representing mature forest and fire danger to
   identify locations that may act as refuges for the Swift Parrot from
   fire, deforestation and predation under baseline and future climates.
   Almost a quarter of the nesting habitat of Swift Parrots is projected to
   become climatically unsuitable by the end of the 21st century, but large
   areas may remain climatically suitable for both Swift Parrots and their
   food trees. However, loss of forests and the presence of Sugar Gliders
   are likely to limit the availability of high-quality habitat. Offshore
   islands that the Sugar Glider is unable to colonise or where future
   climate is not projected to be suitable for the Sugar Glider may be the
   only places, in the near future, where the Swift Parrot will be
   protected from nest predation by this introduced species.},

Abstract = {In March and April 2010, we investigated the development of young
   landfast sea ice in Kongsfjorden, Spitsbergen, Svalbard. We sampled the
   vertical column, including sea ice, brine, frost flowers and sea water,
   to determine the CO2 system, nutrients, salinity and bacterial and ice
   algae production during a 13 day interval of ice growth. Apart from the
   changes due to salinity and brine rejection, the sea-ice concentrations
   of total inorganic carbon (C-T), total alkalinity (A(T)), CO2 and
   carbonate ions (CO32-) in melted ice were influenced by dissolution of
   calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitates (25-55 mu mol kg(-1)) and played
   the largest role in the changes to the CO2 system. The C-T values were
   also influenced by CO2 gas flux, bacterial carbon production and primary
   production, which had a small impact on the C-T. The only exception was
   the uppermost ice layer. In the top 0.05 m of the ice, there was a CO2
   loss of similar to 20 mu mol kg(-1) melted ice (1 mmol m(-2)) from the
   ice to the atmosphere. Frost flowers on newly formed sea ice were
   important in promoting ice-air CO2 gas flux, causing a CO2 loss to the
   atmosphere of 140-800 mu mol kg(-1) d(-1) melted frost flowers (7-40
   mmol m(-2)d(-1)).},

Abstract = {King George Island, situated in the South Shetland Islands archipelago,
   is one of the most visited sites in Antarctica. Antarctica attracts much
   attention because it is one of the most sensitive areas under the
   influence of global warming. To understand its hydrochemistry
   characteristics, we collected various types of water samples, including
   samples from streams, meltwaters, ground waters, snow and ice from
   around the Great Wall Station, Fildes Peninsula, King George Island,
   from January to February, 2015. Major ions, alkalinities, silicate, pH,
   dissolved oxygen, temperature, and electric conductivities were
   measured. Several approaches were applied to identify processes that
   affect the hydrochemistry on Fildes Peninsula, including ternary
   diagrams, principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Our data
   suggest that atmospheric seasalt deposition is the main factor
   controlling the hydrochemistry on Fildes Peninsula. After atmospheric
   influences were corrected for seasalt, we defined the weathering of
   local rocks to be another important factor on the Peninsula's
   hydrochemistry. Processes such as Ca dissolution from the Ca-bearing
   basalt, Si loss through secondary mineralization and biological uptake
   influence the chemical composition of runoffs on the peninsula. Cluster
   analysis identified 4 groups of streams based on their hydrochemical
   features, which reflect their original weathering characters under
   icecap and the combined effects with melt snow, biological activity and
   the anthropogenic input.},

Title = {Coextirpation of host-affiliate relationships in rivers: the role of

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {The role of climate-related disturbances on complex host-affiliate
   relationships remains understudied, largely because affiliate species
   vary in host use and are often differentially susceptible to disturbance
   relative to their hosts. Here we report the first set of host-affiliate
   species-discharge relationships (SDR) in freshwater and examine how
   anticipated shifts in water availability (flow) will impact
   coextirpations. We used SDR for freshwater mussels and fish across 11
   regions (over 350 rivers) in the continental United States that we
   coupled to future water availability (2070) to model mussel and fish
   coextirpations. We also used river-specific host-affiliate matrices
   (presence-absence) to evaluate how host-specificity (mean number of
   hosts used by an affiliate) and host-overlap (extent to which affiliates
   share hosts) relate to extirpation vulnerability. We found that the
   strength and predictability of SDR models vary geographically and that
   mussels were more susceptible to flow alterations than fish. These
   patterns of extirpations were strongest in the southeast where: (1) flow
   reductions are expected to be greatest; (2) more species are lost per
   unit flow; (3) and more mussels are expected to be lost per unit of
   fish. We also found that overall mussel losses associated with reduction
   in habitat (water availability) were greater than those associated with
   loss of fish hosts which we assumed to be a function of host redundancy.
   These findings highlight the utility of SDR as a tool for conservation
   efforts but they also demonstrate the potential severity of reductions
   in mussel and fish richness as consequence of climate change and water
   use. Mussels provide key ecosystem services but face multiple pronged
   attacks from reductions in flow, habitat, and fish hosts. These losses
   in biodiversity and ecosystem functions can translate into major effects
   on food webs and nutrient recycling.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The mangrove ecosystems are known to efficiently sequester trace metals
   both in sediments and plant biomass. However, less is known about the
   chemistry of rare earth elements (REE) in the coastal environments,
   especially in the world's largest mangrove province, the Sundarban.
   Here, the concentration of REE in the sediment and plant organs of eight
   dominant mangrove species (mainly Avicennia sp.) in the Indian Sundarban
   was measured to assess REE sources, distribution, and bioaccumulation
   state. Results revealed that light REE (LREE) were more concentrated
   than the heavy REE (HREE) (128-144 mg kg(-1) and 12-15 mg kg(-1),
   respectively) in the mangrove sediments, with a relatively weak positive
   europium anomaly (Eu/Eu{*} = 1.03-1.14) with respect to North American
   shale composite. The primary source of REE was most likely linked to
   aluminosilicate weathering of crustal materials, and the resultant
   increase in LREE in the detritus. Vertical distribution of REE in one of
   the long cores from Lothian Island was altered by mangrove root activity
   and dependent on various physicochemical properties in the sediment
   (e.g., Eh, pH, organic carbon, and phosphate). REE uptake by plants was
   higher in the below-ground parts than in the above-ground plant tissues
   (root = 3.3 mg kg(-1), leaf + wood = 1.7 mg kg(-1)); however, their
   total concentration was much lower than in the sediment (149.5 mg
   kg(-1)). Species-specific variability in bioaccumulation factor and
   translocation factor was observed indicating different REE partitioning
   and varying degree of mangrove uptake efficiency. Total REE stock in
   plant (above + live below ground) was estimated to be 168 g ha(-1) with
   LREE contributing similar to 90\% of the stock. This study highlighted
   the efficiency of using REE as a biological proxy in determining the
   degree of bioaccumulation within the mangrove environment.},

Abstract = {Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, is one of the most popular
   freshwater aquaculture species in developing countries. Although
   formulated feed provides higher fish yield, it is expensive. Therefore,
   fertilizer-based fish culture using natural food sources is generally
   implemented in developing countries. The aim of this study was to
   identify the major natural foods contributing to tilapia growth in
   fertilizer-based fish ponds. The stomach contents of tilapia in a
   fertilizer-based fish pond in Lao PDR were analyzed to estimate their
   feeding behaviors; stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in the
   potential food organisms and suspended solids were measured and compared
   with the ratios in the fish muscle tissues. Further, the feed efficiency
   of chironomid larvae was compared with that of chlorella and formulated
   feed in a laboratory feeding experiment. Consequently, chironomid larvae
   were identified as the main contributors to tilapia growth in the
   fertilizer-based fish pond. In conclusion, benthic larvae of insects
   belonging to the family Chironomidae are confirmed to be a natural food
   source for tilapia in the fertilizer-based fish pond.},

   Stable Seawater Electrolysis Promoted by Phosphate Intercalation},
Journal = {SMALL},

Abstract = {Sustainable production of hydrogen from seawater electrolysis has
   attracted much attention in recent years. Considering that Cl- might
   corrode metal substrate by crossing through the covered catalyst, the
   conventional Ni(II)Fe(III)-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) loaded on
   metal substrate, as a favorable oxygen evolution catalyst, cannot be
   directly used for seawater electrolysis. Herein, an anti-corrosion
   strategy of PO43- intercalation in NiFe-LDH is proposed, in which the
   highly negatively charged PO43- in the interlayers can prevent the Ni
   substrate from Cl- corrosion by electrostatic repulsion. In order to
   verify the anti-corrosion effect, the two electrodes of the pristine
   NiFe-LDH and the PO43- intercalated NiFe-LDH are evaluated in a solution
   with high Cl- concentration. PO43- can effectively hinder the migration
   of Cl- between the interlayers of NiFe-LDH, thus the corrosion life of
   the PO43- intercalated NiFe-LDH is more than 100 times longer than that
   of the pristine NiFe-LDH. The improvement of stability is attributed to
   the inhibition effect of Cl- passing through the interlayers of
   NiFe-LDH, leading to the protection of Ni substrate. This work provides
   a design strategy for the catalysts loaded on the metal substrate, which
   has excellent Cl--corrosion resistance and can be widely used in
   hydrogen generation from seawater electrolysis.},

Abstract = {Metazoan meiofauna was sampled along a temperate latitude transect
   (41-47 degrees S 178 degrees 30'E) across the Chatham Rise, south-west
   Pacific, from water depths of 350-2600 m on three occasions (austral
   autumn 1997, spring 1997, summer 2000). Samples were collected using a
   multicorer and extracted on a 63-mu m mesh. Meiofaunal density and
   biomass were negatively correlated with water depth, median grain-size
   and sediment calcium carbonate content, and positively correlated with
   sediment chlorophyll a. There were no significant relationships between
   meiofaunal abundance and biomass and measures of sediment organic matter
   and bacterial productivity and biomass, except in summer when bacterial
   and meiofaunal biomass were positively correlated. Vertical penetration
   of meiofauna into the sediment was related to sediment organic matter
   and sediment chloroplastic pigments. Variation in meiofaunal abundance
   at different spatial scales was examined at two sites: at 450 and 2300 m
   on the northern slope of the rise. At both sites, variation between
   subcores of a multicore (<10-cm scale) was lower than that of multicores
   within a deployment (<1-m scale). However, whilst the highest variance
   component at the shallow site was for multicores within a deployment, it
   was between multicore deployments (<1-km scale) for the deep site.
   Meiofaunal density and biomass were generally higher on the southern
   slope of the rise than on the northern slope, a trend probably
   attributable to high productivity of the overlying Subtropical Front and
   the flux of more nutritious organic material to the sea floor. (C) 2005

Title = {Energy Conservation Optimization and Numerical Simulation of Urban Green
   Space Landscape Pattern},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {In order to alleviate the urban heat island effect, absorb harmful
   gases, reduce temperature, and increase humidity, a method of energy
   conservation optimization and numerical simulation of urban green space
   landscape pattern is proposed. Based on the theory of landscape ecology,
   green wedge, green belt, green road, park, and other types of green
   space with different ecological functions are designed in Shenyang, and
   an optimization scheme of urban green space network spatial structure of
   ``four belts, three rings, seven wedges, and network connection{''} is
   formed. Combined with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information
   system (GIS) spatial analysis technology, the atmospheric environment
   effect under the influence of green space landscape optimization pattern
   in summer based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical
   simulation technology is analyzed, and the corresponding optimization
   strategies of urban green space planning are put forward. The simulation
   results show that in the bottom wind speed field of 1.5m, the area ratio
   of 0 similar to 0.375m/s wind speed is 15.87\%, and the area ratio of
   2.625 similar to 3m/s wind speed is 32.06\%. In the bottom concentration
   field of 1.5m, the spatial diffusion capacity of SO2 pollutants is
   enhanced, and the concentration of pollutants is relatively low. The
   area ratio of SO2 concentration is 10.06\% in the range of 0.1292
   similar to 0.1551mg/m(3), and the area ratio of SO2 concentration is
   68.08\% in the range of 0 similar to 0.05169mg/m(3). It is concluded
   that the spatial diffusion of wind speed, SO2, and temperature is
   closely related to the urban spatial layout. The optimal spatial layout
   of urban green space can effectively alleviate the urban heat island
   effect, promote the spatial diffusion of SO2, and better form the urban
   ventilation corridor. The research on atmospheric environmental effects
   of urban green space based on CFD can effectively simulate and evaluate
   the optimization measures and conceptual design of urban green space
   system planning, and also provide new ideas for the quantitative
   planning of urban green space system.},

Title = {The Role of Vegetation in Incipient Dune and Foredune Development and
   Morphology: A Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {414-428},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Vegetation is the principal boundary condition on the coast for foredune
   development, both by trapping sand and protecting it from erosion.
   Plants that colonise beaches and dunes grow in a variety of forms and
   have different life cycles. Plant characteristics (e.g., leaf length,
   width) are important in the initiation of a dune, and their interaction
   with sand being transported inland from the beach is highly variable.
   This review aimed to identify gaps in knowledge regarding the influence
   of specific plant species on dune morphological processes. Many studies
   that relate the influence of vegetation on dune morphology are of a
   descriptive and qualitative nature. These studies record elements of
   plant architecture and species presence on the dune. Quantitative
   studies have primarily focused on exotic species growing on the U.S.
   Pacific Northwest coast, whilst numerical modelling of dune growth
   incorporating vegetation has parameterised the plant drag coefficients.
   In these highly numeric investigations, the parameters used are derived
   from desert vegetation or artificial proxies such as rigid cylinders.
   Direct measurements derived from dune vegetation are often lacking.
   Biogeomorphologists and ecological engineers have placed coastal
   vegetation into a variety of categories related to their growth form and
   response to abiotic factors. A consensus on the categories for plant
   functional and engineering groups used for research and planning
   purposes is necessary, for example, sand stabilisers and sand
   accumulators. There is an urgent requirement for quantitative data on
   the growth and sand-capture ability of coastal plants. This is necessary
   because dune responses to climate change will be a function of their
   floral communities. In many instances, these floral communities are
   undergoing rapid change due to exotic invasions, which means that the
   resilience of the dunes may change faster than climate-driven change.},

Title = {Model sensitivity analysis of scattering-induced attenuation of
   ice-coupled waves},
Journal = {OCEAN MODELLING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {45-46},
Pages = {1-13},
Abstract = {The sensitivity of the rate of exponential decay of wave energy through
   the ice-covered oceans is investigated using a two-dimensional (one
   horizontal and one depth) linear model. Attenuation in the model results
   from multiple wave scattering caused by features (irregularities) in the
   ice cover. The focus of the study is the assimilation of ocean wave/sea
   ice interactivity-experienced via the attenuation in the model, into an
   operational ice/ocean forecasting paradigm. Attenuation coefficients are
   considered, which define the rate of exponential decay as functions of
   the properties of the ice cover and the incident wave field. It is shown
   first that wave scattering can be highly sensitive to the values of
   Young's modulus that are typical of natural sea ice, but that the
   difference between the values for first-year and multi-year ice is
   small. Three common ice cover features, namely floes, cracks and
   pressure ridges, are then examined and compared. Regimes in which
   particular irregularities are dominant are identified and approximations
   are derived for the attenuation coefficients produced by each feature.
   Attenuation produced by rough ice is considered as well, but it is found
   to be insignificant compared to that due to the three prototype
   irregularities chosen. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Sensitivity of a Dike-Marsh System to Sea-Level Rise-A Model-Based
   Exploration},

Abstract = {Integrating natural components in flood defence infrastructure can add
   resilience to sea-level rise. Natural foreshores can keep pace with
   sea-level rise by accumulating sediment and attenuate waves before
   reaching the adjacent flood defences. In this study we address how
   natural foreshores affect the future need for dike heightening. A
   simplified model of vertical marsh accretion was combined with a wave
   model and a probabilistic evaluation of dike failure by overtopping. The
   sensitivity of a marsh-dike system was evaluated in relation to a
   combination of processes: (1) sea-level rise, (2) changes in sediment
   concentration, (3) a retreat of the marsh edge, and (4) compaction of
   the marsh. Results indicate that foreshore processes considerably affect
   the need for dike heightening in the future. At a low sea-level rise
   rate, the marshes can accrete such that dike heightening is partially
   mitigated. But with sea-level rise accelerating, a threshold is reached
   where dike heightening needs to compensate for the loss of marshes, and
   for increasing water levels. The level of the threshold depends mostly
   on the delivery of sediment and degree of compaction on the marsh; with
   sufficient width of the marsh, lateral erosion only has a minor effect.
   The study shows how processes and practices that hamper or enhance marsh
   development today exacerbate or alleviate the challenge of flood
   protection posed by accelerated sea-level rise.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Despite vigorous tidal and wind mixing, observations in an estuarine
   tidal inlet in the Wadden Sea show that during part of the tidal cycle,
   vertical stratification and internal waves may still develop. Acoustic
   Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and conductivity, temperature, depth
   observations, collected over the past 6 years at 13 h anchor stations
   (ASs), reveal that these occur especially during slack tide, when there
   is little wind and large freshwater discharge from nearby Lake IJssel.
   Measurements with a moored ADCP show that in the same tidal phase,
   strong cross-channel circulation develops, which may suddenly reverse
   circulation sense due to passing density fronts. In the vertically
   stratified phase that follows after the front passage, propagating
   mode-one solitary internal waves are observed. These are resonantly
   generated during decelerating tidal ebb currents when the (shear) flow
   passes a transcritical regime (Froude number equal to 1). A combination
   of photographs (including one from the International Space Station),
   bathymetric data, and ASs data leads to the discovery of yet another
   source of internal waves in this area, produced during slackening tide
   by propagating lee waves that develop over a deep trench. We suggest
   that both the cross-channel circulation as well as the (solitary)
   internal waves may locally be of importance for the (re)distribution and
   transport of sediments and nutrients and may influence tidally averaged
   transports.},

Volume = {355},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Dual stage PRO process was proposed for power generation. The present
   study evaluated two design configurations of the dual stage PRO process.
   The old dual stage PRO design was modified to enhance the process
   performance. In the new design, the entire seawater flow from the first
   stage goes to the second stage to increase the second stage membrane
   flux. Seawater salinities between 32 g/L and 45 g/L were tested to
   investigate the effect of draw solution TDS on the process performance.
   The results showed that PRO process performed better at higher seawater
   salinity. Furthermore, the performance of the new dual stage PRO design
   was higher than that of the old dual stage PRO process. Power density in
   the new dual stage PRO design was 17.4\% higher than that in the old
   dual stage PRO design. Mainly, this was attributed to the higher
   membrane flux in the modified PRO design. It was also found that the
   specific power consumption of the new PRO design was about 8\% less than
   that of the old PRO design. Finally, the results also showed that for a
   given plant capacity, the membrane elements required in the new PRO
   design were less than that in the old PRO design. As such, the proposed
   new design would be suggested for power generation for being more
   efficient and at cheaper cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Tracing the fate of microplastic carbon in the aquatic food web by
   compound-specific isotope analysis},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Increasing abundance of microplastics (MP) in marine and freshwaters is
   currently one of the greatest environmental concerns. Since plastics are
   fairly resistant to chemical decomposition, breakdown and reutilization
   of MP carbon complexes requires microbial activity. Currently, only a
   few microbial isolates have been shown to degrade MPs, and direct
   measurements of the fate of the MP carbon are still lacking. We used
   compound-specific isotope analysis to track the fate of fully labelled
   C-13-polyethylene (PE) MP carbon across the aquatic microbial-animal
   interface. Isotopic values of respired CO2 and membrane lipids showed
   that MP carbon was partly mineralized and partly used for cell growth.
   Microbial mineralization and assimilation of PE-MP carbon was most
   active when inoculated microbes were obtained from highly humic waters,
   which contain recalcitrant substrate sources. Mixotrophic algae
   (Cryptomonas sp.) and herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia magna) used
   microbial mediated PE-MP carbon in their cell membrane fatty acids.
   Moreover, heteronanoflagellates and mixotrophic algae sequestered MP
   carbon for synthesizing essential omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated
   fatty acids. Thus, this study demonstrates that aquatic micro-organisms
   can produce, biochemically upgrade, and trophically transfer
   nutritionally important biomolecules from PE-MP.},

Abstract = {Species responses to climate change are often measured at broad
   spatiotemporal scales, which can miss the fine-scale changes that are
   most relevant to conservation and fisheries management. We develop a
   scaleable geostatistical approach to assess how juvenile and adult fish
   distributions have been shaped by changes in bottom temperature and
   dissolved oxygen over a recent decade of warming in the northeast
   Pacific. Across 38 demersal fishes, biomass trends were associated
   negatively with warming and positively with dissolved oxygen, but when
   trends in both biomass and climate were converted to velocities-the
   speed and direction a population would have to move to maintain
   consistent conditions-the effect of temperature change differed
   depending on local conditions. In the warmest locations, warming
   velocities were associated with negative biotic velocities for 19 of 69
   species-maturity combinations, and yet were almost always associated
   with stable or positive biotic velocities in the coolest locations (64
   of 69). These spatially consistent biomass declines (negative biotic
   velocities) in the warmest locations and increases in cooler locations
   suggest a redistribution of species with the potential for new
   ecological and fisheries interactions. After controlling for
   temperature, the more spatially consistent effects of dissolved oxygen
   were often negative, suggesting a mechanism other than hypoxia
   avoidance-potentially changes in primary production. Our approach
   identifies the species and locations that are most sensitive to observed
   changes in the environment at any scale, thus facilitating future
   vulnerability assessments.},

Abstract = {As the Earth's temperature continues to rise, coral bleaching events
   become more frequent. Some of the most affected reef ecosystems are
   located in poorly monitored waters, and thus, the extent of the damage
   is unknown. We propose the use of marine heatwaves (MHWs) as a new
   approach for detecting coral reef zones susceptible to bleaching, using
   the Red Sea as a model system. Red Sea corals are exceptionally
   heat-resistant, yet bleaching events have increased in frequency. By
   applying a strict definition of MHWs on > 30 year satellite-derived sea
   surface temperature observations (1985-2015), we provide an atlas of MHW
   hotspots over the Red Sea coral reef zones, which includes all MHWs that
   caused major coral bleaching. We found that: (a) if tuned to a specific
   set of conditions, MHWs identify all areas where coral bleaching has
   previously been reported; (b) those conditions extended farther and
   occurred more often than bleaching was reported; and (c) an emergent
   pattern of extreme warming events is evident in the northern Red Sea
   (since 1998), a region until now thought to be a thermal refuge for
   corals. We argue that bleaching in the Red Sea may be vastly
   underrepresented. Additionally, although northern Red Sea corals exhibit
   remarkably high thermal resistance, the rapidly rising incidence of MHWs
   of high intensity indicates this region may not remain a thermal refuge
   much longer. As our regionally tuned MHW algorithm was capable of
   isolating all extreme warming events that have led to documented coral
   bleaching in the Red Sea, we propose that this approach could be used to
   reveal bleaching-prone regions in other data-limited tropical regions.
   It may thus prove a highly valuable tool for policymakers to optimize
   the sustainable management of coastal economic zones.},

Abstract = {Reliability and maintenance issues of offshore wind turbines are
   demanding due to lack of proven experience at hand. Grouping strategy is
   one of the possible ways to enhance the reliability of the offshore wind
   turbines. It has been outlined how to optimize the maintenance tasks
   based on the age and conditions of the components to group them
   together. The attempt has been made to address the certain issues and
   challenges pertaining to the set up costs, criteria for travel from one
   turbine to another, heuristics development, and exploiting the
   opportunities. In the current work, it has been proposed how to develop
   the optimal operational strategies based on the grouping technique. It
   is expected that realization of the propose approach would help in
   reducing the overall operational costs in a significant way for the
   offshore wind turbines and making them a more attractive and viable
   option for the investors.},

Abstract = {Three ocean acidification experiments were conducted on water from the
   same location in the Ross Sea, Southern Ocean, to ascertain how
   surface-water mixed populations, including the microbial community,
   would respond to changes in pH (pH 7.80 and 7.65). Bacterial
   extracellular enzymes, abundances, thymidine uptake rate, the diversity
   of the active fraction of the bacterial community and phytoplankton
   diversity were measured in response to changes in pH. Bacterial
   abundance increased at lower pH, and the active fraction of the bacteria
   decreased, concurrently becoming less diverse within 8 d. However, as
   the active fraction of the bacterial community evolved, changes in
   bacterial extracellular enzyme rates occurred, with phosphatase,
   beta-glucosidase and lipase activity increasing up to 2-fold in the
   acidified incubations. These results suggest that carbohydrates and
   lipids may be hydrolysed faster with more rapid regeneration of
   nutrients at lower pH. The changes observed in our experiments indicate
   that the bacteria in the Ross Sea adapt quickly to lower pH but that
   bacterial diversity will be lost. However, this loss of diversity did
   not adversely affect bacterial activity and in fact enhanced their
   ability to break down carbohydrates and lipids and recycle phosphate.
   These changes will alter the rate of carbon and phosphate regeneration,
   potentially accelerating decomposition in surface waters and
   short-circuiting the biological pump.},

Title = {Dynamics of a Floating Platform Mounting a Hydrokinetic Turbine},
Journal = {MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {45-56},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {A two-dimensional mathematical model was developed to predict the
   dynamic response of a moored floating Platform mounting a tidal turbine
   in current waves. The model calculates heave, pitch, and surge response
   to clollinear waves and current. Waves may be single frequency or a
   random sea with a specified spectrum. The mooring consists of a fixed
   anchor, heavy chain (forming a catenary), a lightweight elastic line,
   and a mooring ball tethered to the platform. The equations motion and
   mooring equations are solved using a marching solution approach
   immplemented MATLAB. The model was applied to a 10.7-m twin-hulled
   platform used to deploy a 0.86-m shrouded, in-line horizontal axis
   turbine. Added mass and damping coefficients were obtained empirically
   using a 1/9 scale physical model in tank experiments. Full-scale tests
   were used to specify drag coefficients for the turbine and platform. The
   computer model was then used to calculate full-scale mooring loads,
   turbine forces, and platform motion in preparation for a full-scale test
   of the tidal turbing in Muskeget Channel, Massachusetts, which runs
   north-south between Matha's Vinevard and Nantucket Island. During the
   field experiment, wave, current, and platform motion were recorded. The
   field measurements were used to compute responses for heave, pitch, and
   surge. The measured RAOs were compared with those calculated using the
   model. The very good agreement indicates that the model can serve as a
   useful design tool for larger test and commercial platforms.},

   changing operational conditions},
Journal = {ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {464-479},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sea defences are at increasing risk of wave overtopping due to changing
   hydraulic conditions caused by climate change and deteriorating
   structural resistance. This paper presents a method for assessing wave
   overtopping risk of coastal flood defences subjected to changing
   operational conditions. The joint probability of hydraulic parameters
   such as sea water level and significant wave height is investigated
   using the extreme value analysis approaches taking into account rising
   sea level in the future. Meanwhile, structural resistance degradation
   such as the crest level settlement of earth sea dykes is considered in
   overtopping risk analysis by utilising a state-based stochastic
   deterioration model. Time-dependent probability of wave overtopping
   failure is estimated from the associated limit state equation, and the
   effect of hydraulic parameters and crest level settlement on the risk of
   overtopping failure is investigated. A risk cost optimised maintenance
   strategy is then determined by balancing the risk of overtopping failure
   and the costs for structural maintenances. The results for the numerical
   example of a typical earth sea dyke show that the probability of
   overtopping failure will increase significantly due to changing
   hydraulic parameters and losing crest level, thus appropriate
   maintenance will be needed to reduce the risk during the lifecycle.},

Abstract = {Carbonate ramps are special carbonate depositional settings,
   characterized by very gentle slopes extending from the coast to offshore
   without a marked break in slope, In the Cantabrian Mountains of Northern
   Spain a carbonate ramp developed during the Early Devonian (Abelgas
   Formation), An inner ramp tidal-flat complex bounded by small oolite
   shoals (Dolomite Member) developed on the southern edge of the
   Cantabrian Block and to the south and west passed into the mid ramp,
   where shallow-water storm influenced limestones and shales (Lumajo
   Member) and nodular limestones (Wavy Limestone Member) were deposited,
   Later, skeletal banks formed in nearshore areas (Millaro Limestone
   Member) whereas deeper ramp facies (Limestone-Marlstone Member) consist
   of regularly bedded pelagic limestones, marlstones, and shales.
   Evolution of the ramp was mainly controlled by eustatic sea level
   fluctuations, An initial sea-level rise near the Silurian/Devonian
   boundary resulted in a reduction in siliciclastic supply and the
   initiation of carbonate sedimentation in a ramp setting, The ramp was
   finally drowned towards the close of the Pragian by a second rapid
   global sea-level rise, The resulting sequence-stratigraphic pattern
   shows a stack of two ramp systems, which can be grouped into a type 1
   sequence at the base of the formation and a subsequent type 2 sequence
   including the overlying Esla Formation.},

Abstract = {Accurate proton flux measurements of the near-Earth environment are
   essential to the understanding of many phenomena which have a direct
   impact on our lives. Currently, there is only a small set of satellites
   capable of performing these measurements which makes certain studies and
   analyses difficult. This paper details the capabilities of the Combined
   X-ray Dosimeter (CXD), flown on 21 satellites of the Global Positioning
   System constellation, as it relates to proton measurements. We present a
   cross calibration of the CXD with the Energetic Particle Sensor (EPS)
   onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite operated
   by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By utilizing
   Solar Energetic Particle Events when both sets of satellites were
   operational we have orders of magnitude in flux and energy to compare
   against. Robust statistical analyses show that the CXD and Geostationary
   Operational Environmental Satellite flux calculations are similar and
   that for proton energies >30 MeV the CXD fluxes are on average within
   20\% of EPS. Although the CXD has a response to protons as low as 6 MeV,
   the sensitivity at energies below 20 MeV is reduced and so flux
   comparisons of these are generally worse. Integral flux values >10 MeV
   are typically within 40\% of EPS. These calibrated CXD data sets will
   give researchers capabilities to study solar proton access to the inner
   magnetosphere down to L similar to 4 near the equatorial plane at high
   temporal cadence.},

Abstract = {Lichens are diverse symbiotic organisms that contribute essential
   functions to ecosystems worldwide. Generally, lichens are
   under-represented in conservation assessments and implementation when
   compared to other groups of organisms (e.g., plants and vertebrates).
   However, some progress has been made towards better conservation of
   lichens in recent decades. Here we review the current state of lichen
   conservation in Canada and the United States, a region that includes
   nearly 6000 species of lichens. Through detailed case studies, we
   document threats and declines of diversity and abundance, then review
   the legal frameworks that exist to protect lichens at different spatial
   scales in both countries. We highlight progress in effectively using
   `Big Data' to inform conservation, monitoring rare and endangered
   species, expanding the professional capacity of lichenologists, and
   building interdisciplinary networks between scientists and the broader
   community of conservation and resource managers. Moving forward, there
   are clear actions that must be taken to accelerate lichen conservation.},

Title = {Defining fishers in the South African context: Subsistence, artisanal

Abstract = {Evolution of a new policy for the management of marine fisheries in
   South Africa led to the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA).
   Among other innovations, this requires that management strategies be
   developed for subsistence fisheries. As a prerequisite, definitions and
   criteria are needed to identify and distinguish them. To achieve this,
   the Chief Director of Marine \& Coastal Management (MCM), the authority
   responsible for managing marine fisheries, appointed a Subsistence
   Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) to make recommendations about definitions
   and modes of management. The process involved successive surveys and
   consultations with fishing communities, communication with MCM, and a
   national workshop of all participants. This led to consensus about the
   following definition:
   Subsistence fishers are poor people who personally harvest marine
   resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet the basic needs of
   food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries,
   live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources
   locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing
   community-based or cultural practice), and the kinds of resources they
   harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet the basic needs of food
   security.
   This definition builds on the facts that existing subsistence fisheries
   are usually: (1) local operations; (2) customary, traditional or
   cultural; (3) undertaken for personal or family use; (4) primarily for
   nutritional needs (though excess resources may be sold to ensure food
   security); (5) based on minimal technology; and (6) undertaken by people
   with low cash incomes. They are specifically non-commercial and
   non-recreational. The definition was designed to allow protection of the
   rights of these people and sustainability of the resources. While
   developing this definition, it became obvious that the definition of
   ``commercial fishing{''} in the MLRA is also inadequate, and a new
   definition was developed. Commercial fisheries span a wide spectrum, and
   the SFTG defined ``small-scale commercial fishers{''} as a distinct
   component that has not received adequate attention, and for whom
   specific management plans need to be developed. They are distinguished
   by living on or close to the coast, having a history of involvement with
   fishing, being personally involved in hands-on day-to-day running of
   their enterprises, operating with limited amounts of capital investment
   and low levels of technology, and employing small numbers of people.},

Abstract = {Models involving basin-averaged T/S properties {[}Ffield and Gordon,
   1992; Hautala et al., 1996] and barotropic/baroclinic tidal energy

   archipelago is a site of active mixing. This paper describes the first

   Jaya IV, we repeated 18 km legs centered on (6.5 degrees S, 128 degrees
   E), in the central Banda Sea, for two weeks during Oct/Nov 1998.
   With the Modular Microstructure Profiler, we gathered 519 profiles of
   potential temperature, salinity, potential density, pressure and kinetic
   energy dissipation rate. The cruise-mean diapycnal diffusivity from
   20-300 m is <(K rho)over bar>(9.2+/-0.55) x 10(-6) m(2)s(-1), similar to
   ``open ocean{''} {[}Gawett and Munk, 1975] values K rho, =5.1 x 10-6

   Sea-surface temperature displays some evidence of a fortnightly

   tidal mixing, but is uncorrelated with the dissipation rate just below

Title = {The extant shore platform stromatolite (SPS) facies association: a

Abstract = {Shore platform stromatolites (SPS) were first noted at Cape Morgan on
   the south-east African seaboard. Since then they have been found growing
   discontinuously in rocky peritidal zones along the entire southern
   African seaboard. They have also been found on the southwest Australian
   coast, at Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, and more recently at
   Harris on the Scottish Hebridean Atlantic coast. In this paper SPS
   occurrence and SPS potential as analogues for Precambrian fossil
   stromatolites, as well as potential stromatolite occurrences in shore
   platform regions on Mars, are assessed. Sub-horizontal surfaces promote
   stromatolite development, while tufa develops on cliffs and steep rocky
   surfaces. Tufa and stromatolites are end members of a spectrum dictated
   by coastal topography. Extant SPS occur on well indurated shore
   platforms in high wave energy settings, often around or near headlands.
   They can be associated with boulder beaches, boulder ridges, storm swash
   terraces, coastal dunes, and peat bogs. In contrast to other extant
   stromatolites, SPS are produced primarily by mineral precipitation,
   although minor trapping and binding stromatolites do occur. From a
   geological perspective, SPS develop in mildly transgressive
   siliciclastic settings in various climatic and tidal regimes. We suggest
   that SPS could be preserved in the geological record as micritic lenses
   on palaeo-shore platform surfaces. SPS share many features with
   Precambrian stromatolites and are a valid modern analogue despite the
   widely different atmospheric and oceanic conditions of the Archean. We
   suggest that terraces associated with former oceanic or lacustrine
   flooding surfaces on Mars are potential targets in the search for
   palaeo-SPS on Mars.},

Abstract = {The dissipation of kinetic energy at the surface of natural water bodies
   has important consequences for many physical and biochemical processes
   including wave dynamics, gas transfer, mixing of nutrients and
   pollutants, and photosynthetic efficiency of plankton. Measurements of
   dissipation close to the surface obtained in a large lake under
   conditions of strong wind forcing are presented that show a layer of
   enhanced dissipation exceeding wall layer values by one or two orders of
   magnitude. The authors propose a scaling for the rate of dissipation
   based on wind and wave parameters, and conclude that the dissipation
   rate under breaking waves depends on depth, to varying degrees, in three
   stages. Very near the surface, within one significant height, the
   dissipation rate is high (an order of magnitude greater than that
   predicted by wall layer theory) and roughly constant. Below this is an
   intermediate region where the dissipation decays as z(-2). The thickness
   of this layer (relative to the significant wave height) is proportional
   to the energy flux from breaking normalized by rho u{*}(3), which for
   young waves is proportional to wave age. At sufficient depth the
   dissipation rate asymptotes to values commensurate with a traditional
   wall layer. The total energy flux into the water column can be an order
   of magnitude greater than the conventional estimate of rho u{*}(3)/2 and
   depends strongly on wave age. These results imply a pronounced shift in
   our approach to estimating kinetic energy dissipation in wave-stirred
   regions and in the modeling of various physical, chemical, and
   biological processes.},

Abstract = {Efficient, stable, and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for both the
   oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction are highly
   imperative for the realization of low-cost commercial water-splitting
   electrolyzers. Herein, a cost-effective and ecofriendly strategy is
   reported to fabricate coral-like FeNi(OH)(x)/Ni as a bifunctional
   electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline media. With the
   assistance of mild corrosion of Ni by Fe(NO3)(3), in situ generated
   FeNi(OH)(x) nanosheets are intimately attached on metallic coral-like
   Ni. Integration of these nanosheets with the electrodeposited coral-like
   Ni skeleton and the supermacroporous Ni foam substrate forms a
   binder-free hierarchical electrode, which is beneficial for exposing
   catalytic active sites, accelerating mass transport, and facilitating
   the release of gaseous species. In 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution, a symmetric
   electrolyzer constructed with FeNi(OH)(x)/Ni as both the anode and the
   cathode exhibits an excellent activity with an applied potential
   difference of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of an
   asymmetric electrolyzer constructed with the state-of-the-art RuO2-PtC
   couple (applied potential difference of 1.55 Vat 10 mA cm(-2)). This
   work contributes a facile and reliable strategy for manufacturing
   affordable, practical, and promising water-splitting devices. (C) 2018,

Abstract = {The scarcity of natural aggregates promotes waste reuse as secondary raw
   material in the field of civil engineering. This article focuses on the
   beneficial reuse of marine-dredged sediments in road building. Thus,
   mixtures of raw sediments and dredged sand collected from Brest Harbur
   (Bretagne, France) were treated with road hydraulic binders. Formulation
   were prepared and characterized as recommended by the French Technical
   Guidelines for soil treatment with lime and/or hydraulic binders.
   Mechanical resistance results are quite similar for both the hydraulic
   binders, suggesting a similar reactivity with the studied sediment
   sample. However, some discrepancies can be noted on sustainability
   parameters. Indeed, water resistance after immersion at 40 degrees C is
   significantly better for the mixtures treated with cement containing
   more glass-forming oxides (SiO2+Al2O3) and fluxing
   (Fe2O3+CaO+MgO+K2O+Na2O). Moreover, the both hydraulic binders can lead
   to swelling in the road materials as observed in scanning electron
   microscopy analyses. Indeed, microscopic observations indicated
   volumetric swelling of treated samples, which is greatly influenced on
   the one side by ettringite quantity and on the other hand by the

Title = {Experimental study of glass to metal seals for parabolic trough
   receivers},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {85-91},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The breakage of the glass to metal sealing is the primary ongoing issue
   for the solar receiver tubes in parabolic trough solar power systems.
   Sealing failure leads to loss of the vacuum inside the tube which
   substantially reduces the collector efficiency. It is a technical
   difficulty to obtain good glass to metal seals with high mechanical
   strength and long-term temperature resistance during current receiver
   manufacturing. The paper describes the development of the glass to metal
   seals in the parabolic trough receivers and presents a new method that
   uses the high-frequency induction heating to band a new borosilicate
   glass to the Kovar alloy ends. Kovar pre-oxidization experiments were
   used to measure the relation curves of Kovar oxidation weight gain
   during heating. The preoxidation of Kovar and the sealing process are
   guided by a series tests to measure the gas tightness, sealing strength,
   seal interface microstructure and thermal shock. The results show that
   excellent glass-to-Kovar sealing can be obtained with a Kovar oxidation
   weight gain of about 0.3-0.8 mg/cm(2). Finally, a new solar receiver was
   developed by the new sealing method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Marine silage (MS) is a fish hatchery diet prepared by decomposing
   seaweed into cellular units and performing lactic acid fermentation. MS
   was first developed by using a wild-type consortium composed of a lactic
   acid bacterium (LAB) Lactobacillus brevis and yeasts Debaryomyces
   hansenii var. hansenii and Candida sp. as a fermentation starter. To
   further examine a suitable combination of starter microorganisms, MS was
   prepared with different compositions of LAB and yeasts from a substrate
   of Undaria pinnatifida. Production efficiency of algal single cell units
   was not different among the trials. Inoculation of LAB significantly
   retarded the growth of contaminant microorganisms while a single
   inoculation of yeasts could not retard the growth of halophilic
   contaminant microorganisms. Lactobacillus brevis showed the highest
   predominating ability in MS among the tested, while L. acidophilus
   (casei-type) IAM 10074 and L. plantarum IAM12477(T) also showed
   predominating ability with relatively inferior scores when analyzed from
   the results of the identification with 16S rRNA-targeted
   species-specific primers. The present study demonstrated that a single
   use of LAB, including food industry-familiar species, is suitable for
   preparation of MS, while the superiority of L. brevis B5201 was
   suggested in predominating ability in marine silage.},

Abstract = {The validity of a hydrophobic organic contaminant mass transfer model to
   predict the effectiveness of in situ activated carbon (AC) treatment
   under stagnant sediment AC contact is studied for different contaminants
   and sediments. The modeling results and data from a previous 24-month
   column experiment of uptake in polyethylene samplers are within a factor
   of 2 for parent- and allcylated-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in
   petroleum-impacted sediment and factors of 3-10 for polychlorinated
   biphenyls. The model successfully reproduces the relative effects of
   AC-sediment contact time, contaminant properties, AC particle size, AC
   mixing regime, AC distribution, and hydraulic conditions observed in the
   sediment column experiments. The model tracks contaminant concentrations
   in different sediment compartments over time, which provides useful
   information on the contaminant sequestration by the added AC. Long-term
   projection of the effectiveness of AC amendment using the model shows
   that the effects of AC particle size and particle-scale heterogeneity in
   AC distribution are pronounced within a year or so. However, the effect
   of those factors becomes less significant after a much longer contact
   period (on the order of a decade or two), resulting in substantial
   reduction in pore-water concentrations, for example, greater than 99\%
   for benz{[}a]anthracene, under various scenarios.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article presents the modelling and assessment of a pulsating torque
   mitigation control strategy by using a tidal turbine emulator in a
   laboratory environment. Sudden changes and variability of the tidal flow
   velocity have the effect of creating pulsations on tidal current
   turbines. These pulsations have an adverse effect on tidal turbine
   fatigue and ultimate loading as well as the operation of the drivetrain.
   For the above reasons, a pulsating torque mitigation control strategy
   has been developed and tested which is based on modifying the reference
   maximum power point speed of the generator. This article presents the
   assessment of this pulsating torque mitigation control strategy in a
   laboratory setup. A 7kW tidal current turbine is modelled in
   MATLAB/Simulink. The tidal turbine is emulated in the laboratory setup
   by using a torque-controlled induction motor. Results show the
   effectiveness of the method in a laboratory environment, the ability of
   the generator to accelerate and decelerate based on the speed controller
   commands and the difference between the pulsating torque mitigation
   control strategy and maximum power point operation (MPPO). In addition,
   the experimental results are compared with a Simulink model which will
   show the accuracy of the modelling process.},

Abstract = {In light of the difficult logistics and high cost of polar research into
   climate change, involvement of local people can contribute immensely to
   important data collection. One can use the knowledge and skills of human

   established at Crazy Lake (63 degrees 51' N, 68 degrees 28'W) near
   Iqaluit, Nunavut, to monitor snow and ice thickness, biological
   components, and water chemistry. Nunavut Arctic College students
   collected basic limnological data at Crazy Lake during spring field
   camps held between 10 and 16 April in 2005 and 2006. Mean snow depth +/-
   SD for Crazy Lake was 0.46 +/- 0.13 m (n = 24). White ice averaged 0.13
   +/- 0.12 m and black ice 1.38 +/- 0.28 m. Total ice thickness (white ice
   + black ice) ranged between 0.91 and 1.91 m (mean = 1.51 +/- 0.22 m).
   The total lake cover (snow + ice) averaged 1.97 +/- 0.20 m. Water depth

Abstract = {Hybrid renewable energy heat sources provide more sustainable energy
   resources with high maintenance for high-efficient power plants.
   Multigeneration systems driven by a hybrid renewable source are proved
   as cutting-edge technologies in recent studies. In this study, a novel
   multigeneration system driven by a hybrid biogasgeothermal heat source
   is proposed and simulated. To demonstrate the feasibility of the
   proposed multi generation system, first and second laws analysis are
   employed as the most effective tools for performance assessment of the
   systems. It is found that the proposed multigeneration system can
   produce overall heating capacity, overall cooling capacity, net output
   power, hydrogen production rate, and freshwater production rate of 538.1
   kW, 1799 kW, 443.4 kW, 0.2583 kg/s, and 367.92 lit/h, respectively.
   Under this circumstance, the thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, and
   total exergy destruction of the system are calculated 62.28\%, 74.9\%,
   and 2036.19 kW, respectively, showing a considerable improvement
   compared to the single-generation system. In addition, the results
   indicated that the condenser is the most destructive component, whereas
   the absorption refrigeration cycle is accounted as the most destructive
   sub-system. Moreover, a comprehensive parametric study is carried out to
   give more information about the behavior of the proposed system.},

Title = {Spectral wave dissipation over a barrier reef},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {110},
Number = {C4},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {A 2 week field experiment was conducted to measure surface wave
   dissipation on a barrier reef at Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Wave heights
   and velocities were measured at several locations on the fore reef and
   the reef flat, which were used to estimate rates of dissipation by wave
   breaking and bottom friction. Dissipation on the reef flat was found to
   be dominated by friction at rates that are significantly larger than
   those typically observed at sandy beach sites. This is attributed to the
   rough surface generated by the reef organisms, which makes the reef
   highly efficient at dissipating energy by bottom friction. Results were
   compared to a spectral wave friction model, which showed that the
   variation in frictional dissipation among the different frequency
   components could be described using a single hydraulic roughness length
   scale. Surveys of the bottom roughness conducted on the reef flat showed
   that this hydraulic roughness length was comparable to the physical
   roughness measured at this site. On the fore reef, dissipation was due
   to the combined effect of frictional dissipation and wave breaking.
   However, in this region the magnitude of dissipation by bottom friction
   was comparable to wave breaking, despite the existence of a well-defined
   surf zone there. Under typical wave conditions the bulk of the total
   wave energy incident on Kaneohe Bay is dissipated by bottom friction,
   not wave breaking, as is often assumed for sandy beach sites and other
   coral reefs.},

Title = {Pelagic stocks and carbon and nitrogen uptake in a pearl farming atoll
   (Ahe, French Polynesia)},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study reports the first measurements of nitrogen uptake and new
   data on carbon fixation (N-15/C-13 incorporation) for two
   size-fractionated phytoplankton (<2 mu m and >2 mu m), on organic
   matter, and phytoplankton stocks in Ahe lagoon. Data were collected
   between November and December 2017, during the hot season with
   prevailing trade winds. Ammonium and nitrate uptake data (7.58 to 39.81
   and 1.80 to 21.43 mu mol N m(-3) h(-1), respectively) suggest a rapid
   turn-over of N-nutrients in the water column and show that primary
   production was largely sustained by recycled nitrogen providing 68\% of
   the pelagic N demand. These results highlight the spatial heterogeneity
   of the measured processes linked to the local hydrodynamics, exhibiting
   higher regenerated production in the more exploited southwestern part of
   the lagoon and a higher proportion of new production in the north.
   Intense nutrient recycling appears to promote nanophytoplankton
   production which is critical for pearl oyster growth.},

Abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most sensitive regions of
   Antarctica to climate change. Here, ecological and cryospheric systems
   respond rapidly to climate fluctuations. A 4.4 m thick laminated diatom
   ooze deposited during the last deglaciation is examined from a marine
   sediment core (ODP Site 1098) recovered from Basin 1, Palmer Deep,
   western Antarctic Peninsula. This deglacial laminated interval was
   deposited directly over a glaciomarine diamict, hence during a globally
   recognised period of rapid climate change. The ultra-high-resolution
   deglacial record is analysed using SEM backscattered electron imagery
   and secondary electron imagery. Laminated to thinly bedded orange-brown
   diatom ooze (near monogeneric Hyalochaete Chaetoceros spp. resting
   spores) alternates with blue-grey terrigenous sediments (open water
   diatom species). These discrete laminae are interpreted as austral
   spring and summer signals respectively, with negligible winter
   deposition. Sub-seasonal sub-laminae are observed repeatedly through the
   summer laminae, suggesting variations in shelf waters throughout the
   summer. Tidal cycles, high storm intensities and/or intrusion of
   Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf introduced conditions
   which enhanced specific species productivity through the season.

Title = {Comparison of the Arctic upper-air temperatures from radiosonde and

Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},

Abstract = {The air temperature is one of the most important parameters used for
   monitoring the Arctic climate change. The constellation observing system
   for meteorology, ionosphere, and climate and Formosa Satellite Mission 3
   (COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3) radio occultation (RO) ``wet{''} temperature product
   (i.e., ``wetPrf{''}) is used to analyze the Arctic air temperature
   profiles at 925-200 hPa in 2007-2012. The ``wet{''} temperatures are
   further compared with radiosonde (RS) observations. The results from the
   spatially and temporally synchronized RS and COSMIC observations show
   that their temperatures agree well with each other, especially at 400
   hPa. Comparisons of seasonal temperatures and anomalies from the COSMIC
   and homogenized RS observations suggest that the limited number of
   COSMIC observations during the spatial matchup may be insufficient to
   describe the smallscale spatial structure of temperature variations.
   Furthermore, comparisons of the seasonal temperature anomalies from the
   RS and 5A degrees x5A degrees gridded COSMIC observations at 400 hPa
   during the sea ice minimum (SIM) of 2007 and 2012 are also made. The
   results reveal that similar Arctic temperature variation patterns can be
   obtained from both RS and COSMIC observations over the land area, while
   extra information can be further provided from the densely distributed
   COSMIC observations. Therefore, despite COSMIC observations being
   unsuitable to describe the Arctic temperatures in the lowest level, they
   provide a complementary data source to study the Arctic upper-air
   temperature variations and related climate change.},

Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Improving the economic feasibility is necessary for algae-based
   processes to achieve commercial scales for biofuels and bioproducts
   production. A closed-loop system for fusel alcohol production from
   microalgae biomass with integrated nutrient recycling was developed,
   which enables the reuse of nitrogen and phosphorus for downstream
   application and thus reduces the operational requirement for external
   major nutrients. Mixed fusel alcohols, primarily isobutanol and
   isopentanol were produced from Microchloropsis salina hydrolysates by an
   engineered E. coli co-culture. During the process, cellular nitrogen
   from microalgae biomass was converted into ammonium, whereas cellular
   phosphorus was liberated by an osmotic shock treatment. The formation of
   struvite from the liberated ammonium and phosphate, and the subsequent
   utilization of struvite to support M. salina cultivation was
   demonstrated. The closed loop system established here should help
   overcome one of the identified economic barriers to scale-up of
   microalgae production, and enhance the sustainability of
   microalgae-based chemical commodities production.},

Abstract = {In this study, non-flammable insulator materials with high thermal
   resistance have been produced for vessel doors. Silica-based polymers
   were used as core materials. Four different synthesis routes are
   procured and their morphologies, thermal performances, and flammability
   properties are compared. Thermal properties of the synthesized
   silica-based polymers are improved by attaining higher porosity and
   surface area with different synthesizing routes. While surfactant usage
   provided a spherical morphology for particles, changing the drying
   procedure to freeze drying technique showed an increase in terms of
   porosity and average pore size. Amongst the synthesized silica-based
   polymers, the sample with the lowest thermal conductivity lambda value
   {[}14 mW/(m K)] is chosen as a core material for prepared panels. After
   the ratio optimization of fiberglass, silicon carbide and silica-based
   polymer, different pressing pressures are applied to the panels. The
   values of 90 mW/(m K) is attained at 0.1 N/mm(2) pressure and by
   increasing the pressing value to 0.6 N/mm(2) the thermal conductivity of
   the panel decreases to 56 mW/(m K). Furthermore, the thermal properties
   of the prepared panel with the best result and commercial panels that
   are commonly used are also compared.},

Abstract = {Samples of top soils (0-20 cm) were collected in Jilin province in the
   northeast of China. The levels of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   were analyzed by gas chromatography. In soils, the total content of 16
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ranged between 67.1 ng g(-1) to 27941.2
   ng g(-1) (dry weight) with arithmetic mean of 2190 ng g(-1) for samples
   collected different types of soil. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   composition of surface soil in Jilin Province, mainly in the 3 and 4
   rings such as pyrene. The research shows that there was a strong
   pyrogenic influence on soil polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in all
   soils sampled in Jilin province. Some parts of the test results show
   that different molecular indices for phenanthrene/anthracene and
   fluoranthene/pyrene, respectively, indicates a possible influence of
   petrogenic inputs. Soil organic carbon is an important factor to affect
   distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the soil samples.
   These results indicate that local sources of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, especially different types of land, lead to very different
   values of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.},

Title = {Success of concrete and crab traps in facilitating Eastern oyster
   recruitment and reef development},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Background: Abundance of the commercially and ecologically important
   Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, has declined across the US
   Eastern and Gulf coasts in recent decades, spurring substantial efforts
   to restore oyster reefs. These efforts are widely constrained by the
   availability, cost, and suitability of substrates to support oyster
   settlement and reef establishment. In particular, oyster shell is often
   the preferred substrate but is relatively scarce and increasingly
   expensive. Thus, there is a need for alternative oyster restoration
   materials that are cost-effective, abundant, and durable.
   Methods: We tested the viability of two low-cost substrates-concrete and
   recycled blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) traps-in facilitating oyster
   recovery in a replicated 22-month field experiment at historically
   productive but now degraded intertidal oyster grounds on northwestern
   Florida's Nature Coast. Throughout the trial, we monitored areal oyster
   cover on each substrate; at the end of the trial, we measured the
   densities of oysters by size class (spat, juvenile, and market-size) and
   the biomass and volume of each reef.
   Results: Oysters colonized the concrete structures more quickly than the
   crab traps, as evidenced by significantly higher oyster cover during the
   first year of the experiment. By the end of the experiment, the concrete
   structures hosted higher densities of spat and juveniles, while the
   density of market-size oysters was relatively low and similar between
   treatments. The open structure of the crab traps led to the development
   of larger-volume reefs, while oyster biomass per unit area was similar
   between treatments. In addition, substrates positioned at lower
   elevations (relative to mean sea level) supported higher oyster
   abundance, size, and biomass than those less frequently inundated at
   higher elevations.
   Discussion: Together, these findings indicate that both concrete and
   crab traps are viable substrates for oyster reef restoration, especially
   when placed at lower intertidal elevations conducive to oyster
   settlement and reef development.},

Abstract = {The classic model of water and sediment flux in barred surf zones is a
   net flux landward across a nearshore bar, alongshore in a feeder
   channel, and offshore in narrow jet-like flows in a rip neck cut through
   the bar; this circulation is frequently modulated by the tide, even
   under micro-tidal conditions. Water levels, waves, currents and
   suspended sediment transport (SST) were recorded at elevations of z =
   0.13, 0.26 and 0.39 m in a rip neck on an intermediate bar-rip beach at
   a micro-tidal site, Bennett's Beach, NSW, Australia. Measurements
   revealed SST was driven by quasi-steady rip currents and by gravity and
   infragravity waves. The balance between these components determined the
   magnitude and direction of the overall net SST. Tentative conclusions
   are that:
   (i) the direction of the overall net SST rate in the rip neck was
   dominated, as expected, by offshore-directed mean cross-shore currents,
   especially around high tide; at this time the SST rates due to gravity
   and infragravity waves were relatively small and somewhat variable in
   direction.
   (ii) as the tide fell, relatively large SST rates were directed onshore
   by shoaling gravity waves propagating through the neck, which opposed
   and even exceeded the rip current transport. At mid-tide, the transport
   by infragravity waves complemented the gravity waves such that the
   overall net flux of suspended sediment was directed onshore into the rip
   cell at the two lowest elevations.
   (iii) whenever the SST by the rip current and by shoaling waves was
   close to a balance, it was the infragravity waves that controlled the
   rate and direction of the overall net suspended sediment flux.},

Abstract = {Mechanics plays a key role in the evolution of the sea ice cover through
   its control on drift, on momentum and thermal energy exchanges between
   the polar oceans and the atmosphere along cracks and faults, and on ice
   thickness distribution through opening and ridging processes. At the
   local scale, a significant variability of the mechanical strength is
   associated with the microstructural heterogeneity of saline ice, however
   characterized by a small correlation length, below the ice thickness
   scale. Conversely, the sea ice mechanical fields (velocity, strain and
   stress) are characterized by long-ranged (more than 1000 km) and
   long-lasting (approx. few months) correlations. The associated space and
   time scaling laws are the signature of the brittle character of sea ice
   mechanics, with deformation resulting from a multi-scale accumulation of
   episodic fracturing and faulting events. To translate the
   short-range-correlated disorder on strength into long-range-correlated
   mechanical fields, several key ingredients are identified: long-ranged
   elastic interactions, slow driving conditions, a slow viscous-like
   relaxation of elastic stresses and a restoring/healing mechanism. These
   ingredients constrained the development of a new continuum mechanics
   modelling framework for the sea ice cover, called
   Maxwell-elasto-brittle. Idealized simulations without advection
   demonstrate that this rheological framework reproduces the main
   characteristics of sea ice mechanics, including anisotropy, spatial
   localization and intermittency, as well as the associated scaling laws.

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Studies with marine fishes indicate that exposure to elevated partial
   pressures of CO2 (pCO(2)) related to climate change have negative
   consequences for fish behaviour. Freshwater fishes may experience
   similar increases in pCO(2) due to a number of different mechanisms, but
   there is a paucity of information on how freshwater fishes may respond
   to exposure to elevated pCO(2). To define the effects of elevated pCO(2)
   on a free-swimming freshwater fish, 19 adult largemouth bass
   (Micropterus salmoides) were tagged with acoustic transmitters, held in
   water with pCO(2) levels of either 10000atm or ambient pCO(2) (<100atm)
   for 5days and released into a naturalised, earthen-bottom pond outfitted
   with an acoustic telemetry array. Findings indicate that largemouth bass
   not exposed to elevated levels of pCO(2) decreased movement over 35\%
   during the daylight periods; however, fish exposed to elevated levels of
   pCO(2) did not exhibit this pattern. This difference in diel movement
   patterns between fish exposed to elevated pCO(2) and fish not exposed
   was not detectable after 11days. Changes in home range size and daily
   distance travelled were not observed. However, based on an assessment of
   position estimates after the completion of the telemetry monitoring
   portion of the study, space use differed for fish exposed to elevated
   pCO(2). Exposure to elevated pCO(2) therefore can have consequences for
   some movement behaviours of freshwater fish and this may influence a
   variety of ecological processes including energetics, foraging and
   predator-prey dynamics. CO2-induced alterations to behaviour should
   recover upon a return to ambient water.},

Title = {Evaluating the potential for an increased and sustainable commercial
   fisheries production across multiple jurisdictions and diverse fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We describe a first estimate of the potential to increase production
   from Australia's commercial fisheries based on the difference between
   current catches and maximum sustainable yield (MSY). MSY is not being
   advocated as a target reference point but enables a level of consistency
   across species and/or jurisdictions with different reference points. MSY
   estimates were obtained for 290 species/stocks that comprised 84\% of
   annual landings. 75\% of the estimates were computed using methods
   applied specifically for this study, aided by an assessment framework,
   and supporting software. The catch-MSY method was used extensively given
   the lack of formal assessments for many species, and the limitations of
   taking this approach are discussed. The results indicated that potential
   production could be more than double the current national catch (an
   increase over current catches of about 124\%), but potential increases
   varied considerably among Federal, State and Territory jurisdictions.
   The potential for increased production was particularly influenced by
   predictions for highly productive small pelagic fishes, although
   ignoring the potential for increased catches of these species still led
   to an estimate of an increase of almost 80\% over current catches. Other
   factors such as whether an increase in production has market demand are
   also clearly important, along with other social and economic issues.
   Impacts on ecosystem sustainability and the consequences of climate
   change were beyond the scope of this study and would need to be
   considered in separate analyses. However, in making our estimates of
   potential production we acknowledged the issues with attempting to use
   single species approaches to provide fish community wide estimates and
   acted conservatively with our interpretation. Consequently, the results
   presented in this paper provide useful insights into possible
   biologically sustainable catches and the potential for increased
   production.},

Title = {Depth-averaged unsteady RANS simulation of resonant shallow flows in
   lateral cavities using augmented WENO-ADER schemes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS},

Abstract = {Turbulent shallow flows are characterized by the presence of horizontal
   large-scale vortices, caused by local variations of the velocity field.
   Apart from these 2D large vortices, small scale 3D turbulence, mainly
   produced by the interaction of the flowing water with the solid
   boundaries, is also present. The energy spectrum of turbulent shallow
   flows shows the presence of a 2D energy cascade at low wave numbers and
   a 3D energy cascade at high wave numbers, with a well-defined separation
   region between them. Horizontal flow movements (e.g. 2D large-scale
   vortical structures) at low wave numbers mostly determine the
   hydrodynamic behavior of these flows. Moreover, the generation of
   standing waves often occurs closely associated to the interaction of 2D
   horizontal flows with lateral boundaries, this is the case of seiches.
   To adequately reproduce these phenomena, a mathematical and numerical
   model able to resolve 2D turbulence is required. We herein show that
   depth-averaged (DA) unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (URANS)
   models based on the Shallow Water Equations (SWE) are a suitable choice
   for the resolution of turbulent shallow flows with sufficient accuracy
   in an affordable computational time. The 3D small-scale vortices are
   modeled by means of diffusion terms, whereas the 2D large-scales are
   resolved. A high order numerical scheme is required for the resolution
   of 2D large eddies. In this work, we design a DA-URANS model based on a
   high order augmented WENO-ADER scheme. The mathematical model and
   numerical scheme are validated against observation of complex
   experiments in an open channel with lateral cavities that involve the
   presence of resonant phenomena (seiching). The numerical results
   evidence that the model accurately reproduces both longitudinal and
   transversal resonant waves and provides an accurate description of the
   flow field. The high order WENO-ADER scheme combined with a SWE model
   allows to obtain a powerful, reliable and efficient URANS simulation
   tool. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Daily bacterioplankton dynamics in a sub-Saharan estuary (Senegal River,

Year = {2005},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Temporal variability in bacterial communities was studied on a daily
   scale in the estuarine part of the largest river on the West African
   coast, the Senegal River. Duplicate mesocosms (3 m(3) volume) were
   placed in the upper part of the estuary at the end of the dry season
   (May 2002) and treated with low and high inorganic nutrient (N and P)
   enrichment. High nutrient additions were followed by a 7-fold increase
   in phytoplankton biomass and a 6-fold increase in bacterial abundance
   after 4 and 9 d, respectively. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF)
   showed their maximal abundance (1 x 10(6) ml(-1)) 2 d after the
   bacterial peak. The low bacteria to flagellate ratios recorded on Day 10
   may suggest enhanced bacterivory from HNF. Simultaneous measurements of
   growth and grazing rates on bacteria during the bacterial growth phase
   were performed with the dilution method and seemed to indicate that the
   HNF community was capable of quickly controlling bacterial development.
   However, estimates of the carbon demand of HNF during their growth phase
   (915 mu g C l(-1) d(-1)) appeared to be more elevated than the bacterial
   carbon production (63\% of the HNF carbon demand). To cover HNF carbon
   requirements, an alternative/complementary prey might be the
   picophytoplanktonic cells, which were very numerous during the study
   (i.e. 85 \% of the total phytoplankton count). During the period of high
   grazing pressure, bacterial populations were characterized by higher
   specific activity (from tritiated thymidine incorporation) and
   culturability (from plate counts). The presence of very large bacteria,
   as detected by epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry
   measurements, may be an escape response from flagellate grazing. 16S
   rDNA sequences from bacterial isolates showed the presence of 2 types of
   taxonomic units (Vibrio natriegens- and Flexibacter maritimus-like
   bacteria), which can be considered by their forms and growth rates to be
   strains that have developed strategies to protect against grazing. Thus,
   as demonstrated in various temperate systems, predation by HNF in
   estuarine tropical ecosystems may also be of importance in shaping the
   structure and functions of the bacterial community.},

Title = {Biodiversity and metacommunity structure of animals along altitudinal
   gradients in tropical montane forests},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {421-436},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The study of altitudinal gradients has made enduring contributions to
   the theoretical and empirical bases of modern biology. Unfortunately,
   the persistence of these systems and the species that compose them is
   threatened by land-use change at lower altitudes and by climate change
   throughout the gradients, but especially at higher altitudes. In this
   review, we focus on two broad themes that are inspired by altitudinal
   variation in tropical montane regions: (1) dimensions of biodiversity
   and (2) metacommunity structure. Species richness generally decreased
   with increasing altitude, although not always in a linear fashion.
   Mid-altitudinal peaks in richness were less common than monotonic
   declines, and altitudinal increases in richness were restricted to
   amphibian faunas. Moreover, gradients of biodiversity differed among
   dimensions (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) as well as among
   faunas (bats, rodents, birds) in the tropical Andes, suggesting that
   species richness is not a good surrogate for dimensions that reflect
   differences in the function or evolutionary history of species. Tropical
   montane metacommunities evinced a variety of structures, including
   nested (bats), Clementsian (rodents, bats, gastropods),
   quasi-Clementsian (reptiles, amphibians, passerines) and
   quasi-Gleasonian (gastropods) patterns. Nonetheless, compositional
   changes were always associated with the ecotones between rain forest and
   cloud forest, regardless of fauna.},

Abstract = {Burgeoning demand for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA)
   due to their established pharmacological and economic significances
   along with the declining sources of fish urge to explore the sustainable
   sources of LC-PUFA. Being the predominant LC-PUFA source for marine
   fishes at the base of the aquatic food web, microalgae has been hailed
   as a promising natural source for LC-PUFA. However, the potential of
   algal systems to overproduce LC-PUFA via metabolic engineering is
   warranted to meet the ever-increasing demand. In this study, we
   identified and overexpressed Delta 6-desaturase, the key enzyme involved
   in fatty acid desaturation and exemplified its potential on elevating
   PUFA and lipid content in Nannochloropsis oceanica. Delta 6-desaturase
   overexpression enhanced growth and photosynthetic efficiency. Transgenic
   cells exhibited a remarkable increase in EPA content and reached up to
   62.35 mg/g DW, the highest EPA production in transgenic N. oceanica by
   expressing a single key enzyme without impeding growth. Total lipid
   content was significantly increased by 1.7-fold in the transgenic cell
   than WT. Together, these findings exemplify a potential candidate for
   LC-PUFA overproduction and also open a new avenue for sustainable
   production of microalgal PUFAs.},

Abstract = {Fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) were derived from
   Po-210/Pb-210 disequilibrium during the 4th Chinese National Arctic
   Research Expedition (CHINARE-4) from July 1 to September 28, 2010.
   Average residence times of particulate Po-210 in the euphotic zone were
   -16.00 a to 1.54 a, which are higher than those of dissolved Po-210
   (-6.89 a to -0.70 a). Great excesses of dissolved Po-210 were observed
   at all stations, with an average Po-210/Pb-210 ratio of 1.91 +/- 0.20,
   resulting from Pb-210 atmospheric deposition after sea ice melt. POC
   fluxes from the euphotic zone were estimated by two methods (E and B) in
   the irreversible scavenging model. Estimated POC fluxes were 945-126
   mmol C/(m(2)center dot a) and 1 848-109 mmol C/(m(2)center dot a) by
   methods E and B, respectively, both decreasing from low to high
   latitude. The results are comparable to previous works for the same
   region, indicating efficient biological pumping in the Chukchi Sea. The
   results can improve understanding of the carbon cycle in the western

Title = {Biogeographical characterisation of Egypt based on environmental
   features and endemic vascular plants distribution},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Biogeographical studies are considered effective for investigations on
   macroecology and evolution, as well as for delineating patterns of
   endemism and identifying the key drivers influencing the historical
   distribution of species. Clustering techniques, based on environmental
   datasets and distribution of endemic species, have been largely used in
   biogeography and for the definition of endemic-rich regions where
   conservation actions should be implemented. Despite several earlier
   studies have dealt with the biogeographical territories in Egypt, none
   of them have provided a replicable method to support such
   regionalisation. We proposed a two-step procedure for the
   biogeographical regionalisation of Egypt consisting in (1) the
   definition of environmental clusters (based on 24 climatic, three
   topographic, two soil organic carbon content and pH, and four habitat
   heterogeneity variables) by using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm and
   (2) the spatial clustering of such clusters according to the
   distribution of 140 endemic vascular plants. The hierarchical clustering
   and indicator values analyses, based on the presence-absence matrix of
   endemic taxa in each cluster were performed to define two cut-off levels
   of biogeographical sectors and subsectors. A total of six sectors and
   nine subsectors were identified. Climatic-related variables, elevation
   and soil organic carbon were the most important determinants for
   environmental clustering of Egypt. The highest endemic richness was
   recorded in the Marioutico-Arishian (71 species), Sinaico-Arabian (62
   species) and Nilotic (16 species) sectors, and in Sinaic (54 species),
   Arishian (45 species) and Marioutic (40 species) subsectors.
   Nonetheless, the most protected sectors were Elbanian and Suezian (62.73
   and 29.05\%, respectively) while the lowest sectors were Nilotic and
   Marioutico-Arishian (9.86 and 13.26\%, respectively). The already
   established protected areas in Egypt are not sufficient for conserving
   the representation of the identified endemic rich plant sectors. This
   two-step procedure confirms the usefulness of environmental attributes
   together with the spatial distribution of endemic vascular plants to
   define the biogeographical units in Egypt. Our regionalisation method
   could be replicated for other species' groups, with the ultimate goal of
   integration all species of interest in a single biogeographical system.
   Furthermore, the presented regionalisation will help to identify
   weaknesses in current protection actions and to understand
   biogeographical processes.},

Abstract = {The feasibility to recover stored CO2 from the Utsira formation at
   Sleipner has been studied by reservoir simulation of a 15 years
   injection (until 2011) and a subsequent scenario where the CO2 is
   produced from a horizontal well under the cap rock. There are three
   important aspects related to the recovery of the stored CO2:
   Performance of temporary storage of CO2 for EOR purposes.
   Reproduction of mobile CO2 from formations that turn out to be less
   suitable for storage than anticipated.
   The reproduction simulation can resemble an open leaking well. The
   simulations are based on experimental drainage and imbibition curves for
   the corresponding injection and production phase. The results show that
   until 47.7\% of injected CO2 can be reproduced during a seven year
   non-stop production period. The results are based on a 15 year injection
   period, an irreducible water saturation of 5 \% and a residual CO2
   saturation after imbibition of 25 \%. Also the amount CO2 reproduced was
   found to be increasing with decreasing values of irreducible water
   saturation.
   Data from pre-injection seismic, well logs and petrophysical data are
   used to build a reservoir model. The Utsira formation is intersected by
   thin horizontal discontinuous shale layers that impede the vertical
   migration and cause entrapment of the CO2 in flat plumes. The transport
   properties of these shales are obtained by history matching the size of
   the plumes observed from seismic monitoring. To accommodate the
   necessary amount of CO2 the lateral size of the model had to be 5.2 km x
   7.9 km. To minimize numerical dispersion a relatively fine grid was
   required giving 2.1 million grid blocks in the model.
   The CO2 plume may be reached by a new well from the Sleipner A platform
   or through a sidetrack of the existing CO2 injection well and convert it
   to a producer. Placement of the producer is optimized for maximum
   reproduction by utilizing the local topography of the top seal. A
   producer could be drilled to avoid penetration of the cap-rock close to
   or above the CO2 plume and thereby avoid a potential leakage point after
   abandonment. The formation is high-permeable and relatively flat. The
   injected CO2 will therefore accumulate in thin plumes with large lateral
   extensions. Accordingly, recovery efficiency is low and the formation is
   less suitable for reproduction of CO2 compared to formations with a
   significant dome seal or dipping structures sealed by faults. The
   results give an important confirmation that it is possible to reproduce
   a significant amount of the mobile CO2 as a remediation option if a
   serious lack of integrity of the cap rock is detected. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {Recent rapid changes of air temperature on the western side of the
   Antarctic Peninsula results in increased sediment discharge and ice
   scouring frequencies in coastal regions. These changes are bound to
   especially affect slow growing, sessile filter feeders such as the
   Antarctic bivalve, Laternula elliptica, a long-lived and abundant key
   species with circumpolar distribution. We investigated the effect of
   sedimentation and ice scouring on small/young and large/old individuals
   at two closely located stations, distinctly influenced by both types of
   disturbance. Small individuals dealt better with disturbance in terms of
   their respiratory response to sediment exposure, reburrowing ability,
   and survival after injury, compared to larger animals. At the more
   disturbed station L. elliptica population density was lower, but larger
   animals reburrowed faster after iceberg disturbance and reduced their
   metabolic rate under strong sediment coverage, compared to larger
   animals of the less disturbed station, indicating that an adaptation or
   learning response to both types of disturbance may be possible. Smaller
   individuals were not influenced. Laternula elliptica seems capable of
   coping with the rapidly changing environmental conditions. Due to a
   decrease in population density and mean population lifespan, L.
   elliptica could however lose its key role in the bentho-pelagic carbon
   flux in areas of high sediment deposition.},

Abstract = {Removal of oil from water is strongly desired due to environmental
   pollution, and related studies are mainly limited to the material
   itself. Here, we propose an oil-water separation device, called a
   floating well, which includes a container for oil collection and a
   modified mesh screen for oil separation. The mesh screen is
   superhydrophilic to oil and superhydrophobic to water. The oil removal
   experiment was performed in a basin. Under the calm surface condition,
   the oil collection efficiency is shown to be 42-69\%. The inadequate oil
   collection is explained by the breakdown of a thin oil film above water
   to form an oil-free area, preventing direct contact between the
   separator and the oil. Sustained by a wave generator, we are surprised
   to find that with a low-frequency surface wave, the oil collection
   efficiency is increased to 98\%, and the collection speed reaches 2.5
   times that under the calm surface condition. The almost complete
   collection is due to the sustained contact between the separator and the
   oil, under which the surface wave continuously drives the oil film
   toward the separator from elsewhere, thus the oil-free area cannot be
   formed. Our work presents a new clue for large-scale in situ
   applications, in which the nature wave energy of river/sea can be the
   driving force for continuous oil separation and collection.},

Abstract = {We deal with the problem of a caisson breakwater embodying an OWC which
   is connected to the sea through a small opening. Waves cannot enter this
   OWC and the oscillations of the water column are due to the wave
   pressure on the small opening. The problem is solved through two
   alternative approaches. First alternative: we assume that the plant
   generates a progressive wave which is superimposed on the standing wave
   yielded by the reflection of the incident wave. Second alternative: a
   priori before the breakwater there may be every periodic waveform with
   the given frequency and a mean energy flux smaller than (or equal to)
   the mean energy flux of the incident waves, and we look for the waveform
   satisfying the equations of wave-OWC interaction, and giving the largest
   value of Phi/E (mean energy flux/ mean energy per unit surface). In some
   cases the solutions obtained through the two alternative approaches
   prove to be coincident with each other. In other cases the solution
   giving the largest value of Phi/E proves to be a sum of two standing
   waves with phase angles in space and time. In these cases (sum of two
   standing waves) the plant may absorb up to the 100\% of the incident
   wave energy. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objective Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in the colon has been
   widely adopted, but there is limited data on the histopathological
   effects of the differing electrosurgical currents (ESCs) used. We used
   an in vivo porcine model to compare the tissue effects of ESCs for snare
   resection and adjuvant margin ablation techniques. Design Standardised
   EMR was performed by a single endoscopist in 12 pigs. Two intersecting
   15 mm snare resections were performed. Resections were randomised 1:1
   using either a microprocessor-controlled current (MCC) or low-power
   coagulating current (LPCC). The lateral margins of each defect were
   treated with either argon plasma coagulation (APC) or snare tip soft
   coagulation (STSC). Colons were surgically removed at 72 hours. Two
   specialist pathologists blinded to the intervention assessed the
   specimens. Results 88 defects were analysed (median 7 per pig, median
   defect size 29x17 mm). For snare ESC effects, 156 tissue sections were
   assessed. LPCC was comparable to MCC for deep involvement of the colon
   wall. For margin ablation, 172 tissue sections were assessed. APC was
   comparable to STSC for deep involvement of the colon wall. Islands of
   preserved mucosa at the coagulated margin were more likely with APC
   compared with STSC (16\% vs 5\%, p=0.010). Conclusion For snare
   resection, MCC and LPCC did not produce significantly different tissue
   effects. The submucosal injectate may protect the underlying tissue, and
   technique may more strongly dictate the depth and extent of final
   injury. For margin ablation, APC was less uniform and complete compared
   with STSC.},

Abstract = {There are two power generation and seawater desalination plants
   currently operated at Barka, Oman: Barka I was commissioned in 2003, and
   Barka II in 2009. The cooling water from the power generation plants are
   mixed with reject brine (and other effluents) from desalination plants
   and are discharged through the same marine outfall systems. Therefore,
   during 2009, the brine discharge plumes changed from the previously
   positively buoyant from Barka I plant to a newly negatively buoyant from
   the combined Barka I and II plants. Consequently, instead of rising to
   the sea-surface, the new brine plume will now tend to sink and stay at
   the seabed. CORMIX simulations were carried out for two scenarios that
   represent the previous heated brine discharges and the new concentrated
   brine discharges from the Barka plants. Due to uncertainty in the input
   data, further simulations were carried out using salinity as a measure
   of the plume concentration for single port and multiport, and by varying
   the ambient current velocity, the effluent discharge density and flow
   rate. The results show that the water quality standards in the Omani
   coastal marine environment within the regulatory mixing zone at a 150 m
   radius from the discharge point have been met for both scenarios.
   However, the potential benthic impact due to the attachment of the new
   brine plume at the seabed should be monitored and investigated further.},

Title = {Effects of Protein and Lipid Levels in Practical Diets on Growth and

Abstract = {A 9-wk feeding experiment was conducted to estimate the optimal dietary
   protein and lipid levels for tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis Gunther
   (initial average weight of 43.8 +/- 0.18g). Six practical test diets
   were formulated to contain three protein levels (45, 50, and 55\%,
   respectively) at two lipid levels (12 and 16\%, respectively) with P/E
   ratios ranging from 87.1 to 110.5mg protein/kcal. Each diet was randomly
   fed to triplicate groups of 20 fish per tank (1000L). The results showed
   that fish fed the diet with 55\% protein and 12\% lipid (P/E ratio of
   110.5mg protein/kcal) had the highest thermal-unit growth coefficient
   (TGC), feed efficiency ratio, protein productive value, and energy
   retention. TGC was significantly increased with increasing dietary
   protein levels irrespective of dietary lipid levels (P<0.05). However,
   fish fed the diet with 16\% lipid showed significant lower growth than
   fish fed the diet with 12\% lipid. These results suggest that the diet
   containing 55\% protein and 12\% lipid with P/E of 110.5mg protein/kcal
   is optimal for tongue sole and the increase of dietary lipid level has
   no effective protein-sparing effect.},

Title = {Postglacial formation and dynamics of North Patagonian Rainforest in the
   Chonos Archipelago, southern Chile},

Abstract = {Pollen analysis of continuous sediment cores from two lakes in the
   northern Chonos Archipelago (44degreesS) in southern Chile shows a
   complete postglacial record of vegetation change. The fossil records
   indicate that deglaciation was complete in the northern Chonos by at
   least 13,600 C-14 yr BP. Ericaceous heath and grassland persisted for
   more than 600 years after deglaciation under the influence 14 of
   dry/cold climates and frequent burning.
   Nothofagus-Pilgerodendron-Podocarpus forest, with modern analogues in
   the southern 14 Chonos Archipelago, was established across the northern
   islands by 12,400 C-14 yr BP under increasingly warm and wet climates.
   There is no evidence for a return to cooler climates during the Younger
   Dryas chronozone. The rise of Tepualia stipularis and 14 Weinmannia
   trichosperma as important forest components between 10,600 and 6000 C-14
   yr BP may be associated with climates that were warmer than present. The
   collapse of Pilgerodendron communities during this time may have been
   triggered by a combination of factors related to disturbance frequency
   including tephra deposition events, fire and climate change. After 6000
   C-14 yr BP Pilgerodendron recovers and
   Nothofagus-Pilgerodendron-Tepualia forest persists until the present.
   European logging and burning activity may have increased the
   susceptibility of North Patagonian Rainforest to invasion by introduced
   species and to future collapse of the long-lived Pilgerodendron
   communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
