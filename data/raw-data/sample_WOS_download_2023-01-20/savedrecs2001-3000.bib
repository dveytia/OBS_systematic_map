Abstract = {Purposeful deep-sea carbon dioxide sequestration by direct injection of
   liquid CO(2) into the deep waters of the ocean has the potential to
   mitigate the rapid rise in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. One
   issue of concern for this carbon sequestration option is the impact of
   changes in seawater chemistry caused by CO(2) injection on deep-sea
   ecosystems. The effects of deep-sea carbon dioxide injection on infaunal
   deep-sea organisms were evaluated during a field experiment in 3600 m
   depth off California, in which liquid CO(2) was released on the
   seafloor. Exposure to the dissolution plume emanating from the liquid
   CO(2) resulted in high rates of mortality for flagellates, amoebae, and
   nematodes inhabiting sediments in close proximity to sites of CO(2)
   release. Results from this study indicate that large changes in seawater
   chemistry (i.e. pH reductions of similar to0.5-1.0 pH units) near CO(2)
   release sites will cause high mortality rates for nearby infaunal
   deep-sea communities.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the potential for the development of offshore
   wind power plants in Tunisia. The goal of this research is to increase
   the possibility of using renewable energy available in the country and
   reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The data used for the analysis is
   obtained from remote sensing satellites and weather stations located
   across the country's coastal regions. A multi-criteria decision model is
   built to perform geographic and technical analysis of the study area.
   This research reveals locations suitable for wind turbine installations.
   The results of this study aid the transition to wind energy with its
   optimal adaptation in Tunisia. Only 7\% of Tunisian offshore territory
   is found fit for the deployment of fixed-bottom wind farms. Six
   locations, in particular, were chosen in the Gulf of Tunisia, Gabes,
   Sousse, Sfax, Bizerte, and Djerba. The GIS-based methodology proposed in
   this paper can be applied to other offshore wind farm allocation
   investigations. The environmental impact of proposed wind farms on GHG
   reduction and employment opportunities are investigated. The suggested
   wind farms will reduce the GHG emissions and the energy price in Tunisia
   as well as create new jobs for society.},

Title = {Air pollution, greenhouse gases and climate change: Global and regional

Abstract = {Greenhouse gases (GHGs) warm the Surface and the atmosphere with
   significant implications for rainfall, retreat of glaciers and sea ice,
   sea level, among other factors. About 30 years ago, it was recognized
   that the increase in tropospheric ozone from air pollution (NOx, CO and
   others) is an important greenhouse forcing term. In addition, the
   recognition of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on stratospheric ozone and its
   climate effects linked chemistry and climate strongly. What is less
   recognized, however, is a comparably major global problem dealing with
   air pollution. Until about ten years ago, air pollution was thought to
   be just an urban or a local problem. But new data have revealed that air
   pollution is transported across continents and ocean basins due to fast
   long-range transport, resulting in trans-oceanic and trans-continental
   plumes of atmospheric brown Clouds (ABCs) containing sub micron size
   particles, i.e., aerosols. ABCs intercept Sunlight by absorbing as well
   as reflecting it, both of which lead to a large surface dimming. The
   dimming effect is enhanced further because aerosols may nucleate more
   cloud droplets, which makes the clouds reflect More solar radiation. The
   dimming has a Surface cooling effect and decreases evaporation of
   moisture from the surface, thus slows down the hydrological cycle. On
   the other hand, absorption of solar radiation by black carbon and some
   organics increase atmospheric hearing and tend to amplify greenhouse
   warming of the atmosphere.
   ABCs are concentrated in regional and mega-city hot spots. Long-range
   transport from these hot spots causes widespread plumes over the
   adjacent oceans. Such a pattern Of regionally concentrated Surface
   dimming and atmospheric Solar heating, accompanied by widespread dimming
   over the oceans, gives rise to large regional effects. Only during the
   last decade, we have begun to comprehend the surprisingly large regional
   impacts. In S. Asia and N. Africa, the large north-south gradient in the
   ABC dimming has altered both the north-south gradients in sea Surface
   temperatures and land-ocean contrast in surface temperatures, which in
   turn slow down the monsoon circulation and decrease rainfall over the
   continents. On the other hand, heating by black carbon warms the
   atmosphere at elevated levels from 2 to 6 kin, where most tropical
   glaciers are located, thus strengthening the effect of GHGs on retreat
   of snow packs and glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan glaciers.
   Globally, the surface cooling effect of ABCs may have masked as Much
   47\% of the global warming by greenhouse gases, with an uncertainty
   range of 20-80\%. This presents a dilemma since efforts to curb air
   pollution may unmask the ABC cooling effect and enhance the surface
   warming. Thus efforts to reduce GHGs and air pollution should be done
   under one common framework. The uncertainties in our understanding of
   the ABC effects are large, but we are discovering new ways in which
   human activities are changing the climate and the environment. (C) 2008

Abstract = {It is claimed that country ownership enables equitable adaption by
   ensuring that adaptation interventions address priorities of local level
   vulnerable populations. This paper uses a framings approach to
   understand whether country owned interventions are aligned with local
   level adaptation needs. Three framing - the rights and responsibility,
   capabilities and recognition framings-are used to identify principles of
   justice reflected in adaptation interventions and compares them to those
   expressed by local level communities expected to benefit from these
   interventions. A case study of a Least Developed Countries Fund-funded
   and Global Environment Facility-administered coastal adaptation project
   in Tanzania is used. The analysis finds differences between framings by
   the project and local communities. The project portrays a rights and
   responsibilities framing with emphasis on government-led technocratic
   adaptation. Local level communities prioritize the capabilities framing,
   where local natural resource management institutions are considered
   necessary for mediating between resource access by resource-dependent
   households and resource conservation for coastal adaptation. The
   findings suggest that country ownership may not necessarily be equitable
   as local level adaptation priorities can fail to be reflected in country
   owned interventions.},

Abstract = {Accelerating Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet ice mass losses and
   potential West Antarctic Ice Sheet instability may lead to higher than
   previously anticipated future sea levels. The New York City Panel on
   Climate Change Antarctic Rapid Ice Melt (ARIM) upper-end, low
   probability sea level rise (SLR) scenario, which incorporates recent ice
   loss trends, improved ice sheet-ocean-atmosphere modeling, and potential
   ice sheet destabilization, projects SLR of up to 2.1 m by the 2080s and
   up to 2.9 m by 2100, at high greenhouse gas emissions ((SPCC, 2019).
   These results exceed previous high-end SLR projections (90th percentile)
   of 1.5 m by the 2080s and 1.9 m by 2100, relative to 2000-2004 (NPCC,
   2015).
   By 2100, the 1\% annual chance (100-year) floodplain could cover 1/3 of
   the city's total area under ARIM; around 1/5 of the area could be
   flooded during monthly high tides. Some low-lying locations could become
   permanently inundated by late century. Will New York City coastal
   resiliency initiatives, guided, in part by NPCC findings, suffice for
   very high sea levels? Additional research is needed to determine
   technological, environmental, or economic limitations to coastal
   protection and to decide when and where strategic relocation may become
   necessary.},

Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are essential for regulating the global carbon budget
   through soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG - CO2, CH4,
   and N2O) fluxes. The conversion of coastal wetlands to agricultural land
   alters these fluxes' magnitude and direction (uptake/release). However,
   the extent and drivers of change of GHG fluxes are still unknown for
   many tropical regions. We measured soil GHG fluxes from three natural
   coastal wetlands - mangroves, salt marsh, and freshwater tidal forests -
   and two alternative agricultural land uses - sugarcane farming and
   pastures for cattle grazing (ponded and dry conditions). We assessed
   variations throughout different climatic conditions (dry-cool, dry-hot,
   and wet-hot) within 2 years of measurements (2018-2020) in tropical
   Australia. The wet pasture had by far the highest CH4 emissions with
   1231 +/- 386 mgm(-2) d(-1), which were 200-fold higher than any other
   site. Dry pastures and sugarcane were the highest emitters of N2O with
   55 +/- 9 mgm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period) and 11 +/- 3 mgm(-2) d(-1)
   (hot-dry period, coinciding with fertilisation), respectively. Dry
   pastures were also the highest emitters of CO2 with 20 +/- 1 gm(-2)
   d(-1) (wet-hot period). The three coastal wetlands measured had lower
   emissions, with salt marsh uptake of -0.55 +/- 0.23 and -1.19 +/- 0.08
   gm(-2) d(-1) of N2O and CO2, respectively, during the dry-hot period.
   During the sampled period, sugarcane and pastures had higher total
   cumulative soil GHG emissions (CH4 C N2O) of 7142 and 56 124CO(2-eq) kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to coastal wetlands with 144 to 884CO(2-eq) kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1) (where CO2-eq is CO2 equivalent). Restoring unproductive
   sugarcane land or pastures (especially ponded ones) to coastal wetlands
   could provide significant GHG mitigation.},

Abstract = {A version of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model that is coupled to an
   ocean is used to investigate the separate effects of climate change and
   ozone depletion on the dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere (SH)
   stratosphere. This is achieved by performing three sets of simulations
   extending from 1960 to 2099: 1) greenhouse gases (GHGs) fixed at 1960
   levels and ozone depleting substances (ODSs) varying in time, 2) ODSs
   fixed at 1960 levels and GHGs varying in time, and 3) both GHGs and ODSs
   varying in time. The response of various dynamical quantities to the GHG
   and ODS forcings is shown to be additive; that is, trends computed from
   the sum of the first two simulations are equal to trends from the third.
   Additivity is shown to hold for the zonal mean zonal wind and
   temperature, the mass flux into and out of the stratosphere, and the
   latitudinally averaged wave drag in SH spring and summer, as well as for
   final warming dates. Ozone depletion and recovery causes seasonal
   changes in lower-stratosphere mass flux, with reduced polar downwelling
   in the past followed by increased downwelling in the future in SH
   spring, and the reverse in SH summer. These seasonal changes are
   attributed to changes in wave drag caused by ozone-induced changes in
   the zonal mean zonal winds. Climate change, on the other hand, causes a
   steady decrease in wave drag during SH spring, which delays the
   breakdown of the vortex, resulting in increased wave drag in summer.},

Title = {End-to-End Modeling Reveals Species-Specific Effects of Large-Scale
   Coastal Restoration on Living Resources Facing Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion and wetland loss are affecting Louisiana to such an
   extent that the loss of land between 1932 and 2016 was close to 5,000
   km(2). To mitigate this decline, coastal protection and restoration
   projects are being planned and implemented by the State of Louisiana,
   United States. The Louisiana Coastal Master Plan (CMP) is an adaptive
   management approach that provides a suite of projects that are predicted
   to build or maintain land and protect coastal communities. Restoring the
   coast with this 50-year large-scale restoration and risk reduction plan
   has the potential to change the biomass and distribution of economically
   and ecologically important fisheries species in this region. However,
   not restoring the coast may have negative impacts on these species due
   to the loss of habitat. This research uses an ecosystem model to
   evaluate the effects of plan implementation versus a future without
   action (FWOA) on the biomass and distribution of fisheries species in
   the estuaries over 50 years of model simulations. By simulating effects
   using a spatially-explicit ecosystem model, not only can the changes in
   biomass in response to plan implementation be evaluated, but also the
   distribution of species in response to the planned restoration and risk
   reduction projects. Simulations are performed under two relative sea
   level rise (SLR) scenarios to understand the effects of climate change
   on project performance and subsequent fisheries species biomass and
   distribution. Simulation output of eight economically important
   fisheries species shows that the plan mostly results in increases in
   species biomass, but that the outcomes are species-specific and
   basin-specific. The SLR scenario highly affects the amount of wetland
   habitat maintained after 50 years (with higher levels of wetland loss
   under increased SLR) and, subsequently, the biomass of species depending
   on that habitat. Species distribution results can be used to identify
   expected changes for specific species on a regional basis. By making
   this type of information available to resource managers, precautionary
   measures of ecosystem management and adaptation can be implemented.},

Abstract = {To evaluate the influence of human activities on ecosystem respiration
   (CO2) and CH4 fluxes and determine the seasonal and spatial variations,
   we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes at four sampling sites (west side of the
   seawall, WSS; oilfield, OF; Spartina alterniflora coastal marsh, SCM;
   aquaculture pond, ACP) in the Yellow River estuary from June to December
   in 2013. Both CO2 and CH4 fluxes showed seasonal and spatial variations
   in the Yellow River estuary. The average CO2 fluxes from WSS, OF, SCM
   and ACP were 125.36, 111.03, 241.97 and -39.49 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), while
   CH4 fluxes were -0.0110, -0.0165, 0.2012 and 0.0034 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1),
   respectively. Spatial variations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were mainly
   affected by vegetation and soil moisture. There were significant
   relationships between both CO2 fluxes in WSS and SCM and CH4 flux in SCM
   with temperature. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were mainly affected by the
   interactions of thermal conditions and other abiotic factors in OF and
   ACP. Human activities have great effect on greenhouse gas emission,
   especially in the area where exotic-species S. alterniflora invaded. The
   construction of seawall blocked sea water transporting into the study
   area leading to low soil moisture which accelerated CO2 emission.
   Aquaculture ponds act as an emission of CH4 and consumption of CO2.},

Abstract = {According to the population growth, the energy demand has grown rapidly.
   Besides these, economic and technological improvement demands more
   energy utilization. But the world's treasured energies are limited. It
   is also important that more uses of conventional energy resources create
   a huge greenhouse gas which have an adverse effect on global ecosystem.
   But without energy, modernization of our civilization is quite
   impossible. So, to save our planet, we have to choose some alternative
   resources of energy. That alternative energy sources should be renewable
   and sustainable. In this world we can find different types of renewable
   energy in different geographical position. The main advantages of
   renewable energy are that, it has a little effect on ecosystem, it can
   be collected even in bad weather condition and overall it is a weapon to
   fight against environmental pollution. It has a great influence on
   economic growth, job creation and energy security. But there are some
   problems in storing of renewable energy. Scientists and investors are
   continuously trying to overcome this problem. Sometime, protest from
   common people during the installation of renewable energy set up, make
   the situation difficult. Employment opportunities and some facilities
   reduce the protest against the application of sustainable energy. Public
   education and awareness on renewable energy helps the policymaker to
   make decisions. From study of review papers about the renewable energy
   it is found that a massive experiment is going on sustainable energy.
   This paper has established an idea about different renewable energy
   application, their difficulties of application and their solution. It is
   also observed that with rising government strategy to reduce carbon
   emission for economic growth and with proper technique and storage
   arrangement, the renewable energy application will significantly expand
   in few years.},

Title = {Beyond LCOE: A multi-criteria evaluation framework for offshore
   renewable energy projects},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {161},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The transition to low-carbon energy systems is a complex process that
   implies radical technological changes, greenhouse gas emission
   reductions, and benefits to the local economies yet, also significant
   investment, a need for capacity building, strengthening supply chains
   and supporting legal frameworks. Consequently, the choice of renewable
   energy technologies should be based on a comprehensive assessment
   addressing the different dimensions that are affected. Clean energy
   technologies are traditionally evaluated on the basis of their
   techno-economic performance. Such an approach penalises emerging energy
   technologies that are generally more capital-intensive given their
   innovation requirement and the lack of support mechanisms facilitating
   their industrial roll-out. In this paper, a multi-criteria evaluation
   framework is proposed encompassing three important broad dimensions:
   techno-economics, environment and socio-economics. The applicability and
   flexibility of the proposed evaluation framework are demonstrated on
   different case studies. First, the hypothetical deployment of a floating
   offshore wind farm both in Scotland and Portugal is evaluated. Later,
   the proposed framework is used to evaluate the deployments of wave
   energy devices in the same two locations. The results show that this
   multi-criteria approach provides a more holistic overview of the
   performance and implications of renewable energy technologies,
   particularly emerging ones, and can better support decision-and
   policy-making in the medium-and long-term. Furthermore, the framework
   can be used by researchers, investors, developers and/or analysts to
   assess energy planning alternatives.},

Title = {Groundwater discharge drives water quality and greenhouse gas emissions
   in a tidal wetland},
Journal = {WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-151},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle as they can
   be sources or sinks for greenhouse gases. Groundwater discharge into
   wetlands can affect the water chemistry and act as a source of dissolved
   greenhouse gases, including CO2 and CH4. In this study, surface water
   quality parameters and CO2 and CH4 concentrations were evaluated in a
   tidal wetland (Hunter Wetlands National Park, Australia) using time
   series measurements. Radon (Rn-222), a natural groundwater tracer, was
   used to investigate the role of groundwater as a pathway for
   transporting dissolved CO2 and CH(4 )into the wetland. In addition,
   water-to-air CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the wetland were also estimated.
   The results showed a high concentration of radon in wetland surface
   water, indicating the occurrence of groundwater discharge. Radon
   concentration had a strong negative relationship with water depth with a
   determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.7, indicating that tidal pumping
   was the main driver of groundwater discharge to the wetland. Radon
   concentration also showed a positive relationship with CO2 and CH4
   concentrations (R-2 = 0.4 and 0.5, respectively), while the time series
   data revealed that radon, CO2, and CH4 concentrations peaked
   concurrently during low tides. This implied that groundwater discharge
   was a source of CO2 and CH4 to the wetland. The wetland had an average
   water-to-air CO2 flux of 99.1 mmol/(m(2).d), twice higher than the
   global average CO2 flux from wetlands. The average CH4 flux from the
   wetland was estimated to be 0.3 mmol/(m(2).d), which is at the higher
   end of the global CH4 flux range for wetlands. The results showed that
   groundwater discharge could be an important, yet unaccounted source of
   CO2 and CH(4 )to tidal wetlands. This work has implications for tidal
   wetland carbon budgets and emphasizes the role of groundwater as a
   subsurface pathway for carbon transport. (C) 2022 Hohai University.

Abstract = {Climate change is known to be dominantly caused by the increased
   concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, in particular CO2.
   To prevent excessive accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and the
   perturbation of natural carbon cycles, carbon capture and sequestration
   (CCS) is urgently needed. In this review, a brief overview is provided
   for both biotic and abiotic CO2 sequestration pathways. Special focus is
   given to sequestration approaches pertaining to clathrate hydrates. CO2
   hydrate, a solid compound made of molecular CO2 enclathrated in
   crystalline lattices formed by water molecules, is an attractive option
   for long-term CO2 sequestration due to its higher density than seawater,
   stability below moderate oceanic/permafrost depths, low susceptibility
   to fluid flow perturbation when formed in sediments. This review
   compiles and summarizes the research efforts made on CO2 sequestration
   as hydrates. Various approaches of CO2 sequestration via gas hydrates
   are discussed, including storage in seawater, sediments under the sea
   floor, permafrost regions, methane hydrate reservoirs via CO2-CH4
   exchange, and depleted gas fields. The technical feasibility and
   potential storage capacity of these approaches are analyzed. Finally,
   the key scientific challenges and prospects are identified and
   highlighted. Issues related to economics, scale-up, and relative
   attractiveness versus non-hydrate methods are touched upon but are not
   the focus of this work.},

Abstract = {Climate change studies are often interdisciplinary by nature,
   incorporating many domains of science, economics, and political theory.
   Integrated assessment (IA) aims to bring diverse scientific, economics
   and social science expertise together to provide analysis and advice
   that comprehensively addresses all or at least many aspects of the
   climate change issue. IA methods have been applied to many areas of
   climate change providing insights into areas such as optimal timing of
   emission reductions, weighting of different greenhouse gases, or impacts
   of biofuel policies. Additionally, IAs have identified key uncertainties
   that should be priorities of future research, such as the need to
   understand oceanic heat uptake in order to better constrain climate
   sensitivity and predict future timing of temperature change. These
   assessments have also served to establish ongoing communication within
   the community of researchers, and between researchers and policy makers.
   In complex scientific issues it is often difficult for policy makers and
   the public to sort out conflicting scientific views, and an
   authoritative assessment process can provide consensus views on the
   issue, accepting that in some cases the ``consensus{''}' may be that
   some aspects of the issue remain unresolved. This review explores the
   history and applications of these IAs, and identifies avenues for future
   emphasis. We briefly review the whole field of IAs of climate change,
   but focus on the role of formal computational frameworks in IA models.

Abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases could lead to undesirable
   effects on oceans in coming centuries. Drawing on recommendations
   published by the German Advisory Council on Global Change, levels of
   unacceptable global marine change (so-called guardrails) are defined in
   terms of global mean temperature, sea level rise, and ocean
   acidification. A global-mean climate model {[}the Aggregated Carbon
   Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model (ACC2)] is coupled with
   an economic module {[}taken from the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy
   Model (DICE)] to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to derive CO2
   emission pathways that both minimize abatement costs and are compatible
   with these guardrails. Additionally, the ``tolerable windows
   approach{''} is used to calculate a range of CO2 emissions paths that
   obey the guardrails as well as a restriction on mitigation rate.
   Prospects of meeting the global mean temperature change guardrail (2
   degrees and 0.2 degrees C decade(-1) relative to preindustrial) depend
   strongly on assumed values for climate sensitivity: at climate
   sensitivities >3 degrees C the guardrail cannot be attained under any
   CO2 emissions reduction strategy without mitigation of non-CO2
   greenhouse gases. The ocean acidification guardrail (0.2 unit pH decline
   relative to preindustrial) is less restrictive than the absolute
   temperature guardrail at climate sensitivities >2.5 degrees C but
   becomes more constraining at lower climate sensitivities. The sea level
   rise and rate of rise guardrails (1 m and 5 cm decade(-1)) are
   substantially less stringent for ice sheet sensitivities derived in the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment
   Report, but they may already be committed to violation if ice sheet
   sensitivities consistent with semiempirical sea level rise projections
   are assumed.},

Abstract = {New terminology is needed for the assessment of wetland restoration
   projects, focusing on progress towards ecological goals rather than the
   yes/no alternative of success versus failure. Mitigation projects should
   be evaluated based on `compliance' of specific mitigation criteria.
   Peer-reviewed assessments of wetland restoration projects have focused
   on appropriate parameters (topographic, hydrologic, soil, vegetation,
   and animal components); however, for the most part, they have evaluated
   small, newly restored wetlands over the short-term with little repeated
   sampling. Future assessments should focus on understanding problems at a
   particular site by identifying cause-effect mechanisms. We review a case
   study from San Diego Bay where detailed assessments led to the
   identification of problems and subsequent management alternatives. We
   also recommend the use of two novel approaches: experimentation and the
   evaluation of ecosystem resiliency to unplanned disturbances. These
   assessments will provide a better understanding of ecosystem functioning
   and enhance current comparisons of natural and restored systems. A
   stronger science base for wetland restoration and adaptive management do
   not guarantee that restoration targets will be reached; however, these
   approaches will identify the causes of problems and allow us to predict
   whether or not restoration targets can be leached in a timely manner.

Title = {Uncertainty and Bias in Global to Regional Scale Assessments of Current
   and Future Coastal Flood Risk},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study provides a literature-based comparative assessment of
   uncertainties and biases in global to world-regional scale assessments
   of current and future coastal flood risks, considering mean and extreme
   sea-level hazards, the propagation of these into the floodplain, people
   and coastal assets exposed, and their vulnerability. Globally, by far
   the largest bias is introduced by not considering human adaptation,
   which can lead to an overestimation of coastal flood risk in 2100 by up
   to factor 1300. But even when considering adaptation, uncertainties in
   how coastal societies will adapt to sea-level rise dominate with a
   factor of up to 27 all other uncertainties. Other large uncertainties
   that have been quantified globally are associated with socio-economic
   development (factors 2.3-5.8), digital elevation data (factors 1.2-3.8),
   ice sheet models (factor 1.6-3.8) and greenhouse gas emissions (factors
   1.6-2.1). Local uncertainties that stand out but have not been
   quantified globally, relate to depth-damage functions, defense failure
   mechanisms, surge and wave heights in areas affected by tropical
   cyclones (in particular for large return periods), as well as nearshore
   interactions between mean sea-levels, storm surges, tides and waves.
   Advancing the state-of-the-art requires analyzing and reporting more
   comprehensively on underlying uncertainties, including those in data,
   methods and adaptation scenarios. Epistemic uncertainties in digital
   elevation, coastal protection levels and depth-damage functions would be
   best reduced through open community-based efforts, in which many
   scholars work together in collecting and validating these data.},

Title = {Combining gray and green infrastructure to improve coastal resilience:

Abstract = {Shoreline erosion and storm tide inundation increasingly threaten
   coastal populations, infrastructure and economies. Hard infrastructure,
   known as gray infrastructure (e.g. concrete seawalls), has commonly been
   used to protect coastal communities but is expensive to build, maintain,
   and deteriorates coastal vegetation. Green infrastructure (e.g. restored
   or conserved mangrove and marsh ecosystems) delivers nature-based
   coastal protection but in comparatively lower density coastal areas.
   Nowadays a more popularized approach to coastal protection is hybrid
   eco-engineering. In this study, we discuss lessons-learnt on how the
   hybridization of engineered structures and wetland restoration practices
   compared with traditional gray and green approaches. We contrast hybrid
   applications in mangrove and tidal marsh areas in the UK and south-east
   Asia. The majority (70\%) of successful hybrid infrastructure cases were
   underpinned by understanding of ecological and hydrological changes in
   response to infrastructure and involved a wide range of stakeholders. In
   terms of construction and maintenance cost, limited data suggested that
   hybrid infrastructure may be more cost effective than gray
   infrastructure, but more expensive than green; however, data were very
   limited and therefore we suggest the need for further cost-benefit
   analyses to inform a robust comparison. Development of new technologies
   should see growing efficacy of future hybrid infrastructure in
   mitigating coastal flood risks.},

Abstract = {Offshore turbines are getting an increasingly more important role in the
   development of wind power, particularly in the northwestern part of
   Europe. Presently two wind farms exist in Denmark and, before 2008, 750
   MW of offshore wind power has to be established with the Danish
   utilities as the main entrepreneur. In the long-term perspective,
   offshore wind turbines are expected to play an even more important role.
   According to the latest Danish energy plan, the total capacity of wind
   turbines is assumed to increase to approx. 5400 MW by 2030, including
   more than 3600 MW offshore turbines. This implies that wind-generated
   electricity will cover more than 50\% of total electricity consumption
   by 2030. Liberalizing the electricity industry and attempts to reduce
   the emissions of greenhouse gases are presently the two dominant trends
   in European energy policy. In a Danish context, it is expected that the
   latter issue will require the contribution from renewable energy
   technologies, but at present most renewables can not compete on their
   own with conventional technologies. One model of generating additional
   payments to renewable technologies is to develop a separate green market
   which has just been decided in Denmark. With this as the starting point
   this paper discusses how a green certificate market may be set-up,
   paying special attention to the integration of offshore wind power into
   such a green market.},

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation Options for Coastal Communities and Local
   Governments},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events and failure to adapt to the likely impacts of
   climate change are two of the most significant threats to humanity.
   Therefore, many local communities are preparing adaptation plans. Even
   so, much of what was done has not been published in the peer-reviewed
   literature. This means that consideration of adaptation options for
   local communities is limited. With the objective of assisting in the
   development of adaptation plans, we present 80 adaptation options
   suitable for coastal communities that can be applied by local
   governments. They are a catena of options from defend to co-exist and
   finally, retreat that progresses as impacts become less manageable.
   Options are organized according to their capacity to protect local
   properties and infrastructure, natural systems, food production,
   availability of fresh and drinking water and well-being of the local
   population, as these are likely to be affected by climate change. To
   respond to multiple threats, `soft' options, such as awareness raising,
   planning, political articulation and financial incentives, insurance and
   professional skills enhancement, can be encouraged immediately at
   relatively low cost and are reversible. For specific threats, options
   emphasize change in management practices as pre-emptive measures. Key
   audiences for this work are communities and local governments starting
   to consider priority actions to respond to climate change impacts.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},

Volume = {58},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal zones are vital to small islands due to limited land
   availability and ocean exposure. Their significance and resident
   dependence result in a need to address unique small island coastal zone
   concerns. Recent population concentrations and increased economic
   activity along with accompanying lucrative coastal development are
   posing significant threats to human and natural system well-being.
   Potential environmental hazards therefore play an important role in
   coastal vulnerability and risk assessment, and it is only by
   understanding causes and consequences that policy makers, along with
   scientists and the public, can establish appropriate mitigation
   measures. This paper addresses the lack of specific small island
   studies, including their unique circumstances. Coastal hazards are
   assessed and effective mitigation strategies suggested. A case study of
   the Azores archipelago highlights specific coastal hazards and
   demonstrates the importance of public participation when implementing
   mitigation measures. Furthermore, the inclusion of an external neutral
   and unbiased coastal management expert within the public participation
   process facilitated successful development of Azorean Coastal Zone
   Management Plans.},

Title = {Model for Estimation of Fuel Consumption of Cruise Ships},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article presents a model to estimate the energy use and fuel
   consumption of cruise ships that sail Norwegian waters. Automatic
   identification system (AIS) data and technical information about cruise
   ships provided input to the model, including service speed, total power,
   and number of engines. The model was tested against real-world data
   obtained from a small cruise vessel and both a medium and large cruise
   ship. It is sensitive to speed and the corresponding engine load profile
   of the ship. A crucial determinate for total fuel consumption is also
   associated with hotel functions, which can make a large contribution to
   the overall energy use of cruise ships. Real-world data fits the model
   best when ship speed is 70-75\% of service speed. With decreased or
   increased speed, the model tends to diverge from real-world
   observations. The model gives a proxy for calculation of fuel
   consumption associated with cruise ships that sail to Norwegian waters
   and can be used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and to evaluate
   energy reduction strategies for cruise ships.},

Abstract = {Many remote areas in developing countries such as Africa and island
   developing nations rely on expensive diesel grid even though there is a

   energy and efficient water heating systems would lower the electricity
   cost and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper introduces an optimal

   powered using integrated energy systems. The model can lead to 5.5\% of

Title = {Alternatives to the global warming potential for comparing climate
   impacts of emissions of greenhouse gases},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {281-302},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Global Warming Potential (GWP) is used within the Kyoto Protocol to
   the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as a metric
   for weighting the climatic impact of emissions of different greenhouse
   gases. The GWP has been subjected to many criticisms because of its
   formulation, but nevertheless it has retained some favour because of the
   simplicity of its design and application, and its transparency compared
   to proposed alternatives. Here, two new metrics are proposed, which are
   based on a simple analytical climate model. The first metric is called
   the Global Temperature Change Potential and represents the temperature
   change at a given time due to a pulse emission of a gas (GTP(P)); the
   second is similar but represents the effect of a sustained emission
   change (hence GTP(S)). Both GTP(P) and GTP(S) are presented as relative
   to the temperature change due to a similar emission change of a
   reference gas, here taken to be carbon dioxide. Both metrics are
   compared against an upwelling-diffusion energy balance model that
   resolves land and ocean and the hemispheres. The GTP(P) does not perform
   well, compared to the energy balance model, except for long-lived gases.
   By contrast, the GTP(S) is shown to perform well relative to the energy
   balance model, for gases with a wide variety of lifetimes. It is also
   shown that for time horizons in excess of about 100 years, the GTP(S)
   and GWP produce very similar results, indicating an alternative
   interpretation for the GAT. The GTP(S) retains the advantage of the GWP
   in terms of transparency, and the relatively small number of input
   parameters required for calculation. However, it has an enhanced
   relevance, as it is further down the cause-effect chain of the impacts
   of greenhouse gases emissions and has an unambiguous interpretation. It
   appears to be robust to key uncertainties and simplifications in its
   derivation and may be an attractive alternative to the GWP.},

Title = {Optimization of the electricity generation mix using economic criteria
   with zero-emissions for stand-alone systems: Case applied to Grand
   Canary Island in Spain},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {151},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The extensive use of greenhouse gas-free energy sources is essential to
   achieve net zero emissions targets in electricity generation by
   mid-century; if such sources also increase the economic competitiveness
   by producing cheaper energy, the outlook is even better. With this
   purpose, the current study presents the combined use of the NuScale
   design, a promising type of small modular reactor (SMR), along with
   renewable sources and storage technologies. The widespread use of highly
   variable generation sources, such as wind and solar PV, poses
   sig-nificant challenges in trying to match electricity generation and
   demand. Therefore, more reliable generation sources and/or storage
   technologies combined with these highly volatile sources are necessary
   to meet the de-mand with guarantees and affordable costs. This issue is
   even more pronounced in isolated regions, such as islands, where at
   least one more reliable generation source and/or substantial energy
   storage capacity is required. The system, in many cases, is autonomous
   and needs to be 100\% self-sufficient. Furthermore, to achieve the
   future goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to
   eliminate fossil fuels in all areas, particularly in power generation,
   which significantly contributes to the total greenhouse gas emissions.
   There-fore, developing techniques to assess the feasibility of the
   combined use of different carbon-free technologies is required. Using
   renewable energies with nuclear energy coupled with storage technologies
   is a very good pos-sibility to achieve these objectives. It was, in all
   likelihood, the best option in the case of isolated locations where the
   system must be self-sufficient precisely because of its isolation. The
   use of nuclear energy is a key part of the analysis if there is no
   reliable energy capable of covering approximately the off-peak demand,
   the rest of the systems will have to be greatly oversized, i.e., the
   power to be installed from renewables and/or storage will be
   unaffordable. Therefore, it is very useful to study these problems,
   especially in the case of islands. Specifically, this analysis has been
   applied to the Island of Grand Canary in Spain. This island has about
   1500 km2 and nearly one million inhabitants, with a off-peak electricity
   demand of about 250 MW and a peak demand value of about 500 MW. The
   software HOMER was used to analyze and compare different alternatives,
   estimating the best combination to get the lower Levelized Cost Of

Abstract = {The CO2 emission reduction policy of the International Maritime
   Organization (IMO) recommends that the operation of ships, managed by
   maritime transport companies, should be energy-efficient. An evaluation
   method that can determine how successfully a ship implements the energy
   efficiency plan is proposed in this study. To develop this method, the
   measures required for energy-efficient ship operations according to the
   Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) operational guidelines
   were selected. The weights of the selected measures, which indicate how
   they contribute to the energy-efficient operation of a ship, were
   derived using a survey based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
   method. Consequently, using these measures and their weights, a new
   evaluation method was proposed. This evaluation method was applied to
   shipping companies in South Korea, and their ship operation energy
   efficiency indices were derived and compared. This evaluation method
   will be useful to the government and shipping companies in assessing the
   energy efficiency of ship operations.},

   Energy Storage},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Cities are concentrations of economic, social, and technical assets,
   which are fundamental to addressing climate change challenges. Renewable
   energy sources are growing fast in cities to mitigate greenhouse gas
   emissions in response to these challenges. In this transition urban
   decentralized energy shares technical and economic characteristics with
   energy islands. This is reflected in that island energy systems
   essentially operate off-grid which as a modus operandi can offer lessons
   to small-scale urban systems. With the expansion of urban areas,
   communities, especially small-scale ones, are sometimes further away
   from the main power infrastructure. Providing power supply to these
   communities would require significant investment to the existing power
   system, either to improve its grid infrastructure or power supply
   facilities. The energy islands have for some time now lent themselves to
   energy innovation including smart grid and battery storage applications.
   In this research we conceptualize that urban energy communities can be
   benefitted by knowledge transfer from energy islands in several fronts.
   We specifically put forward a life-cycle cost-benefit analysis model to
   evaluate the economics of battery storage system used in small
   communities from a life-cycle perspective. In this research we put
   forward a novel cost-benefit analysis model. Our results show that the
   inclusion of externalities can improve the economic value of battery
   systems significantly. Nevertheless, the economic performance is still
   largely dependent on several parameters, including capacity cost,
   discharging price, and charging cost. We conclude that existing
   electricity price structures (e.g., using household electricity price as
   a benchmark) struggle to guarantee sufficient economic returns except in
   very favorable circumstances; therefore, governmental support is deemed
   necessary.},

Year = {2015},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Demographic change, dramatic population increase and rapid industrial
   growth are major trends emerging in Malaysia. Climate change and
   depletion of fossil fuel along with the rise in petroleum prices have
   forced the Malaysian Government to rethink strategies to be more in line
   with other developed countries including the decision to embark on
   renewable energy (RE) resources as a better source of energy amongst the
   global energy mix. The Malaysian Government is making frantic efforts to
   make policies, RE programmes and incentives more effective so as to
   promote and develop the use of RE. Malaysia is rich with fossil fuel but
   these are fast depleting. Although RE is necessary, current RE resources
   are still not enough. Therefore, exploration into other resources must
   be considered in order to meet future energy demands. The objective of
   this paper is to identify the potential of available renewable energy
   resources in Malaysia as well as the country's current implementation
   strategies. This paper also discusses the different RE policies in
   Malaysia. In order to determine the potential of RE, various sources and
   published materials in conferences, international journals and
   information released by relevant government bodies and miscellaneous
   resources are used. This research has revealed that among all the
   renewable energy sources that are present in Malaysia, biomass and solar
   energy are the most prospective ones. Plus, renewable energy (RE)
   sources are quite advantageous as they are free from greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions and related global warming effects. They can also be
   applied in off-grid electricity generation for rural communities. (C)

Abstract = {Moving towards RER has become imperative to achieve sustainable
   development goals (SDG). Renewable energy resources (RER) are
   characterized by uncertainty whereas, most of them are unpredictable and
   variable according to climatic conditions. This paper focuses on
   RER-based electrical power plants as a base to achieve two different
   goals, SDG7 (obtaining reasonably priced clean energy) and SDG13
   (reducing climate change). These goals in turn would support other
   environmental, social, and economic SDG. This study is constructed based
   on two pillars which are technological developments and life cycle
   assessment (LCA) for wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power plants.
   To support the study and achieve the main point, many essential topics
   are presented in brief such as fossil fuels' environmental impact,
   economic sustainability linkage to RER, the current contribution of RER
   in energy consumption worldwide and barriers and environmental effects
   of RER under consideration. As a result, solar and wind energy lead the
   RER electricity market with major contributions of 27.7\% and 26.92\%,
   respectively, biomass and geothermal are still of negligible
   contributions at 4.68\% and 0.5\%, respectively, offshore HAWT dominated
   other WT techniques, silicon-based PV cells dominated other solar PV
   technologies with 27\% efficiency, combustion thermochemical energy
   conversion process dominated other biomass energy systems techniques,
   due to many concerns geothermal energy system is not preferable. Many
   emerging technologies need to receive more public attention, intensive
   research, financial support, and governmental facilities including
   effective policies and data availability.},

   efficiency, to optimize the energy consumption and to reduce the
   greenhouse gases (GHG's) emission. The maritime players came with
   innovative ideas in the ship design and ship performance management.
   These innovative solutions have been implemented, i.e. Non-ballast
   design, retrofit of the bulbous bow, retrofit of the propeller,
   low-steaming, air lubrication system and use of clean energy. This paper
   reviews these innovative solutions and presents their impact on the

Abstract = {The studies and development of coal seam gas (CSG) have been conducted
   for more than 30 years in China, but few of China's CSG projects have
   achieved large-scale commercial success; faced with the boom of shale
   gas, some investors are beginning to lose patience and confidence in
   CSG. China currently faces the following question: Should the government
   continue to vigorously support the development of the CSG industry? To
   provide a reference for policy makers and investors, this paper
   calculates the EROIstnd {[}a standardized energy return on investment
   (EROI) method], EROIide (the maximum theoretical EROI), EROI3,i (EROI
   considering the energy investment in transport), and EROI3,1+e (EROI
   with environmental inputs) of a single vertical CSG well in the
   Fanzhuang CSG project in the Qinshui Basin. The energy payback time
   (EPT) and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the CSG systems are also
   calculated. The results show that over a 15-year lifetime, EROIstnd,
   EROIide, EROI3,1, and EROI3,1+e are expected to deliver EROIs of
   approximately 11:1, 20:1, 7:1, and 6:1, respectively. The EPT within
   different boundaries is no more than 2 years, and the life-cycle GHG
   emissions are approximately 18.8 million kg CO2 equivalent. The
   relatively high EROI and short EPT indicate that the government should
   take more positive measures to promote the development of the CSG
   industry.},

   those of long-lived GHGs, so that superficial extrapolations of GHG
   trends would lead to misleading conclusions. In many world regions, the
   evolution of air pollutant emissions has effectively decoupled from
   economic growth. Since 1990, air pollutant emissions declined (sulfur
   dioxide, SO2), stabilized (nitrogen oxides, NOx), or increased slightly
   (black carbon, BC; organic carbon, OC; and ammonia, NH3). This review
   discusses to what extent structural changes, technological improvements,
   and dedicated environmental legislation have contributed to these
   changes. The scenarios of future emissions in the literature span a wide
   range, mainly owing to different assumptions about future environmental
   policies. Although the more recent scenarios agree on declining air
   pollutants up to 2030, avoiding potential rebounds of emissions after
   2030 will require additional policy interventions.},

Abstract = {Planning for change is critical to ensuring resilient coastal
   communities. In Maine, USA, the comprehensive planning process provides
   a platform for communities to articulate policies that address social,
   economic, and environmental issues. While comprehensive plans were
   initially required of municipalities to address urban sprawl over thirty
   years ago, a broad range of challenges face coastal communities today.
   Here, we report on an assessment of 30 comprehensive plans from coastal
   communities across the state. We analyzed the degree to which plans
   incorporate principles of social-ecological resilience. Our results
   reveal significant variability across comprehensive plans, with some
   communities addressing key indicators of resilience and others engaging
   with them in a limited way. By more explicitly incorporating principles
   of social-ecological resilience, the next-generation of comprehensive
   plans can be repurposed to serve as tools for communities to implement
   strategies that build adaptive capacity as they face unprecedented
   challenges and plan for a changing world.},

Volume = {63},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {We are motivated to study the exploitation of marine energy as a
   renewable resource because of society's ever-increasing energy demands,
   and a concomitant need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally,
   climate-related variations in wave energy should be investigated in
   order to ensure the stability of its long-term availability. Here, we
   investigate the potential for wave energy in the Persian Gulf along the
   southern coasts of Iran. To do so, we have applied the Mike SW numerical
   model and ECMWF wind field data for a 30-year study, from 1988 to 2017.
   For this purpose, wave energy was evaluated at six points in the
   western, northern, southern, and eastern parts of the Persian Gulf. To
   assess the impacts of climate change, we also consider the wave regime
   from 2070 to 2099 (for 30 years) following IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5
   climate change scenarios. Our findings suggest that in the present
   climate, seasonal variations in the mean wave parameters (i.e. wave
   energy, wave period, and significant wave height) correspond to the
   lowest wave energy in the summers, and highest in the winters. In the
   future climate change scenarios, energy level variations generally have
   similar patterns, with slight modulations in some local areas. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Climate change is associated with earth radiation budget that depends
   upon incoming solar radiation, surface albedo and radiative forcing by
   greenhouse gases. Human activities are contributing to climate change by
   causing changes in Earth's atmosphere (greenhouse gases, aerosols) and
   biosphere (deforestation, urbanization, irrigation). Long term and
   precise measurements from calibrated global observation constellation is
   a vital component in climate system modelling. Space based records of
   biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere over more than three
   decades are providing important information on climate change. Space
   observations are an important source of climate variables due to multi
   scale simultaneous observation (local, regional, and global scales)
   capability with temporal revisit in tune with requirements of land,
   ocean and atmospheric processes. Essential climatic variables that can
   be measured from space include atmosphere (upper air temperature, water
   vapour, precipitation, clouds, aerosols, GHGs etc.), ocean (sea ice, sea
   level, SST, salinity, ocean colour etc.) and land (snow, glacier,
   albedo, biomass, LAI/fAPAR, soil moisture etc.). India's Earth
   Observation Programme addresses various aspects of land, ocean and
   atmospheric applications. The present and planned missions such as
   Resourcesat-1, Oceansat-2, RISAT, Megha-Tropiques, INSAT-3D, SARAL,
   Resourcesat-2, Geo-HR Imager and series of Environmental satellites
   (I-STAG) would help in understanding the issues related to climate
   changes. The paper reviews observational needs, space observation
   systems and studies that have been carried out at ISRO (Indian Space
   Research Organization) towards mapping/detecting the indicators of
   climate change, monitoring the agents of climate change and
   understanding the impact of climate change, in national perspectives.
   Studies to assess glacier retreat, changes in polar ice cover,
   timberline change and coral bleaching are being carried out towards
   monitoring of climate change indicators. Spatial methane inventories
   from paddy rice, livestock and wetlands have been prepared and seasonal
   pattern of CO(2), and CO have been analysed. Future challenges in space
   observations include design and placement of adequate and accurate
   multi-platform observational systems to monitor all parameters related
   to various interaction processes and generation of long term calibrated
   climate data records pertaining to land ocean and atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Lakes and ponds can be hotspots for CO2 and CH4 emissions, but Arctic
   studies remain scarce. Here we present diffusive and ebullition fluxes
   collected over several years from 30 ponds and 4 lakes formed on an
   organic-rich polygonal tundra landscape. Water body morphology strongly
   affects the mixing regime-and thus the seasonal patterns in gas
   emissions-with ice-out and autumnal turnover periods identified as hot
   moments in most cases. The studied thermokarst lake maintained
   relatively high ebullition rates of millennia-old CH4 (up to 3405 C-14
   YBP). Larger and deeper kettle lakes maintained low fluxes of both gases
   (century to millennium-old), slowly turning into a CO2 sink over the
   summer. During winter, lakes accumulated CO2, which was emitted during
   the ice-out period. Coalescent polygonal ponds, influenced by
   photosynthesizing benthic mats, were continuous CO2 sinks, yet important
   CH4 emitters (modern carbon). The highest fluxes were recorded from
   ice-wedge trough ponds (up to 96 mmol CO2 equivalent m(-2) d(-1)).
   However, despite clear signs of permafrost carbon inputs via active
   shore erosion, these sheltered ponds emitted modern to century-old
   greenhouse gases. As the ice-free period lengthens, scenarios of warmer
   and wetter conditions could favor both the production of CO2 and CH4
   from thawing permafrost carbon, and CH4 production from recently fixed
   carbon through an atmospheric CO2-to-CH4 shunt at sites in which primary
   production is stimulated. This must be carefully considered at the
   landscape scale, recognizing that older carbon stocks can be mineralized
   efficiently in specific locations, such as in thermokarst lakes.},

Abstract = {Usage of the geotextile based artificial soil materials recently
   increase in coastal protection applications. These materials are become
   important such as temporary solutions, lack of supplying natural
   materials (rock), quick solutions cases. One of the most important
   applications of geotextile application in coastal engineering is one or
   several layer geotubes overlap each other replacements as height as wave
   run up in the coast line or near protecting coastal area. Stability of
   these type of structures are generally tested by numerically and wave
   loads determined over geotubes. In the presented paper, numerical model
   generated extreme wave loads over the geotube was compared with a
   bearing capacity of geosynthetic in Black Sea coast of Turkey for

Number = {10},
Pages = {410-415},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {River mouths are potentially abundant locations for the exploitation of
   the clean and renewable salinity gradient energy (SGE) as here
   perpetually fresh water mixes with saline seawater. However, the
   practical yield of SGE depends on the spatiotemporal variability of the
   salinity structure. Here we show this relationship for exemplary river
   mouths. Depending on characteristics of the salinity structure, SGE
   resources can be reduced to only 0.2\% of the theoretical potential. We
   derive a descriptor for a quick general assessment of the site specific
   potential and propose a classification of river mouths according to
   their suitability for SGE generation. It is shown that the tidal range
   is the most limiting factor for the harnessing of SGE at river mouths.
   Systems with a tidal range greater than 1.2 m seem not to be suitable
   locations.},

Abstract = {The sustainability of biodiesel adoption in diesel engines are dependent
   on its environmental friendliness relative to lower pollutant emissions.
   Biodiesel was produced from extracted Parinari polyandra oil via alkali
   catalyzed methanolysis. Performance and emission analysis of a diesel
   engine was conducted on a diesel engine, operated under different
   operating conditions, using varied Parinari polyandra biodiesel blends.
   Exhaust emissions, like total hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon
   monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides were measured. The
   biodiesel properties were found to be similar to fossil diesel. B10 was
   found to be the optimal blend in improving the engine performance in
   terms of speed, power and thermal efficiency. B30 demonstrated stable
   performance characteristics without any modification of the diesel
   engine. The exhaust emissions from biodiesel blends combustion were
   found to be lower than that of diesel, except nitrogen oxides. High
   percentage reduction of greenhouse gases, carbon monoxide and carbon
   dioxide, was recorded at 81.7\% and 65.7\%, respectively. The
   utilization of Parinari polyandra biodiesel for engine application was
   found to be a viable means of heightening adoption of sustainable
   biofuels and minimizing pollutant emissions from the combustion of
   fossil fuels. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This study explores the potential effectiveness of metropolitan land
   cover change as a climate change adaptation strategy for managing rising
   temperatures in a large and rapidly warming metropolitan region of the
   United States. Through the integration of a mesoscale meteorological
   model with estimated land cover data for the Atlanta, Georgia region in
   2010, this study quantifies the influence of extensive land cover change
   at the periphery of a large metropolitan region on temperature within
   the city center. The first study to directly model a metropolitan scale
   heat transfer mechanism, we find both enhanced tree canopy and
   impervious cover hi the suburban zones of the Atlanta region to produce
   statistically significant cooling and warming effects in the urban core.
   Based on these findings, we conclude that urban heat island management
   both within and beyond the central developed core of large cities may
   provide an effective climate change adaptation strategy for large
   metropolitan regions.},

Abstract = {The majority of existing water is saline water and it is crucial to find
   approaches and technologies to desalinate water in an efficient and
   reliable manner. Solar energy can be applied in desalination systems in
   order to provide required heat or generate needed electricity by using
   PV modules. Applying solar energy instead of fossil fuels leads to more
   environmentally benign technologies in desalinating saline water. Due to
   the severe worldwide water crisis, precise comprehension of desalination
   methods can pave the way toward potable water achievement at reasonable
   cost. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review is accomplished
   on various types of desalination systems and applications of solar
   energy in these technologies. Based on the reviewed studies, solar
   energy is a preferable source of energy for fresh water production with
   lower greenhouse gases emission and high operation reliability.},

Title = {Accelerated Greenland Ice Sheet Mass Loss Under High Greenhouse Gas
   Forcing as Simulated by the Coupled CESM2.1-CISM2.1},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is now losing mass at a rate of 0.7 mm of
   sea level rise (SLR) per year. Here we explore future GrIS evolution and
   interactions with global and regional climate under high greenhouse gas
   forcing with the Community Earth System Model version 2.1 (CESM2.1),
   which includes an interactive ice sheet component (the Community Ice
   Sheet Model v2.1 {[}CISM2.1]) and an advanced energy balance-based
   calculation of surface melt. We run an idealized 350-year scenario in
   which atmospheric CO2 concentration increases by 1\% annually until
   reaching four times pre-industrial values at year 140, after which it is
   held fixed. The global mean temperature increases by 5.2 and 8.5 K by
   years 131-150 and 331-350, respectively. The projected GrIS contribution
   to global mean SLR is 107 mm by year 150 and 1,140 mm by year 350. The
   rate of SLR increases from 2 mm yr(-1) at year 150 to almost 7 mm yr(-1)
   by year 350. The accelerated mass loss is caused by rapidly increasing
   surface melt as the ablation area expands, with associated albedo
   feedback and increased sensible and latent heat fluxes. This
   acceleration occurs for a global warming of approximately 4.2 K with
   respect to pre-industrial and is in part explained by the
   quasi-parabolic shape of the ice sheet, which favors rapid expansion of
   the ablation area as it approaches the interior ``plateau.{''}},

Abstract = {Any discussion of the benefits of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation
   measures should take into consideration the full range of possible
   climate change outcomes, including impacts that remain highly uncertain,
   like surprises and other climate irreversibilities. Real-world coupling
   between complex systems can cause them to exhibit new collective
   behaviours that are not clearly demonstrable by models that do not
   include such coupling. Through examples from ocean circulation and
   atmosphere-biosphere interactions, this paper demonstrates that external
   forcings such as increases in GHG concentrations can push complex
   systems from one equilibrium state to another, with non-linear abrupt
   change as a possible consequence. Furthermore, the harder and faster a
   system is perturbed, the higher the likelihood of such surprises-a
   conclusion that has significant bearing on the assessment of the
   potential benefits of the timing and stringency of GHG abatement
   measures. The paper concludes with a perspective on how to better
   incorporate uncertainty and surprise into integrated assessment models
   of climate change. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessment of the carbon abatement and removal opportunities of the
   Arabian Gulf Countries},
Journal = {CLEAN ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {340-353},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The Arabian Gulf Countries (AGC) are strongly reliant on the economic
   export of fossil fuels, while being vulnerable to climate change that is
   resulting in temperature increase, air pollution and sea-level rise, and
   threatening the health of the population and ecosystem. In agreement
   with the Paris Accords, most of the AGC have published short-term goals
   to reduce their carbon emissions in the coming decades. In relation to
   these goals, this study explores the potential CO2 reduction, avoidance
   and removal in the region, by comparing a business-as-usual (BAU)
   scenario to three decarbonization scenarios for the power sector. In
   2018, the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the AGC were similar
   to 1333 MtCO(2)/yr and are expected to rise to 1568 MtCO(2)/yr in 2030
   following a BAU scenario, which is likely to be reduced to 1522
   MtCO(2)/yr in 2030 by following the countries' planning. Countries
   issued plans for the coming decades that focus on increasing the share
   of renewable energy in their grid mix. The three decarbonization
   scenarios presented in this study focus on supply-side technological
   solutions. The retirement of the oldest natural-gas and oil power plants
   could lead to a total emissions reduction of similar to 75 MtCO(2)/yr,
   without accounting for the embodied carbon emissions associated with
   renewable energy. In addition, the implementation of point-source
   capture at power plants expected to retire in >10 years' time could
   avoid emissions of similar to 240 MtCO(2)/yr, provided the CO2 is
   permanently sequestered in appropriate geological formations. The region
   also shows high-quality solar resources and large CO2-storage potential
   that could couple to direct air-capture plants to offset
   difficult-to-avoid emissions. This last scenario has the potential to
   ultimately result in net negative emissions.

Title = {Optimising the Operation of Tidal Range Schemes},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Marine renewable energy, including tidal renewable energy, is one of the
   less exploited sources of energy that could contribute to energy demand,
   while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Amongst several proposals to
   build tidal range structure (TRS), a tidal lagoon has been proposed for
   construction in Swansea Bay, in the South West of the UK, but this
   scheme was recently rejected by the UK government due to the high
   electricity costs. This decision makes the optimisation of such schemes
   more important for the future. This study proposes various novel
   approaches by breaking the operation into small components to optimise

   approach results in a minimum 10\% increase in energy output, without
   the inclusion of pumping, in comparison to the maximum energy output
   using a similar operation for all tides. This increase in energy will be

Abstract = {Indian large point sources (LPS) contribute to CO2 and SO2 emissions to
   a large extent (above 65\%) and to CH4, N2O and NOX emissions to some
   extent (around 10\%). The former emissions are primarily from fossil
   fuel combustion while the latter have agriculture sector dominance,
   explaining the drastic difference in LPS contributions to all India
   emissions. The present paper covers 509 LPS for India. These are well
   distributed across the country. However, there are some regions of very
   few LPS (like the western desert and the hilly areas of north, northeast
   and coastal west) and some regions of high LPS concentration
   (Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, Delhi and near coal mine mouths). There is a
   dominance of power plants in Indian LPS emissions for CO2 and SO2 (47\%
   each), with cement (9\% and 5\%) and steel (6\% and 7\%) plants being
   the other major contributors. Moreover, due to growing population,
   increasing urbanization and hi-her consumption levels, these LPS
   emissions are growing much faster than the national average. The present
   analysis would be useful for policy-making to mitigate these pollutants
   and their associated impacts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {Climate change costs more than we think because people adapt less than
   we assume},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {173},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Human behaviour is commonly optimised in economic models of adaptation
   to climate change. These models assume that people work to maximise
   profit, subject to financial and technological limitations. In effect,
   these models simulate adaptive potential. In reality, adaptation falls
   short of this potential. This shortfall is conceptualised as the
   adaptation deficit, and it has been causing increasing concern.
   This study demonstrates the impacts of the ways by which people's
   real-world adaptive behaviours depart from those assumed under pure
   optimisation. These departures, known as adaptation constraints, are
   formalised as numerical preference functions based on an empirical case
   study in New Zealand, and they are used to constrain an agent-based
   model of climate change adaptation. We show that these
   empirically-specified adaptation constraints reduce profits relative to
   an optimised specification by roughly one third. This demonstrates that
   unconstrained economic models are likely to significantly underestimate
   the costs of adaptation to climate change, the benefits of reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions, and the residual loss and damage that climate
   change will cause.},

Title = {The impact of sheep grazing on the carbon balance of a peatland},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {438},
Pages = {426-434},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes resulting from sheep
   grazing upon upland peat soils have never been fully quantified.
   Previous studies have been limited to individual flux pathways or to
   comparing the presence to the absence of sheep grazing. Therefore, this
   study combines a model of the physical impact of grazing with models of:
   biomass production; energy usage in sheep; and peat accumulation. These
   combined modelling approaches enabled this study to consider the
   indirect and direct impacts of sheep upon the carbon and greenhouse gas
   balance of a peatland at different grazing intensities as well as the
   changes between grazing intensities. The study considered four
   vegetation scenarios (Calluna sp., Molinia sp.; reseeded grasses, and
   Agrostis-Festuca grassland) and a mixed vegetation scenario based upon
   the vegetation typical of upland peat ecosystems in northern England.
   Each scenario was considered for altitudes between 350 and 900 m above
   sea level and for grazing intensities between 0.1 and 2 ewes/ha. The
   study can show that the total GHG flux at the vegetative carrying
   capacity tended to decline with increasing altitude for all vegetation
   scenarios considered except for Molinia sp. The average total GHG flux
   for all scenarios was 1505 kg CO(2)eq/ha/yr/(ewe/ha), and on average
   89\% of the fluxes were directly from the sheep and not from the soil,
   and are therefore not unique to a peat soil environment. The study
   suggests that emission factors for upland sheep have been greatly
   underestimated. By comparing the total flux due to grazers to the flux
   to or from the soil that allows the study to define a GHG carry
   capacity, i.e. the grazing intensity at which the flux due to grazing is
   equal to the sink represented by the peat soils, this GHG carrying
   capacity varies between 0.2 and 1.7 ewes/ha with this capacity declining
   with increasing altitude for all model scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Climate changes induced by doubling atmospheric greenhouse gas (2XGHG)
   concentrations are expected to affect the distribution of global
   vegetation and thereby, the amount of carbon it stores. The role of the
   terrestrial biosphere as a source or sink for carbon during climate
   change is critical: if increased GHG concentration and warming enhances
   carbon storage, thereby reducing atmospheric concentrations, the climate
   changes would also be ameliorated. If instead, carbon storage is
   reduced, the warming could induce a positive feedback to further
   increase atmospheric concentrations already on the rise from burning of
   fossil fuels. Differing climate-defined static vegetation
   classifications have been used to project biome distributions for
   climates induced by 2XGHGs. These projections assume that species
   extirpation and invasion will track perfectly distributions of climate
   variables and they predict enhanced terrestrial carbon storage. However,
   theoretical calculations and palaeoecological evidence suggest an
   alternative, more realistic simplifying assumption: trees will be
   extirpated but will not invade new territory before 2XGHG climate is
   attained. We projected global terrestrial carbon under future climates
   using both assumptions. Simulated terrestrial carbon under delayed
   immigration decreasd 7 to 34 Pg from modern values in contrast to
   increases projected under instant migration in this and earlier model
   exercises.},

Abstract = {Building community resilience to climate-induced disaster shocks
   requires an innovative, adaptive, and forwardlooking approach. However,
   empirical data on such initiatives is lacking. Adopting an Adaptive
   Governance Framework, we gathered evidence that collaborative multi-loop
   social learning by multilevel institutions (local, regional, and
   national) can significantly enhance community resilience to climate
   induced disaster shocks and reduce gaps between institutional disaster
   governance responsibilities and capacities. Following a Case Study
   approach, we investigated the disaster resilience of two coastal
   communities in Bangladesh. Our primary data collection techniques were
   Key Informant Interviews and document reviews. The results of our
   investigation revealed three key prerequisites for building community
   resilience to nature-triggered disasters like cyclones or floods: i) the
   presence of multiple nested institutional structures at the local level;
   ii) multi-loop social learning at multiple institutional levels; and
   iii) documentation of lessons learned from each disaster and the
   application of these lessons to disaster governance at all institutional
   levels. We documented that bridging organizations play a decisive role
   in documenting and scaling-up lessons learned from episodic extreme
   weather events. Therefore, more emphasis needs to be placed on the
   importance of bridging organizations in scaling up lessons from episodic
   disaster events into national-level policy and practice.},

Abstract = {A change in CO2 concentration induces a direct radiative forcing that
   modifies the planetary thermodynamic state, and hence the surface
   temperature. The infrared cooling, by assuming a constant temperature
   lapse-rate during the process, will be related to the surface
   temperature through the Stefan-Boltzmann law in a ratio proportional to
   the new infrared opacity. Other indirect effects, such as the water
   vapor and ice-albedo feedbacks, may amplify the system response. In the
   present paper, we address the question of how a global climate model
   with a mixed layer ocean responds to different rates of change of a
   well-mixed greenhouse gas such as CO2. We provide evidence that
   different rates of CO2 variation may lead to similar transient climates
   characterized by the same global mean surface temperature but different
   values of CO2 concentration. Moreover, it is shown that, far from the
   bifurcation points, the model's climate depends on the history of the
   radiative forcing displaying a hysteresis cycle that is neither static
   nor dynamical, but is related to the memory response of the model.

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {The present work evaluates the environmental performance of three wave
   energy converters including on-shore oscillating water columns and
   oscillating floaters embedded in piers, and near-shore seabed-based
   buoys in the Mediterranean Basin. The life cycle assessment methodology
   was used to account for their potential environmental impact, in terms
   of carbon footprint (t CO(2)eq), considering four main phases, i.e.,
   manufacturing of material components, assembling and installation on
   site, maintenance in time, and decommission end of life. Results show
   the greenhouse gas emission from different lifecycle processes, based on
   the inventory of main energy inputs and materials, highlighting the
   major impact of the manufacture of the structural components (52 \%),
   especially due to the limited durability of materials. In order to
   compare the performances of the three different wave energy converters,
   the carbon intensity of electricity was evaluated considering a range of
   electricity production per technology based on data available in
   scientific literature. The results obtained for a single device (203-270
   g CO(2)eq?kWh(-1) for the oscillating water column system; 94-374 g
   CO(2)eq?kWh(-1) for oscillating floater and 105-158 g CO(2)eq?kWh(-1)
   for the seabed-based buoy) highlight that wave energy converters are
   promising solutions to harvest wave energy, showing lower carbon
   intensity of electricity values compared to fossil energy sources;
   nevertheless, technological improvements are needed to increase
   efficiency and achieve the performances of other renewable energy
   sources. Moreover, the combination of wave energy converters with other
   solutions, such as offshore wind turbines, represents a valuable option
   in the future to increase productivity and foster energy transition of
   the Mediterranean regions.},

Title = {Carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes of the Amazon region, Brazil},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},

Abstract = {In addition to the largest existing expanse of tropical forests, the
   Brazilian Amazon has among the largest area of mangroves in the world.
   While recognized as important global carbon sinks that, when disturbed,
   are significant sources of greenhouse gases, no studies have quantified
   the carbon stocks of these vast mangrove forests. In this paper, we
   quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes
   east of the mouth of the Amazon River, Brazil. Mean ecosystem carbon
   stocks of the salt marshes were 257 Mg C ha(-1) while those of mangroves
   ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha(-1). Although aboveground mass was high
   relative to many other mangrove forests (145 Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon
   stocks were relatively low (340 Mg C ha(-1)). Low soil carbon stocks may
   be related to coarse textured soils coupled with a high tidal range.
   Nevertheless, the carbon stocks of the Amazon mangroves were over twice
   those of upland evergreen forests and almost 10-fold those of tropical
   dry forests.},

Title = {Morphological Development and Behaviour of a Shoreface Nourishment in
   the Portuguese Western Coast},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Current coastal protection strategy in Portugal defines beach and
   shoreface nourishment as a valid measure to mitigate coastal erosion in
   some erosional hot-spots, being considered as an adaptation measure
   under the present climate change scenario, including the impacts of sea
   level rise. However, scant objective data on shoreface nourishments are
   available to evaluate performance of this type of intervention in
   mitigating beach erosion and managing coast risk. We present the first
   monitoring results of a approximate to 2.4 x 10(6) m(3) shoreface
   nourishment on the Aveiro coast (Costa Nova-ilhavo), the largest until
   now in Portugal, focusing on its morphological development, impacts on
   adjacent beaches due to alongshore spreading and cross-shore
   redistribution, and contribution to the sediment budget of the nourished
   sediment cell. The analyses are based on high-resolution coastal
   monitoring data, provided by the Portuguese COaStal MOnitoring Program
   (COSMO). A Multiple Monitoring Cell (MMC) approach was used to evaluate
   local and feeder efficiency of the nourishment, sediment budget
   exchanges within both the placement and wider survey domains
   (approximate to 1 km(2) and 12 km(2), respectively). Results show rapid
   (ca. 6 months) morphological change over the placement area, with a
   decrease of about 40\% of the initial volume. Fast onshore sediment
   redistribution explains part of this change, placed sand having merged
   with the pre-existing bar system increased the volume of the shallower
   nearshore. Longshore transport is reflected by increasing the robustness
   of the bar downdrift of the placement area and also explains the
   negative sediment budget (0.75 x 10(6) m(3)) of the survey domain, which
   corresponds to losses through its southern boundary. Sediment spreading
   also induced accretion of the subaerial section of Costa Nova beaches in
   front of the placement area, reversing their long-term erosive trend. In
   contrast, this trend persisted at downdrift beaches. This suggests that
   the time lag of the subaerial beach response to this intervention
   increases with the distance to the placement area, and reversal of the
   erosive trend will only be noticeable in the following years. This study
   provides new insights on the time scales of beach response to
   high-magnitude shoreface interventions in high-energy wave-dominated
   sandy coasts, which will support decision making regarding similar
   operations designed to manage erosional hot-spots elsewhere.},

Abstract = {The Southern Hemisphere (SH) stratospheric stationary wave amplitude
   increased significantly in late spring and early summer during the last
   two decades of the twentieth century. A suite of chemistry climate model
   simulations are examined to explore the underlying cause and the
   separate effects of anthropogenic forcing from ozone depleting
   substances (ODSs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the past and projected
   SH stationary wave evolution. The model simulations produce trends in
   the wave amplitude similar to that observed, although somewhat weaker.
   In simulations with changing ODSs, this increase in amplitude is
   reproduced during the ozone depletion period and is reversed during the
   ozone recovery period. This response is related to changes in the
   strength and timing of the breakdown of the SH polar vortex associated
   with ozone depletion and recovery. GHG increases have little impact on
   the simulated stratospheric stationary wave amplitude but are projected
   to induce an eastward phase shift of the waves. This phase shift is
   linked to the strengthening of the subtropical jets driven by GHG
   forcing via sea surface warming.},

Abstract = {Fluorocarbon impact on ozone depletion is reviewed together with the
   efficacy of the Montreal Protocol in acting to correct the imbalance
   between stratospheric ozone production and destruction. The Protocol is
   also helping to reduce global warming: CFCs are shown to be currently
   the largest fluorocarbon contributors to climate change. Relative
   contributions to climate change from CFCs and their HFC substitutes are
   discussed, together with the consequences of control of minor greenhouse
   gases on an environmental impact which is dominated by carbon dioxide
   emissions. Both the potencies of the materials for environmental change
   and their concentrations in the atmosphere are important and are
   considered here.
   Trifluoroacetic acid, a minor product of atmospheric decomposition of
   some HCFCs and HFCs and of the pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, has been
   shown to be uniformly distributed in seawater to a depth of over 4000 m
   and so is natural, although the actual source has yet to be identified.
   The Montreal Protocol is only one example of action to reduce
   undesirable impact from fluorocarbons. Other, less universal, actions
   include abatement of fluoroform greenhouse gas emissions from HCFC
   manufacturing, process changes to eliminate trifluoromethylsulfur
   pentafluoride emissions from electrochemical fluorination and ceasing
   manufacture of perfluorooctanyl sulfonate compounds due to their
   persistence in human tissue. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The aim of this article is twofold. We first summarize our current
   scientific knowledge about the potential influence of human activities
   on climate. This review is largely based on the conclusions of the 1995
   IPCC report (International Panel on Climate Change). An increase in
   atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases has been observed since
   1750 (CH4 = 145 \%; CO2 = 30 \%; N2O = 15 \%) and in the temperature of
   the Earth's surface since 1860 (between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees C). This
   report suggests a discernable human influence on climate and predicts
   significant global warming for the next century (1 to 3.5 degrees C) as
   a result of the anthropogenic increase of the greenhouse effect. We then
   show how studies of past climates have, over the last ten years,
   contributed to this problem by providing information relevant to the
   future of our climate. Important results concern the existence of a
   relationship between climate and concentrations of greenhouse gases for
   more than 200 000 years, the discovery of rapid climatic changes
   (similar to 10 degrees C in a few decades in Greenland) and the
   reconstruction of recent climate showing that the 20th century is the
   warmest since 1 400 AD. ((C) Academie des sciences / Elsevier, Paris).},

Title = {Emerging trends in science and news of climate change threats to and
   adaptation of aquaculture},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {549},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Food production is one of the main contributors to climate change, but
   is also vulnerable to the resulting stressors, which is well documented
   for agriculture and fisheries. Attention is now turning to the rapidly
   growing aquaculture sector and its vulnerability to a changing climate.
   Here we explore the extent to which climate stressors and aquaculture,
   and concomitant adaptation strategies, are studied in science and
   addressed in public media (news) to assess focus and attribution of
   climate change. We reviewed 553 scientific publications and 228 news
   media articles on climate stressors, impacts, and adaptation approaches
   with respect to aquaculture. Results indicate that coverage in the
   scientific community of climate stressors on aquaculture have not kept
   pace with growth of production in the sector, especially compared to
   agriculture and fisheries. Temperature, sea level rise, and ocean
   acidification were most often the focus in science (44\%) and news
   (42\%), suggesting some alignment. Combined coverage tended to revolve
   around Asia, Europe, and North/Central America (70\%) and at least 10
   countries' science and news linked current impacts on aquaculture to
   climate change. The majority of scientific articles addressing
   adaptation were regional rather than global, and emphasized governance
   and institutional strategies over technological solutions. In all, this
   research highlights the comparatively nascent focus of climate change
   implications for aquaculture, narrow emphasis of stressors, but fairly
   representative coverage of regions with more aquaculture. Our work
   highlights the need for more research and public awareness of the social
   and ecological climate change threats and impacts on, and adaptive
   strategies for aquaculture.},

Abstract = {This paper examines perceived climate risks, their impacts, and existing
   adaptation practices at the local level, including the role of local
   institutions. The analysis focuses on two selected areas in Vietnam and
   Thailand. The paper is based on the information collected through key
   informant interviews at provincial and district level, focus group
   discussions at village level, and household survey. Several adaptation
   practices exist at local level to deal with the perceived risks of
   drought, floods, and salinity intrusion. Most of the adaptation
   practices were autonomous focusing on coping with short-term risks
   rather than structural long-term climate risks. Some adaptation
   practices, such as crop insurance and regulatory measures included in
   the literature and practiced in other places, did not exist at local
   level in the case study countries, but some local practices such as
   farmers' annual fair could be an important addition to the inventory of
   potential adaptation measures. Local institutions have facilitated
   adaptation in different ways. They (1) lead and support unique
   adaptation practices suitable to the local context; (2) act as a
   catalyst to help people to adapt some practices by providing technical
   and material support; and (3) act as the bridge between local people and
   the governmental and non-governmental agencies. But several factors
   constrain the effectiveness of locally practiced adaptation measures.
   Thus, to enhance the adaptive capacity of households and the local
   community, it is necessary to: (1) improve the technical capacity of
   farmers; (2) create effective mechanisms for strengthening, promoting,
   and disseminating locally initiated efforts; (3) subsidize and improve
   access to credit services; (4) improve links between production and
   markets; and (5) establish effective mechanisms for coordination.},

Abstract = {Concern over global climate change has led policy makers to accept the
   importance of reducing Greenhouse gas emissions. A tidal barrage
   utilizes the potential energy of the tide and has proven to be very
   successful, despite opposition from environmental groups. Tidal barrages
   make use of the potential energy of the tides. A tidal barrage is
   typically a dam, built across a bay or estuary that experiences a tidal
   range in excess of 5 m. Electricity generation from tidal barrages
   employs the same principles as hydroelectric generation, except that
   tidal currents. flow in both directions. A typical tidal barrage
   consists of turbines, sluice gates, embankments and ship locks. The
   turbines that are used in tidal barrages are either unidirectional or
   bi-directional, and include bulb turbines, straflo or rim turbines and
   tubular turbines. Tidal barrages can be broken into two types:
   single-basin systems and double-basin systems. This paper discussed
   about the tidal barrage, wave energy, environmental impacts and special
   conditions in there process (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {The Potential of Wave Energy Conversion to Mitigate Coastal Erosion from
   Hurricanes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wave energy conversion technologies have recently attracted more
   attention as part of global efforts to replace fossil fuels with
   renewable energy resources. While ocean waves can provide renewable
   energy, they can also be destructive to coastal areas that are often
   densely populated and vulnerable to coastal erosion. There have been a
   variety of efforts to mitigate the impacts of wave- and storm-induced
   erosion; however, they are either temporary solutions or approaches that
   are not able to adapt to a changing climate. This study explores a green
   and sustainable approach to mitigating coastal erosion from hurricanes
   through wave energy conversion. A barrier island, Dauphin Island, off
   the coast of Alabama, is used as a test case. The potential use of wave
   energy converter farms to mitigate erosion due to hurricane storm surges
   while simultaneously generating renewable energy is explored through
   simulations that are forced with storm data using the XBeach model. It
   is shown that wave farms can impact coastal morphodynamics and have the
   potential to reduce dune and beach erosion, predominantly in the western
   portion of the island. The capacity of wave farms to influence coastal
   morphodynamics varies with the storm intensity.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {90},
Number = {6},
Pages = {573-588},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is a consensus among climatologists that our planet is
   experiencing a progressive rise in surface temperature due to the
   increased production of `greenhouse' gases. Some of the possible
   consequences of elevated temperature on malaria transmission are
   examined in the present review. A simple mathematical model is first
   used to examine the effect of temperature on the ability of Anopheles
   maculipennis to transmit vivax malaria. This indicates that small
   increases in temperature at low temperatures may increase the risk of
   transmission substantially. This is important, since vulnerable
   communities, poorly protected by health services, in areas of unstable
   or no malaria are likely to be at increased risk of future outbreaks. In
   contrast, areas of stable transmission may be little affected by rising
   temperature. It is thought that global warming will lead to coastal
   flooding, changes in precipitation and, indirectly, changes in land use.
   Just how these changes will effect transmission at a regional level
   requires an understanding of the ecology of local vectors, since
   environmental changes which favour malaria transmission in one vector
   species may reduce it in another. Methods for predicting future changes
   in malaria in different regions are discussed, highlighting the need for
   further research in this area. Most importantly, there is a need for
   researchers to validate the accuracy of the models used for predicting
   malaria and to confirm the assumptions on which the models are based.},

Title = {The United States Department of Energy's Regional Carbon Sequestration
   Partnerships program: A collaborative approach to carbon management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {128-144},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper reviews the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP)
   concept, which is a first attempt to bring the U.S. Deparment of
   Energy's (DOE) carbon sequestration program activities into the ``real
   world{''} by using a geographically-disposed-system type approach for
   the U.S. Each regional partnership is unique and covers a unique section
   of the U.S. and is tasked with determining how the research and
   development activities of DOE's carbon sequestration program can best be
   implemented in their region of the country.
   Although there is no universal agreement on the cause, it is generally
   understood that global warming is occurring, and many climate scientists
   believe that this is due, in part, to the buildup of carbon dioxide
   (CO2) in the atmosphere. This is evident from the finding presented in
   the National Academy of Science Report to the President on Climate
   Change which stated ``Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's
   atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air
   temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures
   are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades
   are likely mostly due to human activities, ...{''}. In the United
   States, emissions of CO2 originate mainly from the combustion of fossil
   fuels for energy production, transportation, and other industrial
   processes. Roughly one third of U.S. anthropogenic CO2 emissions come
   from power plants. Reduction of CO2 emissions through sequestration of
   carbon either in geologic formations or in terrestrial ecosystems can be
   part of the solution to the problem of global warming. However, a number
   of steps must be accomplished before sequestration can become a reality.
   Cost effective capture and separation technology must be developed,
   tested, and demonstrated; a database of potential sequestration sites
   must be established; and techniques must be developed to measure,
   monitor, and verify the sequestered CO2
   Geographical differences in fossil fuel use, the industries present, and
   potential sequestration sinks across the United States dictate the use
   of a regional approach to address the sequestration of CO2. To
   accommodate these differences, the DOE has created a nationwide network
   of seven Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) to help
   determine and implement the carbon sequestration technologies,
   infrastructure, and regulations most appropriate to promote CO2
   sequestration in different regions of the nation. These partnerships
   currently represent 40 states, three Indian Nations, four Canadian
   Provinces, and over 200 organizations, including academic institutions,
   research institutions, coal companies, utilities, equipment
   manufacturers, forestry and agricultural representatives, state and
   local governments, non-governmental organizations, and national
   laboratories. These partnerships are dedicated to developing the
   necessary infrastructure and validating the carbon sequestration
   technologies that have emerged from DOE's core R\&D and other programs
   to mitigate emissions of CO2, a potent greenhouse gas. The partnerships
   provide a critical link to DOE's plans for FutureGen, a highly efficient
   and technologically sophisticated coal-fired power plant that will
   produce both hydrogen and electricity with near-zero emissions. Though
   limited to the situation in the U.S., the paper describes for the
   international scientific community the approach being taken by the U.S.
   to prepare for carbon sequestration, should that become necessary. (C)

Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {The unprecedented global heatwave of 2014-2017 was a defining event for
   many ecosystems. Widespread degradation caused by coral bleaching, for
   example, highlighted the vulnerability of hundreds of millions of people
   dependent on reefs for their livelihoods, well-being, and food security.
   Scientists and policy makers are now reassessing long-held assumptions
   about coping with anthropogenic climate change, particularly the
   assumption that strong local institutions can maintain ecological and
   social resilience through ecosystem-based management, adaptation, and
   restoration. Governance is struggling to address the new normal as
   ecosystem assemblages transform to novel configurations. A central
   challenge for policy makers in the Anthropocene is navigating
   environmental crises and coping with societal insecurity and change.
   Ecosystem governance needs a new paradigm to embrace rapid change and
   shape future trajectories. In this Perspective, we focus on coral reefs
   as vanguards for governance transformation. We explain the spatial,
   temporal, and political dynamics of reefs as they respond to climate
   change and outline a new governance paradigm applicable to all
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Soil CO2 emission is an important part of the terrestrial carbon cycling
   and is influenced by several factors, such as type and distribution of
   vegetation. In this work we evaluated the spatial variability of soil
   CO2 emission in terrestrial ecosystems of maritime Antarctica, under two
   contrasting vegetation covers: 1) grass areas of Deschampsia antarctica
   Desv., and 2) moss carpets of Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) Loeske. Highest
   mean emission was obtained for the Deschampsia (4.13 mu mol m(-2) s(-1))
   developed on organic-rich soil with a strong penguin influence. The
   overall results indicate that soil temperature is not directly related
   to the spatial pattern of soil CO2 emission at the sites studied.
   Emission adjusted models were Gaussian and exponential with ranges
   varying from 1.3 to 2.8 m, depending on the studied site and vegetation
   cover.},

Abstract = {Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food production sectors in the
   world, but many of the small-hold operations are poorly assessed for
   their climate impact. We analyzed the literature data on CO2 and CH4
   fluxes from various aquaculture systems in China. The mean fluxes varied
   in the ranges of 382.45-551.88 g CO2-C m (2) yr (1) and 0.03-565.09 g
   CH4-C m (2) yr (1). Aquaculture system reclaimed from mudflat had the
   highest CH4 emission (54.92 +/- 21.00 g C m (2) yr (1)) but lowest CO2
   emission. Shrimp aquaculture and semiintensive farming tended to yield
   higher CH4 emission. Small and shallow systems had significantly higher
   CO2 and CH4 emissions, with chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen
   concentrations as the main environmental drivers. Management practice
   such as drainage, exposure and desilting during the non-farming period
   significantly decreased CH4 emission. We estimated that aquaculture
   systems in China emitted 181.66 Tg CO2-eq yr (1), offsetting similar to
   7\% of the national terrestrial carbon sink, with most of the emission
   concentrated in coastal provinces and along the major rivers in the
   southeastern quadrant. This study highlights the importance of
   accounting for greenhouse gas emissions from aquaculture to improve the
   accuracy of the regional and national carbon budgets.},

Title = {Local sources of global climate forcing from different categories of
   land use activities},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {175-194},
Abstract = {Identifying and quantifying the sources of climate impacts from land use
   and land cover change (LULCC) is necessary to optimize policies
   regarding LULCC for climate change mitigation. These climate impacts are
   typically defined relative to emissions of CO2, or sometimes emissions
   of other long-lived greenhouse gases. Here we use previously published
   estimates of the radiative forcing (RF) of LULCC that include the
   short-lived forcing agents O-3 and aerosols, in addition to long-lived
   greenhouse gases and land albedo change, for six projections of LULCC as
   a metric for quantifying climate impacts. The LULCC RF is attributed to
   three categories of LULCC activities: direct modifications to land
   cover, agriculture, and wildfire response, and sources of the forcing
   are ascribed to individual grid points for each sector. Results for the
   year 2010 show substantial positive forcings from the direct
   modifications and agriculture sectors, particularly from south and
   southeast Asia, and a smaller magnitude negative forcing response from
   wildfires. The spatial distribution of future sources of LULCC RF is
   highly scenario-dependent, but we show that future forest area change
   can be used as a predictor of the future RF from direct modification
   activities, especially in the tropics, suggesting that
   deforestation-prevention policies that value land based on its C-content
   may be particularly effective at mitigating climate forcing originating
   in the tropics from this sector. However, the response of wildfire RF to
   tropical land cover changes is not as easily scalable and yet imposes a
   non-trivial feedback onto the total LULCC RF.},

Title = {Does seaweed offer a solution for bioenergy with biological carbon
   capture and storage?},
Journal = {GREENHOUSE GASES-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Number = {6},
Pages = {402-407},

Abstract = {The concept of combining bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
   (BECCS) has been identified as one mechanism to achieve energy
   production with a net negative atmospheric carbon emission. Conventional
   geological carbon capture and storage involves large capital outlay and
   recurring expense. Therefore there is increased interest in coupling
   biological carbon capture and sequestration with biomass production.
   Systems such as low-input high-diversity native grasslands and biochar
   production have been heralded as carbon negative biofuels. Another
   potential production system for bioenergy with biological carbon capture
   and storage (BEBCCS) is the large-scale cultivation of seaweed
   (macroalgae) for biofuels. Marine biofuels offer considerable advantages
   over terrestrial first-generation biofuels in terms of their low land
   use, fresh water and fertilizer requirements. In addition, they also
   offer considerable potential in the field of BEBCCS. Macroalgae rapidly
   accumulate biomass and as part of this process, a significant proportion
   (estimates range up to 60\%) of the carbon they fix photosynthetically
   is released into the water. A proportion of this released dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) is highly labile and enters the bacterial loop and
   is rapidly remineralized back to CO2. However, a proportion is known to
   be resistant to biological degradation and enters the refractory DOC
   pool. The marine DOC pool is the largest organic carbon pool on the
   planet and the refractory component is known to have a turnover period
   of 100s-1000s years. The release of refractory DOC from macroalgae
   combined with biofuel production offers the potential for large scale
   carbon negative fuel production. (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry

Abstract = {An increase in the amount of greenhouse gases around the Earth's
   atmosphere generated by emissions through various sources creates a huge
   problem for the near future because of global warming and the consequent
   cli-mate changes. This study fabricated an
   organoclay/polypyrrole-alginate (OC/Ppy-A) nanocomposite-modified glassy
   carbon sensor (MGCS), which was used for the sensitive estimation of
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas (CO2). The efficiency of the developed
   sensor was investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochem-ical
   impedance spectroscopy. Compared with the bare glassy carbon sensor
   (GCS), the developed MGCS exhib-ited a five-fold superior CV signal for
   the recognition of the redox-active solution of potassium ferricyanide
   (K3{[}Fe(CN)6]). The CV signal currents of the redox reaction of
   (K3{[}Fe(CN)6]) were changed by changing the amount of CO2 molecules in
   the measured samples. The oxidation signal of (K3{[}Fe(CN)6]) linearly
   correlated with the CO2concentration in the separate ranges of 0.05-0.25
   ppm (0.595-2.98 mu M) and 0.25-3.5 ppm (2.98-41.67 mu M) with limits of
   detection (S/N = 3) of 0.0165 ppm (0.196 mu M, 40.569 mu A/ppm) and
   0.0825 ppm (0.982 mu M, 1.751 mu A/ppm). Additionally, the developed
   electrochemical MGCS exhibited appro-priate repeatability,
   reproducibility, and stability. The proposed sensor was successfully
   applied for the deter-mination of CO2 in brackish and seawater samples

Title = {Hydrologic Context Alters Greenhouse Gas Feedbacks of Coastal Wetland
   Salinization},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1108-1125},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Changes in sea-level rise and precipitation are altering patterns of
   coastal wetland hydrology and salinization. We conducted paired
   laboratory (20 weeks) and field (15 weeks) marine salt addition
   experiments to disentangle the effects of hydrology (permanent versus
   intermittent flooding) and elevated marine salts (sulfate versus other
   salt ions) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freshwater forested
   wetland soils. Marine salt additions strongly affected GHG emissions in
   both experiments, but the magnitude, and even the direction, of GHG
   responses depended on the hydrologic context in which marine salt
   exposure occurred. Under permanent flooding, carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes
   were unaffected by marine salts, whereas methane (CH4) fluxes were
   significantly suppressed by the addition of sulfate (as K2SO4) both with
   and without marine salts. In contrast, in intermittently flooded field
   and laboratory soils elevated salinity reduced carbon mineralization and
   CO2 fluxes, but enhanced CH4 fluxes relative to both controls and
   treatments with elevated sulfate. Thus, elevated salinity or alkalinity
   (and not sulfate) controlled both gaseous carbon fluxes under
   intermittent flooding. Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes had contrasting
   responses in the field and laboratory. In the laboratory, N2O fluxes
   were not significantly related to chemical treatment but increased with
   porewater ammonium concentrations, which increased in salinity
   treatments via cation exchange. In intermittently flooded field
   conditions, elevated salinity strongly suppressed N2O fluxes because
   ammonium did not accumulate in porewater; it was likely lost through
   advection, dispersion, or plant uptake. Understanding dynamic hydrologic
   and vegetation patterns across wetland landscapes will be critical for
   predicting both the magnitude and direction of wetland GHG responses to
   increasing marine salt across broad spatial scales.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the main effects that building tidal power barrages
   would have on the bird populations using Britain's estuaries. The
   changes in the tidal prism that would occur after a tidal power barrage
   is built are discussed in the context of their effect on the ecology of
   the estuary. Three main issues are discussed; the effect of changes in
   size and nature of the intertidal areas of the estuary, effects on
   saltmarshes, and the displacement of birds at closure. Recently, tidal
   stream technologies have been developed which are individually likely to
   have small effects on birds. However the cumulative effects of large
   scale tidal stream arrays need to be investigated. Finally, the effects
   of tidal barrages are put in the context of Britain's energy policy and
   the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Should tidal power barrages
   be considered in the future, there will be a need for strategic
   assessments to be used to select sites that maximize the energy produced
   while minimizing the impacts on bird populations.},

Title = {Space-based Earth observation in support of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Space-based Earth observation (EO), in the form of long-term climate
   data records, has been crucial in the monitoring and quantification of
   slow changes in the climate system-from accumulating greenhouse gases
   (GHGs) in the atmosphere, increasing surface temperatures, and melting
   sea-ice, glaciers and ice sheets, to rising sea-level. In addition to
   documenting a changing climate, EO is needed for effective policy
   making, implementation and monitoring, and ultimately to measure
   progress and achievements towards the overarching goals of the United
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement
   to combat climate change. The best approach for translating EO into
   actionable information for policymakers and other stakeholders is,
   however, far from clear. For example, climate change is now self-evident
   through increasingly intense and frequent extreme events-heatwaves,
   droughts, wildfires, and flooding-costing human lives and significant
   economic damage, even though single events do not constitute ``climate
   ``. EO can capture and visualize the impacts of such events in single
   images, and thus help quantify and ultimately manage them within the
   framework of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, both at the national level (via
   the Enhanced Transparency Framework) and global level (via the Global
   Stocktake). We present a transdisciplinary perspective, across policy
   and science, and also theory and practice, that sheds light on the
   potential of EO to inform mitigation, including sinks and reservoirs of
   greenhouse gases, and adaptation, including loss and damage. Yet to be
   successful with this new mandate, EO science must undergo a radical
   overhaul: it must become more user-oriented, collaborative, and
   transdisciplinary; span the range from fiducial to contextual data; and
   embrace new technologies for data analysis (e.g., artificial
   intelligence). Only this will allow the creation of the knowledge base
   and actionable climate information needed to guide the UNFCCC Paris
   Agreement to a just and equitable success.},

Title = {The Impact of Sea Embankment Reclamation on Greenhouse Gas GHG Fluxes

Abstract = {The introduction of embankment seawalls to limit the expansion of the
   exotic C-4 perennial grass Spartina alteniflora Loisel in eastern
   China's coastal wetlands has more than doubled in the past decades.
   Previous research focused on the impact of sea embankment reclamation on
   the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in salt marshes,
   whereas no study attempted to assess the impact of sea embankment
   reclamation on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in such marshes. Here we
   examined the impact of sea embankment reclamation on GHG stocks and
   fluxes of an invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites
   australis dominated salt marsh in the Dongtai wetlands of China's
   Jiangsu province. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased
   soil total organic C by 54.0\% and total organic N by 73.2\%, decreasing
   plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil salinity in both plants' marsh.
   It increased CO2 emissions by 38.2\% and 13.5\%, and reduced CH4
   emissions by 34.5\% and 37.1\%, respectively, in the Spartina
   alterniflora and Phragmites australis marshes. The coastal embankment
   wall also significantly increased N2O emission by 48.9\% in the
   Phragmites australis salt marsh and reduced emissions by 17.2\% in the
   Spartina alterniflora marsh. The fluxes of methane CH4 and carbon
   dioxide CO2 were similar in both restored and unrestored sections,
   whereas the fluxes of nitrous oxide N2O were substantially different
   owing to increased nitrate as a result of N-loading. Our findings show
   that sea embankment reclamation significantly alters coastal marsh
   potential to sequester C and N, particularly in native Phragmites
   australis salt marshes. As a result, sea embankment reclamation
   essentially weakens native and invasive saltmarshes' C and N sinks,
   potentially depleting C and N sinks in coastal China's wetlands.
   Stakeholders and policymakers can utilize this scientific evidence to
   strike a balance between seawall reclamation and invasive plant
   expansion in coastal wetlands.},

Abstract = {Many island power systems are powered by diesel generators or long
   underwater cables, which result in greater operating costs or losses
   than stand-alone systems. It is therefore desirable to integrate
   renewable energy (RE) sources into these mini grids. The main objective
   of the paper is to describe, analyse and present a more unified approach
   for assessing the technical feasibility/potential of different energy
   scenarios for the islands of Malta. in this study, three different
   scenarios are analysed. Integrating RE sources (RES) in energy systems
   reduces losses, cuts fossil fuel consumption whilst maintaining system
   stability and increasing job opportunities. Hydrogen conversion and
   storage methods are also analysed as a method for greenhouse gas (GHG)
   reduction in the transport sector and as a way to reduce excess
   electricity produced from RE. (C) 2008 International Association for

Title = {Coastal use accelerated the regional sea-level rise},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {1-6},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal zones are highly threatened by global sea-level rise (SLR), but
   human-induced change in SLR is often neglected in many studies.
   Identifying the influences of coastal use on regional SLR and their
   interactions is helpful to effectively respond to SLR. In this paper, we
   analyzed the relationship between SLR, coastal use and rising
   temperature at the provincial level in mainland China since 2000. The
   results show that there is significant correlation between increasing
   coastal use and SLR, but that relationship between temperature rising
   and SLR is not significant. This supports our hypothesis that coastal
   use can accelerate regional SLR on Chinese coasts, especially in the
   Bohai Sea. We also discuss the potentially influential mechanism of one
   important coastal use, reclamation, on SLR in the Bohai Sea and present
   suggestions for both coastal use management and adaptation to SLR for
   this region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Southern Ocean has, on average, warmed and freshened over the past
   several decades. As a primary global sink for anthropogenic heat and
   carbon, to understand changes in the Southern Ocean is directly relevant
   to predicting the future evolution of the global climate system.
   However, the drivers of these changes are poorly understood, owing to
   sparse observational sampling, large amplitude internal variability,
   modelling uncertainties and the competing influence of multiple forcing
   agents. Here we construct an observational synthesis to quantify the
   temperature and salinity changes over the Southern Ocean and combine
   this with an ensemble of co-sampled climate model simulations. Using a
   detection and attribution analysis, we show that the observed changes
   are inconsistent with the internal variability or the response to
   natural forcing alone. Rather, the observed changes are primarily
   attributable to human-induced greenhouse gas increases, with a secondary
   role for strato-spheric ozone depletion. Physically, the simulated
   changes are primarily driven by surface fluxes of heat and freshwater.
   The consistency between the observed changes and our simulations
   provides increased confidence in the ability of climate models to
   simulate large-scale thermohaline change in the Southern Ocean.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {China is a country that is particularly negatively affected by the
   challenge of sea-level rise (SLR), which will increasingly threaten the
   country's coastlines. As a result, it is vital that China's local
   communities adapt to these impacts. This paper assesses how local
   decision-makers in coastal communities of Zhejiang Province perceive SLR
   adaptation and how the decision-makers act on these perceptions. We also
   investigate the effect of an information brochure on local
   decision-makers' knowledge, awareness, and policy actions regarding SLR
   adaptation. The results show that decision-makers located along the
   Zhejiang coast have little knowledge of climate change and SLR, and they
   do not place a high priority on the issue of SLR. While providing local
   decision-makers with relevant information could increase their knowledge
   and awareness of the need to act, it will not necessarily lead to
   action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Calculating ships' real emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases:
   Towards zero uncertainties},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {750},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The energy output and emissions from maritime transport have increased
   considerably over the last two decades. Countries in Europe, North
   America and Asia use different methodologies to calculate these
   important variables; two of the main methods used are known as the Ship
   Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) and the Ship Traffic, Energy
   and Environmental Model (STEEM). Furthermore, the International Maritime
   Organization has recently required additional parameters to be included
   in the calculation, but the procedure for calculating these is not
   defined. In this paper, a model named SENEM (Ship's ENergy Efficiency
   Model) is proposed to calculate the power delivered in real time by the
   main engine taking into account all the equations required for defining
   and calculating all these parameters together with the efficiency of
   both the shaft and propulsion system. This model has been tested and
   validated on board four Ro-Pax ships operating across the Strait of
   Gibraltar - three vessels powered by waterjet and the fourth by
   propeller. The results show differences of up to 40\% compared with
   other models. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In 2014, the Australian Government implemented the Emissions Reduction
   Fund to offer incentives for businesses to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions by following approved methods. Beef cattle businesses in
   northern Australia can participate by applying the reducing GHG
   emissions by feeding nitrates to beef cattle' methodology and the beef
   cattle herd management' methods. The nitrate (NO3) method requires that
   each baseline area must demonstrate a history of urea use. Projects earn
   Australian carbon credit units (ACCU) for reducing enteric methane
   emissions by substituting NO3 for urea at the same amount of fed
   nitrogen. NO3 must be fed in the form of a lick block because most
   operations do not have labour or equipment to manage daily
   supplementation. NO3 concentrations, after a 2-week adaptation period,
   must not exceed 50 g NO3/adult animal equivalent per day or 7 g NO3/kg
   dry matter intake per day to reduce the risk of NO3 toxicity. There is
   also a beef cattle herd management' method, approved in 2015, that
   covers activities that improve the herd emission intensity (emissions
   per unit of product sold) through change in the diet or management. The
   present study was conducted to compare the required ACCU or supplement
   prices for a 2\% return on capital when feeding a low or high supplement
   concentration to breeding stock of either (1) urea, (2) three different
   forms of NO3 or (3) cottonseed meal (CSM), at N concentrations
   equivalent to 25 or 50 g urea/animal equivalent, to fasten steer entry
   to a feedlot (backgrounding), in a typical breeder herd on the coastal
   speargrass land types in central Queensland. Monte Carlo simulations
   were run using the software @risk, with probability functions used for
   (1) urea, NO3 and CSM prices, (2) GHG mitigation, (3) livestock prices
   and (4) carbon price. Increasing the weight of steers at a set turnoff
   month by feeding CSM was found to be the most cost-effective option,
   with or without including the offset income. The required ACCU prices
   for a 2\% return on capital were an order of magnitude higher than were
   indicative carbon prices in 2015 for the three forms of NO3. The likely
   costs of participating in ERF projects would reduce the return on
   capital for all mitigation options.},

Title = {Fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane across the water-atmosphere

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {635},
Pages = {1025-1035},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {While aquaculture pond is a dominant land use/cover type and a distinct
   aquatic ecosystem in the coastal zones of China and southeast Asia,
   their contributions to the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) have only
   been poorly quantified. Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in the shrimp ponds with
   different salinities were simultaneously measured in situ using the
   floating chamber technique in two different subtropical estuaries,
   namely, the Min River Estuary (MRE) and Jiulong River Estuary (JRE). The
   average CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the shrimp ponds over the observation
   periods varied from-2.09 to 3.37 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and from 0.28 to
   16.28 mmol CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively, with higher fluxes being
   detected during the middle stage of aquaculture. The temporal variation
   of CO2 and CH4 fluxes in both estuaries ponds closely followed the
   seasonal cycle of temperature. Higher CH4 emissions were observed in MRE
   ponds than in JRE ponds because of the lower water salinity and N-NO3-
   concentrations as well as a greater supply of carbon substrates. Our
   findings suggested that shrimp ponds were CH4 emission ``hotspots{''} in
   the subtropical estuaries of China. Based on a new global warming
   potential model, we conservatively estimated an anuual GHG emission rate
   of approximately 63.68 Tg CO2-eq during the culture period from
   aquaculture ponds across the subtropical estuaries of China. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of aquaculture ponds as a major GHG source
   and a contributor to climate warming in the subtropical estuarine
   regions of China, and call for effective regulation of GHG emissions
   from these ponds for climate mitigation in future. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Decadal changes in radiative fluxes at land and ocean surfaces and their

Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-107},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic interference with climate occurs primarily through
   modification of radiative fluxes in the climate system. Increasing
   releases of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere lead to an enhancement
   of thermal radiation from the atmosphere to the surface by presently
   about 2 W m(-2) per decade, thereby causing global warming. Yet not only
   thermal radiation undergoes substantial decadal changes at the Earth
   surface, but also incident solar radiation (SSR), often in line with
   changes in aerosol emissions. Land-based observations suggest widespread
   declines in SSR from 1950s to 1980s (global dimming'), a partial
   recovery (brightening') since mid-1980s, and indication for an early'
   brightening in 1930s and 1940s. No similar extended observational
   records are available over oceans. However, modeling studies, conceptual
   frameworks and available satellite-derived records point to the
   existence of decadal SSR variations also over oceans. SSR changes
   overall match with decadal variations in observed warming rates,
   suggesting that SSR variations may effectively modulate greenhouse
   gas-induced warming. Specifically, on the Northern Hemisphere, the lack
   of warming from 1950s to 1980s and its subsequent acceleration in the
   1990s fits to the trend reversal from dimming to brightening and
   associated changes in air pollution levels. From the 1950s to 1980s no
   warming was also observed over Northern Hemispheric Oceans, in line with
   conceptual ideas that subtle aerosol changes in pristine ocean areas,
   effectively amplified by aerosol-cloud interactions, can substantially
   alter SSR, thereby modulating Sea Surface Temperatures. On the Southern
   Hemisphere, the absence of significant aerosol levels fits to the
   observed stable (greenhouse gas-induced) warming rates since the 1950s.

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {332},

Pages = {22-36},
Abstract = {The relevance. The greenhouse effect is often associated with methane
   and carbon dioxide emission from the thawing gas-saturated icy deposits.
   The relationship between the increase in concentrations of greenhouse
   gases in the atmosphere and their content in underground ice and frozen
   deposits has not been sufficiently studied. Different and incomparable
   methods of gas sampling from frozen deposits and ice are used to assess
   the content of gases in sediments and ice, the volume of gases entering
   the atmosphere. When generalizing the data on carbon emissions in the
   Arctic zone, it is necessary to take into account both the methods of
   determining the content and composition of gases and the different
   chemical composition, the presence of organic and mineral inclusions in
   genetic types of underground ice.
   The aim of the research is to determine the results of different methods
   of gas sampling from ice and to establish the relationship between the
   content and composition of gases in common genetic types of ground ice.
   Objects: genesis types of ice (segregated, closed-cavity, and ice
   wedge), icy frozen deposits of the north of Western Siberia: on the Bely
   island, on Western Yamal, on the north of Gydan and the Pur-Taz
   interfiuve, collected in expeditions of the Earth Cryosphere Institute,
   Tyumen scientific center SB RAS in 2014-2019.
   Research methods and interpretation of chemical composition. The thermal
   vacuum degassing method and the ``headspace{''} method were used for gas
   extraction from frozen monoliths and ice. The thermal vacuum degassing
   method in laboratory conditions with the determination of the gas volume
   in the ice sample was used as a reference. The method of gas
   chromatography was applied to determine the composition of atmospheric
   and greenhouse gases. Gas content in ice and gas content in frozen peat
   that contains gas in the atmosphere, and the values of the gas
   solubility in water were compared. The correlation analysis of the gas
   content in common types of underground ice, as well as frozen peat, was
   carried out.
   Results. It was established that gas entrapped in ground ice and frozen
   peat was similar to atmospheric gas in terms of the relative content of
   nitrogen and oxygen. It was found out the large variations in methane
   content from 4 to 1,7 - 10(4) ppmV and carbon dioxide from 7 to 2,7 -
   10(3) ppmV in samples are associated with different conditions for
   production and accumulation of greenhouse gases in the permafrost. The
   prevalence of carbon dioxide content over methane in segregated ice and
   ice wedge was established, and maximum methane concentrations (from 1,1
   - 10(3) to 1,7 - 10(4) ppmV) in segregated-migration ice of heaving
   mound and wedge-shaped ice. An excess of methane in the near-surface
   segregated-migration ice is associated with its accumulation in thawed
   talik deposits and subsequent ice formation during freezing in a closed
   system. High concentrations of carbon dioxide (up to 1,1 -10(3) ppmV)
   and methane (up to 222 ppmV) in segregated ice in peat were found; their
   source is organic matter degradation under variable aerobic and
   anaerobic conditions under the action of bacteria. As a result, the
   peatlands are a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions into the
   atmosphere. Assessing reproducibility and comparability of the methods
   of thermal vacuum degassing and ``headspace{''} was carried out in the
   study of ice and frozen sediments in the cross section of peat bog in
   the area of the village Gaz-Sale. It was found that methane
   concentrations during testing by the ``headspace{''} method are
   overestimated by 3-70 times in comparison with the values determined by
   the method of thermal vacuum degassing. This is due to the low
   solubility of methane and its predominance in bubbles, while carbon
   dioxide and some oxygen remain dissolved in water and do not pass into
   the gas sample. Consequently, the data on the gas content determined by
   the ``headspace{''} method is insufficient to estimate the volumes of
   greenhouse gas emissions, since these values characterize the
   qualitative composition of the gas in the bubbles. Thermal vacuum
   degassing method allows calculating and estimating the volumes of gas
   receipts from thawing permafrost.},

Title = {Forecasts of the Compound Coastal Erosion Risks Based on Time-Variant
   Assessment: A Case Study on Yunlin Coast, Taiwan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A coastal erosion risk assessment was framed as the basis for the
   intervention of coastal adaptation strategies under time-variant
   scenarios. The framework was devised to assess the influence of coastal
   erosion on coastal defense, the coastal inundation induced by the
   erosion-induced malfunction of defense, and risks using a downscaling
   analysis and the mechanism of the compound hazard interaction, which are
   innovative and practical for the application of coastal management in
   Taiwan. In addition, the vulnerable socio-economy was also taken into
   consideration in risk assessment. The adaptive strategy is proposed in
   terms of the risk origins and time-variance of risk forecasts, and the
   risk origins were assessed based on the Fuzzy Delphi Method and the
   analytic hierarchy process instead of subjective consideration. Within
   the erosion-induced hazard and risk assessments, this study considered
   erosion rates, decreases in defense elevation due to land subsidence,
   and population development in time-variant scenario analyses to estimate
   risk forecasts. Furthermore, a case study of the Yunlin coastal area was
   undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The
   presented results are informative for coastal hazard reduction and the
   promotion of the sustainable development of coastal zones.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Adaptive management has a long history in ecology and conservation.
   Uncertainty in both the state of a system and the model defining its
   dynamics are fundamental challenges in adaptive management of complex
   ecological systems. Traditional approaches in conservation biology often
   ignore one or both sources of uncertainty due to the computational
   complexity involved. Here, we show that underestimating the role of
   uncertainty in both model estimation and decision-making results in
   aggressive decision rules which can potentially lead to the dramatic
   decline and possible collapse of a population, species, or ecosystem. We
   propose an approximate solution to adaptive management of ecological
   systems under both model and state uncertainties that is computationally
   feasible and applicable to complex management problems and provide a
   software for detailed implementation of our method,
   http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1161521. We apply the proposed method in a
   marine ecosystem management context and show that by learning from
   historical data and arrival of new observations, decision makers can
   adapt their policies to avoid decline in the population and reach a
   sustainable population stability.},

Title = {Attribution of Anthropogenic Influence on Atmospheric Patterns Conducive
   to Recent Most Severe Haze Over Eastern China},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2072-2081},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Severe haze pollution in eastern China has caused substantial health
   impacts and economic loss. Conducive atmospheric conditions are
   important to affect occurrence of severe haze events, and circulation
   changes induced by future global climate warming are projected to
   increase the frequency of such events. However, a potential contribution
   of an anthropogenic influence to recent most severe haze (December 2015
   and January 2013) over eastern China remains unclear. Here we show that
   the anthropogenic influence, which is estimated by using large ensemble
   runs with a climate model forced with and without anthropogenic
   forcings, has already increased the probability of the atmospheric
   patterns conducive to severe haze by at least 45\% in January 2013 and
   27\% in December 2015, respectively. We further confirm that simulated
   atmospheric circulation pattern changes induced by anthropogenic
   influence are driven mainly by increased greenhouse gas emissions. Our
   results suggest that more strict reductions in pollutant emissions are
   needed under future anthropogenic warming.
   Plain Language Summary Extremely severe haze pollution occurred in
   December 2015 and January 2013 over eastern China with concentrations of
   PM2.5 reaching 500gm(-3). During such severe haze, atmospheric
   circulation exhibited an anomalous east-west sea level pressure gradient
   and a weakened East Asia monsoon. We assess in this work the role of
   anthropogenic climate change in such large-scale circulation anomalies
   by using a large ensemble of climate simulations forced with and without
   anthropogenic forcings. Anthropogenic influence is estimated to increase
   the probability of the occurrence of anomalous atmospheric pattern
   similar to that in January 2013 (December 2015) by 45\% (27\%). We
   further confirm that the simulated anthropogenic circulation changes are
   induced mainly by increased greenhouse gas emissions. Results from our
   study suggest that more strict emission reduction measures are needed to
   improve air quality under a continuing anthropogenic warming in the
   upcoming decades and global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
   can decrease the risk of severe haze over eastern China.},

Title = {Decarbonization of Marine Fuels-The Future of Shipping},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The goal of reducing the climate impact of shipping requires many
   different activities. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the
   International Maritime Organization prepared some proposals to meet and
   fulfill the requirements. It sets out the provisions of the
   International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
   73/78 Annex 6-Prevention of the Air Pollution from Ships (1997) with the
   amendments and the future objectives set. The main objective is to
   achieve climate neutrality from shipping by 2050. One method is the
   decarbonization of marine fuels. The types of fuels that are transient
   fuels, with the final target fuel being hydrogen, are shown. Carbon
   dioxide emissions depend on the chemical composition of the fuel, its
   Lower Heating Value and the engine efficiency. The aim of the manuscript
   is to demonstrate that the use of fuels with lower carbon content is a
   transitional process enabling the hydrogen era to take place. An
   analysis of this problem is presented as a review of the subject along
   with the author's comments and observations. The development of
   technologies for adapting potential fuels to combustion requirements in
   marine diesel engines and gas turbines, together with their storage and
   bunkering capabilities, are the main barriers to their limited use. The
   efficiency of marine diesel engines reaches a value of about 50\%, while
   that of fuel cells are close to 100\%. It seems that hydrogen will be
   the fuel of the future, including in shipping. Its basic use is in fuel
   cells, the efficiency of which is almost twice that of current thermal
   internal combustion engines.},

Journal = {APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {5823-5839},
Abstract = {This paper takes some typical points at downstream of Jinsha River in
   China as examples for the overall evaluation of greenhouse gas
   emissions. In reference of previous literature, this study adopted the
   combination of headspace balance method and model estimation to obtain
   the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and methane in surface water and
   exchange fluxes of CO2 and methane. Additionally, this paper also used
   field measuring instruments to measure the physical and chemical
   variables. The Spearman correlation index based on SPSS software are
   applied to analyse the relationship between between the partial
   pressures and fluxes of CO2 and methane and environment variables.
   Experiments' results showed that mean value for partial pressure of CO2
   (p(CO2)) was (1785.87 +/- 451.18) mu atm, ranked medium in worldwide
   rivers. In contrast, the average value for p(CH4) was (22.63 +/- 11.48)
   mu atm ranked relatively low in worldwide rivers. Among all sampling
   sites, the p(CH4) for Linjiaba, Shaonvping, Lizhuang located in
   reservoir area were higher than that for other sites. And the diffusion
   of CO2 flux was in medium level compared with other major rivers in the
   world, at (1.71 +/- 0.55) mmol/(m(2).h), while that of CH4 flux kept in
   low level at (0.0009 +/- 0.0005) mmol/(m(2).h), and all benthic flux of
   CO2 and CH4 were positive indicated the Jinsha River was the source of
   producing greenhouse gas., the trend of the partial pressure and flux
   almost remained the same. Moreover, p(CO2) in surface waters showed
   positive correlations with alkalinity (TA) and dissolved organic
   carbon(DOC), and p(CH4) showed significant positive correlations with
   Chl-a and temperature. CO2 flux showed positively correlation with the
   p(CO2), DOC, alkalinity (TA), and CH4 flux is positively related to
   p(CH4), wind speed. Other environmental factors showed vague effects on
   the fluxes.},

Abstract = {Biogenic greenhouse gas emissions, e.g., of methane (CH4) and carbon
   dioxide (CO2) from inland waters, contribute substantially to global
   warming. In aquatic systems, dissolved greenhouse gases are highly
   heterogeneous in both space and time. To better understand the
   biological and physical processes that affect sources and sinks of both
   CH4 and CO2, their dissolved concentrations need to be measured with
   high spatial and temporal resolution. To achieve this goal, we developed
   the Fast-Response Automated Gas Equilibrator (FaRAGE) for real-time in
   situ measurement of dissolved CH4 and CO2 concentrations at the water
   surface and in the water column. FaRAGE can achieve an exceptionally
   short response time (t(95\%) = 12 s when including the response time of
   the gas analyzer) while retaining an equilibration ratio of 62.6\% and a
   measurement accuracy of 0.5\% for CH4. A similar performance was
   observed for dissolved CO2 (t(95\%) = 10 s, equilibration ratio 67.1
   \%). An equilibration ratio as high as 91.8\% can be reached at the cost
   of a slightly increased response time (16 s). The FaRAGE is capable of
   continuously measuring dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the
   nM-to-submM (10(-9)-10(-3) mol L-1) range with a detection limit of
   subnM (10(-10) mol L-1), when coupling with a cavity ring-down
   greenhouse gas analyzer (Picarro GasScouter). FaRAGE allows for the
   possibility of mapping dissolved concentration in a ``quasi{''}
   three-dimensional manner in lakes and provides an inexpensive
   alternative to other commercial gas equilibrators. It is simple to
   operate and suitable for continuous monitoring with a strong tolerance
   for suspended particles. While the FaRAGE is developed for inland
   waters, it can be also applied to ocean waters by tuning the gas-water
   mixing ratio. The FaRAGE is easily adapted to suit other gas analyzers
   expanding the range of potential applications, including nitrous oxide
   and isotopic composition of the gases.},

Abstract = {Due to the loss of coastal land by intensified global climate change,
   the threat to the lives and property of people is becoming more serious,
   and the disaster risk assessment and management of coastal areas is
   becoming an important issue. Based on the Coastal Management Act, in
   this study, the four hazard factors such as sea-level rise, subsidence,
   storm surge flooding, and coastal erosion are discussed. Further, the
   hazard index and the designating principles for coastal protection zone
   are established and designated as first-grade and second-grade coastal
   protection zones. In addition, the vulnerability index includes physical
   factors', natural environmental factors', social-economic factors', and
   resilience factors' relationships with urban development. Use of the
   Pareto ranking method can remove the weight factor to establish a
   comprehensive assessment of the index rating respectively. Then,
   combined with coastal hazards and the vulnerability index for disaster
   risk analysis of coastal areas, a risk map can be generated via
   geographic information systems. The study results can provide a
   reference for disaster adaptation and coastal management and
   utilization.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mangroves are extraordinary ecosystems, providing many goods and
   services to human beings. These particularly include fisheries, forest
   products, pollution abatement, carbon sequestration and coastal
   protection against natural calamities such as tsunami and cyclones.
   However, a recent article by Satheeshkumar et al. (2012) questioned the
   role of mangroves as barriers against cyclones. These authors further
   claimed that the cost of mangrove restoration was higher than the value
   of the coastal protection service provided by them. The role of
   mangroves in coastal protection against cyclones, typhoons and tidal
   waves has been scientifically proved in several parts of the tropical
   region beyond all doubts. High priority should be given to conserve the
   remaining mangroves in order to minimize the impacts of natural
   disasters both in coastal and inland areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Deep-Sea Bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 Has Two Dimethyl
   Sulfoxide Reductases in Distinct Subcellular Locations},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) acts as a substantial sink for dimethyl
   sulfide (DMS) in deep waters and is therefore considered a potential
   electron acceptor supporting abyssal ecosystems. Shewanella
   piezotolerans WP3 was isolated from west Pacific deep-sea sediments, and
   two functional DMSO respiratory subsystems are essential for maximum
   growth of WP3 under in situ conditions (4 degrees C/20MPa). However, the
   relationship between these two subsystems and the electron transport
   pathway underlying DMSO reduction by WP3 remain unknown. In this study,
   both DMSO reductases (type I and type VI) in WP3 were found to be
   functionally independent despite their close evolutionary relationship.
   Moreover, immunogold labeling of DMSO reductase subunits revealed that
   the type I DMSO reductase was localized on the outer leaflet of the
   outer membrane, whereas the type VI DMSO reductase was located within
   the periplasmic space. CymA, a cytoplasmic membrane-bound tetraheme
   c-type cytochrome, served as a preferential electron transport protein
   for the type I and type VI DMSO reductases, in which type VI accepted
   electrons from CymA in a DmsEand DmsF-independent manner. Based on these
   results, we proposed a core electron transport model of DMSO reduction
   in the deep-sea bacterium S. piezotolerans WP3. These results
   collectively suggest that the possession of two sets of DMSO reductases
   with distinct subcellular localizations may be an adaptive strategy for
   WP3 to achieve maximum DMSO utilization in deep-sea environments.
   IMPORTANCE As the dominant methylated sulfur compound in deep oceanic
   water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been suggested to play an important
   role in the marine biogeochemical cycle of the volatile anti-greenhouse
   gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Two sets of DMSO respiratory systems in the
   deep-sea bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 have previously been
   identified to mediate DMSO reduction under in situ conditions (4 degrees
   C/20 MPa). Here, we report that the two DMSO reductases (type I and type
   VI) in WP3 have distinct subcellular localizations, in which type I DMSO
   reductase is localized to the exterior surface of the outer membrane and
   type VI DMSO reductase resides in the periplasmic space. A core electron
   transport model of DMSO reduction in WP3 was constructed based on
   genetic and physiological data. These results will contribute to a
   comprehensive understanding of the adaptation mechanisms of anaerobic
   respiratory systems in benthic microorganisms.},

Abstract = {Reconstructions of climate from marine sediment(1) and ice(2) cores show
   that the amplitude of glacial-interglacial climate cycles increased
   substantially after the Mid-Brunhes Event(3), about 430,000 years ago.
   Interglacial periods before the event seem to be characterized by larger
   continental ice sheets, lower sea level(4,5), cooler temperatures in
   Antarctica2 and lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations(6), relative to the
   more recent interglacials. Here we use an Earth system model of
   intermediate complexity to assess the contributions of insolation and
   greenhouse-gas concentrations to the climate associated with the peaks
   of all the interglacials over the past 800,000 years. Our simulations
   recreate the expected warmer interglacials after the Mid-Brunhes Event
   and suggest that later interglacials are warmer primarily because of
   increased global mean temperatures during Northern Hemisphere winters.
   This warmth arises from increased insolation during this season,
   relative to the interglacials that preceded the Mid-Brunhes Event, in
   conjunction with increased atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations.
   The effect of boreal winters and of the Southern Hemisphere, which is
   also warmer during austral winters, on the carbon cyle should be
   assessed when investigating the underlying causes of the higher CO2
   concentrations during the later interglacials.},

Abstract = {Located in north-east France, the Observatoire Perenne de
   l'Environnement (OPE) station was built during the Integrated Carbon
   Observation System (ICOS) Demonstration Experiment to monitor the
   greenhouse gases mole fraction. Its continental rural background setting
   fills the gaps between oceanic or mountain stations and urban stations
   within the ICOS network. Continuous measurements of several greenhouse
   gases using high-precision spectrometers started in 2011 on a tall tower
   with three sampling inlets at 10, 50 and 120 m above ground level
   (a.g.l.). Measurement quality is regularly assessed using several
   complementary approaches based on reference high-pressure cylinders,
   audits using travelling instruments and sets of travelling cylinders
   ({''}cucumber{''} intercomparison programme). Thanks to the quality
   assurance strategy recommended by ICOS, measurement uncertainties are
   within the World Meteorological Organisation compatibility goals for
   carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO). The time
   series of mixing ratios from 2011 to the end of 2018 are used to analyse
   trends and diurnal and seasonal cycles. The CO2 and CH4 annual growth
   rates are 2.4 ppm yr(-1) and 8.8 ppb yr(-1) respectively for
   measurements at 120 m a.g.l. over the investigated period. However, no
   significant trend has been recorded for CO mixing ratios. The afternoon
   mean residuals (defined as the differences between midday observations
   and a smooth fitted curve) of these three compounds are significantly
   stronger during the cold period when inter-species correlations are
   high, compared to the warm period. The variabilities of residuals show a
   close link with air mass back-trajectories.},

Abstract = {A new field of study, ``decadal prediction,{''} is emerging in climate
   science. Decadal prediction lies between seasonal/interannual
   forecasting and longer-term climate change projections, and focuses on
   time-evolving regional climate conditions over the next 10-30 yr.
   Numerous assessments of climate information user needs have identified
   this time scale as being important to infrastructure planners, water
   resource managers, and many others. It is central to the information
   portfolio required to adapt effectively to and through climatic changes.
   At least three factors influence time-evolving regional climate at the
   decadal time scale: 1) climate change commitment (further warming as the
   coupled climate system comes into adjustment with increases of
   greenhouse gases that have already occurred), 2) external forcing,
   particularly from future increases of greenhouse gases and recovery of
   the ozone hole, and 3) internally generated variability. Some decadal
   prediction skill has been demonstrated to arise from the first two of
   these factors, and there is evidence that initialized coupled climate
   models can capture mechanisms of internally generated decadal climate
   variations, thus increasing predictive skill globally and particularly
   regionally. Several methods have been proposed for initializing global
   coupled climate models for decadal predictions, all of which involve
   global time-evolving threedimensional ocean data, including temperature
   and salinity. An experimental framework to address decadal
   predictability/prediction is described in this paper and has been
   incorporated into the coordinated Coupled Model Intercomparison Model,
   phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments, some of which will be assessed for the IPCC
   Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). These experiments will likely guide work
   in this emerging field over the next 5 yr.},

Title = {Confronting climate change: Adaptation vs. migration in Small Island
   Developing States?},
Journal = {RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper examines the adaptation policy of Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS) facing climate change. We consider a dynamic economy with
   the following ingredients: (i) natural capital is an input in local
   production that is degraded as a result of climate change; (ii) the
   government has two instruments to cope with climate-related damages: it
   can adjust the population size thanks to migration policies and/or it
   can undertake adaptation measures in order to slow the degradation of
   natural assets; (iii) expatriates send remittances back home. We
   identify two critical conditions on the fundamentals of the economy that
   helps under-stand the features of the optimal policy. We especially show
   that in most situations, the migration policy is a valuable instrument.
   Calibrating the model for Caribbean SIDS, we find that the optimal
   policy of the Caribbean region displays heterogeneity, that is explained
   by the different degradation rate, population size, and endowment in
   natural capital. We also highlight that the higher the climate damages,
   the higher the incentives to conduct an active adaptation policy,
   combining conventional adaptation actions and migration. (c) 2022

   Climate Change: A Narrative Review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This narrative review examined strategies for preparedness and response
   to mental health impacts of three forms of climate change from a
   services perspective: (1) acute and extreme weather events such as
   hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, (2) sub-acute or long-term events
   such as droughts and heatwaves; and (3) the prospect of long-term and
   permanent changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and
   an uninhabitable physical environment. Strategies for acute events
   included development and implementation of programs and practices for
   monitoring and treating mental health problems and strengthening
   individual and community resilience, training of community health
   workers to deliver services, and conducting inventories of available
   resources and assessments of at-risk populations. Additional strategies
   for sub-acute changes included advocacy for mitigation policies and
   programs and adaptation of guidelines and interventions to address the
   secondary impacts of sub-acute events, such as threats to livelihood,
   health and well-being, population displacement, environmental
   degradation, and civil conflict. Strategies for long-lasting changes
   included the implementation of evidence-based risk communication
   interventions that address the existing and potential threat of climate
   change, promoting the mental health benefits of environmental
   conservation, and promoting psychological growth and resilience.},

Title = {Salinity stress changed the biogeochemical controls on CH4 and N2O
   emissions of estuarine and intertidal sediments},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {652},
Pages = {593-601},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Elevated salinity is expected to drive changes in biogeochemical cycling
   and microbial communities in estuarine and intertidal wetlands. However,
   limited information regarding the role of salinity in shaping
   biogeochemical controls and mediating greenhouse gas emissions is
   currently available. In this study, we used incubation experiment across
   salinity gradients of the estuarine and intertidal sediments to reveal
   the underlying interconnections of CH4 and N2O emissions, biogeochemical
   controls and salinity gradients. Our results indicated that sediment
   biogeochemical properties were significantly affected by the increasing
   salinity, which were attributed to the accelerated sediment enzyme
   activities. The increasing salinity promoted CH4 and N2O emission rates
   by stimulating organic carbon decomposition and nitrogen transformation
   rates. In addition, the copy number of mcrA, nirS and nirK genes
   increased along with the salinity gradients, which strongly mediated the
   CH4 and N2O emission rates. Stepwise regression analysis suggested that
   labile organic carbon and denitrification were the most crucial
   determinants of CH4 and N2O emission rates, respectively. Overall,
   salinity could enhance CH4 and N2O emission mainly by altering sediment
   geochemical variables, microbial activity and functional gene abundance
   in estuarine and intertidal environments. Furthermore, increasing
   salinity could enhance the carbon and nitrogen export, which may pose a
   threat to the ecological function of estuarine and intertidal
   ecosystems. This study may contribute to the knowledge about the
   importance of biogeochemical controls induced by salinity in mediating
   greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Green development strategy of offshore wind farm in China guided by life
   cycle assessment},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {188},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Offshore wind power contributes to the decarbonization of the power
   system; however, its green development faces many challenges, including
   environmental impact concerns, scale limitations, and grid parity to go
   carbon neutral. This study applies life cycle assessment (LCA) to
   evaluate the potential environmental impact of China's first high-power
   prototype windfarm. The environmental impact of the wind farm is more
   sensitive to steel, copper, and electricity usage. The recycling of
   waste turbines can be a solution to reduce the environmental impacts of
   not only the wind farm but also other entities such as metal producers.
   Overall, this wind farm case can reduce energy consumption and
   greenhouse gas emissions by 9.23 MJ and 767.9 g CO2-eq for 1 kWh
   electricity produced, respectively. Guided by LCA results, green
   development strategies that include toward the deep sea, promote
   industrial upgrading and synergy, and advance demonstration projects are
   discussed in the offshore wind power industry.},

Title = {Increasing risk over time of weather-related hazards to the European
   population: a data-driven prognostic study},
Journal = {LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {1},
Number = {5},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background The observed increase in the effects on human beings of
   weather-related disasters has been largely attributed to the rise in
   population exposed, with a possible influence of global warming. Yet,
   future risks of weather-related hazards on human lives in view of
   climate and demographic changes have not been comprehensively
   investigated.
   Methods We assessed the risk of weather-related hazards to the European
   population in terms of annual numbers of deaths in 30 year intervals
   relative to the reference period (1981-2010) up to the year 2100
   (2011-40, 2041-70, and 2071-100) by combining disaster records with
   high-resolution hazard and demographic projections in a prognostic
   modelling framework. We focused on the hazards with the greatest
   impacts-heatwaves and cold waves, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal
   floods, and windstorms-and evaluated their spatial and temporal
   variations in intensity and frequency under a business-as-usual scenario
   of greenhouse gas emissions. We modelled long-term demographic dynamics
   through a territorial modelling platform to represent the evolution of
   human exposure under a corresponding middle-of-the-road socioeconomic
   scenario. We appraised human vulnerability to weather extremes on the
   basis of more than 2300 records collected from disaster databases during
   the reference period and assumed it to be static under a scenario of no
   adaptation.
   Findings We found that weather-related disasters could affect about
   two-thirds of the European population annually by the year 2100 (351
   million people exposed per year {[}uncertainty range 126 million to 523
   million] during the period 2071-100) compared with 5\% during the
   reference period (1981-2010; 25 million people exposed per year). About
   50 times the number of fatalities occurring annually during the
   reference period (3000 deaths) could occur by the year 2100 (152 000
   deaths {[}80 500-239 800]). Future effects show a prominent latitudinal
   gradient, increasing towards southern Europe, where the premature
   mortality rate due to weather extremes (about 700 annual fatalities per
   million inhabitants {[}482-957] during the period 2071-100 vs 11 during
   the reference period) could become the greatest environmental risk
   factor. The projected changes are dominated by global warming
   (accounting for more than 90\% of the rise in risk to human beings),
   mainly through a rise in the frequency of heatwaves (about 2700
   heat-related fatalities per year during the reference period vs 151 500
   {[}80 100-239 000] during the period 2071-100).
   Interpretation Global warming could result in rapidly rising costs of
   weather-related hazards to human beings in Europe unless adequate
   adaptation measures are taken. Our results could aid in prioritisation
   of regional investments to address the unequal burden of effects on
   human beings of weather-related hazards and differences in adaptation
   capacities. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Pilot scale assessment of methane capture from low concentration sources
   to town gas specification by pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA)},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {427},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Methane (CH4) is the second largest contributor to anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The separation of CH4 from nitrogen
   (N-2) is crucial for the capture of CH4 from low concentration sources,
   such as coal seam gas, to reduce GHG emissions. Pressure vacuum swing
   adsorption (PVSA) provides a flexible and scalable method for CH4/N-2
   separation. In this work, a novel adsorbent (ILZ) was used in a 112 kg
   scale PVSA pilot facility to test the feasibility of separating CH4 from
   low concentration sources (4.7-44.5\%). A product purity of 44.5\% CH4
   and a methane recovery of 81\% were achieved from a feed gas containing
   just 4.7\% CH4 via a 3-stage PVSA process. Such a product gas can then
   be transported using pipelines and used for either power generation or
   4T town gases in China. The total energy consumption was 133 kJ per mol
   CH4 captured, which is 85\% lower than its heating value (similar to 880
   kJ/mol). This study demonstrates that the capture of CH4 from large but
   low concentration sources incentivises GHG emissions reduction.},

Title = {Effect of drainage on CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes from aquaculture ponds
   during winter in a subtropical estuary of China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {72-82},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aquaculture ponds are dominant features of the landscape in the coastal
   zone of China. Generally, aquaculture ponds are drained during the
   non-culture period in winter. However, the effects of such drainage on
   the production and flux of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from aquaculture
   ponds are largely unknown. In the present study, field-based research
   was performed to compare the GHG fluxes between one drained pond (DP,
   with a water depth of 0.05 m) and one undrained pond (UDP, with a water
   depth of 1.16 m) during one winter in the Min River estuary of southeast
   China. Over the entire study period, the mean CO2 flux in the DP was
   (0.75 +/- 0.12) mmol/(m(2).hr), which was significantly higher than that
   in the UDP of (-0.49 +/- 0.09) mmol/(m(2).hr) (p < 0.01). This indicates
   that drainage drastically transforms aquaculture ponds from a net sink
   to a net source of CO2 in winter. Mean CH4 and N2O emissions were
   significantly higher in the DP compared to those in the UDP (CH4 = (0.66
   +/- 0.31) vs. (0.07 +/- 0.06) mmol/(m(2).hr) and N2O = (19.54 +/- 2.08)
   vs. (0.01 +/- 0.04) mu mol/(m(2).hr)) (p < 0.01), suggesting that
   drainage would also significantly enhance CH4 and N2O emissions. Changes
   in environmental variables (including sediment temperature, pH,
   salinity, redox status, and water depth) contributed significantly to
   the enhanced GHG emissions following pond drainage. Furthermore,
   analysis of the sustained-flux global warming and cooling potentials
   indicated that the combined global warming potentials of the GHG fluxes
   were significantly higher in the DP than in the UDP (p < 0.01), with
   values of 739.18 and 26.46 mgCO(2)-eq/(m(2).hr), respectively. Our
   findings suggested that drainage of aquaculture ponds can increase the
   emissions of potent GHGs from the coastal zone of China to the
   atmosphere during winter, further aggravating the problem of global
   warming. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences,

Abstract = {The science of climate change is now well established. Predicted
   weather-related events like sea level rise, increased storm events, and
   extreme heat waves imply an urgent need for new approaches to settlement
   design to enable human and non-human species to adapt to these increased
   risks. A wide variety of policy responses are emerging at local and
   regional levels - from sustainable urban form, to alternative energy
   production and new approaches to biodiversity conservation. However.
   little attempt has been made to ensure that strategies to adapt to the
   inevitable impacts of enhanced climate change (such as additional open
   space to enable water inundation) support ongoing policies intended to
   mitigate local contributions to climate change (such as attempts to
   increase urban densities to reduce car dependency). In some cases
   mitigation and adaptation are complementary but in other cases these
   policy goals may conflict. This research examined leading case examples
   of land-use plans and policies designed to address climate change.
   Focusing predominantly on cases from the United States and Australia, we
   identified whether the policies address adaptation, mitigation or both
   and whether the practices put mitigation and adaptation in potential
   conflict with each other. We found that half of the actions identified
   contain potential conflicts to achieving adaptation and mitigation
   simultaneously. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Multi-Year Comparison of CO(2)Concentration from NOAA Carbon Tracker
   Reanalysis Model with Data from GOSAT and OCO-2 over Asia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the carbon budget on global and regional scales is
   critically important to design mitigation strategies aimed at
   stabilizing the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. For a better
   understanding of CO(2)variation trends over Asia, in this study, the
   column-averaged CO(2)dry air mole fraction (XCO2) derived from the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CarbonTracker
   (CT) was compared with that of Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite
   (GOSAT) from September 2009 to August 2019 and with Orbiting Carbon
   Observatory 2 (OCO-2) from September 2014 until August 2019. Moreover,
   monthly averaged time-series and seasonal climatology comparisons were
   also performed separately over the five regions of Asia; i.e., Central
   Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Western Asia. The
   results show that XCO(2)from GOSAT is higher than the XCO(2)simulated by
   CT by an amount of 0.61 ppm, whereas, OCO-2 XCO(2)is lower than CT by
   0.31 ppm on average, over Asia. The mean spatial correlations of 0.93
   and 0.89 and average Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSDs) of 2.61 and
   2.16 ppm were found between the CT and GOSAT, and CT and OCO-2,
   respectively, implying the existence of a good agreement between the CT
   and the other two satellites datasets. The spatial distribution of the
   datasets shows that the larger uncertainties exist over the southwest
   part of China. Over Asia, NOAA CT shows a good agreement with GOSAT and
   OCO-2 in terms of spatial distribution, monthly averaged time series,
   and seasonal climatology with small biases. These results suggest that
   CO(2)can be used from either of the datasets to understand its role in
   the carbon budget, climate change, and air quality at regional to global
   scales.},

Title = {Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils via cultivation of cover
   crops - A meta-analysis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {200},
Pages = {33-41},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the
   inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover
   crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil
   organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields,
   like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic
   manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green
   manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a
   meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock
   changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites
   were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly
   higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since
   introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated
   with SOC stock change (R-2 = 0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32
   +/- 0.08 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in a mean soil depth of 22 cm and during the
   observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot
   and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the
   model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not
   proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the
   carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached
   after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock
   accumulation of 16.7 +/- 1.5 Mg ha(-1) for a soil depth of 22 cm. Thus,
   the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover
   crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC
   sequestration of 0.12 +/- 0.03 Pg Cyr(-1), which would compensate for
   8\% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.
   However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation
   have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which
   are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable
   greenhouse gas budgets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The increasing energy demand, the need to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions and the shrinking reserves of fossil fuels have all enhanced
   the interest in sustainable and renewable energy sources, including wave
   energy. Many concepts for wave power conversion have been invented. In
   order to extract a considerable amount of wave power, single Wave Energy
   Converters (abbreviated as WECs) will have to be arranged in arrays or
   `farms' using a particular geometrical layout, comprising large numbers
   of devices. As a result of the interaction between the WECs within a
   farm, the overall power absorption is affected. In general, the incident
   waves are partly reflected, transmitted and absorbed by a single WEC.
   Also, the wave height behind a large farm of WECs is reduced and this
   reduction may influence neighbouring farms, other users in the sea or
   even the coastline (wake effects of a WEC farm).
   The numerical wave propagation model MILDwave has been recently used to
   study wake effects and energy absorption of farms of WECs, though
   without taking into account wave regeneration by wind in the lee of the
   WEC-farm which can be significant in large distances downwave the WECs.
   In this paper, the implementation of wave growth due to wind in the
   hyperbolic mild-slope equations of the wave propagation model, MILDwave
   is described. Several formulations for the energy input from wind found
   in literature are considered and implemented. The performance of these
   formulations in MILDwave is investigated and validated. The modified
   model MILDwave is then applied for the investigation of the influence of
   the wind on the wakes in the lee of a farm of wave energy converters.},

Title = {Effects of salinity and wet-dry treatments on C and N dynamics in
   coastal-forested wetland soils: Implications of sea level rise},

Abstract = {Forested wetlands dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and
   water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) are commonly found in coastal regions of
   the southeastern United States. Global climate change and in particular
   sea level rise will alter the frequency and magnitude of wet/dry periods
   and salinity levels in these ecosystems. Soil microcosm experiments were
   set up to identify the effects of water level variations (0.4-3.0
   g-water g-soil(-1)) and salinity changes (0, 1 and 5 ppt of NaCl) on
   greenhouse gas emissions (CH4, CO2, and N2O) and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) characteristics from forested wetland soils. Our results
   indicate that, the effect of water level was much greater than salt
   intrusion on C and N cycling. Wet dry treatments significantly decreased
   DOC production and total CH4-C loss, aromatic and humic-like substance
   compounds in DOC were increased in both flooding and wet dry treatments
   after 60-d incubation. The molecular weight (MW) of DOC, as indicated by
   E2/E3 ratio and spectral slope, after flooding treatments was higher
   than that in wet dry treatments. A first order kinetic model showed
   there was a positive linear correlation (r(2) = 0.73) between CO2
   emission rate and DOC concentration which indicated that CO2 was mainly
   generated from DOC. An exponential kinetic model was applied to describe
   the correlation between CH4 emission rate and DOC concentration (r(2) =
   0.41). This study demonstrates that an increase in salinity, and in
   particular variations in wet dry cycles, will lead to changes in the
   formation of climate -relevant greenhouse gases, such as CH4, CO2, and
   N2O. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the most important problems that affect the world are carbon
   footprint decrease, fossil fuel use, and climate change. As proof of
   that, all environmental international agencies impose different laws and
   rules related to greenhouse effect. European Union policy is a clear
   example, which is explained in the document 2020 Strategies
   (COM/2010/2020 final) {[}1]. Water deficit is another question that
   produces a lot of problems around the World. About 1,100 million people
   lack access to safe drinking water, which represents 18\% of the world
   population. Approximately 42\% of the population is not able to access
   basic sanitation. The project raised different problems related to water
   and energy production. The primary goal is to achieve low carbon
   emissions. Moreover, these dual plants (desalination and thermal power
   plants) should be more efficient and flexible. The project's main goal
   is to study water and energy cogeneration in half power thermal power
   plants through different docking ways. The system is approached to be
   installed in areas where water is not sufficient.},

Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Pacific Island countries, like the Cook Islands, are often considered to
   be extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Considerable
   literature highlights that local knowledge can play an important role in
   climate change adaptation, particularly in small island countries.
   However, there is less understanding on how to practically integrate and
   apply local knowledge in climate change adaptation, particularly in the
   Cook Islands. This research investigated the role of local knowledge in
   climate change adaptation in the Cook Islands, aiming to understand the
   role of local knowledge in adaptation policies and the challenges of
   incorporating local knowledge into climate change adaptation policy
   through semistructured interviews with key informants and local
   participants. Key informants often recognized the important role of
   local knowledge in climate change adaptation while local knowledge was
   less recognized by local participants. Concerns over both the usefulness
   of the knowledge today and the loss of this knowledge were expressed.
   Additionally, challenges to integrating local knowledge into climate
   change policy were identified, including development pressure,
   out-migration, and a lack of understanding of local knowledge. This
   study offers insight into the role of local knowledge in climate change
   adaptation for other small island countries facing similar challenges.},

Abstract = {Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world with more
   than 250 million people, it encompasses more than 17,000 islands.
   Indonesia is geographically located close to the equator and the islands
   have an abundance of natural resources. Indonesia has become one of the
   World's biggest coal and natural gas exporters. However, Indonesia
   struggles to achieve a good balance between energy security,
   environmental standards and economic growth. Development of a
   sustainable energy policy is seen as a key aspect that will allow
   Indonesia to achieve improved environmental standards. The development
   of Indonesian energy policy can be traced back to 1981 with the
   development of KUBE (Kebijakan Umum Bidang Energi) which aimed to
   achieve energy conservation and diversification. Since then Indonesian
   energy policy has been regularly updated (in 1987, 1991, 1993 and 2003).
   In the 2005 update, Indonesia set targets to achieve a 17\% contribution
   from renewable energy in the energy mix by 2025 and reduce Greenhouse
   Gas (GHG) emissions by 26\% in 2020. In 2014, as part of the National
   Energy Policy (KEN), Indonesia updated their energy policy to reflect
   the latest energy growth and trends. This study explores the trends in
   Indonesia's energy and environment issues through a comprehensive review
   of the published literature on issues such as energy development, air
   pollution, GHG emissions and sociopolitical aspects of energy, from 1982
   to 2016. This information is analysed to help understand how energy
   supply and use interacts with the environment and what this might mean
   for future energy policy in Indonesia.},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations in the
   last several decades has caused observable changes in global climate on
   all continents. Carbon dioxide, the primary causative agent of climate
   change has increased from long-term mean average of 275 ppm to the
   current level of 400 ppm. About 85\% of the current global energy
   production and use is based or derived from fossil fuels. If there is no
   concerted action by the global community, CO2 levels could increase by
   130\% by mid century resulting in large-scale climate changes such as
   the disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet, large-scale coral
   reef bleaching, and shutdown of the ocean circulation system.
   Stabilization of CO2 levels will require a deceleration in the rate of
   increase in fossil fuel consumption, and the use of emission-free power
   sources in the immediate future. The former can have immediate
   ameliorative effects, whereas the latter will require substantial
   investment in research and development to find and implement innovative
   technologies. However there are limits to technological solutions to
   sustainable development. Renewable energy technologies and low-carbon
   emission technologies will have material and environmental constraints
   with as yet undetermined consequences. In addition to technological
   solutions, it is important to develop needed social and political
   infrastructure to decrease future energy demand by controlling
   population growth and energy intensity. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Challenges, opportunities, and climate change adaptation strategies of
   mangrove-agriculture ecosystem in the Sundarbans, India: a review},

Abstract = {The mangrove-agriculture system is a distinct ecosystem that evolved in
   the Sundarbans, India in the last century due to anthropogenic
   activities and climate change consequences. Degraded-mangrove and
   agriculture (rice-based systems and aquaculture) exist side by side,
   each having their specific challenges and opportunities. In this review,
   we analyzed challenges faced by this unique ecosystem along with
   opportunities derived from technological advancement and site-specific
   climate change adaptation strategies. Both the mangrove and lowland rice
   ecosystem could act as carbon (C) sink to the tune of 27 and 0.93 t
   ha(-1) per annum, respectively. Apart from C sequestration,
   mangrove-rice systems provide many ecosystem services. However, 40\% of
   tropical and 10.5\% of Sundarban mangroves (between 1930 and 2013), have
   been lost due to climate change induced sea-level rise, extreme weather
   events and human interferences. The specific challenges in this system
   are freshwater scarcity, high salinity, insufficient real-time seed
   supply, poor fertilizer-management, lack of irrigation network, and
   unprecedented occurrence of extreme events which seriously hamper the
   productivity of mangrove, rice, and aquaculture. There also exist some
   unique opportunities in terms of cheap labour availability,
   mangrove-conservation acts, cheap river-communication, and scope of
   ecotourism which fortunately get the attention of national and
   international funding agencies. In the last section of this review, we
   recommended ten climate change adaptation strategies that may be
   considered at the policy and farmer levels. The strategies broadly
   include the development of small-scale rainwater harvesting structures
   in series, the introduction of salt tolerant cultivars with water
   management, land shaping, establishment of multipurpose cyclone shelter
   at each block and empowerment of women through self-help groups.},

Abstract = {Three distinct models from earlier work are combined to: (1) produce
   probabilistically weighted scenarios of greenhouse-gas-induced sea-level
   rise; (2) support estimates of the expected discounted value of the cost
   of sea-level rise to the developed coastline of the United States, and
   (3) develop reduced-form estimates of the functional relationship
   between those costs to anticipated sea-level rise, the cost of
   protection, and the anticipated rate of property-value appreciation,
   Four alternative representations of future sulfate emissions, each tied
   consistently to the forces that drive the initial trajectories of the
   greenhouse gases, are considered. Sea-level rise has a nonlinear effect
   on expected cost in all cases, bur the estimated sensitivity falls short
   of being quadratic. The mean estimate for the expected discounted cost
   across the United States is approximately \$2 billion (with a 3\% real
   discount rate), but the range of uncertainty around that estimate is
   enormous; indeed, the 10th and 90th percentile estimates run from less
   than \$0.2 billion up to more than \$4.6 billion, In addition, the mean
   estimate is very sensitive to associated sulfate emissions; it is,
   specifically, diminished by nearly 25\% when base-case sulfate emission
   trajectories are considered and by more than 55\% when high-sulfate
   trajectories are allowed.},

Title = {ECOLOGICALLY ENGINEERING CITIES THROUGH INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS

Abstract = {Every day more evidence surfaces about the dire state of the
   environment. More and more, sustainable development is fundamentally
   about meeting human needs while restoring balance to the global
   ecosystem that is failing, Greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets
   and other new environmental performance targets are rapidly being
   adopted across the globe to try to shore up this degradation.
   We are finally entering the era of broad scale environmental
   accountability. Achieving sustainability performance targets across
   complex and integrated social, ecological, and economic systems requires
   new ways of engineering the way we interact with the environment. In
   turn, ecologically engineering the built environment requires new
   quantitative performance approaches to planning. It requires
   understanding and analyzing the complex systematic relationships between
   the built and natural environment and capitalizing on the efficiencies
   that can be found through integrated design.
   The sustainability movement is currently focused on reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions, but the threats to sustainability run much deeper than
   that. Climate change is driving changes to nearly all ecosystem services
   upon which we rely. Reducing carbon emissions has taken a front seat in
   sustainability programming, but typically through a some what focused
   lens of energy and transportation systems.
   This paper will discuss an approach to sustainability that is more
   holistic and ecosystem based. One that optimizes the ecological
   opportunities of a site and technology to make the built environment
   more sustainably integrated with the natural environment at the site,
   region, and global scale.},

Journal = {NATURE GEOSCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {5},
Pages = {313-317},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A poleward shift of the mid-latitude storm tracks in response to
   anthropogenic greenhouse-gas forcing has been diagnosed in climate model
   simulations(1,2). Explanations of this effect have focused on
   atmospheric dynamics(3-7). However, in contrast to storm tracks in other
   regions, the North Atlantic storm track responds by strengthening and
   extending farther east, in particular on its southern flank(8). These
   adjustments are associated with an intensification and extension of the
   eddy-driven jet towards western Europe(9) and are expected to have
   considerable societal impacts related to a rise in storminess in
   Europe(10-12). Here, we apply a regression analysis to an ensemble of
   coupled climate model simulations to show that the coupling between
   ocean and atmosphere shapes the distinct storm-track response to
   greenhouse-gas forcing in the North Atlantic region. In the ensemble of
   simulations we analyse, at least half of the differences between the
   storm-track responses of different models are associated with
   uncertainties in ocean circulation changes. We compare the fully coupled
   simulations with both the associated slab model simulations and an
   ocean-forced experiment with one climate model to establish causality.
   We conclude that uncertainties in the response of the North Atlantic
   storm track to anthropogenic emissions could be reduced through tighter
   constraints on the future ocean circulation.},

Title = {Nearshore Zone Dynamics Determine Pathway of Organic Carbon From Eroding
   Permafrost Coasts},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Collapse of permafrost coasts delivers large quantities of particulate
   organic carbon (POC) to Arctic coastal areas. With rapidly changing
   environmental conditions, sediment and organic carbon (OC) mobilization
   and transport pathways are also changing. Here, we assess the sources
   and sinks of POC in the highly dynamic nearshore zone of Herschel
   Island-Qikiqtaruk (Yukon, Canada). Our results show that POC
   concentrations sharply decrease, from 15.9 to 0.3 mg L-1, within the
   first 100-300 m offshore. Simultaneously, radiocarbon ages of POC drop
   from 16,400 to 3,600 C-14 years, indicating rapid settling of old
   permafrost POC to underlying sediments. This suggests that permafrost OC
   is, apart from a very narrow resuspension zone (<5 m water depth),
   predominantly deposited in nearshore sediments. While long-term storage
   of permafrost OC in marine sediments potentially limits biodegradation
   and its subsequent release as greenhouse gas, resuspension of
   fine-grained, OC-rich sediments in the nearshore zone potentially
   enhances OC turnover.
   Plain Language Summary The coast around the Arctic Ocean consists mostly
   of permafrost, permanently frozen ground, which contains large amounts
   of millennia-old organic carbon. Due to rising temperatures, this
   several thousand years old organic carbon is released to the Arctic
   Ocean at an increased rate by permafrost thaw and coastal erosion. Once
   released, organic carbon can be degraded and emitted as greenhouse gas
   to the atmosphere, or it can be stored away in marine sediments. In this
   study, we find that this old organic carbon quickly settles after
   release into the ocean and is buried in sediments close to shore,
   whereas the overlying sea water is dominated by young organic carbon
   from other sources than permafrost. However, sediments close to shore
   can be reworked by waves and currents, releasing the organic carbon
   again. This makes the zone closest to shore an important research area
   to assess the impact of thawing permafrost on climate.},

Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {538},
Number = {7624},
Pages = {226+},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Reconstructions of Earth's past climate strongly influence our
   understanding of the dynamics and sensitivity of the climate system. Yet
   global temperature has been reconstructed for only a few isolated
   windows of time(1,2), and continuous reconstructions across glacial
   cycles remain elusive. Here I present a spatially weighted proxy
   reconstruction of global temperature over the past 2 million years
   estimated from a multi-proxy database of over 20,000 sea surface
   temperature point reconstructions. Global temperature gradually cooled
   until roughly 1.2 million years ago and cooling then stalled until the
   present. The cooling trend probably stalled before the beginning of the
   mid-Pleistocene transition(3), and predated the increase in the maximum
   size of ice sheets around 0.9 million years ago(4-6). Thus, global
   cooling may have been a precondition for, but probably is not the sole
   causal mechanism of, the shift to quasi-100,000-year glacial cycles at
   the mid-Pleistocene transition. Over the past 800,000 years, polar
   amplification (the amplification of temperature change at the poles
   relative to global temperature change) has been stable over time, and
   global temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have
   been closely coupled across glacial cycles. A comparison of the new
   temperature reconstruction with radiative forcing from greenhouse gases
   estimates an Earth system sensitivity of 9 degrees Celsius (range 7 to
   13 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) change in global
   average surface temperature per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide
   over millennium timescales. This result suggests that stabilization at
   today's greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual
   total warming of 5 degrees Celsius (range 3 to 7 degrees Celsius, 95 per
   cent credible interval) over the next few millennia as ice sheets,
   vegetation and atmospheric dust continue to respond to global warming.},

Abstract = {Optimal signal detection theory has been applied in a search through 100
   yr of surface temperature data for the climate response to four specific
   radiative forcings. The data used comes from 36 boxes on the earth and
   was restricted to the frequency band 0.06-0.13 cycles yr(-1) (16.67-7.69
   yr) in the analysis. Estimates were sought of the strengths of the
   climate response to solar variability, volcanic aerosols, greenhouse
   gases, and anthropogenic aerosols. The optimal Biter was constructed
   with a signal waveform computed From a two-dimensional energy balance
   model (EBM). The optimal weights were computed from a 10000-yr control
   run of a noise-forced EBM and from 1000-yr control runs from coupled
   ocean-atmosphere models at Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)
   and Max-Planck Institute; the authors also used a 1000-yr run using the
   GFDL mixed layer model. Results are reasonably consistent across these
   four separate model formulations. It was found that the component of the
   volcanic response perpendicular to the other signals was very robust and
   highly significant. Similarly, the component of the greenhouse gas
   response perpendicular to the others was very robust and highly
   significant. When the sum of all four climate forcings was used, the
   climate response was more than three standard deviations above the noise
   level. These findings are considered to be powerful evidence of
   anthropogenically induced climate change.},

Abstract = {With considering the increasing of global temperature, and also the
   concern of global climate change, many policy makers worldwide have been
   accepted the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in
   particular from the power industries. Energy resource use is one of the
   most important and Contentious issues of our time. The ocean provides a
   vast source of potential energy resources. Of the total solar radiation,
   oceans are the largest collectors, accumulating 250 billion barrels of
   oil equivalent, according to an estimate. This vast amount of solar
   energy absorbed in the oceans can be converted into electricity by a
   process known as Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion, popularly known as
   OTEC. OTEC makes use of the difference in temperatures of warm surface
   water (22-27 degrees C) and very cold water at a depth of 1 km (4-7
   degrees C). an open-cycle plant based on creating a rising mixture of
   water and steam bubbles or ``foam{''}, which is separated at a height
   above sea-level, such that the water can be used to drive a turbine
   rotor. In closed-cycle OTEC, warm seawater heats a working fluid with a
   low boiling point, such as ammonia, and the ammonia vapor turns a
   turbine, which drives a generator. This paper discusses about the ocean
   energy, ocean thermal energy potential, ocean thermal energy conversion
   by the close, open and hybrid cycles, environmental impact and special
   conditions of these process. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {As the body of literature on marine climate impacts accumulates the
   question is no longer whether marine ecosystems and their living
   resources are affected, but what we as scientists, managers and policy
   makers can do to prepare for the inevitable changes. In this study, the
   current literature on how fisheries, fisheries management and fishing
   communities react and adapt to projected climate impacts is reviewed.
   First, a brief background on adaptation research, including definitions
   of key terms and concepts is provided. Secondly, available frameworks
   and tools to assess and foster adaptation to climate change are outlined
   and discussed. Thirdly, case studies illustrating several key aspects
   (political, legal, economic, and social) influencing adaptation at the
   level of fisheries, communities and households worldwide are presented
   and compared. Finally, a brief synthesis of the main issues and their
   implications for adaptation within fisheries and fisheries management at
   large are identified and discussed. In summary, the study illustrates
   that while a great wealth of local and regional knowledge, as well as
   tools and approaches to foster adaptation exists, examples of concrete
   adaptation actions and measures are surprisingly few. This emphasizes
   the need to increase the general awareness of climate change impacts and
   to build a solid political, legal, financial and social infrastructure
   within which the available knowledge, tools and approaches can be set to
   practical use in implementing adaptation to climate change.},

Abstract = {Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) is a follow on mission of ADEOS
   and ADEOS2. It is under phase A study in NASDA (National Space
   Development Agency of Japan). GCOM is not satellites but a mission and
   its concept is to continuously monitor geophysical parameters which are
   critical to understand global change phenomena, especially phenomena
   related to climate change and ozone depletion. The first generation of
   GCOM is now composed of 2 satellites, i.e. GCOM-A1 and GCOM-B1. The
   target of GCOM-A1 is to monitor greenhouse gases distribution and ozone
   as well as ozone related constituents from oblique orbit. It is now
   planned to carry two core instruments, i.e. ILAS2 F/O and ODUS. ILAS2
   F/O is a sun occultation sensor using a Fourier transform spectrometer
   and measures vertical distribution of atmospheric constituents. ODUS is
   an ultraviolet to visible grating spectrometer and measures total ozone
   and aerosols. The target of GCOM-B1 is to measure geophysical parameters
   which are uncertain in the today's climate models. Those parameters
   include, but not limited to, optical thickness of aerosols and clouds,
   thermal fluxes, carbon fluxes, sink and source of greenhouse gases, etc.
   GCOM-B1 will carry four core instruments, i.e. SGLI (GLI follow on),
   AMSR2 (AMSR follow on), alpha-Seat (SeaWinds follow on), and APOLDER
   (POLDER follow on). Another candidate instrument is ATRAS (IMG follow
   on). The orbit of GCOM-B1 will be a sun synchronous orbit, which is
   almost the same as ADEOS2.GCOM-A1 is planned to be launched in Feb. 2005
   while GCOM-B1 is planned to be launched in Aug. 2005.},

Abstract = {Many island power systems are powered by diesel generators or long
   underwater cables, which result in greater operating costs or losses
   than stand-alone systems. It is therefore desirable to integrate
   renewable energy (RE) sources into these mini grids.
   The main objective of the paper is to describe, analyse and present a
   more unified approach for assessing the technical feasibility/potential
   of different energy scenarios for the islands of Malta. in this study,
   three different scenarios are analysed. Integrating RE sources (RES) in
   energy systems reduces losses, cuts fossil fuel consumption whilst
   maintaining system stability and increasing job opportunities. Hydrogen
   conversion and storage methods are also analysed as a method for
   greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction in the transport sector and as a way to
   reduce excess electricity produced from RE. (C) 2008 International

Abstract = {Mangroves are among the world's most productive ecosystems and a part of
   the ``blue carbon{''} sink. They act as a connection between the
   terrestrial and marine ecosystems, providing habitat to countless
   organisms. Among these, microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, archaea, fungi,
   phytoplankton, and protozoa) play a crucial role in this ecosystem.
   Microbial cycling of major nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and
   sulfur) helps maintain the high productivity of this ecosystem. However,
   mangrove ecosystems are being disturbed by the increasing concentration
   of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere. Both the anthropogenic and
   natural factors contribute to the upsurge of greenhouse gas
   concentration, resulting in global warming. Changing climate due to
   global warming and the increasing rate of human interferences such as
   pollution and deforestation are significant concerns for the mangrove
   ecosystem. Mangroves are susceptible to such environmental
   perturbations. Global warming, human interventions, and its consequences
   are destroying the ecosystem, and the dreadful impacts are experienced
   worldwide. Therefore, the conservation of mangrove ecosystems is
   necessary for protecting them from the changing environment-a step
   toward preserving the globe for better living. This review highlights
   the importance of mangroves and their microbial components on a global
   scale and the degree of vulnerability of the ecosystems toward anthropic
   and climate change factors. The future scenario of the mangrove
   ecosystem and the resilience of plants and microbes have also been
   discussed.},

Title = {Displacement Induced by Climate Change Adaptation: The Case of `Climate
   Buffer' Infrastructure},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate buffer infrastructure is on the rise as a promising `green'
   climate adaptation strategy. More often than not, such infrastructure
   building is legitimized as an urgent technical intervention-while less
   attention is paid to the distribution of costs and benefits among the
   affected population. However, as this article shows, adaptation
   interventions may directly or indirectly result in the relocation or
   even eviction of households or communities, thereby increasing
   vulnerabilities for some while intending to reduce long-term climate
   vulnerabilities for all. We argue that this raises serious, if
   underappreciated, ethical issues that need to be more explicitly
   addressed in adaptation policy making. We illustrate our conceptual
   argument with the help of three examples of infrastructural `climate
   buffers': Space for the River projects in the Netherlands, the
   Diamer-Bhasha dam in Pakistan and the coastal protection plan in
   Jakarta, Indonesia.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES},

Volume = {68},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Drivers of upwelling in the tropical lower stratosphere are investigated
   using the E39C-A chemistry-climate model. The climatological annual
   cycle in upwelling and its wave forcing are compared to the interim
   ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). The strength in tropical upwelling and
   its annual cycle can be largely explained by local resolved wave
   forcing. The climatological mean forcing is due to both stationary
   planetary-scale waves that originate in the tropics and extratropical
   transient synoptic-scale waves that are refracted equatorward.
   Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations to 2050
   force a year-round positive trend in tropical upwelling, which maximizes
   in the lowermost stratosphere. Tropical ascent is balanced by
   downwelling between 20 degrees and 40 degrees. Strengthening of tropical
   upwelling can be explained by stronger local forcing by resolved wave
   flux convergence, which is driven in turn by processes initiated by
   increases in tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Higher tropical
   SSTs cause a strengthening of the subtropical jets and modification of
   deep convection affecting latent heat release. While the former can
   modify wave propagation and dissipation, the latter affects tropical
   wave generation. The dominant mechanism leading to enhanced vertical
   wave propagation into the lower stratosphere is an upward shift of the
   easterly shear zone due to the strengthening and upward shift of the
   subtropical jets.},

Abstract = {Climate engineering measures are designed to either reduce atmospheric
   carbon concentration (by growing trees or spreading iron in the ocean,
   for example) or directly influence the radiation reaching or leaving the
   earth (by injecting sulfur into the stratosphere or modifying cloud
   formations, for example) to compensate for greenhouse gas-induced
   warming. The former measures are termed carbon dioxide removal (CDR),
   which we characterize as a low-leverage causative approach, and the
   latter are termed radiation management (RM), which we characterize as a
   high-leverage symptomatic approach. There are similarities between CDR
   and emission control. Accordingly, benefit-cost analysis can be used to
   assess certain CDR measures. By contrast, high-leverage RM represents a
   genuinely new option in the climate change response portfolio, at first
   glance promising insurance against fat-tail climate change risks.
   However, the persistent intrinsic uncertainties of RM suggest that any
   cautious climate risk management approach should consider RM as a
   complement to (rather than a substitute for) emission control at best.
   Moreover, the complexity of the earth system imposes major limitations
   on the ability of research to reduce these uncertainties. Thus we argue
   that a research strategy is needed that focuses on increasing our basic
   understanding of the earth system and conducting comprehensive
   assessments of the risk(s) associated with both climate change and the
   deployment of climate engineering.},

Abstract = {Tidal power is a form of renewable energy from the ocean that can be
   exploited for electrical power generation. Several countries have
   implemented the techniques of harnessing tidal power through tidal
   barrages and tidal streams. A substantial amount of the electricity
   consumed in South Africa is generated from the combustion of fossil
   fuel, which is known to have huge consequences on the environment.
   Hence, the establishment of a tidal power plant would reduce greenhouse
   gasses and also minimize the huge reliance on fossil fuels. This paper
   presents the concepts of the design elements for a tidal plant that
   employs helical turbines. A case study of Esikhawini is presented which
   is the optimum site that was selected for the establishment of the tidal
   plant proposed in this study. The significance of this study mainly
   focused on the design considerations of the helical turbine. The tidal
   velocity at Esikhawini was modelled the results show an average velocity
   of 1.5 m/s. The tidal velocity was used as an input into the analytical
   model of the turbine which implements the blade element momentum theory
   (BEMT). The power generated from a single tidal turbine unit was 23.75
   kW, and the overall power generated from the proposed tidal plant was
   1.4 MW.},

Journal = {ENERGY TECHNOLOGY},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {834-849},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In recent years, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has been proposed
   as a potential technological solution to the problems of greenhouse-gas
   emissions and the ever-growing energy demand. To combat climate change
   and ocean acidification as a result of anthropogenic CO2 emissions,
   efforts have already been put forth to capture and sequester CO2 from
   large point sources, especially power plants; however, the utilization
   of CO2 as a feedstock to make valuable chemicals, materials, and
   transportation fuels is potentially more desirable and provides a better
   and long-term solution than sequestration. The products of CO2
   utilization can supplement or replace chemical feedstocks in the fine
   chemicals, pharmaceutical, and polymer industries. In this review, we
   first provide an overview of the current status of CO2-capture
   technologies and their associated challenges and opportunities with
   respect to efficiency and economy followed by an overview of various
   carbon-utilization approaches. The current status of combined CO2
   capture and utilization, as a novel efficient and cost-effective
   approach, is also briefly discussed. We summarize the main challenges
   associated with the design, development, and large-scale deployment of
   CO2 capture and utilization processes to provide a perspective and
   roadmap for the development of new technologies and opportunities
   future.},

Abstract = {CO2 geological storage into deep saline aquifers is one of the most
   promising methods for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the

   the desiccation phenomenon on the physical and chemical behaviors around
   the injection well, a series of numerical simulations were performed.
   Simulation results demonstrated that the geochemical reactions play an
   important role in the CO2 injection stage, especially the dissolution of

   Hemisphere winds},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},

Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {An Earth System model is used to explore the response of the oceanic and
   terrestrial carbon sinks to strengthening and poleward shifting of the
   extratropical Southern Hemisphere winds, which is a robust feature of
   climate models' response to greenhouse gas forcing through the 20th and
   21st centuries. We find that under time-varying CO(2) emissions poleward
   intensifying Southern Hemisphere winds act on average to slightly
   enhance the efficacy of both the oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks,
   thus providing a small negative feedback on the atmospheric CO(2)
   concentration. Regionally, the effects of the changing winds on oceanic
   and terrestrial carbon uptake are more pronounced and partly of opposite
   sign. We further show that the magnitude and sign of global oceanic
   CO(2) uptake is also controlled by changes in mesoscale eddy activity,
   which has been suggested to increase in response to intensifying
   Southern Hemisphere winds.},

Volume = {52},
Number = {6, SI},

Abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the
   biogeographic distribution of seaweeds and is expected to increase due
   to the rise in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, especially
   in polar and cold-temperate regions. To estimate prospective
   distributional shifts in cold-water key structural seaweeds from both
   hemispheres, we related temperature requirements and recent
   distributions of seaweeds to observed mean sea surface temperature (SST)
   isotherms for the periods 1980-1999 (Meteorological Office Hadley
   Centre's SST data set; HadISST) and to modelled temperatures for
   2080-2099 {[}Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) database

   Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) report] based on moderate greenhouse gas
   emissions Special Report on Emission Scenarios - Scenario B1 (SRESA1B).
   Under this scenario, North Atlantic polar to cold-temperate seaweeds
   investigated will extend their distribution into the High Arctic until
   the end of the 21st century, but retreat along the northeastern Atlantic
   coastline. In contrast, selected Antarctic seaweeds will probably not
   significantly alter their latitudinal distributions, as deduced from our
   presently incomplete knowledge of their temperature requirements. We
   identified several cold-temperate regions where seaweed composition and
   abundance will certainly change with elevated temperatures. The results
   are discussed in the context of local temperature conditions, effects of
   multifactorial abiotic and biotic interactions and expected ecological
   consequences for seaweed-dominated ecosystems.},

Title = {Inference of solar irradiance variability from terrestrial temperature

   connection},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Information can be inferred on the timing and amplitude of solar total
   irradiance changes over 1880-1993 by simulating the global terrestrial
   surface temperature changes produced by these irradiance changes and
   comparing them with observed temperatures. The profiles of solar
   irradiance variations used in the climate simulations are adopted from
   several different proxies: (1) the length of the sunspot cycle, (2) the
   mean sunspot number, and (3) a composite proxy that includes the two
   previous indicators plus the equatorial solar rotation rate, the
   fraction of penumbral spot coverage, and the rate of decay of the
   sunspot cycle. We use a seasonal energy-conservation
   climate/upwelling-diffusion ocean model, forced by the assumed profiles
   of solar total irradiance variations, combined with variations in
   anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Optimized cases imply total irradiance
   changes during 1880-1993 in the range 0.18\%-0.77\%.
   If the solar irradiance profiles found from the climate simulations are
   required to be consistent with recent satellite observations, then the
   composite solar profile reconstructed by Hoyt \& Schatten, combined with
   the anthropogenic greenhouse forcing, explains the highest fraction of
   the variance of observed global mean temperatures. In this case, the
   solar and greenhouse combination accounts for 92\% of the observed
   long-term temperature variance during 1880-1993. The simulation implies
   that the solar part of the forcing alone would account for 71\% of the
   global mean temperature variance, compared to 51\% for the greenhouse
   gases' part alone. It also suggests a solar total irradiance variation
   of 0.5\% during the interval 1880-1993. Such an amplitude of solar total
   irradiance change is consistent with astrophysical limits of brightness
   changes on timescales of decades to centuries independently derived from
   observations of solar-type stars (including the Sun).},

   The result revealed that the stress drops significantly and the cracks
   are much more developed in the ``core stress relieved area{''} within 10
   m in front of the coal face and -30 m behind the coal face, where the
   methane extraction concentration is usually more than 60\%. The results

Abstract = {Marine area-based conservation measures including no-take zones (areas
   with no fishing allowed) are often designed through lengthy processes
   that aim to optimize for ecological and social objectives. Their (semi)
   permanence generates high stakes in what seems like a one-shot game. In
   this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of
   short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive
   co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the
   fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every 5
   years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and
   trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We
   use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of
   such fisheries closures ({''}fishing refugia{''}) in northwest Mexico to
   hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological
   outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based
   management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing
   as long as initial designs are ecologically ``good enough{''} and
   supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive
   management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other
   social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the
   dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor
   design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the tool's
   capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological
   benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor
   ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social
   network effects and alternative benefits. We discuss both the potential
   and the danger of temporary area-based conservation measures as a
   learning tool for adaptive co-management and commoning.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {The effects of sea surface temperature (SST) and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   changes on the mean age-of-air and water vapor are investigated using a
   state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM), and general
   characteristics of tracer transport between the stratosphere and
   troposphere are analyzed. Downward tracer transport in the northern
   midlatitude stratosphere is found to be faster than at southern
   midlatitudes. The global mean downward transport to the troposphere from
   stratosphere mainly occurs during northern winter and the downward
   cross-tropopause transport is weakest from August to October. The
   maximum troposphere mean (TM) age-of-air, derived from an age tracer
   released near the stratopause (around 1 hPa), can reach 13 years and is
   much larger than the maximum stratosphere mean (SM) age-of-air derived
   from an analogous age tracer released in the troposphere, with the SM
   age-of-air in the Northern Hemisphere being younger than in the Southern
   Hemisphere. Increased SSTs tend to accelerate upward transport through
   the stratosphere and slow downward transport in midlatitudes and the
   tropical stratosphere. In the context of effects of GHG increases and
   the associated SST increases on the stratosphere mean age-of-air, the
   GHG effects dominate, i.e., changes in the stratospheric mean age-of-air
   caused by SST increases only are smaller than those caused by combined
   changes in SSTs and GHGs. An increase in SSTs enhances the upward
   Eliasen-Palm (EP) flux in the extratropics. A 7.7\% enhancement of
   tropical upwelling can be caused by a uniform 1.5 K SST increase. When
   both SST and GHG values are increased to the 2100 conditions, the
   meridional heat flux decreases in both winter hemispheres (and
   statistically significantly in the Southern Hemisphere). Meanwhile, the
   EP flux in the Northern Hemisphere increases significantly and the
   tropical upwelling is enhanced by 15\% compared to the present-day
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Synoptic-scale African easterly waves (AEWs) impact weather throughout
   the greater Atlantic basin. Over the African continent, AEWs are
   instrumental in initiating and organizing precipitation in the
   drought-vulnerable Sahel region. AEWs also serve as the precursors to
   the most intense Atlantic hurricanes, and contribute to the global
   transport of Saharan dust. Given the relevance of AEWs for the climate
   of the greater Atlantic basin, we investigate the response of AEWs to
   increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Using an ensemble of general
   circulation models, we find a robust increase in the strength of the
   winds associated with AEWs along the Intertropical Front in West Africa
   by the late 21st century of the representative concentration pathway
   8.5. AEW energy increases directly due to an increase in baroclinicity
   associated with an enhanced meridional temperature gradient between the
   Sahara and Guinea Coast. Further, the pattern of low-level warming
   supports AEW development by enhancing monsoon flow, resulting in greater
   convergence and uplift along the Intertropical Front. These changes in
   energetics result in robust increases in the occurrence of conditions
   that currently produce AEWs. Given relationships observed in the current
   climate, such changes in the location of AEW tracks and the magnitude of
   AEW winds carry implications for the relationship between AEWs and
   precipitation in the Sahel, the mobilization of Saharan dust, and the
   likelihood of cyclogenesis in the Atlantic. Our results therefore
   suggest that changes in AEW characteristics could play a critical role
   in shaping the response of Atlantic basin climate to future increases in
   greenhouse gas concentrations.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {212-224},

Abstract = {Emissions of GHG from the transport sector and how to reduce them are
   major challenges for policy makers. The purpose of this paper is to
   analyse the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships while in
   port based on annual data from Port of Gothenburg, Port of Long Beach,
   Port of Osaka and Sydney Ports. Port call statistics including IMO
   number, ship name, berth number and time spent at berth for each ship
   call, were provided by each participating port. The IMO numbers were
   used to match each port call to ship specifications from the IHS
   database Sea-web. All data were analysed with a model developed by the
   IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute for the purpose of
   quantifying GHG emissions (as CO2-equivalent) from ships in the port
   area. Emissions from five operational modes are summed in order to
   account for ship operations in the different traffic areas. The model
   estimates total GHG emissions of 150,000, 240,000, 97,000, and 95,000
   tonnes CO2 equivalents per year for Gothenburg, Long Beach, Osaka, and
   Sydney, respectively. Four important emission-reduction measures are
   discussed: reduced speed in fairway channels, on-shore power supply,
   reduced turnaround time at berth and alternative fuels. It is argued
   that the potential to reduce emissions in a port area depends on how
   often a ship revisits a port: there it in general is easier to implement
   measures for high-frequent liners. Ships that call 10 times or less
   contribute significantly to emissions in all ports. (C) 2017 Elsevier

   Harnessing the Potential of Urban Rooftops},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Featured Application
   This work presents the analysis of the element of the `roof' as a
   methodological approach to assess the renovation opportunities of
   existing rooftops, as a stimulus to mitigate the urban phenomena of heat
   island mitigation by focusing on the role of codes, policies, and
   regulations in cities.
   Urban rooftops are a potential source of water, energy, and food that
   contribute to make cities more resilient and sustainable. The use of
   smart technologies such as solar panels or cool roofs helps to reach
   energy and climate targets. This work presents a flexible methodology
   based on the use of geographical information systems that allow
   evaluating the potential use of roofs in a densely built-up context,
   estimating the roof areas that can be renovated or used to produce
   renewable energy. The methodology was applied to the case study of the
   city of Turin in Italy, a 3D roof model was designed, some scenarios
   were investigated, and priorities of interventions were established,
   taking into account the conditions of the urban landscape. The
   applicability of smart solutions was conducted as a support to the
   review of the Building Annex Energy Code of Turin, within the project
   `Re-Coding', which aimed to update the current building code of the
   city. In addition, environmental, economic, and social impacts were
   assessed to identify the more effective energy efficiency measures. In
   the Turin context, using an insulated green roof, there was energy
   saving in consumption for heating up to 88 kWh/m(2)/year and for cooling
   of 10 kWh/m(2)/year, with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 193
   tCO(2eq)/MWh/year and 14 tCO(2eq)/MWh/year, respectively. This approach
   could be a significant support in the identification and promotion of
   energy efficiency solutions to exploit also renewable energy resources
   with low greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {Offshore wind resource in the context of global climate change over a
   tropical area},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Understanding the future offshore wind energy is crucial for making an
   appropriate energy strategy. Yet how offshore wind energy will respond
   to the rapidly intensifying global warming remains inconclusive.
   Focusing on a tropical sea in Vietnam, this study assesses the climatic
   impact of global warming on the local offshore wind potential.
   Dynamically downscaled wind data obtained by an edge-cutting
   fine-resolution regional climate model with two greenhouse-gases
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 8.5 and 4.5 were
   biased corrected with a quantile mapping method before using for
   assessment. Results revealed a changing trend of the annual-mean
   offshore wind speed and power potential in Vietnam under both scenarios.
   However, the change is seasonally asymmetric with decreases of about 2 -
   10\% in September-October-November and slight increases of about 2 - 4\%
   in December-January-February. The turbine-based assessment showed that
   the cumulative annual energy obtained from the 12 MW and 8 MW turbines
   could reach the highest about 50.9 GWh and 30.7 GWh (2080-2099 average
   under scenario RCP8.5) but the difference in their capacity factor is
   much smaller, suggesting that turbine 8 MW should be considered in the
   sense of cost-effectiveness in some areas.},

Title = {Applying traditional knowledge to resilience in coastal rural villages},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) pointed out that since 1950, observations of various
   aspects of the climate system have revealed many changes in extreme
   weather events. Global climate change has increased both the intensity
   and frequency of disaster events, causing serious impacts worldwide.
   Because most people and economic activities are clustered in urban
   areas, most studies focus on how to enhance the resilience of urban
   areas, often overlooking the practicable resilience in rural areas,
   especially in radically different areas, such as coastal and alpine
   areas. There should be a fundamentally different resilience approaches
   in areas with low population densities, weak institutional capacities,
   and limited financial feasibility. The application of local and
   indigenous knowledge as an adaptation strategy for climate change to
   achieve the goal of balance between humans and nature has also received
   considerable attention. Therefore, this study applied in-depth
   interviews in the coastal rural village of Guogou in Taiwan. The results
   showed that practices utilizing local and indigenous knowledge have
   helped locals effectively mitigate the impacts of disasters and
   encouraged residents to live in areas with high flood exposure. Overall,
   the application of local and indigenous knowledge in such rural areas
   might be a possible solution to enhance local resilience.},

Abstract = {Aniline-contained wastewater and greenhouse gases are two significant
   environmental issues that threaten the life of humans. In this work, a
   novel bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED)-based process was proposed
   to treat aniline wastewater and simultaneously capture CO2. Such a
   process consists of predesalinization, CO2 capture, and aniline removal
   in three steps. First, the predesalinization removes the salt in saline
   aniline wastewater because the aniline is neutral in this condition.
   Second, in order to adjust the pH of wastewater and make the aniline
   positively charged, CO2 is captured, and finally, BMED is used to remove
   aniline from the feed compartment and then collected in the base
   compartment, simultaneously recovering CO2 in the acid compartment. The
   processes are discussed in terms of multianiline content, multi-CO2
   partial pressure, and multisteps, which clearly indicate the feasibility
   of the processes in an ecofriendly and low cost way.},

Abstract = {The use of high strength-to-weight ratio materials in automotive
   component is a solution to reduce fuel consumption and decrease
   greenhouse gases emissions. Fiber reinforced composite materials are
   believed to enable weight saving that cannot be achieved with metals
   while meeting component mechanical requirements. Moreover, the use of
   renewable bio-based composites is seen as a key aspect to further
   address the reduction of greenhouse gases emission. However, composite
   manufacturing process must meet short cycle time, performance, and cost
   targeted by the transportation industry in order to be considered as
   replacement materials. This article investigates the use of an
   industrial compression-direct long fiber thermoplastic (D-LFT) process
   line to manufacture cellulose reinforced bio-based polyamide parts in
   order to increase the penetration of sustainable materials in the
   transportation sectors. Process evaluation and composite performance
   were first carried out on a simple 2D geometry. Then the use of 100\%
   bio-sourced materials with the high-throughput D-LFT process was
   validated with the manufacturing of an automotive composite seat pan
   demonstrator. Bio-based composite parts were successfully manufactured.
   Tensile properties in the range of glass fiber reinforced polypropylene
   composites traditionally used with the D-LFT process were measured,
   validating the potential of cellulose-biopolyamide composite materials

Title = {Spatial and Temporal Variability and Driving Factors of Carbon Dioxide
   and Nitrous Oxide Fluxes in Alpine Wetland Ecosystems},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plants regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in wetland ecosystems, but
   the mechanisms of plant removal and plant species that contribute to GHG
   emissions remain unclear. In this study, the fluxes of carbon dioxide
   (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using the static chamber
   method from an island forest dominated by two different species, namely
   Betula platyphylla (BP) and Larix gmelinii (LG), in a marsh wetland in
   the Great Xing'an Mountains. Four sub-plots were established in this
   study: (1) bare soil after removing vegetation under BP (SBP); (2) bare
   soil after removing vegetation under LG (SLG); (3) soil with vegetation
   under BP (VSBP); and (4) soil with vegetation under LG (VSLG).
   Additionally, the contributions of the dark respiration from plant
   aerial parts under BP (VBP) and LG (VLG) to GHG fluxes were calculated.
   We found that the substantial spatial variability of CO 2 fluxes ranged
   from -25.32 +/- 15.45 to 187.20 +/- 74.76 mg m(-2) h(-1) during the
   study period. The CO2 fluxes decreased in the order of SBP > VSLG > VSBP
   > SLG > VLG > VBP, indicating that vegetation species had a great impact
   on CO2 emissions. Particularly, the absence of vegetation promoted CO2
   emission in both BP and LG. Additionally, CO2 fluxes showed dramatically
   seasonal variations, with high CO2 fluxes in late spring (May) and
   summer (June, July, and August), but low fluxes in late summer (August)
   and early autumn (September). Soil temperatures at 0-20 cm depth were
   better predictors of CO2 fluxes than deeper soil temperatures. N 2 0
   fluxes were varied in different treatments with the highest N2O fluxes
   in SLG and the lowest N2O fluxes in VBP. Meanwhile, no significant
   correlation was found between N2O fluxes and air or soil temperatures.
   Temporally, negative N2O fluxes were observed from June to October,
   indicating that soil N2O fluxes were reduced and emitted as N-2, which
   was the terminal step of the microbial denitrification process. Most of
   the study sites were CO2 sources during the warm season and CO2 sinks in
   the cold season. Thus, soil temperature plays an important role in CO2
   fluxes. We also found that the CO2 flux was positively related to pH in
   a 10 cm soil layer and positively related to moisture content (MC) in a
   50 cm soil layer in VSBP and VSLG. However, the CO2 flux was negatively
   related to pH in a 30 cm soil layer in SBP and SLG. Our findings
   highlight the effects of vegetation removal on GHG fluxes, and aid in
   the scientific management of wetland plants.},

Abstract = {Carbon dioxide emissions have accelerated since the signing of the Kyoto
   Protocol. This discouraging development may partly be blamed on
   accelerating world growth and on lags in policy instruments. However, it
   also raises serious question concerning whether policies to reduce CO2
   emissions are as effective as generally assumed. In recent years, a
   considerable number of studies have identified various feedback
   mechanisms of climate policies that often erode, and occasionally
   reinforce, their effectiveness. These studies generally focus on a few
   feedback mechanisms at a time, without capturing the entire effect.
   Partial accounting of policy feedbacks is common in many climate
   scenarios. The IPCC, for example, only accounts for direct leakage and
   rebound effects. This article attempts to map the aggregate effects of
   different types of climate policy feedback mechanisms in a cohesive
   framework. Controlling feedback effects is essential if the policy
   measures are to make any difference on a global level. A general
   conclusion is that aggregate policy feedback mechanisms tend to make
   current climate policies much less effective than is generally assumed.
   In fact, various policy measures involve a definite risk of `backfiring'
   and actually increasing CO2 emissions. This risk is particularly
   pronounced once effects of climate policies on the pace of innovation in
   climate technology are considered. To stand any chance of controlling
   carbon emissions, it is imperative that feedback mechanisms are
   integrated into emission scenarios, targets for emission reduction and
   implementation of climate policy. In many cases, this will reduce the
   scope for subsidies to renewable energy sources, but increase the scope
   for other measures such as schemes to return carbon dioxide to the
   ground and to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases from wetlands and
   oceans. A framework that incorporates policy feedback effects
   necessitates rethinking the design of the national and regional emission
   targets. This leads us to a new way of formulating emission targets that
   include feedback effects, the global impact target. Once the full
   climate policy feedback mechanisms are accounted for, there are probably
   only three main routes in climate policy that stand a chance of
   mitigating global warming: (a) returning carbon to the ground, (b)
   technological leaps in zero-emission energy technology that make it
   profitable to leave much carbon in the ground even in Annex II countries
   and (c) international agreements that make it more profitable to leave
   carbon in the ground or in forests.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {43},
Number = {9},
Pages = {4583-4596},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {In this study, carbon-free fuels-ammonia and hydrogen-are proposed to
   replace heavy fuel oils in the engines of maritime transportation
   vehicles. Also, it is proposed to use hydrogen and ammonia as dual fuels
   to quantify the reduction potential of greenhouse gas emissions. An
   environmental impact assessment of transoceanic tanker and transoceanic
   freight ship is implemented to explore the impacts of fuel substituting
   on the environment. In the life cycle analyses, the complete transport
   life cycle is taken into account from manufacture of transoceanic
   freight ship and tanker to production, transportation and utilization of
   hydrogen and ammonia in the maritime vehicles. Several hydrogen and
   ammonia production routes ranging from municipal waste to geothermal
   options are considered to comparatively evaluate environmentally benign
   methods. Besides global warming potential, environmental impact
   categories of marine sediment ecotoxicity and marine aquatic ecotoxicity
   are also selected in order to examine the diverse effects on marine
   environment. Being carbon-neutral fuels, ammonia and hydrogen, yield
   significantly minor global warming impacts during operation. The
   ecotoxicity impacts on maritime environment vary based on the production
   route of hydrogen and ammonia. The results imply that even hydrogen and
   ammonia are utilized as dual fuels in the engines, the global warming
   potential is quite lower in comparison with heavy fuel oil driven
   transoceanic tankers. Geothermal energy sourced hydrogen and ammonia
   fuelled transoceanic tankers release about 0.98 g and 1.65 g CO2 eq. per
   tonne-kilometer, respectively whereas current conventional heavy fuel
   oil tanker releases about 5.33 g/tonne-kilometer CO2 eq. greenhouse gas
   emissions. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by

Abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is
   inducing global warming, ocean acidification, polar ice melting, rise in
   sea level, droughts and hurricanes, thus threatening human health and
   the global economy. Therefore, there is a need to develop cost-effective
   technologies for CO(2)capture. For instance, solution absorption is
   promising due to a large processing capacity, high flexibility and
   reliability, and rich experience in engineering applications.
   Nonetheless, actual commercial solutions, solvents and processes for
   CO(2)capture suffer from slow reaction kinetics, low absorption
   capacity, high-energy consumption, susceptibility to corrosion,
   toxicity, low stability and high costs. Therefore, current research
   focuses on developing more economical, effective, green and sustainable
   technologies. Here we review 2015-2020 findings on CO(2)capture using
   liquid absorption methods. Methods are based on various solutions,
   solvents and processes such as carbonate solution, ammonia solution,
   amine-based solution, ionic liquid, amino acid salt, phase changing
   absorbent, microcapsulated and membrane absorption, nanofluids and
   phenoxide salt solution. We discuss absorption performance, absorption
   mechanism, enhancement pathways and challenges. Amine- and NH3-based
   absorbents are widely used, yet they are limited by high regeneration
   energy, corrosiveness and degradation, reagent loss and secondary
   pollution caused by NH(3)escape. Phase changing absorbents are getting
   more attention due to their lower cost and lower energy penalty. The
   incorporation of membrane and microencapsulation technologies to
   absorbing solvents could enhance CO(2)absorption performance by reducing
   corrosion and increasing selectivity. Adding nanoparticles to solvents
   could improve CO(2)absorption performance and reduce energy requirement.
   Besides, solvent blends and promoter-improved solvents performed better
   than single and non-promoted solvents because they combine the benefits
   of individual solvents and promoters.},

Title = {Research on the Optimization Strategy of the Low-Carbon Economic
   Development Model based on the BP Neural Network Model},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Low-carbon economy has become a topic of great concern to the
   international community. Sea level rise caused by climate change, flood
   disasters, biodiversity reduction, global famine, and other issues have
   begun to threaten the normal survival of human beings, and the climate
   problem needs to be solved urgently. While ensuring rapid economic
   development, in order to better control the total amount of greenhouse
   gas emissions, this paper, based on the theory of low-carbon economy,
   takes control of total carbon emissions for low-carbon economic
   development, as a perspective, and selects the optimization for the
   development of low-carbon economy. From the aspects of structural
   emission reduction technology and emission reduction, a carbon emission
   control optimization index system for low-carbon economic development
   based on total carbon emission control is constructed. Under the
   framework of the index system, construct an optimization model for the
   total amount of carbon emissions in a low-carbon economy and use the BP
   neural network model to seek the balance point between economic
   development, energy consumption, and carbon emissions so as to promote
   the rational and scientific development of the low-carbon economy.
   Planning and development. First of all, on the premise of maintaining
   the same economic growth rate, the optimization plan will reduce carbon
   emissions. Secondly, on the premise of keeping the cost of energy
   consumption unchanged, it is more reasonable to adjust the energy
   consumption structure. Taking the optimization plan as the suggestion
   for the development direction of the low-carbon economy, it provides
   scientific and feasible technical support for achieving the emission
   reduction target of reducing the unit greenhouse gas emission to 40\%.},

Title = {High-resolution seasonal and decadal inventory of anthropogenic
   gas-phase and particle emissions for Argentina},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Pages = {5027-5069},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {This work presents the integration of a gas-phase and particulate
   atmospheric emission inventory (AEI) for Argentina in high spatial
   resolution (0.025 degrees x0.025 degrees; approx. 2.5 km x 2.5 km)
   considering monthly variability from 1995 to 2020. The new inventory,
   called GEAA-AEIv3.0M, includes the following activities: energy
   production, fugitive emissions from oil and gas production, industrial
   fuel consumption and production, transport (road, maritime, and air),
   agriculture, livestock production, manufacturing, residential,
   commercial, and biomass and agricultural waste burning. The following
   species, grouped by atmospheric reactivity, are considered: (i)
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) - CO2, CH4, and N2O; (ii) ozone precursors - CO,
   NOx (NO+NO2), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs); (iii)
   acidifying gases - NH3 and SO2; and (iv) particulate matter (PM) - PM10,
   PM2.5, total suspended particles (TSPs), and black carbon (BC). The main
   objective of the GEAA-AEIv3.0M high-resolution emission inventory is to
   provide temporally resolved emission maps to support air quality and
   climate modeling oriented to evaluate pollutant mitigation strategies by
   local governments. This is of major concern, especially in countries
   where air quality monitoring networks are scarce, and the development of
   regional and seasonal emissions inventories would result in remarkable
   improvements in the time and space chemical prediction achieved by air
   quality models.
   Despite distinguishing among different sectoral and activity databases
   as well as introducing a novel spatial distribution approach based on
   census radii, our high-resolution GEAA-AEIv3.0M shows equivalent
   national-wide total emissions compared to the Third National
   Communication of Argentina (TNCA), which compiles annual GHG emissions
   from 1990 through 2014 (agreement within +/- 7.5 \%). However, the
   GEAA-AEIv3.0M includes acidifying gases and PM species not considered in
   TNCA. Temporal comparisons were also performed against two international
   databases: Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) and EDGAR HTAPv5.0 for
   several pollutants; for EDGAR it also includes a spatial comparison.
   The agreement was acceptable within less than 30 \% for most of the
   pollutants and activities, although a >90 \% discrepancy was obtained
   for methane from fuel production and fugitive emissions and >120 \% for
   biomass burning. Finally, the updated seasonal series clearly showed the
   pollution reduction due to the COVID-19 lockdown during the first
   quarter of year 2020 with respect to same months in previous years.
   Through an open-access data repository, we present the GEAA-AEIv3.0M
   inventory as the largest and more detailed spatial resolution dataset
   for the Argentine Republic, which includes monthly gridded emissions for
   12 species and 15 stors between 1995 and 2020.},

Title = {Assessing the Capacity of Adaptive Policy Pathways to Adapt on Time by
   Mapping Trigger Values to Their Outcomes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Climate change raises serious concerns for policymakers that want to
   ensure the success of long-term policies. To guarantee satisfactory
   decisions in the face of deep uncertainties, adaptive policy pathways
   might be used. Adaptive policy pathways are designed to take actions
   according to how the future will actually unfold. In adaptive pathways,
   a monitoring system collects the evidence required for activating the
   next adaptive action. This monitoring system is made of signposts and
   triggers. Signposts are indicators that track the performance of the
   pathway. When signposts reach pre-specified trigger values, the next
   action on the pathway is implemented. The effectiveness of the
   monitoring system is pivotal to the success of adaptive policy pathways,
   therefore the decision-makers would like to have sufficient confidence
   about the future capacity to adapt on time. On time means activating the
   next action on a pathway neither so early that it incurs unnecessary
   costs, nor so late that it incurs avoidable damages. In this paper, we
   show how mapping the relations between triggers and the probability of
   misclassification errors inform the level of confidence that a
   monitoring system for adaptive policy pathways can provide.
   Specifically, we present the trigger-probability mapping and the
   trigger-consequences mappings. The former mapping displays the interplay
   between trigger values for a given signpost and the level of confidence
   regarding whether change occurs and adaptation is needed. The latter
   mapping displays the interplay between trigger values for a given
   signpost and the consequences of misclassification errors for both
   adapting the policy or not. In a case study, we illustrate how these
   mappings can be used to test the effectiveness of a monitoring system,
   and how they can be integrated into the process of designing an adaptive
   policy.},

Title = {In-situ soil greenhouse gas fluxes under different cryptogamic covers in
   maritime Antarctica},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {770},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Soils can influence climate by sequestering or emitting greenhouse gases
   (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide
   (N2O). We are far from understanding the direct influence of cryptogamic
   covers on soil GHG fluxes, particularly in areas free of potential
   anthropogenic confounding factors.
   We assessed the role ofwell-developed cryptogamic covers in soil
   attributes, as well as in the in-situ exchange of GHG between Antarctic
   soils and the atmosphere during the austral summer. We found lower
   values of soil organic matter, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen
   in bare areas than in soils covered by mosses and, particularly,
   lichens. These differences, together with concomitant decreases and
   increases in soil temperature and moisture, respectively, resulted in
   increases in in-situ CO2 emission (i.e. ecosystem respiration) and
   decreases in CH4 uptake but no significant changes in N2O fluxes. We
   found consistent linear positive and negative relationships between soil
   attributes (i.e. soil organic matter, total organic carbon and total
   nitrogen) and CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake, respectively, and polynomial
   relationships between these soil attributes and net N2O fluxes.
   Our results indicate that any increase in the area occupied by
   cryptogams in terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems (due to increased growing
   season and increasingly warming conditions) will likely result in
   parallel increases in soil fertility as well as in an enhanced capacity
   to emit CO2 and a decreased capacity to uptake CH4. Suchchanges, unless
   offset by parallel C uptake processes, would represent a paradigmatic
   example of a positive climate change feedback. Further, we show that the
   fate of these terrestrial ecosystems under future climate scenarios, as
   well as their capacity to exchange GHG with the atmosphere might depend
   on the relative ability of different above-ground cryptogams to thrive
   under the new conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {AQUACULTURE REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {67-76},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The practice of prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) farming is widespread
   in coastal Bangladesh due to favorable biophysical resources. However,
   export-oriented prawn farming is particularly vulnerable to climate
   change in coastal Bangladesh. This study identified different climatic
   variables, including salinity, coastal flooding, cyclone, sea-level
   rise, water temperature, drought, and rainfall have profound effects on
   prawn farming in the Bagerhat area of southwest Bangladesh. Considering
   extreme vulnerability to the effects of climate change on prawn
   production, one of the adaptation strategies is to translocate prawn
   culture from coastal to inland (i.e., Bagerhat-Gopalganj) that appear
   less vulnerable to climate change. Although the prospects for prawn-carp
   polyculture and integrated prawn-fish-rice farming are positive in
   Gopalganj, a number of challenges were identified for the expansion of
   prawn culture. We suggest that institutional support would help to adopt
   prawn production. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   agro-environmental conditions are assessed in conjunction with issues
   such as population dynamics, agricultural strategies, non-agricultural
   activities, transport and infrastructure, migration, education,
   political conditions, etc. Satellite imagery and aerial photos reveal
   relative stability in agricultural land use intensity despite an
   increase in de facto population (51\% from 1966-2006). Results of
   questionnaire survey of 48 households show that the utilization of
   natural resources (notably shifting cultivation and fisheries) remains
   widespread, although it is increasingly supplemented by other income
   generating activities (e.g., shopkeeping, private business, government
   employment). Group interviews are used to discuss ways in which the
   local communities' adaptive resource management strategies have been
   employed in the face of climatic and socioeconomic events and changes in
   the recent past. Fifty years' development is described as a combination
   of continuity and change. Resource management practices are only
   marginally impacted by different stress factors, but the importance of
   agriculture has been decreasing in relative terms. Culturally determined
   bonds have become a main `mechanism' to cope with environmental or
   socioeconomic stress and the Bellonese have become less vulnerable to
   external shocks.},

Abstract = {Resilience thinking explores the sustainability discourse and
   transformation of urban complex systems. From the perspective of urban
   and human environment, this research simulated the resilience
   transformation of human-environment systems according to the modified
   catastrophe theory. The adaptive cycle model was performed an approach
   to interpret resilience transformations in the interactive
   human-environment systems. In this study, we quantified the resilience
   of human and environment subsystems through four models of catastrophe
   theory (Fold, Cusp, Swallowtail and Butterfly model). The resilience
   transformation was addressed through the mechanism of adaptive cycle
   that contained four phases within four different time periods
   (exploitation-r: 2000-2002; release phase-Omega: 2002-2003;
   conservation-K: 2004-2008 and exploitation-r: 2008-2010). Ultimately, we
   explored the key drivers of the transformation in complex
   human-environmental systems, which included production, energy and
   pollution. Moreover, understanding the transformations in terms of the
   human and environmental components were indispensable in urban
   resilience management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mobilizing for change: Assessing Social adaptive capacity in Micronesian
   fishing communities},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Many Pacific islands are facing increasing anthropogenic threats
   including climatic impacts on the fisheries which provide communities'
   livelihoods and food security. Knowledge of these communities' social
   adaptive capacity is critical to inform climate adaptation planning and
   fisheries management in the region. The present study examines social
   adaptive capacity in four fishing communities in the Federated States of
   Micronesia and Guam. Researchers used a framework based on five social
   adaptive capacity factors (diversity and flexibility, access to assets,
   learning and knowledge, governance and institutions, and agency) to
   develop indicators that were relevant to the study sites and conducted
   262 household surveys, seven focus groups with 45 participants, and 25
   key informant interviews. A combination of quantitative and qualitative
   analyses shows: high levels of livelihood flexibility and perceived
   agency to address climate risks; social networks as most vital community
   asset; significant utility of traditional knowledge combined with
   scientific information; and, the need for governments and leadership to
   develop effective sustainable fisheries governance that prevents further
   fisheries resource degradation and helps develop alternative sustainable
   livelihoods for fishers.},

Title = {Role of Low Solar Luminosity in the History of the Biosphere},
Journal = {GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},
Number = {5},
Pages = {401-417},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {It was shown that the history of the biosphere is closely related to
   processes caused by low solar luminosity. Solar radiation is
   insufficient to maintain the Earth's surface temperature above the
   freezing point of water. Positive temperatures are kept owing to the
   presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere: CO2, CH4, and others.
   Certain stages in the development of the biosphere and climate are
   related to these effects. Methane was the main carbon-bearing gas in the
   primordial atmosphere. It compensated the low solar luminosity. Life
   originated under the reduced conditions of the early Earth.
   Methane-producing biota was formed. Methane remained to be the main
   greenhouse gas in the Archean. The release of molecular oxygen into the
   atmosphere 2.4 Ga ago resulted in the disruption of the established
   mechanism of the compensation of the low solar luminosity. Methane
   ceased to cause a significant greenhouse effect, and the content of
   carbon dioxide was insufficient to play this role. A global glaciation
   began and had lasted for approximately 200 million years. However, the
   increasing CO2 content in the atmosphere reached eventually a level
   sufficient for the compensation for the low solar luminosity. The
   glaciation period came to an end. Simultaneously, a conflict arose
   between the role of CO2 as a gas controlling the thermal regime of the
   planet and as an initial material for biota production. As long as the
   resource of biotic carbon was inferior to that of atmospheric CO2, the
   uptake of atmospheric CO2 related to sporadic increases in biologic
   production was insufficient for a significant change in the thermal
   regime. This was the reason for a long-term climate stabilization for
   1.5 billion years. By 0.8 Ga, the resource of oceanic biota reached the
   level at which variations in the uptake of atmospheric CO2 related to
   variations in the production of organic and carbonate carbon became
   comparable with the resource of atmospheric CO2. Since then, an
   oscillatory equilibrium has been established between the intensity of
   biota development and climate-controlling CO2 content in the atmosphere.
   Glaciation and warming periods have alternated. These changes were
   triggered by various geologic events: intensification or attenuation of
   volcanism; growth, breakup, or migration of continents; large-scale
   magmatism; etc. A new relation between atmospheric CO2 and biotic carbon
   was established in response to the emergence of terrestrial biota and
   the appearance of massive buffers of organic carbon on land. The
   interrelation of the biosphere and climate changed.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},

Pages = {2533-2540},
Abstract = {In a recent paper Hu et al. (2011) suggest that the recovery of
   stratospheric ozone during the first half of this century will
   significantly enhance free tropospheric and surface warming caused by
   the anthropogenic increase of greenhouse gases, with the effects being
   most pronounced in Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. These
   surprising results are based on a multi-model analysis of CMIP3 model
   simulations with and without prescribed stratospheric ozone recovery. Hu
   et al. suggest that in order to properly quantify the tropospheric and
   surface temperature response to stratospheric ozone recovery, it is
   necessary to run coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models with
   stratospheric ozone chemistry. The results of such an experiment are
   presented here, using a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model coupled
   to a three-dimensional ocean model. In contrast to Hu et al., we find a
   much smaller Northern Hemisphere tropospheric temperature response to
   ozone recovery, which is of opposite sign. We suggest that their result
   is an artifact of the incomplete removal of the large effect of
   greenhouse gas warming between the two different sets of models.},

Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {233},
Pages = {1003-1014},

Abstract = {Offshore renewable energy resources are options to address a country's
   energy and climate objectives without having to occupy vast amount of
   land space. Offshore wind power production, among the various offshore
   renewable options, has gained popularity albeit its dependence on the
   deployment location's wind conditions, technical challenge in
   construction and grid connection, and potentially high capital cost. The
   wind conditions in Southeast Asia are generally much less favourable as
   compared to other parts of the world, but several economies in this
   region consider offshore wind energy as a long term solution to
   decarbonize the electricity sector and to diversify the source of
   electricity. There is thus a need to evaluate the true benefits of
   offshore wind energy under the region's suboptimal climatic conditions.
   In response, this study employs the life cycle analysis approach to
   conduct a cost-benefit analysis of offshore wind energy in the context
   of Southeast Asia. Findings from study suggest that the cost of offshore
   wind energy remains high at the moment for Southeast Asia. The findings
   further contribute to the debate on offshore wind energy by setting the
   bottom-line for deployment under unfavourable climatic conditions in the
   tropical region and world-wide. However, offshore wind farm could still
   represent a plausible option through technology innovation in wind
   turbine designs and reductions in the cost of wind turbine and submarine
   power cable. As suggested in this study, there is potential for the cost
   of offshore wind energy to reach parity against onshore renewables such
   as solar energy in the context of Southeast Asia.},

Title = {A framework for identifying and selecting long term adaptation policy
   directions for deltas},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {633},
Pages = {946-957},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Deltas are precarious environments experiencing significant biophysical,
   and socio-economic changes with the ebb and flow of seasons (including
   with floods and drought), with infrastructural developments (such as
   dikes and polders), with the movement of people, and as a result of
   climate and environmental variability and change. Decisions are being
   taken about the future of deltas and about the provision of adaptation
   investment to enable people and the environment to respond to the
   changing climate and related changes. The paper presents a framework to
   identify options for, and trade-offs between, long term adaptation
   strategies in deltas. Using a three step process, we: (1) identify
   current policy-led adaptations actions in deltas by conducting
   literature searches on current observable adaptations, potential
   transformational adaptations and government policy; (2) develop
   narratives of future adaptation policy directions that take into account
   investment cost of adaptation and the extent to which significant policy
   change/political effort is required; and (3) explore trade-offs that
   occur within each policy direction using a subjective weighting process
   developed during a collaborative expert workshop. We conclude that the
   process of developing policy directions for adaptation can assist policy
   makers in scoping the spectrum of options that exist, while enabling
   them to consider their own willingness to make significant policy
   changes within the delta and to initiate transformative change. (C) 2018

Year = {2017},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {246-253},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The disposal of CO2 is a key issue for greenhouse gas control. We apply
   a reactive transport model based on lattice Boltzmann and finite volume
   methods to simulate the injection of CO2-saturated brine into a
   fractured coal. Fluid flow, transport of solute and dissolution are
   modelled at the pore scale. Fracture closure under overburden pressure
   is considered in the numerical model by performing mineral detachment
   identification and aperture adjustment. Variations of permeability and
   porosity are investigated. Mechanical properties are calculated to study
   the effect of mineral dissolution on formation stability. The results
   show that injection of CO2 causes fracture demineralisation. However,
   the removal of minerals may result in closure of existing fractures
   increasing resistance to fluid flow. This paper helps improve
   understanding of CO2 injection into coal seams and discusses its
   potential effect on coal properties.},

Volume = {112},
Pages = {164-178},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {In this study, a thermodynamic analysis is conducted on a
   multigeneration energy system based on renewable energy sources. The
   proposed system is developed for residential applications, including
   individual- and multi-building complexes, utilizing solar energy to
   produce useful outputs, namely electricity, heat, fresh water and
   hydrogen. Hydrogen is used for the purpose of storing energy to offset
   the mismatch between demand and supply when dealt with renewables, such
   as solar energy. The system is modeled thermodynamically to obtain the
   optimal energy and exergy efficiencies, heat and work outputs for the
   overall system. Moreover, greenhouse gas emissions caused by
   conventional energy systems utilized for the same outputs are calculated
   and compared with the studied systems. A solar collector area of 24 m(2)
   is considered for the present system and its analysis. The maximum
   energy efficiency is 36\% and the maximum exergy efficiency is 44\%. The
   total work output for electricity is 116 kW, and hence the CO2 reduction
   achieved by this system is 476 tons per year. It can produce 0.04 kgis
   desalinated water. The optimum number of suites, as an application for a
   building complex, which can be sustained with the proposed system is
   determined as 106 suites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Developing indicators to identify coastal green infrastructure
   potential: The case of the Salish Sea region},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {175},
Pages = {53-69},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {This study investigates where coastal green infrastructure (CGI) can
   provide highest potential coastal protection benefits, while considering
   its vulnerability to environmental conditions. CGI provides important
   coastal protection benefits, however, influenced by climate change and
   human activities, these benefits are highly threatened. This
   vulnerability of CGI was not considered in the previous studies. This
   study provides a framework and an indicator-based methodology to fill
   this gap. A review of the literature was conducted to identify the
   parameters used to measure CGI's coastal protection benefits and
   vulnerability. The content of the references that contained specific
   parameters related to CGI's role in coastal protection and vulnerability
   were systematically reviewed. A total of 11 indicators were identified
   and organized into two indices: CGI coastal protection index, and CGI
   vulnerability index. The indices were synthesized using a 2 x 2 matrix
   to identify areas with the highest coastal protection potential.
   Analysis was conducted for the 74 most populated coastal communities in
   the Salish Sea region. Results indicate that the British Columbia
   communities in the Salish Sea region have high potential to utilize CGI
   for coastal protection. CGI in 59\% of the communities in British
   Columbia and 36\% in Washington State can provide high coastal
   protection benefits, even when vulnerability is accounted for.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Indonesian peatland forest is considered a huge sink of tropical carbon
   and thereby make significant contribution to global terrestrial carbon
   storage. However, landcover and landuse changes in this ecosystem have
   incurred a synergistic exposure to drought and wildfires. Deforestation
   and forest degradation through combustion and decomposition of forest
   biomass and soil carbon have become global issues because of their
   greenhouse gas contribution to global climate change. Thus fire-driven
   carbon losses in these peatlands have increased the need to evaluate the
   impacts of fire at a landscape scale. In 6-10 week dry periods from
   January to April 2014 and in January 2015, wildfires burnt peatland
   forest in Kubu Raya, West Kalimantan province (Indonesian Borneo). An
   assessment was conducted to provide more reliable estimates of the
   effects of fire on aboveground and soil carbon losses and their dynamics
   in the coastal peatlands of the province. Carbon loss from combustion of
   both aboveground biomass and peat soil was substantial. Moreover, CO2
   emission from soil respiration at the burnt peat surface increased 46\%
   over the first 9 months after the fire. This study clearly showed the
   magnitude of fire-driven carbon loss and the scale of CO2 emission to
   the atmosphere arising from fire in tropical peatland forest.},

Title = {Lessons in applying adaptive management on a dynamic coastline: a case

Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE COASTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many of the world's coastlines are vulnerable to erosion and at risk
   from tidal flooding. Addressing and managing these risks presents major
   challenges especially when seeking to sustainably balance the
   requirements for coastal protection with other economic, environmental,
   and societal objectives. The nature and scale of these challenges varies
   greatly from site to site and can often be magnified on dynamic
   shorelines that are subject to a high degree of physical and ecological
   change. Applying an ongoing process of adaptive management is widely
   agreed to be a key mechanism for dealing with such dynamic conditions
   and issues of uncertainty. However, under this process it can be
   difficult for different stakeholders to reach a consensus about the most
   suitable intervention actions. In part, this can arise because there is
   an incomplete understanding about past, present, and, especially, future
   environmental processes. It can also occur due to differences in the
   perceptions and priorities of the relevant stakeholders. This paper
   reviews some of these complexities using, as a case study, recent
   developments of a shingle spit and tidal inlet at Pagham Harbour, on the
   south coast of the UK. This example provides lessons in the application
   of adaptive management and working with nature concepts in a
   particularly complex coastal setting. This paper considers these lessons
   in the context of the site's history, the legal and policy framework,
   and established understanding about the natural environment.},

   People (IDP): An exploratory study on coastal areas of Bangladesh},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Every year thousands of people are being displaced in coastal areas of
   Bangladesh due to natural calamities associated with climate change,
   known as Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs). Climate change adaptation
   measures play a significant role in coping with the alteration of
   climatic components, while various forms of barriers hinder the
   sustainability of adaptation. This research was conducted to understand
   the perception of IDPs on climate change impact on health in the coastal
   areas of Bangladesh, including the adaptation practices and barriers to
   the coping strategies. To fulfill the objective, 420 individual surveys
   were conducted randomly in two Sub-districts of Khulna district in
   Bangladesh. The findings reveal that the riverbank erosion and cyclones
   were the primary reasons for displacement, and the social relationships
   were hampered in the new places of living. Also, the temperature in
   summer and winter, and the rainfall intensity increased, whereas
   rainfall slightly decreased over the last ten years. Differences of
   opinion were identified about the effects of the changing climatic
   variables on the respondents' health between the previous and present
   locations. Despite practicing different adaptive strategies, the weak
   financial condition and a lack of access to health care information are
   mostly hindering the sustainability of adaptation. This research may
   help policymakers in taking proper initiatives to ensure sustainable
   adaptation practices in the coastal areas.},

Title = {Lessons From the Pacific Islands - Adapting to Climate Change by
   Supporting Social and Ecological Resilience},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {By necessity, Pacific Islands have become hubs of innovation, where
   climate strategies are piloted and refined to inform adaptation efforts
   globally. Pacific Island ecosystems are being degraded by pollution,
   overfishing, and unsustainable development. They also increasingly face
   severe climate impacts including sea-level rise, changing temperature
   and rainfall patterns. These impacts result inchanges in food and water
   security, loss of identity, climate-induced migration and threats to
   sovereignty. In response, communities in the region are leading climate
   adaptation strategies, often combining traditional practices and
   cutting-edge science, to build the resilience of their communities and
   ecosystems in the face of increasing climate risk. For example,
   communities are implementing resilient networks of marine protected
   areas using the best available science and strengthening tribal
   governance to manage these networks, experimenting with salt and drought
   tolerant crops, revegetating coastlines with native salt-tolerant
   plants, revitalizing traditional wells, and implementing climate-smart
   development plans. Often these efforts contribute to local development
   priorities and create co-benefits for multiple sustainable development
   goals (SDGs). These community efforts are being scaled up through
   provincial and national policies that reinforce the critical role that
   ecosystems play in climate adaptation and provide a model for the rest
   of the world. While adaptation efforts are critical to help communities
   cope with climate impacts, in some cases, they will be insufficient to
   address the magnitude of climate impacts and local development needs.
   Thus, there are inherent trade-offs and limitations to climate
   adaptation with migration being the last resort for some island
   communities.},

Abstract = {Environmental assessments in green chemistry often rely on simplified
   metrics that enable comparisons between alternative routes but fail to
   shed light on whether they are truly sustainable in absolute terms, viz.
   relative to the Earth's ecological capacity. To expand our currently
   limited knowledge of the extent to which chemicals are environmentally
   sustainable, here we analyse 492 chemical products through the lens of
   seven planetary boundaries representing critical biophysical limits that
   should never be exceeded. We found that most of them transgress these
   environmental guardrails, mainly the ones strongly connected to
   greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., climate change, ocean acidification and
   biosphere integrity). However, their levels of transgression fail to
   correlate with their carbon footprints, currently the focus of most
   studies, implying that chemicals entailing higher greenhouse gas
   emissions are not necessarily less environmentally sustainable in
   absolute terms. Our work points towards the need to embrace absolute
   sustainability criteria in current environmental assessments, which will
   require agreeing on how to allocate shares of the planet's ecological
   capacity among anthropogenic activities, including chemicals'
   production. This work's absolute environmental sustainability assessment
   (AESA) method, which could complement standard life cycle assessment
   approaches, might help experimental researchers working in green
   chemistry develop truly `green' products. The AESA method should be
   taken as a starting point to devise holistic approaches for quantifying
   the absolute environmental impact of chemicals to guide research and
   policymaking more sensibly.},

   strategy on the port-to-ship pathway},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {355},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {The maritime sector has been searching for efficient solutions to change
   energy consumptions patterns of ports and ships to ensure sustainable
   operation and to reduce CO2 emissions to support sustainable transport
   in line with International Maritime Organization (IMO) policy
   guidelines. Therefore, pursuing smart strategies by utilizing renewable
   energy sources, clean fuels, smart grid, as well as measures of
   efficient-energy use are beneficial towards attaining the core goals of
   the IMO, specifically CO2 emission reduction in the future. In this
   review work, the main methods and criteria for monitoring CO2 emission
   from ports and ships are meticulously presented. Advanced renewable
   energy technologies connected with sources such as solar, wind, tidal,
   wave, and alternative fuels and their application in ports to reduce CO2
   are thoroughly examined. In addition, energy-saving techniques and
   strategies for alternative power and fuels in ships are comprehensively
   evaluated. The key finding is that port-to-ship interactions such as
   using zero-emission energy sources or nearly zero-emission approaches
   could offer significant benefits for CO2 emission reduction. Finally, it
   is recommended that smart approaches associated with efficient and clean
   energy use for the port-to-ship pathways to generate net zero-CO2
   emissions for the maritime shipping sector need further urgent
   investigation.},

Abstract = {We evaluated how land use change affected the nitrogen cycle and
   greenhouse gas fluxes. We measured soil temperature and water-filled
   pore space (WFPS), as well as nitrate and ammonium concentrations,
   mineralization and nitrification rates, and flux of CH4, CO2 and N2O in
   soils of pasture catchment and in soils of a forest catchment located on
   the north coast of the State of Sao Paulo. The main vegetation type in
   the forest catchment is primary Atlantic Montane Forest, while the
   pasture is an unfertilized 40-year old area planted with Brachiaria
   humidicola. Four plots were used for monthly sampling in each land use
   for an entire year. Soil temperature was always higher in pasture than
   in forest soils, while WFPS was lower in the pasture in relation to
   forest soils. Pasture soils were a weak source of CH4 during the winter
   months and a less strong sink of methane than the forest soils during
   the rainy summer months of the year. The annual median CH4 uptake was
   -1.8 +/- 1.0 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the forest in contrast to -0.6 +/- 0.9 mg
   m(-2) d(-1) in pasture soils. CO2 emissions were similar in the winter,
   but higher in the summer months in pasture soils in relation to forest
   soils. The annual median flux in the forest was 4.2 +/- 1.5 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1) and increased in the pasture to 6.5 +/- 2.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In
   contrast. N2O fluxes were smaller in the pasture (0.3 +/- 0.7 ng cm(-2)
   h(-1)) than in forest soils (0.5 +/- 0.5 ng cm(-2) h(-1)). (c) 2011

Abstract = {Fossil fuels present the difficult-to-reconcile dilemma that the energy
   systems of today's society dictate that we use great quantities of
   fossil fuels to produce the energy we need, but their use results in the
   liberation of large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the
   so-called `'greenhouse gases''. Certain models predict that uncontrolled
   releases of greenhouse gases could result in unacceptable increases in
   global mean temperature. This dilemma is examined and a method of
   management of the use of fossil fuels is presented that will help to
   mitigate the problems their use creates. The challenge is to avoid the
   dilemma by technology and policy intervention so that fossil fuels are
   used to the net benefit of society and its environment. We should take
   those low-cost measures that slow greenhouse gas emissions, and we
   should be prepared technologically to accomplish much larger reductions
   if necessary. At present, our technological insurance is not in place,
   but the opportunities for improvement are great, even for fossil fuels.
   Several low-cost actions that can be taken in the near term include the
   establishment of policies including R\&D that encourage the development
   of more efficient and economical end-use and conversion technologies
   (e.g., more efficient gas turbines, fuel cells, oxygen-blown gasifiers,
   and processes for producing hydrogen from fossil sources); more
   intensive R\&D to accelerate the development of better nonfossil sources
   including direct solar, biomass, and other renewables, fission, and
   fusion; policies that encourage the substitution of hydrogen-rich for
   hydrogen-lean fuels and expansion of the natural gas system,
   particularly in developing nations; cooperation by western
   industrialized countries in providing technical assistance to developing
   and Eastern European countries for producing energy technologies that
   are both economically and environmentally more attractive, including
   expanding the development and use of the natural gas resources of the
   former Soviet Union; R\&D to increase our understanding of the global
   cycle of CO2 releases to the atmosphere and its removal by the oceans
   and by terrestrial ecosystems so that climate stabilization targets and
   policies can be better established; and experiments with CO2 recovery
   and sequestration techniques so that the economic and environmental
   impacts are better understood.},

Abstract = {Net ecosystem carbon dioxide (FCO2) and methane (FCH4) exchanges were
   measured by using the eddy covariance method to quantify the atmospheric
   carbon budget at a Typha- and Nymphaea-dominated freshwater marsh (March
   2011 to March 2013) and a soybean cropland (May 2011 to May 2012) in
   northwestern Ohio, USA. Two year average annual FCH4 (49.7 g C-CH4
   m-2yr-1) from the marsh was high and compatible with its net annual CO2
   uptake (FCO2: -21.0 g C-CO2 m-2yr-1). In contrast, FCH4 was small (2.3 g
   C-CH4 m-2yr-1) and accounted for a minor portion of the atmospheric
   carbon budget (FCO2: -151.8 g C-CO2 m-2yr-1) at the cropland. At the
   seasonal scale, soil temperature associated with methane (CH4)
   production provided the dominant regulator of FCH4 at the marsh
   (R2=0.86). At the diurnal scale, plant-modulated gas flow was the major
   pathway for CH4 outgassing in the growing season at the marsh. Diffusion
   and ebullition became the major pathways in the nongrowing season and
   were regulated by friction velocity. Our findings highlight the
   importance of freshwater marshes for their efficiency in turning over
   and releasing newly fixed carbon as CH4. Despite marshes accounting for
   only similar to 4\% of area in the agriculture-dominated landscape,
   their high FCH4 should be carefully addressed in the regional carbon
   budget.},

Title = {The resilience of coastal ecosystems: A functional trait-based

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems provide important services to human population, such
   as nurseries for fish, carbon storage and coastal protection. However,
   the pressure faced by these systems due to global changes will strongly
   challenge the capacity of coastal ecosystems to persist. Therefore, it
   is crucial to understand the resilience of coastal ecosystems.
   Here, I propose that combining a resilience framework based on ecosystem
   properties with the functional trait response-effect framework would
   allow researchers and managers to quantify the resilience of coastal
   ecosystems. I place emphasis on salt marsh and sand dunes because of the
   higher availability of studies for these systems.
   First, I introduce the resilience framework based on ecosystem
   properties and, second, I show how adopting a functional trait
   perspective in this framework would allow researchers to link how
   environmental changes influence ecosystem properties. In turn, measuring
   the changes in ecosystem properties would allow researchers to measure
   the resilience of the system.
   Synthesis. I reviewed several types of disturbances (e.g. storms and
   sea-level rise) that are threatening the persistence of coastal
   ecosystems, with an emphasis on salt marshes and sand dunes. Applying
   this resilience framework reveals, for instance, that the same suite of
   traits (e.g. plant density and stiffness) increase marsh resistance to
   multiple threats (e.g. storms and sea-level rise); yet, these traits
   vary along environmental gradients (e.g. along estuaries) and,
   therefore, marshes resilience vary accordingly. Overall, this framework
   would allow researchers to gather crucial insights on the resilience of
   coastal ecosystems and to set reference marks for measuring their
   resilience under environmental changes.},

Abstract = {In the coming decades, global warming and increase in temperature, in
   different regions of the world, may change indoor and outdoor thermal
   comfort conditions and human health. The aim of this research was to
   study the effects of global warming on thermal comfort conditions in
   indoor ambiences in Iran. To study the increase in temperature, model
   for assessment of greenhouse-gas induced climate change scenario
   generator compound model has been used together with four scenarios and
   to estimate thermal comfort conditions, adaptive model of the American
   Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers has
   been used. In this study, Iran was divided into 30 zones, outdoor
   conditions were obtained using meteorological data of 80 climatological
   stations and changes in neutral comfort conditions in 2025, 2050, 2075
   and 2100 were predicted. In accordance with each scenario, findings from
   this study showed that temperature in the 30 zones will increase by 2100
   to between 3.4 degrees C and 5.6 degrees C. In the coming decades and in
   the 30 studied zones, neutral comfort temperature will increase and be
   higher and more intense in the central and desert zones of Iran. The low
   increase in this temperature will be connected to the coastal areas of
   the Caspian and Oman Sea in southeast Iran. This increase in temperature
   will be followed by a change in thermal comfort and indoor energy
   consumption from 8.6 \% to 13.1 \% in air conditioning systems. As a
   result, passive methods as thermal inertia are proposed as a possible
   solution.},

Abstract = {The lack of adequate knowledge sharing and knowledge creation about
   disasters and climate change has been identified as a reason behind the
   unsatisfactory performance of climate-adaptation and disaster-management
   practices. This study aimed to identify the critical factors in
   knowledge creation in order to improve community resilience and propose
   a conceptual model. The main objectives of this study were to i)
   identify the key factors supporting the creation of knowledge, ii)
   identify the key factors promoting community resilience, and iii)
   develop a conceptual model to improve community resilience based on
   knowledge creation. This study used both quantitative and qualitative
   methods. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in four coastal
   subdistricts in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. A total of 300 samples were
   obtained from among respondents living in the coastal area using a
   purposive random sampling technique. The paper presents a literature
   review exploring theories and concepts concerning the factors supporting
   knowledge creation as a way to increase community resilience. A
   conceptual framework is then generated based on the results of field
   surveys and prior studies. The knowledge-level survey results indicate a
   need to develop a community resilience framework based on Knowledge
   Creation Theory as the foundation for decision making and ensure the
   transmission of knowledge across generations. This study proposes a
   conceptual model of Knowledge Creation for Community Resilience (KCCR).},

Title = {Factors and practices: farmers' adaptation to climate change in
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Abstract = {Climate literature is pronounced about the impending threat to
   agriculture taking into account the climate change scenario and
   suggesting adaptation as a possible option to opt for. Considering this,
   the study seeks to comprehend the factors influencing farmers'
   adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in coastal Bangladesh
   (Koyra Upazila, Khulna). In order to achieve the objectives,
   descriptive, multivariate, and binary logistic regressions were used to
   analyze the data. Findings demonstrate that the most often used
   adaptation strategies were crop, water, and infrastructure management.
   Regression result shows that factors such as gender, labor in the
   family, farming experience, and the damaged sector are important factors
   in determining how well adaption methods are implemented. Binary
   logistic regression analysis explains that age (p= <= 0.041), income (p
   = <= 0.037), and farm size (p <= 0.005) are significant factors in
   deciding on a new adaption option. The outcomes of this research can be
   used to reevaluate current frameworks and strategies for coping with
   climate change and to identify the factors that influence policy
   formulation. In order to improve the water management system for
   agriculture, policies such as Cash-for-Work (CFW) and Employment
   Generation Programme for the Poorest (EGPP) may be used to boost local
   agriculture.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing
   coastal communities today. Coastal communities are subject to a wide
   range of stressors related to climate change, including biological
   resource decline and natural hazards. Small historically
   natural-resource-dependent communities are particularly vulnerable
   because of their close reliance on ecosystem goods and services that are
   likely to be affected by climate change (e.g., fisheries, forests) and
   their limited access to outside technical and financial resources needed
   for adaptation. Exogenous adaptation policies, while helpful for
   fostering new behavioral adjustments to address resource decline and
   natural hazards, can in some cases exacerbate socioeconomic disruption,
   further burdening communities already struggling to adapt. This paper
   presents an investigation of how six historically
   natural-resource-dependent coastal communities in Oregon, USA, have
   experienced and responded to external stressors and how adaptation in
   these communities has been shaped by interactions between past and
   present practices, processes, and vulnerabilities. Despite
   climate-related impacts identified by the scientific community, climate
   change was not salient in the community members' reports of stressors
   and impacts, and thus was not a trigger of adaptation. Rather,
   communities were responding to stressors associated with decades of
   declines in natural resource industries, an economic recession,
   restrictive natural resource management and land use policies,
   demographic change, and natural hazards. These findings confirm other
   research findings that chronic everyday problems, including those
   related to the maintenance of livelihoods, or consequences of inadequate
   livelihoods, often eclipse potentially disastrous threats in the minds
   of rural community members, thereby influencing adaptation strategies.
   In some cases communities do not prioritize such threats because people
   have come to accept living with them, or they feel powerless and unable
   to change the circumstances of daily life. The findings improve
   understanding of adaptation in natural-resource based coastal
   communities in the USA and support the need for policy makers and
   planners to integrate climate change adaptation into livelihood
   improvement strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Frozen peat in permafrost regions poses a potential source of increased
   greenhouse gas production should these deposits thaw. Ponds on frozen
   peat plateaus in northern Manitoba are numerically modelled as heat
   sources to determine their potential to promote thaw. Modelling
   indicates that anticipated climate warming of approximately 2 degrees C
   between 2020 and 2050 will produce taliks up to a few metres thick
   beneath ponds a few tens of metres across. However, active-layer
   thickness in the subaerial parts of peat plateaus will not increase
   beyond the peat thickness. These findings assume 1) a climate warming
   rate under a moderately effective intervention in greenhouse gas
   production, 2) pond freezing regimes that represent both rapid ice
   formation and ice formation delayed by rapid snow accumulation, and 3)
   snow thermal conductivities that anticipate snow conductivity increase
   during the freeze interval. These conditions and properties may turn out
   to be less conducive to talik expansion than the values that will
   actually occur. Despite these uncertainties, peat plateau pond sizes and
   plateau margin positions can be monitored to ascertain the onset of
   accelerated thawing.},

Title = {Waterlogging affects the mitigation of soil GHG emissions by biochar
   amendment in coastal wetland},

Abstract = {Purpose Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) have greatly impacted the
   global warming by altering the composition of the atmosphere. The effect
   of biochar on GHG mitigation has been mainly studied in amended mineral
   soils and agricultural soils. However, the interactive effects of
   waterlogging and biochar application on GHG emissions, in coastal
   wetlands, are still poorly understood, which is important when
   considering the application of biochar at specific sites.
   Materials and methods We carried out a soil incubation experiment for 90
   days at 25 degrees C to investigate the effects of two types of biochar
   (Phragmites communisandSpartina alterniflora) with different application
   rates (0\%, 1\%, 5\%, and 10\%) (w/w) on GHG emissions from soil at two
   different water levels (unwaterlogged and waterlogged soils).
   Furthermore, soil pH, organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents
   were analyzed after incubation to gain insights into the underlying
   mechanisms of the biochar's effects on CO2, CH4, and N2O evolution.
   Results and discussion Waterlogging significantly reduced the cumulative
   CO2 flux by 36.27\%, had no effect on cumulative CH4 flux, and
   significantly increased cumulative N2O flux by 50.82\%, and the
   corresponding global warming potential (GWP) significantly decreased by
   29.72\%. Biochar application reduced not only the cumulative CO2 flux,
   but also the cumulative CH4 absorption, which may shift soils from being
   CH4 sinks to sources. After biochar application, the cumulative N2O
   release increased from unwaterlogged soils but decreased in waterlogged
   soils. There was no significant difference between biochar type on GHG
   emissions, but differences were observed among different application
   rates. The GWP significantly decreased by 27.64-69.39\% and
   36.11-87.34\% after biochar application in the unwaterlogged and
   waterlogged soils, respectively.
   Conclusions As a consequence, biochar application may significantly
   decrease GWP of soils due to the large reduction of CO2 release. These
   results suggest that biochar application is an effective way to reduce
   GWP in the Yellow River Delta Wetlands, especially when biochar is
   applied in waterlogged soils at high application rates.},

Abstract = {Producing fresh water via sea-and brackish-water desalination is
   essential for arid, water-scarce regions, but it is expensive and
   energy-intensive. The cost of energy is a major contributor to this high
   cost and the use of fossil fuels that currently power desalination
   plants causes emissions of greenhouse gases and other hazardous
   pollutants. The recent cost reductions and efficiency advances of
   photovoltaic systems create opportunities for developing low-cost and
   emission-free desalination technologies. However, the adoption of
   PV-powered water desalination and reuse technologies is hampered by the
   lack of concepts and designs that are integral to the variability of the
   solar resources. This paper describes the status and prospects of
   PV-integrated grid-connected and autonomous desalination systems and
   presents a holistic approach accounting for the variable conditions of
   the solar resources in different regions of the world to advance the
   development and deployment of environmentally friendly water
   desalination technologies world-wide.},

Abstract = {An assessment of the vulnerability to sea level rise and climate change
   was performed for island countries in the South Pacific (Tonga, Fiji,
   Samoa, and Tuvalu) under the collaboration of Japanese experts and the
   South Pacific Regional Environment Programme. A combination of
   experience-based and scientific methods were developed to reveal the
   overall vulnerability of and possible impacts on the coastal zone
   sectors. The studies identified the common impacts on and vulnerability
   of these countries. Inundation and flooding are the common threats to
   these islands because, of their low-lying setting; the problem is
   exacerbated by the social trends of population growth and migration to
   main islands, in particular to the capital cities. Other threats include
   beach erosion, saltwater intrusion, and impacts on the infrastructure
   and coastal society. For the island countries, the response to sea level
   rise and climate change focuses on adaptation rather than on reduction
   of greenhouse gas emissions (that is, mitigation). Based on the results
   of the vulnerability assessment, the concept of and options for
   adaptation are also discussed.},

Title = {Grass-fed vs. grain-fed beef systems: performance, economic, and
   environmental trade-offs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {100},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Between increasing public concerns over climate change and heightened
   interest of niche market beef on social media, the demand for grass-fed
   beef has increased considerably. However, the demand increase for
   grass-fed beef has raised many producers' and consumers' concerns
   regarding product quality, economic viability, and environmental impacts
   that have thus far gone unanswered. Therefore, using a holistic
   approach, we investigated the performance, carcass quality, financial
   outcomes, and environmental impacts of four grass-fed and grain-fed beef
   systems currently being performed by ranchers in California. The
   treatments included 1) steers stocked on pasture and feedyard finished
   for 128 d (CON); 2) steers grass-fed for 20 mo (GF20); 3) steers
   grass-fed for 20 mo with a 45-d grain finish (GR45); and 4) steers
   grass-fed for 25 mo (GF25). The data were analyzed using a mixed model
   procedure in R with differences between treatments determined by Tukey
   HSD. Using carcass and performance data from these systems, a
   weaning-to-harvest life cycle assessment was developed in the Scalable,
   Process-based, Agronomically Responsive Cropping Systems model
   framework, to determine global warming potential (GWP), consumable water
   use, energy, smog, and land occupation footprints. Final body weight
   varied significantly between treatments (P < 0.001) with the CON cattle
   finishing at 632 kg, followed by GF25 at 570 kg, GR45 at 551 kg, and
   GF20 478 kg. Dressing percentage differed significantly between all
   treatments (P < 0.001). The DP was 61.8\% for CON followed by GR45 at
   57.5\%, GF25 at 53.4\%, and GF20 had the lowest DP of 50.3\%. Marbling
   scores were significantly greater for CON compared to all other
   treatments (P < 0.001) with CON marbling score averaging 421 (low-choice
   >= 400). Breakeven costs with harvesting and marketing for the CON,
   GF20, GR45, and GF25 were \$6.01, \$8.98, \$8.02, and \$8.33 per kg hot
   carcass weight (HCW), respectively. The GWP for the CON, GF20, GR45, and
   GF25 were 4.79, 6.74, 6.65, and 8.31 CO(2)e/kg HCW, respectively. Water
   consumptive use for CON, GF20, GR45, and GF25 were 933, 465, 678, and
   1,250 L/kg HCW, respectively. Energy use for CON, GF20, GR45, and GF25
   were 18.7, 7.65, 13.8, and 8.85 MJ/kg HCW, respectively. Our results
   indicated that grass-fed beef systems differ in both animal performance
   and carcass quality resulting in environmental and economic
   sustainability trade-offs with no system having absolute superiority.
   Is West coast grass-fed beef better for the environment than
   conventional grain-fed beef or is it just consumer hype?
   Lay Summary Between the influence of the ``food elite{''} on social
   media and increasing public concerns over climate change, consumer
   demand for grass-fed beef has increased considerably. Although many
   consumers perceive grass-fed beef as more environmentally friendly than
   grain-fed beef, there is a dearth of research available to address these
   consumer claims. In order to answer both consumer and producer concerns,
   we performed an experiment that evaluated the environmental footprint
   (i.e., water, land, greenhouse gasses, and energy), beef quality, and
   economic outcome of four beef cattle production systems on the West
   coast. The four systems included conventional beef finished on grain for
   128 d, steers grass-fed for 20 mo, steers grass-fed for 20-mo with a
   45-d grain finish, and steers grass-fed for 25 mo. We found that varying
   grass-fed and grain-fed production systems resulted in different
   environmental effects. The conventional system produced the lowest
   greenhouse gas footprint but required the highest energy input. The
   grass-fed for 20 mo used the least amount of water but produced the
   greatest greenhouse gas. In conclusion, this study illustrated the
   complexities underpinning beef sustainability; no system resulted in
   absolute economic, meat quality, and environmental superiority.},

Title = {Do Invasive Mammal Eradications from Islands Support Climate Change
   Adaptation and Mitigation?},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change represents a planetary emergency that is exacerbating the
   loss of native biodiversity. In response, efforts promoting climate
   change adaptation strategies that improve ecosystem resilience and/or
   mitigate climate impacts are paramount. Invasive Alien Species are a key
   threat to islands globally, where strategies such as preventing
   establishment (biosecurity), and eradication, especially invasive
   mammals, have proven effective for reducing native biodiversity loss and
   can also advance ecosystem resilience and create refugia for native
   species at risk from climate change. Furthermore, there is growing
   evidence that successful eradications may also contribute to mitigating
   climate change. Given the cross-sector potential for eradications to
   reduce climate impacts alongside native biodiversity conservation, we
   sought to understand when conservation managers and funders explicitly
   sought to use or fund the eradication of invasive mammals from islands
   to achieve positive climate outcomes. To provide context, we first
   summarized available literature of the synergistic relationship between
   invasive species and climate change, including case studies where
   invasive mammal eradications served to meet climate adaptation or
   mitigation solutions. Second, we conducted a systematic review of the
   literature and eradication-related conference proceedings to identify
   when these synergistic effects of climate and invasive species were
   explicitly addressed through eradication practices. Third, we reviewed
   projects from four large funding entities known to support climate
   change solutions and/or native biodiversity conservation efforts and
   identified when eradications were funded in a climate change context.
   The combined results of our case study summary paired with systematic
   reviews found that, although eradicating invasive mammals from islands
   is an effective climate adaptation strategy, island eradications are
   poorly represented within the climate change adaptation and mitigation
   funding framework. We believe this is a lost opportunity and encourage
   eradication practitioners and funders of climate change adaptation to
   leverage this extremely effective nature-based tool into positive
   conservation and climate resilience solutions.},

Abstract = {Jamaica, like most Small Island Developing States around the world, is
   at high risk of coastal hazards due to its exposure to tropical storms,
   high levels of coastal development, vulnerable coastal communities, and
   the predicted impacts of climate change. Environmental degradation has
   been linked to increased vulnerability to disasters. Nature-based
   Solutions, although not formally present in the literature, are being
   implemented at various scales in Jamaica. This paper presents an
   overview of three marine and coastal Nature-based Solutions being
   utilised in the country: protected area management (Special Fishery
   Conservation Areas); mangrove restoration; and coral restoration. The
   paper briefly reviews their current application in Jamaica before
   arguing that these conservation projects that traditionally focused on
   biodiversity have co-benefits as Nature-based Solutions for disaster
   resilience. The paper closes by outlining several research objectives
   that should be explored in the future to further the implementation of
   Nature-based Solutions for disaster resilience in Jamaica.},

Title = {An Ecosystem-Level Perspective on the Host and Symbiont Traits Needed to
   Mitigate Climate Change Impacts on Caribbean Coral Reefs},

Abstract = {Caribbean reefs have steadily declined during the past 30 years. Thermal
   disturbances that elicit coral bleaching have been identified as a major
   driver of such coral degradation. It has been suggested that either the
   evolution of more tolerant symbionts, or shifts in the distribution of
   existing, tolerant symbionts could ameliorate the effect of rising sea
   temperatures on Caribbean reefs. Using a spatial ecosystem model we
   describe the characteristics that new tolerant symbionts,
   `super-symbionts', and their coral hosts, require for coral cover to be
   maintained. We also quantify the time necessary for such symbionts to
   become dominant before their potential beneficial effect is lost.
   Running scenarios under two levels of greenhouse gas emissions, we find
   that aggressive action to reduce emissions could almost triple the time
   available for new super-symbionts to become dominant and potentially
   mitigate the effect of thermal disturbances. The benefits of thermally
   tolerant super-symbionts depend on the life-history traits of the host,
   the number of coral species infected and the present coral assemblage.
   Corals that are strong competitors with macroalgae are likely to become
   dominant on future reefs if a super-symbiont appears in the next 25-60
   years. In principle, super-symbionts could have ecosystem-level benefits
   in the Caribbean providing that they become dominant in multiple coral
   hosts with specific life-history traits within the next 60 years. This
   potential benefit would only be realized if the appearance of the
   super-symbiont is combined with drastic reductions of greenhouse gas
   emissions and maintenance of ecosystem processes such as herbivory.},

Title = {Nature-Based Solutions for Urban Climate Change Adaptation and
   Wellbeing: Evidence and Opportunities From Kiribati, Samoa, and Vanuatu},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {Climate change and urbanisation in combination put great pressure on
   terrestrial and ocean ecosystems, vital for subsistence and wellbeing in
   both rural and urban areas of Pacific islands. Adaptation is urgently
   required. Nature-based solutions (NbS) offer great potential, with the
   region increasingly implementing NbS and linked approaches like
   ecosystem-based adaptation in response. This paper utilises three
   Pacific island nation case-studies, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu, to
   review current NbS approaches to adapt and mitigate the converging
   resilience challenges of climate change and urbanisation. We look at
   associated government policies, current NbS experience, and offer
   insights into opportunities for future work with focus on urban areas.
   These three Pacific island case-studies showcase their rich cultural and
   biological diversity and, importantly, the role of traditional
   ecological knowledge in shaping localised, place-based, NbS for climate
   change adaptation and enhanced wellbeing. But gaps in knowledge, policy,
   and practice remain. There is great potential for a nature-based urban
   design agenda positioned within an urban ecosystems framework linked
   closely to Indigenous understandings of wellbeing.</p>},

Title = {Prediction of plant carbon sink potential in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
   region of China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Abstract = {Carbon sink is the process of absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, through
   forests, wetlands, grasslands, and oceans. Through this process,
   greenhouse gases can be absorbed from the atmosphere. In order to
   analyze the contribution of carbon sinks to carbon neutrality, three
   parts of works were carried out on carbon sinks in
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Firstly, the regional carbon sinks were
   calculated based on actual data. Secondly, the macro-factors were
   selected related to carbon sinks, on which the econometric analysis was
   carried out. Finally, a carbon sink prediction model was constructed
   based on partial least squares regression. After that, three carbon sink
   development scenarios with different intensities were set up. Under
   these three scenarios, the carbon sink potential of the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was forecasted from 2020 to 2030. The
   results show that under the strong carbon sink scenario, the carbon sink
   in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei can neutralize 388.6901 million tons/a of
   carbon emissions by 2030, whose contribution rate to China's carbon
   emission reduction can reach 10.48\%. Compared with the baseline
   scenario and weak carbon sink scenario, the strong carbon sink scenario
   can achieve greater carbon sink potential and contribute more to China's
   carbon neutrality. As a conclusion, the target of carbon neutrality of
   China can be easier to achieve under the strong carbon sink scenario.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Evidence shows that habitats with potential to mitigate against
   greenhouse gases emissions, by taking up and storing CO2, are being lost
   due to the effects of on-going human activities and climate change. The
   carbon storage by terrestrial habitats (e.g. tropical forests) and the
   role of coastal habitats (`Blue Carbon') as carbon storage sinks is well
   recognised.
   Offshore shelf sediments are also a manageable carbon store, covering
   similar to 9\% of global marine area, but not currently protected by
   international agreements to enable their conservation. Through a
   scenario analysis, we explore the economic value of the damage of human
   activities and climate change can inflict on UK marine habitats,
   including shelf sea sediments.
   In a scenario of increased human and climate pressures over a 25-year
   period, we estimate damage costs up to US\$12.5 billion from carbon
   release linked to disturbance of coastal and shelf sea sediment carbon
   stores.
   It may be possible to manage socio-economic pressure to maintain
   sedimentary carbon storage, but the trade-offs with other global social
   welfare benefits such as food security will have to be taken into
   account. To develop effective incentive mechanisms to preserve these
   valuable coastal and marine ecosystems within a sustainability
   governance framework, robust evidence is required.},

Title = {Management of Primary Energy Carriers in Poland Versus Environmental
   Protection},
Journal = {ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-131},
Abstract = {At present, the progress of civilization depends upon the energy demand.
   This results in the increasing use of energetic resources, especially
   primary energy carriers: hard coal and lignite, oil and natural gas.
   Global resources of primary energetic resources (in 2005) were estimated
   at 900 mid ton (1 ton = 42 GJ).
   Within the structure of reserves of fossil energetic resources, solid
   resources (hard coal and lignite) amount to about 540 mld ton, which
   constitutes about 60\% of the global resources.
   Global hard coal resources are estimated at about 431 mld ton. The USA
   has the greatest resources of hard coal - about 112.3 mid ton (about
   26\%), just before China - over 62 mid ton (over 14\%). Hard coal in
   Poland can be found in 136 deposits, however, only 47 of them are
   managed. Poland has about 43 mid ton of balanced stocks of hard coal,
   with 16 mid ton of managed deposits, while industrial reserves
   (extraction resources) constitute only 4.2 mid ton. The extraction of
   hard coal in Poland in 2007 amounted to about 82.8 mln ton.
   Global lignite resources amount to about 417 mid ton. The greatest
   reserves of this carrier belong to the USA - about 130.5 mid ton (more
   than 31\%) and Russia - about 108 mid ton (26\%). The efficient
   resources of lignite in Poland amount to about 1.9 mid ton. The
   extraction takes place in the four lignite mines (Adamow, Belchatow,
   Konin and Turow) and in 2007 amounted to 59.6 mln ton.
   The evidenced global reserves of oil constitute about 160 mid toe (19\%
   of global reserves). The distribution of these resources is very uneven.
   More than 60\% of oil reserves is located in the Middle East, with the
   three countries - Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq owning about 42\% of the
   global reserves. In Poland, the oil resources have been recorded in 84
   deposits and amount to about 23 mln ton, where about 20 mln ton are
   managed deposits, and about 15 mln ton - industrial resources. The oil
   extraction in Poland in 2007 amounts to 700.5 thous. ton, including:
   Polish Plain - 465 thous. ton, Baltic Shelf - 191 thous. ton, the
   Carpathian Mountains - 26.2 thous. ton and Carpathian Foreland - 18.3
   thous. ton.
   Global natural gas reserves are estimated at about 161 mid toe (about
   19\% of primary global resources). The unconventional reserves of
   natural gas (among others - hydrates) are also estimated at about 280
   mid toe. The greatest evidenced resources of natural gas occur in the
   Middle East (more than 40\%) as well as in Russia (about 32\% of global
   reserves).
   In Poland natural gas can be found in 263 deposits, out of which 181
   deposits are managed. The balance stocks amount to about 139 mld m(3),
   with about 108 mld m(3) of the gas in managed deposits. The extraction
   of natural gas in Poland in 2007 amounted to 5.18 mid m(3), including:
   Polish Plain - 3 333.9 mln m(3), Carpathian Foreland - 1 798.23 mln
   m(3), the Carpathian Mountains - 30.3 mln m(3), Baltic Shelf - 21.01 mln
   m(3).
   The methane recorded reserves of coal deposits in 51 deposits have been
   estimated at 99 mid m(3), including 30 deposits in operational areas -
   33 mld m(3).
   There are numerous forecasts for national electric energy demand made by
   various institutions and authors. All of them (until 2030) assume
   electric energy production on the basis of primary stable energy
   carriers, thus, hard coal and lignite.
   These carriers are burdensome for the environment, since they are
   characterized by excessive greenhouse gases emission. The growing demand
   for direct energy, in accordance with ecological conditions, will
   require the use of clean technologies as well as disposal and deposition
   of CO2 - that is, CCS technologies (Carbon Capture and Storage). Since
   Poland joined the European Union in 2004, we have to face and prepare
   for all the changes which the European Commission has planned for the EU
   countries. The essential issue is the reduction of greenhouse gases,
   especially carbon dioxide. There are many technologies allowing to
   capture CO2 from the stream of gases, and consequently, its
   sequestration by means of storage in the oceans, deep geological layers
   or mineral carbonation.
   In 2006 the EU-27 emitted greenhouse gases in the total amount of more
   than 5.14 mid ton of CO2 equivalent. The greatest emittant of greenhouse
   gases in the power economy is the power industry, which emitted 1.59 mid
   ton of CO2 equivalent. The emission of greenhouse gases in Poland
   amounted to 400.5 mln ton of CO2 equivalent, out of which 330 mln ton is
   CO2 emission.
   The international community the - UN, the EU and many developed
   countries - already in 1990s (and earlier), intended to counteract the
   negative impact of greenhouse gases and dust emission. The problem of
   the environment protection is presently a matter of great importance, as
   far as the strategy of global economy development. It has been the
   subject-matter of numerous conventions, protocols, conferences,
   directives, regulations and etc.
   Polish power industry and energo-chemical industry in 2008 were entitled
   to emit about 201 mln ton of CO2 (additional in the reserves for the new
   investments). In the next years coming Poland will not be able to meet
   the granted emission limits.},

Abstract = {Detecting areas with high social-ecological vulnerability (SEV) is
   essential to better inform management interventions for building
   resilience in coastal systems. The SEV framework, developed by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is a robust method to
   identify SEV of tropical coastal systems to climate change. Yet, the
   application of this framework to temperate regions and other drivers of
   change remains underexplored. This study operationalizes the SEV
   framework to assess the social-ecological implications of fishing and
   tourism in temperate coastal systems. We spatially represented the SEV
   of coastal systems and identified the social and ecological
   vulnerability dimensions underpinning this SEV. Our results demonstrate
   that different dimensions contribute differently to the SEV, suggesting
   the need for distinctive management intervention to reduce the
   vulnerability of coastal systems. Our findings also highlight that
   livelihood diversification and the protection of marine areas may be
   plausible strategies to build resilience in temperate coastal systems
   that face fishing and tourism pressures. With this study, we hope to
   encourage the application of the SEV framework to other drivers of
   change for building more resilient coastal systems.

Title = {Geoengineering potential of artificially enhanced silicate weathering of

Abstract = {Geoengineering is a proposed action to manipulate Earth's climate in
   order to counteract global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emissions. We investigate the potential of a specific geoengineering
   technique, carbon sequestration by artificially enhanced silicate
   weathering via the dissolution of olivine. This approach would not only
   operate against rising temperatures but would also oppose ocean
   acidification, because it influences the global climate via the carbon
   cycle. If important details of the marine chemistry are taken into
   consideration, a new mass ratio of CO2 sequestration per olivine
   dissolution of about 1 is achieved, 20\% smaller than previously
   assumed. We calculate that this approach has the potential to
   sequestrate up to 1 Pg of C per year directly, if olivine is distributed
   as fine powder over land areas of the humid tropics, but this rate is
   limited by the saturation concentration of silicic acid. In our
   calculations for the Amazon and Congo river catchments, a maximum annual
   dissolution of 1.8 and 0.4 Pg of olivine seems possible, corresponding
   to the sequestration of 0.5 and 0.1 Pg of C per year, but these upper
   limit sequestration rates come at the environmental cost of pH values in
   the rivers rising to 8.2. Open water dissolution of fine-grained olivine
   and an enhancement of the biological pump by the rising riverine input
   of silicic acid might increase our estimate of the carbon sequestration,
   but additional research is needed here. We finally calculate with a
   carbon cycle model the consequences of sequestration rates of 1-5 Pg of
   C per year for the 21st century by this technique.},

Title = {Resilience Gentrification: Environmental Privilege in an Age of Coastal
   Climate Disasters},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Climate change is exacerbating storms at the same time that humans are
   increasingly settling in areas most affected by such storms. In theory,
   post-disaster recovery offers opportunities to rebuild for sustainable
   development. However, in reality, responses to climate events often
   result in greater inequality through a process we term resilience
   gentrification. Three possible resolutions to the coastal resilience
   dialectic are managed retreat, denial, and structural mitigation.
   Structural mitigation has become the most popular response in the
   Anthropocene. This response raises the cost of coastal redevelopment,
   giving capital greater access and control over development decisions.
   These changes make coastal areas more expensive and more exclusive. We
   illustrate this process in the post-disaster recovery of two very
   different communities: Gowanus, Brooklyn and the Caribbean island of
   Barbuda. In both cases, attempts to build it back ``green{''}-using
   selective aspects of ``sustainable development{''} as a guide-come at
   the cost of exacerbating existing housing inequality. In this way,
   ``resilience{''} gets equated with wealth, thus reinforcing a cycle of
   climate injustice. To achieve a ``just sustainability,{''} government
   responses must consider and address the equity impacts of climate change
   resilience policies. Managed retreat and degrowth strategies for climate
   resilience offer greater potential for a just sustainability in the
   Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {Australia's aquatic ecosystems are unique, supporting a high diversity
   of species and high levels of endemism; however, they are also extremely
   vulnerable to climate change. The present review assesses
   climate-induced changes to structural habitats that have occurred in
   different aquatic ecosystems. Climatic impacts are often difficult to
   discern against the background of habitat degradation caused by more
   direct anthropogenic impacts. However, climate impacts will become more
   pronounced with ongoing changes in temperature, water chemistry, sea
   level, rainfall patterns and ocean currents. Each of these factors is
   likely to have specific effects on ecosystems, communities or species,
   and their relative importance varies across different marine and
   freshwater habitats. In the Murray-Darling Basin, the greatest concern
   relates to declines in surface water availability and riverine flow,
   owing to declining rainfall and increased evaporative loss. On the Great
   Barrier Reef, increasing temperatures and ocean acidification contribute
   to sustained and ongoing loss of habitat-forming corals. Despite the
   marked differences in major drivers and consequences of climate change,
   the solution is always the same. Greenhouse-gas emissions need to be
   reduced as a matter of urgency, while also minimising non-climatic
   disturbances. Together, these actions will maximise opportunities for
   adaptation by species and increase ecosystem resilience.},

Abstract = {It is estimated that almost ten trillion cubic meters of methane are
   contained in sedimentary basins in Japan and under the seafloor around
   the Japanese Islands. Most of the natural gas resources, however, are
   hardly economically recoverable as the methane is adsorbed in coal
   seams, trapped in hydrate clathrate or dissolved in saline groundwater.
   Shallow subsurface accumulation of methane poses even a hidden threat of
   explosive global warming. Enhanced gas recovery by subsurface CO2
   injection (CO2-EGR) is a practicable solution for the greenhouse gas
   control and for efficient use of unmineable energy resources.
   Extremely light isotopic compositions of carbon in methane from many
   subsurface accumulations of natural gas suggest it was formed by
   methanogens. The subsurface lithoautotrophic microbes form methane again
   from disposed CO2 without sunlight in anoxic aquifers. Re-extraction of
   subsurface methane, that has been converted from disposed CO2 by
   methanogens, makes the carbon recycling complete.
   Autogenous sealing by formation of CO2-hydrate prevents the release of
   CO2 in aquifers under sea floor deeper than 300m. In warm inland and
   shallow subsurface aquifers, leakage of CO2 is prevented by carbon
   dioxide precipitation in a preset ``ambush aquifer{''} with high pH and
   high calcium ion concentration. If necessary, lime water is injected
   into the ``ambush aquifer{''} over the caprock of CO2-reservoirs. Safe
   long containment of CO2 and gas is important for methane fermentation in
   CO2-reservoirs.
   A subsurface ecosystem is similar to an archaic ecosystem that was
   adapted to anoxic CO2-rich atmosphere under high pressure and
   temperature. Methanogenesis is active even in deep basaltic aquifers.
   Subsurface biogeochemical carbon recycling may realize greenhouse gas
   control with restoration of energy resources.},

Title = {Shifts in methanogenic archaea communities and methane dynamics along a
   subtropical estuarine land use gradient},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {15},

Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {In coastal aquatic ecosystems, prokaryotic communities play an important
   role in regulating the cycling of nutrients and greenhouse gases. In the
   coastal zone, estuaries are complex and delicately balanced systems
   containing a multitude of specific ecological niches for resident
   microbes. Anthropogenic influences (i.e. urban, industrial and
   agricultural land uses) along the estuarine continuum can invoke
   physical and biochemical changes that impact these niches. In this
   study, we investigate the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea and
   other prokaryotic communities, distributed along a land use gradient in
   the subtropical Burnett River Estuary, situated within the Great Barrier
   Reef catchment, Australia. Microbiological assemblages were compared to
   physicochemical, nutrient and greenhouse gas distributions in both pore
   and surface water. Pore water samples from within the most urbanised
   site showed a high relative abundance of methanogenic Euryarchaeota
   (7.8\% of all detected prokaryotes), which coincided with elevated
   methane concentrations in the water column, ranging from 0.51 to 0.68 mu
   M at the urban and sewage treatment plant (STP) sites, respectively.
   These sites also featured elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentrations (0.66 to 1.16 mM), potentially fuelling methanogenesis.
   At the upstream freshwater site, both methane and DOC concentrations
   were considerably higher (2.68 mu M and 1.8 mM respectively) than at the
   estuarine sites (0.02 to 0.66 mu M and 0.39 to 1.16 mM respectively) and
   corresponded to the highest relative abundance of methanotrophic
   bacteria. The proportion of sulfate reducing bacteria in the prokaryotic
   community was elevated within the urban and STP sites (relative
   abundances of 8.0\%- 10.5\%), consistent with electron acceptors with
   higher redox potentials (e.g. O-2, NO3-) being scarce. Overall, this
   study showed that ecological niches in anthropogenically altered
   environments appear to give an advantage to specialized prokaryotes

Title = {Wave energy in the UK: Status review and future perspectives},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This review aims at giving a picture of the progress of the UK wave
   energy and suggesting key steps needing to be taken for its contribution
   to the Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050. It follows
   consultation through scoping wave energy workshops held by the
   Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in August
   2019 and by Supergen Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Hub in January 2020
   and a series of structured interviews with academics, policy-makers,
   funding bodies and industry professionals. It is believed that the UK
   has excellent wave resources and advanced techniques that need to be
   rapidly developed to achieve the target of 22 GW of installed capacity
   by 2050 Greaves et al. (2020). The wave energy resources in the UK are
   reviewed, summarising wave energy hotspots for development and
   identifying openly accessible wave data. The progress and achievements
   of wave energy development in the UK are reviewed and described to
   underline the important roles that UK government and industry support
   have to play in securing a leading position in wave energy. The
   potential benefits of wave energy for the decarbonisation of UK industry
   (including utility scale and niche markets) to achieve Net Zero target
   by 2050 are presented, as well as the steps that need to be taken in the
   next 30 years to achieve its potential.},

Abstract = {From the perspective of production performance, energy supply are the
   basic material conditions. However, greenhouse gas, air pollution and
   waste water are also produced in the process of production. If the
   undesired characteristics are ignored in the process of performance
   evaluation, the production efficiency will be misestimated. Based on
   this, this study uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate the
   undesired output, and discusses the production efficiency with thermal
   consumption in Chinese port cities, especially with severe shipping
   emissions, during 2015-2019. The empirical results show that the
   efficiency declines first (2015-2017) and then increases (2018-2019)
   when considering the undesired output of wastewater and SO2 generated by
   thermal consumption.},

Title = {Net ecosystem carbon exchange and the greenhouse gas balance of tidal

Journal = {BIOGEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {120},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {163-189},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Tidal wetlands are productive ecosystems with the capacity to sequester
   large amounts of carbon (C), but we know relatively little about the
   impact of climate change on wetland C cycling in lower salinity
   (oligohaline and tidal freshwater) coastal marshes. In this study we
   assessed plant production, C cycling and sequestration, and microbial
   organic matter mineralization at tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and salt
   marsh sites along the salinity gradient in the Delaware River Estuary
   over four years. We measured aboveground plant biomass, carbon dioxide
   (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the marsh and atmosphere,
   microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in marsh soils, soil
   biogeochemistry, and C sequestration with radiodating of soils. A simple
   model was constructed to estimate monthly and annually integrated rates
   of gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) to
   carbon dioxide () or methane (), net ecosystem production (NEP), the
   contribution of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis to ER, and the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) source or sink status of the wetland for 2 years
   (2007 and 2008). All three marsh types were highly productive but
   evidenced different patterns of C sequestration and GHG source/sink
   status. The contribution of sulfate reduction to total ER increased
   along the salinity gradient from tidal freshwater to salt marsh. The
   Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh was a C sink as indicated by
   both NEP (similar to 140 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and Pb-210 radiodating (336
   g C m(-2) year(-1)), a minor sink for atmospheric CH4, and a GHG sink
   (similar to 620 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The tidal freshwater marsh was
   a source of CH4 to the atmosphere (similar to 22 g C-CH4 m(-2)
   year(-1)). There were large interannual differences in plant production
   and therefore C and GHG source/sink status at the tidal freshwater
   marsh, though Pb-210 radiodating indicated modest C accretion (110 g C
   m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline marsh site experienced seasonal
   saltwater intrusion in the late summer and fall (up to 10 mS cm(-1)) and
   the Zizania aquatica monoculture at this site responded with sharp
   declines in biomass and GEP in late summer. Salinity intrusion was also
   linked to large effluxes of CH4 at the oligohaline site (> 80 g C-CH4
   m(-2) year(-1)), making this site a significant GHG source (> 2,000 g
   CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline site did not accumulate C over
   the 2 year study period, though Pb-210 dating indicated long term C
   accumulation (250 g C m(-2) year(-1)), suggesting seasonal salt-water
   intrusion can significantly alter C cycling and GHG exchange dynamics in
   tidal marsh ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy such as wave energy has gained popularity as a means of
   reducing greenhouse gases. However, the high cost and lack of available
   sea space in some countries have hindered the deployment of wave energy
   converters (WEC) as alternative means of sustainable energy production.
   By combining WECs with infrastructures such as floating breakwaters or
   piers, the idea of electricity generated from WECs will be more
   appealing. This paper considers the integration of vertical raft-type
   WEC (commonly known as the vertical flap WEC) with floating breakwater
   as means to generate electricity and attenuate wave force in the
   tropical sea. An array of 25 WECs attached to a floating breakwater is
   considered where their performance and effect on the wave climate are
   presented. The effects of varying dimensions of the WEC and mooring
   system of the floating breakwater have on the energy generation are
   investigated. The integrated WECs and floating breakwater is subjected
   to both the regular and irregular waves in the tropical sea to assess
   the performance of the system. The result shows that the integrated
   vertical flap-floating breakwater system can generate a substantial
   amount of wave energy and at the same time attenuate the wave force
   effectively for the tropical sea when optimal dimensions of the WECs are
   used.},

Abstract = {Community-based adaptation (CBA) is becoming an increasingly popular
   approach to climate change adaptation in the Pacific islands region.
   Building adaptive capacity should be an important component of projects
   supporting CBA. The literature establishes that adaptive capacity is
   highly context and culture specific. However, to date, there has been
   little research into the factors and processes that enable adaptive
   capacity in Pacific island communities. This paper discusses the Pacific
   Adaptive Capacity Analysis Framework, a theoretical framework developed
   to guide assessment of adaptive capacity for the purposes of supporting
   CBA projects. The framework identifies seven broad factors and several
   sub-factors of Pacific-specific adaptive capacity: (1) human capital;
   (2) social capital; (3) belief systems, worldviews, and values; (4)
   resources and their distribution; (5) options for adaptation,
   livelihood, and food supply; (6) information and awareness; and (7)
   history of dealing with climate stress. The paper presents a case study
   of adaptive capacity from a community in the Solomon Islands and
   concludes that unlike many adaptive capacity determinants identified in
   the broader international literature, function-based (factors shaping
   ability to access and use resources) and cognitive (for example, values
   and belief systems) determinants are of particular relevance in the
   Pacific community social and cultural context. The key to building upon
   cognitive and function-based aspects of adaptive capacity is increasing
   the ability of people to liaise with external support organisations to
   plan and acquire resources for adaptation on their own terms.},

Title = {Energy analysis on Coalbed Methane (CBM) coupled power systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CO2 UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {16-27},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coalbed Methane (CBM) contains 97\% of CH4 and very less amount of
   sulphur. Methane is a very high calorific value (congruent to 55.7
   MJ/kg) gas as well as a greenhouse gas, which gets adsorbed on coal beds
   during coalification. Hence, capture of this CBM gas prior to coal
   mining not only prevents fire hazard but also the emission of greenhouse
   gas into the atmosphere. As the CBM gas is enriched in chemical energy,
   it is a promising source for power generation. In the present study,
   Raniganj (Jharkhand, India) Coal Field (RCF) properties are considered
   for CBM case study. A detailed energy analysis for the CBM and ECBM
   integrated carbon neutral power generating systems such as steam
   turbine, combined cycle (CC) and fuel cell systems is presented and the
   net thermal efficiency of each power plant with carbon capture and
   storage is estimated. High pressure coal seam is considered for combined
   cycle and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cycle operation. Integration of
   power plant with CBM is studied for various coal seam operating
   pressures in the range of 3-1 MPa and a high net thermal efficiency of
   68.3\% is found at 30 bar with carbon capture and storage (CCS) for CBM
   integrated fuel cell cycle. In case of CBM integrated combined cycle and
   steam turbine system, a net thermal efficiency of 45\% and 41\% is
   estimated, respectively. An increase in 0.5\% net thermal efficiency is
   calculated for ECBM case as compared to CBM under identical operating
   conditions of coal seam. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comparative effects of prolonged freshwater and saline flooding on
   nitrogen cycling in an agricultural soil},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {56-70},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Due to climate change, the frequency and duration of flood events are
   predicted to increase in many regions of the world. This is expected to
   cause large changes in soil functioning and to a progressive decline in
   soil quality such as reduced rates of nutrient cycling, enhanced
   greenhouse gas emissions and loss of soil biodiversity. There is a
   knowledge gap, however, on how temperate agricultural soils under
   different management practices (e.g. manure application) respond to
   prolonged river or coastal flooding. The main objective of this work was
   to determine the effects of a simulated prolonged flooding with saline
   and freshwater on soil N cycling, following application of a low C:N
   organic amendment (broiler litter) at two temperatures, representative
   of a winter and a spring flood event. Using laboratory mesocosms we
   simulated prolonged winter (6 degrees C) and spring (14 degrees C)
   flooding of soil amended with broiler litter. We also compared the
   effects of inundation with either river (freshwater) or coastal (saline)
   water. An agricultural grassland soil (Eutric Cambisol) was subjected to
   different combinations of treatments (flood with fresh or saline water,
   winter vs spring temperatures, with/without poultry manure). The impact
   of these treatments on soil solution N dynamics, greenhouse gas
   emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) and microbial community structure (by PLFA
   analysis) were evaluated over an 11 week simulated flood event followed
   by an 8 week soil recovery period (without flood). Overall, potential
   losses of NH4+ and cumulative GHG emissions were increased by flooding
   and the presence of manure. CH4 emissions were found to dominate under
   freshwater flooding conditions and N2O under saline flooding.
   Significant releases of GHG occurred during both flooding and after
   floodwater removal. Temperature was less influential on regulating GHG
   under the different treatments. These releases in GHG were associated
   with disruption in N cycling and changes in soil microbial composition
   and these changes persisted after floodwater removal. Extreme flooding
   negatively impacts soil functioning, however, the magnitude of any
   changes remain critically dependent on flood duration and source of
   flood water, and management conditions. Further work is required at the
   field scale to understand the molecular basis of the responses observed
   in this study.},

Title = {The macroeconomic effects of adapting to high-end sea-level rise via
   protection and migration},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR) is projected to be
   substantial, triggering human adaptation responses, including increasing
   protection and out-migration from coastlines. Yet, in macroeconomic
   assessments of SLR the latter option has been given little attention. We
   fill this gap by providing a global analysis of the macroeconomic
   effects of adaptation to SLR, including coastal migration, focusing on
   the higher end of SLR projections until 2050. We find that when adapting
   simultaneously via protection and coastal migration, macroeconomic costs
   can be lower than with protection alone. For some developing regions
   coastal migration is even less costly (in GDP) than protection.
   Additionally, we find that future macroeconomic costs are dominated by
   accumulated macroeconomic effects over time, rather than by future
   direct damages, implying the need for immediate adaptation. Finally, we
   demonstrate the importance of including autonomous adaptation in the
   reference scenario of economic assessment studies to avoid
   overestimation of adaptation benefits.
   The authors calculated the economy-wide costs of sea level rise and
   possible adaptation options. Protection clearly pays off and when
   combining protection and coastal migration, costs can be brought down
   further, yet, residual damage costs are large.},

   Life Cycle Impacts of Coal Exported from the United States},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The construction of two marine bulk terminals in the Pacific Northwest
   region of the United States are currently under review and would open up
   additional thermal coal exports to Asia on the order of almost 100
   million additional tonnes per year. The major exporters of coal to Asian
   markets include Indonesia and Australia. This life cycle analysis (LCA)
   seeks to understand the role of transportation and mining in the
   cradle-to-busbar environmental impacts of coal exports from the Powder
   River Basin (PRB) to Asian countries, when compared to the competitor
   countries. This LCA shows that: (1) the most significant greenhouse gas
   (GHG) impacts in the cradle-to-busbar life cycle of coal for power
   generation come from the combustion of coal in a power plant, even when
   90\% carbon capture is applied; (2) for non-GHG air impacts, power plant
   combustion impacts are less dominant and variations in upstream impacts
   (mining and transportation) are more important; and (3) when comparing
   impacts between countries, upstream impacts vary for both GHG and
   non-GHG results, but conclusions that rank countries cannot be made.
   Future research should include expansion to include non-air impacts,
   potential consequential effects of coal exports, and a better
   understanding around the characterization of non-GHG ocean transport
   impacts.},

Abstract = {Shoreline hardening is a major driver of biodiversity and habitat loss
   in coastal ecosystems yet remains a common approach to coastal
   management globally. Using surveys of waterfront residents in North
   Carolina, USA, we sought to identify factors influencing individual
   shore-protection decisions and ultimately impacting coastal ecosystems,
   particularly coastal wetlands. We found that neighboring shore condition
   was the best predictor of respondent shore condition. Respondents with
   hardened shorelines were more likely to have neighbors with hardened
   shorelines, and to report that neighbors influenced their
   shore-protection choices than respondents with natural shorelines.
   Further, respondents who expressed climate-change skepticism and
   preference for shoreline hardening were opposed to shoreline-hardening
   restrictions. Despite preferring hardening, respondents ranked wetlands
   as highly valuable for storm protection and other ecosystem services,
   suggesting a disconnect between the ecological knowledge of individuals
   and social norms of shore-protection decisions. However, our results
   also suggest that efforts to increase the installation of living
   shorelines have the potential to conserve and restore important coastal
   habitats and support biodiversity along shorelines that may otherwise be
   degraded by hardening. Further, encouraging waterfront-property owners
   who have adopted living shorelines to recommend them to neighbors may be
   an effective strategy to initiate and reinforce pro-conservation social
   norms.},

Title = {Comparing the cost effectiveness of nature-based and coastal adaptation:
   A case study from the Gulf Coast of the United States},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Coastal risks are increasing from both development and climate change.
   Interest is growing in the protective role that coastal nature-based
   measures (or green infrastructure), such as reefs and wetlands, can play
   in adapting to these risks. However, a lack of quantitative information
   on their relative costs and benefits is one principal factor limiting
   their use more broadly. Here, we apply a quantitative risk assessment
   framework to assess coastal flood risk (from climate change and economic
   exposure growth) across the United States Gulf of Mexico coast to
   compare the cost effectiveness of different adaptation measures. These
   include nature-based (e.g. oyster reef restoration), structural or grey
   (e.g., seawalls) and policy measures (e.g. home elevation). We first
   find that coastal development will be a critical driver of risk,
   particularly for major disasters, but climate change will cause more
   recurrent losses through changes in storms and relative sea level rise.
   By 2030, flooding will cost \$134 +/- 176.6 billion (for different
   economic growth scenarios), but as the effects of climate change, land
   subsidence and concentration of assets in the coastal zone increase,
   annualized risk will more than double by 2050 with respect to 2030.
   However, from the portfolio we studied, the set of cost-effective
   adaptation measures (with benefit to cost ratios above 1) could prevent
   up to \$57 +/- 101 billion in losses, which represents 42.8 +/- 57.2\%
   of the total risk. Nature-based adaptation options could avert more than
   \$50 billion of these costs, and do so cost effectively with average
   benefit to cost ratios above 3.5. Wetland and oyster reef restoration
   are found to be particularly cost-effective. This study demonstrates
   that the cost effectiveness of nature-based, grey and policy measures

Title = {Farmers' adaptation to climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in NW Turkey},

Abstract = {Some of the measures to be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are
   related to agricultural activities. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a
   method allowing implementation of agricultural practices in compliance
   with the efforts to combat climate change. CSA is an approach guiding
   agricultural systems under changing climate conditions to provide
   sustainable development and food safety. The targets of this approach
   included sustainable increase in agricultural production, resistance and
   adaptation to climate change and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
   Farmer participation and level of consciousness play a significant role
   in successful implementation of CSA. The present study was conducted to
   put forth farmers' adaptation of climate change. Farmer perceptions or
   approaches to CSA were taken into consideration. In the study, the
   literature was examined to analyze the adoption of CSA and the typology
   of CSA applications was developed. The typology consists of five
   categories: (1) soil management, (2) water management, (3) chemical
   input management, (4) crop diversification and (5) planting
   trees/agroforestry. Household survey data were used to create and test
   hypotheses about farmers' adoption of CSA. Nonparametric tests were used
   to estimate the socioeconomic variables that were effective in the
   adoption of CSA categories. The results generally show that CSA
   categories have high application potential among farmers. The factors
   influencing farmer decisions on these issues were identified as
   education, participation into agricultural meetings, land size and
   agricultural income. Such factors may guide policymakers while taking
   measures against climate change.},

Title = {Sustainable healthcare - Time for `Green Podiatry'},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOT AND ANKLE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Background Healthcare aims to promote good health and yet demonstrably
   contributes to climate change, which is purported to be `the biggest
   global health threat of the 21st century'. This is happening now, with
   healthcare as an industry representing 4.4\% of global carbon dioxide
   emissions. Main body Climate change promotes health deficits from many
   angles; however, primarily it is the use of fossil fuels which increases
   atmospheric carbon dioxide (also nitrous oxide, and methane). These
   greenhouse gases prevent the earth from cooling, resulting in the higher
   temperatures and rising sea levels, which then cause `wild weather'
   patterns, including floods, storms, and droughts. Particular
   vulnerability is afforded to those already health compromised (older
   people, pregnant women, children, wider health co-morbidities) as well
   as populations closer to equatorial zones, which encompasses many
   low-and-middle-income-countries. The paradox here, is that poorer
   nations by spending less on healthcare, have lower carbon emissions from
   health-related activity, and yet will suffer most from global warming
   effects, with scant resources to off-set the increasing health care
   needs. Global recognition has forged the Paris agreement, the United
   Nations sustainable developments goals, and the World Health
   Organisation climate change action plan. It is agreed that most
   healthcare impact comes from consumption of energy and resources, and
   the production of greenhouse gases into the environment. Many
   professional associations of medicine and allied health professionals
   are advocating for their members to lead on environmental
   sustainability; the Australian Podiatry Association is incorporating
   climate change into its strategic direction. Conclusion Podiatrists, as
   allied health professionals, have wide community engagement, and hence,
   can model positive environmental practices, which may be effective in
   changing wider community behaviours, as occurred last century when
   doctors stopped smoking. As foot health consumers, our patients are
   increasingly likely to expect more sustainable practices and products,
   including `green footwear' options. Green Podiatry, as a part of
   sustainable healthcare, directs us to be responsible energy and product
   consumers, and reduce our workplace emissions.},

Abstract = {The human history of coastal regions around the world has been under
   assault for decades, from forces that include dam building, coastal
   modifications, the destruction of wetlands, marine erosion, population
   growth and rampant development, looting, and other processes. Global
   warming will exacerbate the destruction of cultural resources in coastal
   zones through accelerated sea level rise, intensified storm cycles, and
   related coastal erosion. Although average global sea levels have been
   rising for similar to 20,000 years, they slowed dramatically about 7,000
   years ago. Rates of sea level rise now appear to be increasing rapidly
   due to growing anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other
   greenhouse gases. Global warming and rising seas, especially when
   combined with population growth and the implementation of measures
   designed to protect endangered coastal properties, threaten the deep
   maritime history of human migrations, settlement, and adaptations in
   coastal areas around the world. Ranging in age from the mid-Pleistocene
   to recent historic times, coastal archaeological sites contain
   invaluable data on ancient coastal societies, fisheries, and ecosystems.
   Archaeologists, historians, and other cultural resource managers must do
   more to anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of global
   warming, sea level rise, and coastal erosion on the long history of
   human maritime cultures.},

Abstract = {Governments face the daunting task of developing policies and making

   results in incorporation of flexibility that allows change over time in

Abstract = {Gas pre-extraction technology in a coal reservoir can not only reduce
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but also effectively recover coalbed
   methane (CBM). In this work, we use a geomechanical-coupled gas flow
   (GCF) model to simulate and analyze the pre-extraction effect of a
   mining-disturbed coal seam. First, the simulation results of the GCF
   model are compared with field test data to verify the correctness and
   reliability of our model. Then, the evolution law of the stress field,
   permeability field, and gas flow field in the extraction process is
   analyzed through a case study. The results show that the first principal
   stress of coal in a mining area increases first and then decreases
   slowly and reaches the peak value at 5 m. The third principal stress
   increases gradually at first and becomes stable after 10 m. As the
   distance from the mining face increases, the permeability and gas
   pressure of the coal seam show continuous and asymmetric ``U{''}-shaped
   and ``n{''} -shaped distribution characteristics, respectively. In
   addition, the recovery effect and abnormal emission factors of CBM are
   discussed. This study can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing
   the CBM recovery effect and reducing GHG emissions during mining.},

Abstract = {Reducing speeds across shipping fleets has been shown to make a
   substantial contribution to effective short term measures for reducing
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, working toward the goal adopted by the
   International Maritime Organization (IMO) in April 2018 to reduce the
   total annual GHG emission by at least 50\% by 2050 compared to 2008. I
   review modeling work on GHG emissions and also on the relationships
   between underwater noise, whale collision risk and speed. I examine
   different speed reduction scenarios that would contribute to GHG
   reduction targets, and the other environmental benefits of reduced
   underwater noise and risk of collisions with marine life. A modest 10\%
   speed reduction across the global fleet has been estimated to reduce
   overall GHG emissions by around 13\% (Faber et al., 2017) and improve
   the probability of meeting GHG targets by 23\% (Corner et al., 2018). I
   conclude that such a 10\% speed reduction, could reduce the total sound
   energy from shipping by around 40\%. The associated reduction in overall
   ship strike risk has higher uncertainty but could be around 50\%. This
   would benefit whale populations globally and complement current efforts
   to reduce collision risk in identified high risk areas through small
   changes in routing.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most polarized political issues facing the
   American electorate. Even in places like California, where the vast
   majority of the population believes that some action should be taken to
   protect people and property from the effects of climate change,
   Democrats and Republicans disagree on precisely what should be
   protected, the specific adaptive measures that should be taken, and who
   should pay. As warnings of catastrophic damage become louder, however,
   the urgency to find bipartisan solutions will increase. Using a novel
   survey of California adults, our research assesses the current level of
   disagreement over adaptive measures to sea level rise between Democrats
   and Republicans, and asks whether there are conditions under which
   partisans can come to closer agreement on them. Specifically, we
   consider the role of personal experiences in lessening the degree of
   polarization on how partisans think about and prioritize climate
   adaptation. We find that experiencing extreme events does lessen the
   partisan gap in many instances, offering hope that communities can find
   bipartisan solutions to climate change threats.},

Abstract = {We describe a method for removing systematic biases of column-averaged
   dry air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2 /and CH4 (XCH4 derived from
   short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectra of the Greenhouse gases
   Observing SATellite (GOSAT). We conduct correlation analyses between the
   GOSAT biases and simultaneously retrieved auxiliary parameters. We use
   these correlations to bias correct the GOSAT data, removing these
   spurious correlations. Data from the Total Carbon Column Observing
   Network (TC-CON) were used as reference values for this regression
   analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of this correction method, the
   uncorrected/corrected GOSAT data were compared to independent XCO2 and
   XCH4 data derived from aircraft measurements taken for the Comprehensive
   Observation Network for TRace gases by AIrLiner (CONTRAIL) project, the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US
   Department of Energy (DOE), the National Institute for Environmental
   Studies (NIES), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the HIAPER
   Pole-to-Pole observations (HIPPO) program, and the GOSAT validation
   aircraft observation campaign over Japan. These comparisons demonstrate
   that the empirically derived bias correction improves the agreement
   between GOSAT XCO2/XCH4 and the aircraft data. Finally, we present
   spatial distributions and temporal variations of the derived GOSAT
   biases.},

Title = {Effect of nitrogen fertilization on soil CH4 and N2O fluxes, and soil

Abstract = {The effect of nitrogen addition, through deposition or fertilization, on
   ecosystem processes responsible for storing and releasing greenhouse
   gasses (GHG) CO2, CH4 and N2O are poorly understood. We measured the
   effects of winter application of 200 kg N ha(-1) to a
   near-end-of-rotation coastal Douglas-fir stand on soil CH4 and N2O
   fluxes, soil and bole respiration (R-s and R-b, respectively), and soil
   CH4 and N2O concentrations. Fertilization resulted in a significant
   decrease in CH4 uptake and changed a small uptake of N2O to significant
   emissions. Based on the average reduction of 2 mu mol m(-2)h(-1) CH4
   uptake with N fertilization, from an average of 4 mu mol m(-2)h(-1) I
   with no N fertilization, the approximate first-year annual reduction was
   estimated to be 2.8 kg CH(4)ha(-1). In comparison, net annual increase
   in N2O emissions with N fertilization was 17.6 kg N2O ha-1. Calculations
   showed that fertilizer-induced net GHG emissions due to the reduction in
   CH4 uptake and the increase in N2O emissions was 0.07 and 5.3 t CO2 ha-1
   equivalents (CO2-Eqv). respectively, indicating that the reduction in
   CH4 uptake was much less important than the increase in N2O emissions.
   Contrary to expectation, the annual loss of 17.6 kg N2O ha(-1) from this
   winter application of N was slightly higher than the 15.7 kg N2O ha(-1)
   loss following spring application of N in the previous year. N
   fertilization also resulted in small increase in soil respiration,
   confirming our previous results. Temporal dynamics of Rb matched those
   of soil respiration and N2O fluxes. Fertilization resulted in a small
   but persistent increase in Rb over the first 4-5 months. While soil
   temperature was the main control of soil N2O and CO2 fluxes as well as
   R-b, CH4 uptake was better correlated to soil water content, i.e.. soil
   gas diffusivity and gas exchange with the atmosphere. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Volume = {415},

Pages = {159-162},

Abstract = {Most global biogeochemical processes are known to respond to climate
   change, some of which have the capacity to produce feedbacks through the
   regulation of atmospheric greenhouse gases(1). Marine
   denitrification-the reduction of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen-is an
   important process in this regard, affecting greenhouse gas
   concentrations directly through the incidental production of nitrous
   oxide, and indirectly through modification of the marine nitrogen
   inventory and hence the biological pump for CO2. Although
   denitrification has been shown to vary with glacial-interglacial
   cycles(2,3), its response to more rapid climate change has not yet been
   well characterized. Here we present nitrogen isotope ratio, nitrogen
   content and chlorin abundance data from sediment cores with high
   accumulation rates on the Oman continental margin that reveal
   substantial millennial-scale variability in Arabian Sea denitrification
   and productivity during the last glacial period. The detailed
   correspondence of these changes with Dansgaard-Oeschger events recorded
   in Greenland ice cores(4) indicates rapid, century-scale reorganization
   of the Arabian Sea ecosystem in response to climate excursions, mediated
   through the intensity of summer monsoonal upwelling. Considering the
   several-thousand-year residence time of fixed nitrogen in the ocean, the
   response of global marine productivity to changes in denitrification
   would have occurred at lower frequency and appears to be related to
   climatic and atmospheric CO2 oscillations observed in Antarctic ice
   cores between 20 and 60 kyr ago(5).},

Abstract = {Coastal cities are under rising pressure to adapt to climate change.
   They suffer from the severe effects of increased frequencies and
   intensities of coastal hazards, particularly flooding, while oftentimes
   continuing to sprawl into hazard-exposed areas and grow beyond the pace
   of sufficient infrastructure development. Even though these problems
   have been quite well understood for a while, there is still
   comparatively little knowledge and scientific assessment of the solution
   space, i.e., on the options available for adaptation and the ways in
   which they are being perceived, framed and evaluated in the scientific
   literature. Focusing on Jakarta, this study presents findings from a
   systematic assessment of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the
   adaptation solution space with regard to current and future flooding.
   Jakarta is chosen as a case study since it is among the cities with the
   highest flood risk and adaptation pressure globally while also being one
   of the most heavily researched coastal cities in this regard, certainly
   in the Global South. Based on a structured keyword search, we assess 339
   articles. Results indicate that the perceived solution space is skewed
   towards hard protection against flooding, while measures to accommodate
   flooding or retreat from exposed areas are less widely considered in the
   scientific debate. Soft adaptation measures for the reduction of social
   vulnerability receive less attention in the literature than those
   measures targeting the taming of flood hazards, often through
   engineering solutions. Likewise, hybrid adaptation approaches, which
   combine soft and hard measures in a complementary way, are only rarely
   considered. Looking into the future, the findings suggest that despite
   the importance of hard flood protection as a main adaptation solution in
   Jakarta, other fields of the solution space deserve increased scientific
   attention. This relates in particular to urgently needed feasibility and
   effectiveness assessments of ecosystems-based solutions for flood
   mitigation and adaptation options targeting social vulnerability. While
   the empirical results are specific to Jakarta, heuristic observations
   from research on other coastal cities suggest that similar scoping
   exercises of the predominantly perceived solution space might be of
   relevance in many cities beyond Jakarta.},

   decreasing the release of carbon and increasing its sequestration,
   without compromising currently threatened ecosystems, are required,
   especially for small territories. This study focuses on the strategies
   to increase the resilience of small islands to these losses, including
   spatial management to prevent and adapt to climate change while
   preserving biodiversity. Changes in carbon storage on Pico Island
   (Azores, Portugal) between 1998 and 2013 were assessed using the InVEST
   (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) Carbon
   Storage and Sequestration model. Changes in carbon stocks caused by
   changes in land use during this period, and the stocks' relationships
   with protected areas and the quality of natural habitats on Pico Island,
   were analyzed. Bogs and Azorean endemic Macaronesian heaths store more
   carbon per ha. Alien species are invading natural areas, and their
   carbon values need to be carefully addressed. Results, however,
   indicated that simultaneously increasing carbon stocks (economical
   value) and protecting biodiversity (environmental value) is possible by
   adapted and discussed management actions. This study supports the
   strategies that promote the potential of the conservation of
   biodiversity for mitigating climate change. The proposed management
   guidelines can be applied to other Macaronesian islands and, with local
   adaptations, to other outermost regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has been
   aggressively working to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all
   aspects of its infrastructure and programs, with the ultimate goal of an
   80\% reduction by 2050, relative to the 2005 baseline. Many DEP programs
   have co-benefits that can contribute to the City's overall emissions
   reductions. This water-energy nexus study quantified the carbon
   footprint benefits associated with four of DEP's programs: green
   infrastructure, water demand management and conservation, wetland
   restoration, and water supply forestland protection.
   The study utilized the global protocol for community scale GHG
   emissions, which requires derivation of activity data and emissions
   factors for each program to allow associated carbon footprints to be
   calculated. Sewersheds, defined as the geographic areas contributing
   stormwater and/or sanitary flow to each of the City's 14 wastewater
   treatment plants (WWTPs), were used as modeling boundaries. Activity
   data for fiscal year 2015 included 2.6 billion liters per year (BLY) of
   avoided stormwater input to the City's 14 WWTPs. This stormwater was
   captured by green infrastructure during rainfall events that did not
   cause combined sewer overflows. Additionally, 2.0 BLY of reduced City
   water demand and corresponding wastewater by conserving fixtures and
   0.50 BLY of reduced City water demand through repairs of leaking water
   mains. Also, direct carbon sequestration by 0.15 km(2) of installed
   green infrastructure, 0.86 km(2) of restored tidal and fresh water
   wetlands and 385 km(2) of protected water supply forestlands.
   Corresponding emissions factors included carbon sequestration rates by
   green infrastructure and restored wetlands, and electrical consumption
   offsets at each wastewater and water treatment plant related to flow
   reductions.
   The results were calculated using DEP's water-energy-nexus tool-a
   dashboard style, excel-based calculator that was developed to allow
   rapid and convenient estimation, analysis, and reporting of GHG
   co-benefits from various DEP programs. The modular design of the tool
   allows for future incorporation of other DEP or City programs. Estimated
   total emissions reductions for FY 2015 across all programs is 178,000 MT
   CO2.e; equivalent to removing approximately 53,000 standard passenger
   cars from the road. This result underscores the significant carbon
   co-benefits of DEP's current water and wastewater sustainability
   programs. DEP will use the water energy nexus tool to plan how these
   programs can be expanded in future years to best support the City's GHG
   reduction goals.},

Abstract = {Simple climate models can be used to estimate the global temperature
   response to increasing greenhouse gases. Changes in the energy balance
   of the global climate system are represented by equations that
   necessitate the use of uncertain parameters. The values of these
   parameters can be estimated from historical observations, model testing,
   and tuning to more complex models. Efforts have been made at estimating
   the possible ranges for these parameters. This study continues this
   process, but demonstrates two new constraints. Previous studies have
   shown that land-ocean temperature differences are only weakly correlated
   with global mean temperature for natural internal climate variations.
   Hence, these temperature differences provide additional information that
   can be used to help constrain model parameters. In addition, an ocean
   heat content ratio can also provide a further constraint. A pulse
   response technique was used to identify relative parameter sensitivity
   which confirmed the importance of climate sensitivity and ocean vertical
   diffusivity, but the land-ocean warming ratio and the land-ocean heat
   exchange coefficient were also found to be important. Experiments
   demonstrate the utility of the land-ocean temperature difference and
   ocean heat content ratio for setting parameter values. This work is
   based on investigations with MAGICC (Model for the Assessment of
   Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change) as the simple climate model.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy sources (wind energy, solar energy, hydroelectricity,
   ocean energy, geothermal energy, biomass and biofuels) are alternatives
   to fossil fuel that help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diversify
   energy supplies and reduce dependency on markets of unsustainable and
   volatile fossil fuels, particularly oil and gas. Wind energy is one of
   the renewable energy sources and is considered to be self-renewable as
   it is the result of the Sun's activity. Using wind energy is a rapidly
   developing industry today, and more and more wind turbines are installed
   worldwide every year, land-based wind turbines being more widespread
   than offshore ones. In Latvia, spread of land-based wind parks is
   hampered by unsettled land ownership rights, while the deployment of
   wind parks in the sea is a new field for all Baltic States. The
   neighbouring countries Estonia and Lithuania have developed their own
   projects for offshore wind parks, therefore the topicality of the
   development of wind farms in the territorial waters of Latvia has also
   increased. Experts have proposed best options and their locations. When
   assessing possibilities for development of wind parks and their
   capacity, the following economic factors were evaluated: construction
   and connection costs, potential operational costs and energy prices. The
   aim of this study is to develop the methodology for calculating the area
   of a potential wind park by considering the safety distance to shipping
   routes and height of the wind turbines, as well as for calculating the
   potential capacity of a wind park.},

Title = {On the feasibility of managed retreat in the Wadden Sea of
   Schleswig-Holstein},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Sea embankments along the mainland coastline in the Schleswig-Holstein
   Wadden Sea safeguard 130,000 people and 19 billion euro of capital
   assets from flooding during storm surges. Due to climate change induced
   sea-level rise, these defences will become exposed to higher storm
   surges and adaptation becomes inevitable. As an alternative to
   strengthening, managed retreat is discussed in literature as a coastal
   risk management option for climate change adaptation. Based on an
   evaluation of examples from the Wadden Sea, this paper elaborates
   managed retreat as alternative climate change adaptation from a coastal
   risk management perspective. This paper concludes that, conform the
   principles of integrated coastal zone management, one precondition for
   successful implementation of managed retreat is local acceptance. With
   respect to natural resilience to sea-level rise, managed retreat may
   counteract the loss of Wadden Sea structures and habitats due to coastal
   squeeze. However, the effectiveness depends on the surface elevation in
   the opened polder. If large volumes of sediment are needed to restore a
   natural elevation, regional resilience against SLR-induced drowning may
   deteriorate. With respect to coastal flood risk management in
   Schleswig-Holstein, opened polders have no significance as flood
   retention rooms and managed retreat does not reduce the hazard of
   flooding in surrounding polders. Further, removal of primary embankments
   requires large efforts to secure flood safety in adjacent polders. Under
   certain conditions, removal or opening of embankments may constitute
   sustainable coastal risk management, e.g., if retreat leads to a shorter
   line of defence or if other win-win-situations like securing of NATURA
   2000 coherence arise.},

Title = {Radiative effect of ozone change on stratosphere-troposphere exchange},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {The potential radiative impact of ozone changes on
   stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) is investigated by a series of
   climate model simulations. The impact of an arbitrary 15\% O-3 change on
   temperature, stratospheric water vapor, and cross-tropopause mass flux
   are compared to the corresponding effects from a doubling of atmospheric
   CO2. Our analysis shows that a 15\% global O-3 decrease can cause a
   maximum cooling of 2.4 K in the stratosphere and similar to 7.2\%
   increase in the tropical upwelling. This cooling also results in a
   higher tropical tropopause and lower tropopause temperatures, and hence
   less stratospheric water vapor and smaller amplitude of the so-called
   tape recorder signal. A global 15\% O-3 increase gives rise to similar
   to 2.1 K stratospheric warming and similar to 4\% decrease in the
   tropical upwelling. This O-3 increase results in more water vapor
   entering the stratosphere owing to a lower tropopause and higher
   tropopause temperatures. The effect of a +/- 15\% change in O-3 below
   100 hPa is relatively small. However, the effect of a 15\% O-3 increase
   between 200 and 70 hPa is similar to that of a 15\% O-3 increase through
   the whole domain, suggesting that ozone increases in the UTLS dominate
   the impacts on temperature and tropical upwelling. Sea surface
   temperature (SST) changes associated with increasing atmospheric
   greenhouse gases (GHG) have a profound impact on the STE. Without
   corresponding SST changes, the radiative effects of the CO2 doubling on
   the STE is less significant than a global 15\% O-3 increase. When the
   SST changes are considered in the doubled CO2 experiment, the tropical
   upwelling is significantly increased (by 20.4\%) with a much higher, but
   warmer, tropopause.},

Title = {Technical and Economical Evaluation and GHG Analysis of Wind Power
   Generation in Four Sites Using Different Weibull Parameters},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1697-1708},
Abstract = {Four sites close to the Libyan coast were selected for technical and
   economical assessment of wind power generation using real measured wind
   data. The assessment was carried out using the Weibull distribution
   function and the Weibull parameters were calculated using three
   different methods; graphical method (GM), empirical method (EM) and
   maximum likelihood method (MLM). Error analyses using various techniques
   were conducted to check for the validity of the different Weibull
   methods used. The technical assessment includes the calculations of the
   annual energy production (AEP), capacity factor (C-f) and greenhouse gas
   emission (GHG) reduction. The estimated annual energy production was
   used in the calculation of the present value of cost which estimates the
   cost of each kWh of electricity produced by a certain wind turbine. The
   effect of the annual greenhouse gas emission reduction on the cost
   analysis was also considered. The results have shown the electricity
   cost of all the sites is below the world average electricity price.
   Using different Weibull parameters have noticeable effects on the
   technical and economical estimations of wind power production. The MLM
   method yields higher AEP estimation compared to the other methods for
   all the sites. On the other hand, GM method gives less estimation for
   the AEP compared to the other methods for all the sites. Adding the GHG
   reduction income into the electricity cost calculations decreases it by
   an average of 18\%.},

Title = {A swift turnaround? Abating shipping greenhouse gas emissions via port
   call optimization},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Waiting times for trucks, trains, airplanes and ships in service
   represent apparent transport system inefficiencies, and measures to
   reduce these may have the potential to abate transport GHG emissions. In
   international shipping, transportation researchers have pointed out that
   reduced waiting time in association with port calls holds such promise.
   We explore the potential for GHG abatement through port call
   optimization, focusing on crews and their employers the shipping
   companies. Adding new empirical evidence to the transportation
   literature, we confirm the existence of idle time during port calls, and
   go beyond this in describing the causes for it. We show how several port
   stakeholders, including government officials, limit the crews' and
   shipping companies' room for maneuver in relation to port calls. We also
   show why the process of reducing waiting time in shipping is more
   complex than that for onshore transport modes, where real-time traffic
   information guides drivers' route choices, and reduces congestion and
   waiting time. Our findings have implications for both policy makers and
   transportation research.},

Title = {Country-level potential of carbon sequestration and environmental
   benefits by utilizing crop residues for biochar implementation},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {282},
Number = {B},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Conversion of biomass into biofuel and biochar with a subsequent soil
   storage is assumed as a prospective strategy of reducing atmospheric CO2
   concentrations. However, substantial uncertainties exist in this field
   regarding the country-level potential of biochar carbon sequestration,
   indirect effects of biochar implementation on overall environment, and
   dominating factors. This study conducted a life cycle assessment of
   country-wide incorporation of biochar in agriculture, and associated
   potential benefits. Results showed that over 920 kg CO2e
   (CO2-equivalent) could be sequestrated via converting 1 t of crop
   residues into biochar. As an example, based on crop residues
   availability statistics for China in 2014, the estimated annual carbon
   sequestration potential could be as high as 0.50 Pg CO2e (1 Pg = 1 x
   10(9) t). The most significant potential for biochar carbon
   sequestration was identified in the central south, east and northeast of
   China, which contributed 65\% of the national biochar carbon
   sequestration potential. The biochar system could also contribute to
   mitigation of the following environmental problems: marine aquatic
   biodiversity destruction, surface soil and water acidification, etc.
   Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biochar yield, carbon content in
   biochar, electricity conversion efficiencies of bio-oil and pyrolysis
   gas were the critical parameters determining the biochar system's
   overall carbon sequestration potential and environmental effects. This
   study provides guidance on evaluating biochars potential carbon
   sequestration capacity and comprehensive environmental impacts, as well
   as research and development needs.},

Title = {A multi-objective fuzzy linear programming model for optimization of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {702-710},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Natural gas is one of the most important sources of energy for many of
   the industrial and residential users in the world. It has a complex and
   huge supply chain which is in need of heavy investments in all the
   stages of exploration, extraction, production, transportation, storage
   and distribution. The aim of this study is evaluation and optimization
   of natural gas supply chain using a multi-objective multi-period fuzzy
   linear programming model considering economic and environmental
   objectives. In the proposed model, to deal with uncertainty, the
   parameters of problem including demand, capacity and cost are considered
   as fuzzy parameters. To solve the problem, a combination of
   possibilistic programming approach based on previous approach is used to
   verify and validate the model. A small-sized problem was solved using
   GAMS 23.2 software and sensitivity analysis is conducted on its
   parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
   presents a multi-objective fuzzy linear programming model for
   optimization of natural gas supply chain through a greenhouse gas
   reduction approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Blue carbon potential of coastal wetland restoration varies with
   inundation and rainfall},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {There is a growing interest in how the management of `blue carbon'
   sequestered by coastal wetlands can influence global greenhouse gas
   (GHG) budgets. A promising intervention is through restoring tidal
   exchange to impounded coastal wetlands for reduced methane (CH4)
   emissions. We monitored an impounded wetland's GHG flux (CO2 and CH4)
   prior to and following tidal reinstatement. We found that biogeochemical
   responses varied across an elevation gradient. The low elevation zone
   experienced a greater increase in water level and an associated greater
   marine transition in the sediment microbial community (16S rRNA) than
   the high elevation zone. The low elevation zone's GHG emissions had a
   reduced sustained global warming potential of 264 gm(-2) yr(-1) CO2-e
   over 100 years, and it increased to 351 gm(-2) yr(-1) with the removal
   of extreme rain events. However, emission benefits were achieved through
   a reduction in CO2 emissions, not CH4 emissions. Overall, the wetland
   shifted from a prior CH4 sink (-0.07 to -1.74 gCm(-2) yr(-1)) to a
   variable sink or source depending on the elevation site and rainfall.
   This highlights the need to consider a wetland's initial GHG emissions,
   elevation and future rainfall trends when assessing the efficacy of
   tidal reinstatement for GHG emission control.},

Abstract = {Given the inherent uncertainties in predicting how climate and
   environments will respond to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
   gases, it would be beneficial to society if science could identify
   geological analogues to the human race's current grand climate
   experiment. This has been a focus of the geological and palaeoclimate
   communities over the last 30 years, with many scientific papers claiming
   that intervals in Earth history can be used as an analogue for future
   climate change. Using a coupled ocean-atmosphere modelling approach, we
   test this assertion for the most probable pre-Quaternary candidates of
   the last 100 million years: the Mid-and Late Cretaceous, the
   Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), the Early Eocene, as well as
   warm intervals within the Miocene and Pliocene epochs. These intervals
   fail as true direct analogues since they either represent equilibrium
   climate states to a long-term CO2 forcing-whereas anthropogenic
   emissions of greenhouse gases provide a progressive (transient) forcing
   on climate-or the sensitivity of the climate system itself to CO2 was
   different. While no close geological analogue exists, past warm
   intervals in Earth history provide a unique opportunity to investigate
   processes that operated during warm (high CO2) climate states.
   Palaeoclimate and environmental reconstruction/modelling are
   facilitating the assessment and calculation of the response of global
   temperatures to increasing CO2 concentrations in the longer term
   (multiple centuries); this is now referred to as the Earth System
   Sensitivity, which is critical in identifying CO2 thresholds in the
   atmosphere that must not be crossed to avoid dangerous levels of climate
   change in the long term. Palaeoclimatology also provides a unique and
   independent way to evaluate the qualities of climate and Earth system
   models used to predict future climate.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and have been
   identified as sources of uncertainty in the global carbon budget. Here
   we introduce a recently established mesonet of eddy covariance towers in
   South Carolina and describe the sensor arrays and data workflow used to
   produce three site-years of flux observations in coastal ecosystems. The
   tower sites represent tidal salt marsh (US-HB1), mature longleaf pine
   forest (US-HB2), and longleaf pine restoration (replanted clearcut;
   US-HB3). Coastal ecosystems remain less represented in climate studies
   despite their potential to sequester large amounts of carbon. Our goal
   in publishing this open access dataset is to contribute observations in
   understudied coastal ecosystems to facilitate synthesis and modeling
   analyses that advance carbon cycle science.

Title = {The effect of potential future climate change on the marine methane

Pages = {5903-5917},

Abstract = {The marine gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) is sensitive to temperature
   changes at the seafloor, which likely affected the GHSZ in the past and
   may do so in the future in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emissions. A series of climate sensitivity and potential future climate
   change experiments are undertaken using the University of Victoria Earth
   System Climate Model (UVic ESCM) with resulting seafloor temperature
   changes applied to a simple time-dependent methane hydrate stability
   model. The global GHSZ responds significantly to elevated atmospheric
   CO2 over time scales of 10(3) yr with initial decreases of the GHSZ
   occurring after 200 yr in shallow high-latitude seafloor areas that
   underlie regions of sea ice loss. The magnitude and rate of GHSZ change
   is dependent primarily upon the thermal diffusivity of the seafloor and
   the magnitude and duration of the seafloor temperature increase. Using a
   simple approximation of the amount of carbon stored as hydrate in the
   GHSZ, estimates of carbon mobilized due to hydrate dissociation are made
   for several potential climate change scenarios.},

Title = {Maximising resilience to sea-level rise in urban coastal ecosystems
   through systematic conservation planning},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {221},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal cities and their natural environments are vulnerable to the
   impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise (SLR). Hard coastal
   defences play a key role in protecting at-risk urban coastal populations
   from flooding and erosion, but coastal ecosystems also play important
   roles in the overall sustainability and resilience of cities and urban
   centres by contributing to coastal protection. Conserving coastal
   ecosystems and maximising their resilience will ensure that urban
   coastal communities can continue to benefit from ecosystem services and
   improve their adaptive capacity to cope with adverse impacts in the
   future. Using the hyper-urbanised coast of Singapore as a case study, we
   modelled the resilience of coastal wetlands to SLR and integrated
   resilience in conservation plan-ning. We found that the responses of
   coastal habitats to rising sea level vary across the modelling periods.
   While there is a slight net gain in the extent of mangrove forests and
   tidal flats by the end of the century due to potential habitat
   conversion, the existing habitats will experience a loss in coverage.
   Highly modified coastlines associated with urbanisation impede the
   ability of existing wetlands to migrate landward, which is a key
   mechanism for coastal habitats to cope with rising sea levels.
   Systematic conservation planning can identify sites that are potentially
   resilient to SLR and incorporate factors that influence an ecosystem's
   capability to respond to change. Crucially, the relatively slow rates of
   SLR and persistence of coastal wetlands during the earlier half of this
   century present an opportunity to introduce management interventions
   aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.},

Volume = {464},
Number = {7286},
Pages = {271-274},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Halogen atoms and oxides are highly reactive and can profoundly affect
   atmospheric composition. Chlorine atoms can decrease the lifetimes of
   gaseous elemental mercury(1) and hydrocarbons such as the greenhouse gas
   methane(2). Chlorine atoms also influence cycles that catalytically
   destroy or produce tropospheric ozone(3), a greenhouse gas potentially
   toxic to plant and animal life. Conversion of inorganic chloride into
   gaseous chlorine atom precursors within the troposphere is generally
   considered a coastal or marine air phenomenon(4). Here we report
   mid-continental observations of the chlorine atom precursor nitryl
   chloride at a distance of 1,400km from the nearest coastline. We observe
   persistent and significant nitryl chloride production relative to the
   consumption of its nitrogen oxide precursors. Comparison of these
   findings to model predictions based on aerosol and precipitation
   composition data from long-term monitoring networks suggests nitryl
   chloride production in the contiguous USA alone is at a level similar to
   previous global estimates for coastal and marine regions(5). We also
   suggest that a significant fraction of tropospheric chlorine atoms(6)
   may arise directly from anthropogenic pollutants.},

Title = {From comparative risk assessment to multi-criteria decision analysis and

Abstract = {Environmental risk assessment and decision-making strategies over the
   last several decades have become increasingly more sophisticated,
   information-intensive, and complex, including such approaches as expert
   judgment, cost-benefit analysis, and toxicological risk assessment. One
   tool that has been used to support environmental decision-making is
   comparative risk assessment (CRA), but CRA lacks a structured method for
   arriving at an optimal project alternative. Multi-criteria decision
   analysis (MCDA) provides better-supported techniques for the comparison
   of project alternatives based on decision matrices, and it also provides
   structured methods for the incorporation of project stakeholders'
   opinions in the ranking of alternatives. We argue that the inherent
   uncertainty in our ability to predict ecosystem evolution and response
   to different management policies requires shifting from
   optimization-based management to an adaptive management paradigm. This
   paper brings together a multidisciplinary review of existing
   decision-making approaches at regulatory agencies in the United States
   and Europe and synthesizes state-of-the-art research in CRA, MCDA, and
   adaptive management methods applicable to environmental remediation and
   restoration projects. We propose a basic decision analytic framework
   that couples MCDA with adaptive management and its public participation
   and stakeholder value elicitation methods, and we demonstrate
   application of the framework to a realistic case study based on
   contaminated sediment management issues in the New York/New Jersey
   Harbor. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Pollution-tolerant invertebrates enhance greenhouse gas flux in urban
   wetlands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1852-1861},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {One of the goals of urban ecology is to link community structure to
   ecosystem function in urban habitats. Pollution-tolerant wetland
   invertebrates have been shown to enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) flux in
   controlled laboratory experiments, suggesting that they may influence
   urban wetland roles as sources or sinks of GHG. However, it is unclear
   if their effects can be detected in highly variable conditions in a
   field setting. Here we use an extensive data set on carbon dioxide
   (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux in sediment cores (n
   = 103) collected from 10 urban wetlands in Melbourne, Australia during
   summer and winter in order to test for invertebrate enhancement of GHG
   flux. We detected significant multiplicative enhancement effects of
   temperature, sediment carbon content, and invertebrate density on CH4
   and CO2 flux. Each doubling in density of oligochaete worms or large
   benthic invertebrates (oligochaete worms and midge larvae) corresponded
   to similar to 42\% and similar to 15\% increases in average CH4 and CO2
   flux, respectively. However, despite exceptionally high densities,
   invertebrates did not appear to enhance N2O flux. This was likely due to
   fairly high organic carbon content in sediments (range 2.1-12.6\%), and
   relatively low nitrate availability (median 1.96 mu mol/L NO3 -N), which
   highlights the context-dependent nature of community structural effects
   on ecosystem function. The invertebrates enhancing GHG flux in this
   study are ubiquitous, and frequently dominate faunal communities in
   impaired aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, invertebrate effects on CO2 and
   CH4 flux may be common in wetlands impacted by urbanization, and urban
   wetlands may make greater contributions to the total GHG budgets of
   cities if the negative impacts of urbanization on wetlands are left
   unchecked.},

Abstract = {This article presents governance and institutional strategies for
   climate-induced community relocations. In Alaska, repeated extreme
   weather events coupled with climate change-induced coastal erosion
   impact the habitability of entire communities. Community residents and
   government agencies concur that relocation is the only adaptation
   strategy that can protect lives and infrastructure. Community relocation
   stretches the financial and institutional capacity of existing
   governance institutions. Based on a comparative analysis of three
   Alaskan communities, Kivalina, Newtok, and Shishmaref, which have chosen
   to relocate, we examine the institutional constraints to relocation in
   the United States. We identify policy changes and components of a
   toolkit that can facilitate community-based adaptation when
   environmental events threaten people's lives and protection in place is
   not possible. Policy changes include amendment of the Stafford Act to
   include gradual geophysical processes, such as erosion, in the statutory
   definition of disaster and the creation of an adaptive governance
   framework to allow communities a continuum of responses from protection
   in place to community relocation. Key components of the toolkit are
   local leadership and integration of social and ecological well-being
   into adaptation planning.},

Title = {Dissemination and perception of adaptation co-benefits: Insights from
   the coastal area of Bangladesh},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The assessment and evaluation of co-benefits related to climate change
   policy has shifted from a mitigationcentric approach to also include
   adaptation. In 2017, the 23rd Conference of the Parties of the United
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change requested that Parties
   submit proposals for assessing adaptation co-benefits along with their
   adaptation and resilience strategies. However, adaptation co-benefits
   are not always noticed during the initial stage of risk reduction
   measures, and this can become a bottleneck for intervention. Against
   this backdrop, this research aims to explore how stakeholders recognize
   and communicate the co-benefits of adaptation interventions, by
   conducting a case study of Barguna Sadar, a shoreline upazila
   (subdistrict) in the southern part of Bangladesh that is highly
   vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This qualitative study
   involved focus group discussions and interviews with stakeholders. The
   results revealed a lack of awareness and understanding of adaptation
   co-benefits among community members, especially the intended
   beneficiaries, related to projects implemented by local and
   international non-government organizations. Insufficient communication
   prior to the implementation of adaptation projects was found to be the
   underlying cause of this lack of awareness. Improving public awareness
   of adaptation co-benefits has the potential to overcome the challenges
   posed by the adaptation paradox.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions of Lake Neusiedl, the westernmost European
   shallow steppe lake, were analysed to identify differences between the
   seasons of the years and between different locations in the pelagic zone
   and reed belt. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured in gas
   samples that had been recovered from the gas space of floating chambers
   operated as closed systems. Sampling periods covered all seasons except
   winter. Scaled up to the whole lake area (320 km(2)), the diffusive
   emissions of spring, summer and autumn totalled to about 79,500 t
   CO(2)e, disregarding bubble emissions, winter emissions and
   plant-mediated emissions. The emission sum consisted of about 57,000 t
   CO2, 760 t CH4, and 12 t N2O. Approximately one-third of the methane and
   carbon dioxide emissions originated in the pelagic zone and two-thirds
   in the reed belt (without plant emissions) whereas nitrous oxide
   emissions were similar in these two zones. An estimate of ebullitive
   emissions resulted in additional 1,765 t CH4 that predominantly
   originated in or near the reed belt from spring to autumn.},

Title = {The environmental impact from an offshore windfarm: Challenge and
   evaluation methodology based on an ecosystem approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {114},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Responding to pressure to combat climate change by cutting greenhouse
   gasses emission, Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) is currently the most
   developed of all the renewable energy options that are based in the
   marine environment. However, despite its perceived benefits, OWF
   construction will also lead to direct and indirect impacts on the
   ecosystem. Nonetheless, surprisingly few studies have sought to combine
   trophic web modelling tools with the framework of OWF impact assessment.
   The objective of this study was to develop a holistic and integrated
   ecosystem approach as a complementary methodology to the traditional OWF
   environmental impact assessment. To that end, trophic web models coupled
   with Ecological Network Analysis indices were used to study the
   structure and functioning of three sedimentary types (sandy gravel,
   gravelly sand, and medium sand), identified on the proposed site for a
   new offshore wind farm at Dieppe-Le Treport (Normandy coast). The
   results from this study demonstrated that the trophic structures are
   strongly linked to the sedimentary types. The results also highlighted
   the existence of a maturity gradient moving between the three types of
   sediment identified. This study underlined the challenge and the need to
   have detailed biomass data on a maximum of biological compartments to
   enable an effective OWF impact assessment. We strongly consider that our
   approach will provide useful and practical information for environmental
   decision-makers and stakeholders. The same approach can be applied to
   other new OWF constructions in European or international waters.},

Abstract = {Growing concern over the contribution of freshwater reservoirs to
   increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and the
   relevance of long-term continuous measurements has led Fisheries and
   Oceans Canada, in conjunction with Manitoba Hydro,to develop continuous
   GHG monitors. Continuous water pCO(2), pCH(4), and pO(2) measurements
   were gathered to estimate gas fluxes in one temperate reservoir
   (Riviere-des-Prairies) and two boreal reservoirs (Eastmain-1 and
   Robert-Bourassa) in Quebec, and in four boreal reservoirs (Grand Rapids,
   Jenpeg, Kettle, and McArthur Falls) in Manitoba, Canada. Mean daily CO2
   fluxes ranged between 7 and 14 mmolCO(2) . m(-2) . d(-1) in Manitoba and
   between 15 and 55 mmolCO(2) . m(-2) . d(-1) in Quebec. Summertime
   episodes of water undersaturation in CO2 were observed at Jenpeg,
   Kettle, and McArthur, suggesting higher productivities of these systems
   compared to the other systems studied. Mean daily CH4 fluxes ranged
   between 0 and 69 mu molCH(4) . m(-2) . d(-1) in Manitoba and between 9
   and 48 mu molCH(4) . m(-2) . d(-1) in Quebec. Comparisons of results
   obtained in the Eastmain-1 area using automated monitors, floating
   chambers or dissolved gas analyses over multiple-station field campaigns
   demonstrated that a continuous GHG monitor at a single sampling station
   provided representative and robust results.},

Volume = {21},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Although emission controls for greenhouse gases may limit their future
   rise, there is a finite chance that a substantial fraction of the
   available fossil fuel reservoir will be utilized. Geochemical models
   suggest that the atmospheric perturbation would then last for thousands
   of years. We use a well-calibrated energy balance model, coupled to an
   upwelling-diffusion deep-ocean model, to estimate the temperature
   effects of such unrestricted emissions. We calculate that greenhouse
   warming will peak between approximately 2200-2400, with a global
   temperature increase 4-13-degrees-C greater than present. The high-end
   estimate is as much as 100\% larger than estimates of the temperature
   increase for the ice-free Cretaceous (100 Ma) warm period. Warming of as
   much as 2-5-degrees-C persists as late as 10,000 years AP. The
   `'out-year'' projections are larger than Milankovitch effects occurring
   over the same interval, indicating that unrestricted emissions could
   lead to conditions in which anthropogenic warming dominates climate
   variation for the next 10,000 years.},

Title = {Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Land Reclamation Development in
   Indonesia},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Land reclamation activities can, directly and indirectly, impact the
   environment. Examples of direct effects include alterations in coastal
   geomorphology, variations in the chemical content of water and changes
   in biological composition along the littoral zone. The indirect impacts
   can involve geological changes and increase vulnerability to natural
   disasters. Reclamation processes also result in greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions from vehicle and machinery fuel use and through the release of
   carbon stored in vegetation, soils and sediment in mangroves and
   seagrass ecosystems. Considering the global extent of land reclamation,
   the scale of these emissions is likely to be of widespread interest. The
   case of Jakarta Bay provides useful insights that can contribute to the
   improved environmental management of kindred land development projects
   in Indonesia and other parts of Asia. More than 5,100 ha of new land
   mass is planned from the Jakarta Bay reclamation. Preliminary analysis
   suggests that 30\% of the planned area will require more than 150.7
   million cubic metres of sand sourced from 8,628 ha of marine quarry
   area. In this study, we examine the sources of GHG emissions in these
   activities and the potential opportunities available to reduce them. The
   audience for this paper includes policymakers, environmental
   practitioners, city developers and postgraduate scholars dealing with
   land reclamation or other major infrastructure developments.},

Journal = {APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {162},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Fugitive methane emissions from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply
   chain have revealed uncertainty in the overall greenhouse gas emissions
   reduction associated with the use of LNG in heavy-duty vehicles and
   marine shipping. Methane is the main constituent of natural gas and a
   potent greenhouse gas. Recent measurements have shown that the LNG
   offloading process had the largest contribution to methane emissions in
   the refueling portion of the supply chain. However, there are limited
   studies analyzing the LNG offloading process for small-scale
   applications. This study investigates six methods used to offload LNG
   from a tanker truck to an LNG refueling station and their contribution
   to methane emissions. A verified thermodynamic model is created by
   comparing numerical results with the experimental data collected from an
   LNG offloading process in a refueling station. The modeling results show
   that the LNG transfer by using a pressure buildup unit causes methane
   emissions as high as 104 g/kg LNG. In contrast, LNG transfer by using a
   pump and controlled pressure buildup unit provides the lowest risk of
   methane venting. Also, the results of parametric study indicate that
   rigid foam insulation can be considered as an economical alternative to
   vacuum jacketed pipes in LNG refueling stations.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the climate consequences of ``delayed near-term
   action{''} and ``staged accession{''} scenarios for limiting warming
   below 2 degrees C. The stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations at
   low levels requires a large-scale transformation of the energy system.
   Depending on policy choices, there are alternative pathways to reach
   this objective. An ``optimal{''} path, as emerging from energy-economic
   modeling, implies immediate action with stringent emission reductions,
   while the currently proposed international policies translate into
   reduction delays and higher near-term emissions. In our delayed action
   scenarios, low stabilization levels need thus to be reached from
   comparatively high 2030 emission levels. Negative consequences are
   higher economic cost as explored in accompanying papers and
   significantlythigher mid-term warming, as indicated by a rate of warming
   50\% higher by the 2040s. By contrast, both mid- and long-term warming
   are significantly higher in another class of scenarios of staged
   accession that lets some regions embark on emission reductions, while
   others follow later, with conservation of carbon-price pathways
   comparable to the optimal scenarios. Not only is mid-term warming higher
   in staged accession cases, but the probability to exceed 2 degrees C in
   the 21st century increases by a factor of 1.5. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Title = {Informing policy to protect coastal coral reefs: Insight from a global

Volume = {85},

Abstract = {The continuing degradation of coral reefs has serious consequences for
   the provision of ecosystem goods and services to local and regional
   communities. While climate change is considered the most serious risk to
   coral reefs, agricultural pollution threatens approximately 25\% of the
   total global reef area with further increases in sediment and nutrient
   fluxes projected over the next 50 years. Here, we aim to inform coral
   reef management using insights learned from management examples that
   were successful in reducing agricultural pollution to coastal
   ecosystems. We identify multiple examples reporting reduced fluxes of
   sediment and nutrients at end-of-river, and associated declines in
   nutrient concentrations and algal biomass in receiving coastal waters.
   Based on the insights obtained, we recommend that future protection of
   coral reef ecosystems demands policy focused on desired ecosystem
   outcomes, targeted regulatory approaches, up-scaling of watershed
   management, and long-term maintenance of scientifically robust
   monitoring programs linked with adaptive management. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {The power demand of many islands in Southeast Asia is projected to
   increase rapidly over the next decades. Especially on island systems,
   where the installation of large-scale fossil-fired power plants is not
   appropriate, renewable energy sources could contribute to an
   independent, economic and sustainable power supply. To analyze the
   cost-effective integration of renewables on large islands, a power
   supply optimization model is developed in this paper. The model covers
   hourly load profiles with least cost of transmission, generation and
   battery storage and is applied to a case study on Belitung Island in
   Indonesia. In the case study, intermittent renewable energy sources are
   integrated most cost-effectively using large-scale centralized (> 1 MWh
   of storage capacity) battery storage rather than small-scale,
   decentralized battery systems. The comparably low CO2 abatement costs in
   the case study range between 6.0 and 32.9 USD per ton of CO2 and
   demonstrate the cost-efficiency of integrating renewables into island
   systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {Drivers of greenhouse gas emissions from standing dead trees in ghost

Abstract = {Coastal freshwater forested wetlands are rapidly transitioning from
   forest to marsh, leaving behind many standing dead trees (snags) in
   areas often called `ghost forests'. Snags can act as conduits for soil
   produced greenhouse gases (GHG) and can also be sources as they
   decompose. Thus, snags have the potential to contribute GHGs to the
   atmosphere, but emissions are not well understood. We assessed GHG
   emissions (carbon dioxide-CO2, methane-CH4, and nitrous oxide-N2O) from
   snags and soils in five ghost forests along a salinity gradient on the
   coast of North Carolina, USA. Mean (+/- SE) soil GHG fluxes (416 +/- 44
   mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 5.9 +/- 1.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and 0.1 +/- 0.06 mg
   N2O m(-2) h(-1)) were similar to 4 times greater than mean snag GHGs
   (116 +/- 15 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 0.3 +/- 0.09 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and
   0.04 +/- 0.009 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)). Hydrological conditions and salinity
   influenced soil GHG fluxes between the two field campaigns, but snags
   were less predictable and more variable. Snag and soil CO2/N2O fluxes
   were influenced by similar environmental parameters. The drivers for
   soil and snag CH4 however, were often not the same and at times
   oppositely correlated. Our results illustrate the need to further
   research into the drivers and importance of GHG emissions from snags,
   and the need to include tree stems into ecosystem GHG research.},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts are expected to increase pressure upon coastal

   to the question whether long-term strategies might bring advantages over
   continuing present coastal management practice during the next 200
   years. Comparing long-term coastal management strategies is surrounded
   by both physical and sociological uncertainties, impeding this
   comparisons straightforwardness. A new assessment methodology has been
   set LIP, accounting for these uncertainties in impacts of optional
   long-term coastal management strategies. Applying this new assessment
   framework to a case study for the Dutch coast shows that assessments of
   long-term coastal management strategies differentiate sufficiently for
   comparison, despite all uncertainties involved.},

Title = {A new interactive chemistry-climate model: 2. Sensitivity of the middle
   atmosphere to ozone depletion and increase in greenhouse gases and
   implications for recent stratospheric cooling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {108},

Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {{[} 1] The sensitivity of the middle atmosphere circulation to ozone
   depletion and increase in greenhouse gases is assessed by performing
   multiyear simulations with a chemistry-climate model. Three simulations
   with fixed boundary conditions have been carried out: one simulation for
   the near-past ( 1960) and two simulations for the near-present ( 1990
   and 2000) conditions, including changes in greenhouse gases, in total
   organic chlorine, and in average sea surface temperatures. Changes in
   ozone are simulated interactively by the coupled model. It is found that
   in the stratosphere, ozone decreases, and that in the Antarctic, the
   ozone hole develops in both the 1990 and the 2000 simulations but not in
   the 1960 simulation, as observed. The simulated temperature decreases in
   the stratosphere and mesosphere from the near past to the present, with
   the largest changes at the stratopause and at the South Pole in the
   lower stratosphere, in agreement with current knowledge of temperature
   trends. In the Arctic lower stratosphere, a cooling in March with
   respect to the 1960 simulation is found only for the 2000 simulation.
   Wave activity emerging from the troposphere is found to be comparable in
   the winters of the 1960 and 2000 simulations, suggesting that ozone
   depletion and greenhouse gases increase contribute to the 2000 - 1960
   March cooling in the Arctic lower stratosphere. These results therefore
   provide support to the interpretation that the extreme low temperatures
   observed in March in the last decade can arise from radiative and
   chemical processes, although other factors cannot be ruled out. The
   comparison of the 1960 and 2000 simulations shows an increase in
   downwelling in the mesosphere at the time of cooling in the lower
   stratosphere ( in March in the Arctic; in October in the Antarctic). The
   mesospheric increase in downwelling can be explained as the response of
   the gravity waves to the stronger winds associated with the cooling in
   the lower stratosphere. Planetary waves appear to contribute to the
   downward shift of the increased downwelling, with a delay of about a
   month. The increase in dynamical heating associated with the increased
   downwelling may limit the cooling and the strengthening of the lower
   stratospheric polar vortex from above, facilitating ozone recovery and
   providing a negative dynamical feedback. In both the Arctic and
   Antarctic the cooling from ozone depletion is found to affect the area
   covered with polar stratospheric clouds in spring, which is
   substantially increased from the 1960 to the 2000 simulations. In turn,
   increased amounts of polar stratospheric clouds can facilitate further
   ozone depletion in the 2000 simulation.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of climate change on the decision of
   farmers to engage or not to engage in livestock activities and also on
   the choice of different livestock species in Kenya. To this end,
   cross-sectional household level data supplemented by long-term averages
   of climate data are used. The probit model is employed to derive the
   response of the probability of engaging in livestock activities to
   climate change. Probit and multivariate probit methods are employed to
   model the choice of different livestock species. Atmosphere-ocean global
   circulation models are used to project the impact of different climate
   scenarios on the probability of engaging in livestock activities and
   also of adopting different livestock species according to variations in
   climate. The results suggest that farmers adapt livestock management
   decisions to climate change. At low levels of temperature increase, the
   probability of engaging in livestock activities falls, but at higher
   levels of climate change, the probability rises. The results further
   show that as it gets hotter, farmers change their livestock choices from
   dairy cattle and sheep to beef cattle and goats.},

Title = {The Sleipner storage site: Capillary flow modeling of a layered CO2
   plume requires fractured shale barriers within the Utsira Formation},

Abstract = {To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it
   is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage
   site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste
   repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas
   condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a
   saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the
   coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of
   captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume
   ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to
   reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has
   been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and
   electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2
   layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion
   percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The
   approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to
   match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation
   indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only
   replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale
   barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale
   barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very
   unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress
   of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must
   pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of
   regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded
   approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are
   sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2
   ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in
   the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by
   Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Shipping, which accounts for 2.6\% of global carbon dioxide emissions,
   is urged to find clean energy solutions to decarbonise the industry and
   achieve the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emission targets by 2050. It is generally believed that hydrogen
   will play a vital role in enabling the use of renewable energy sources.
   However, issues related with hydrogen storage and distribution currently
   obstruct its implementation. Alternatively, an energy-carrier such as
   ammonia with its carbon neutral chemical formula, high energy density
   and established production, transportation and storage infrastructure
   could provide a practical short-term next generation power solution for
   maritime industry. This paper presents an overview of the
   state-of-the-art and emerging technologies for decarbonising shipping
   using ammonia as a fuel, covering general properties of ammonia, the
   current production technologies with an emphasis on green synthesis
   methods, onboard storage and ways to generate power from it.},

Abstract = {Permafrost thawing in lowland Arctic tundra results in a polygonal
   patterned landscape and the formation of numerous small ponds. These
   ponds emit biologically mediated carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).
   Their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are variable, for reasons that are
   not well understood. Emissions are related to a balance between GHG
   producers and consumers, as well as to physical properties of the water
   column controlling gas exchange rates with the atmosphere. Here, we
   investigated the bacterial diversity of polygonal and runnel ponds, two
   geomorphologically distinct pond types commonly found in continuous
   permafrost regions. Using a combination of 16S rRNA Sanger sequencing
   and high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we found that bacterial
   communities in overlying waters were clearly dominated by carbon
   degraders and were similar in both pond types, despite their variable
   physical and chemical properties. However, surface sediment communities
   in the two pond types were significantly different. Polygonal pond
   sediment was colonized by carbon degraders (46-29 \%), cyanobacteria
   (20-27 \%) that take up CO2 and produce oxygen, and methanotrophs (11-20
   \%) that consume CH4 and require oxygen. In contrast, cyanobacteria were
   effectively absent from the surface sediment of runnel ponds, which in
   addition to carbon degraders (65-81 \%), were colonized by purple
   non-sulfur bacteria (5-21 \%), and by fewer methanotrophs (1-5 \%). The
   link between the methanotrophic community and the type of ponds could
   potentially be used to improve upscale estimates of GHG emissions based
   on landscape morphology in such remote regions.},

Title = {CLIMATE INSTABILITY ON TIDALLY LOCKED EXOPLANETS},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {743},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Feedbacks that can destabilize the climates of synchronously rotating
   rocky planetsmay arise on planets with strong day-night surface
   temperature contrasts. Earth-like habitable planets maintain stable
   surface liquid water over geologic time. This requires equilibrium
   between the temperature-dependent rate of greenhouse-gas consumption by
   weathering, and greenhouse-gas resupply by other processes. Detected
   small-radius exoplanets, and anticipated M-dwarf habitable-zone rocky
   planets, are expected to be in synchronous rotation (tidally locked). In
   this paper, we investigate two hypothetical feedbacks that can
   destabilize climate on planets in synchronous rotation. (1) If small
   changes in pressure alter the temperature distribution across a planet's
   surface such that the weathering rate goes up when the pressure goes
   down, a runaway positive feedback occurs involving increasing weathering
   rate near the substellar point, decreasing pressure, and increasing
   substellar surface temperature. We call this feedback enhanced
   substellar weathering instability (ESWI). (2) When decreases in pressure
   increase the fraction of surface area above the melting point (through
   reduced advective cooling of the substellar point), and the
   corresponding increase in volume of liquid causes net dissolution of the
   atmosphere, a further decrease in pressure will occur. This substellar
   dissolution feedback can also cause a runaway climate shift. We use an
   idealized energy balance model to map out the conditions under which
   these instabilities may occur. In this simplified model, the weathering
   runaway can shrink the habitable zone and cause geologically rapid
   10(3)-fold atmospheric pressure shifts within the habitable zone. Mars
   may have undergone a weathering runaway in the past. Substellar
   dissolution is usually a negative feedback or weak positive feedback on
   changes in atmospheric pressure. It can only cause runaway changes for
   small, deep oceans and highly soluble atmospheric gases.
   Both instabilities are suppressed if the atmosphere has a high radiative
   efficiency. Our results are most relevant for atmospheres that are thin,
   have low greenhouse-gas radiative efficiency, and have a principal
   greenhouse gas that is also the main constituent of the atmosphere. ESWI
   also requires land near the substellar point, and tectonic resurfacing
   (volcanism, mountain-building) is needed for large jumps in pressure.
   These results identify a new pathway by which habitable-zone planets can
   undergo rapid climate shifts and become uninhabitable.},

Title = {The life-cycle energy and environmental emissions of a typical offshore
   wind farm in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {316-324},

Abstract = {China's vast untapped offshore wind energy and the concentration of
   electricity consumers in coastal regions make offshore wind power a
   promising solution to the country's cleaner power transition. However,
   the potential energy and environmental emissions of offshore wind farms
   have not been thoroughly investigated. Thus, this study employed a
   process-based life cycle inventory (LCI) model to calculate the
   life-cycle energy and emissions of offshore wind power in China based on
   the country's first offshore wind energy project. Results showed that
   the life-cycle energy of the studied wind farm was 2.28E+09 MJ or 0.39
   MJ/kwh, with emission intensities of 25.5 g CO2-eq/kWh for GHG, 0.02
   g/kWh for PM2.5, 0.06 g/kWh for SO2 and 0.09 g/kWh for NOx. The
   life-cycle footprints are dominated by the manufacture of wind turbines
   and foundation materials production. Compared to onshore wind farms,
   offshore wind power plants usually have greater life-cycle electricity
   yields, but their levelized energy and environmental footprints are less
   favorable. The green manufacturing of China's steel sector, and
   scientific operation and maintenance programs of wind facilities
   contribute to greening offshore wind power. Results of this study
   facilitate robust policy making of government authorities and contribute
   to the green deployment of offshore wind technologies in China. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Global average temperature has increased in the last one hundred years.
   This increase in temperature is labeled as global warming, which is due
   to different greenhouse gases that pollute the atmosphere. Carbon
   dioxide is the largest contributor, its main source being from the
   electricity production sector. There has been discussion by experts and
   organizations as to whether zero carbon dioxide emissions in this sector
   is possible by 2050. This paper studies and analyzes wind, nuclear, and
   hydroelectric power production to accomplish this goal. It also examines
   and selects the ideal turbine (onshore and offshore) for each year from
   2018 to 2050 using estimated research and development. The scope focuses
   on night time base load to exclude solar energy from this study. The
   strategy represents the entire United States by focusing on 20
   metropolitan areas (Case Shiller Metropolitan Areas). Due to time
   constraints, only a select 5 of the 20 Case Shiller metropolitan areas
   will be modeled. Using Mathematical Programming Language for linear
   programming, we optimized the number of each alternative in each region
   modeled. An economic model was used from National Renewable Energy
   Laboratory to estimate the job growth for the system in the areas. The
   analysis provides the cost and economic impact that the system will have
   on the regions. It is recommended that a method to levitate the price of
   the system is needed which can be in the form of carbon tax or
   governmental subsidies.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in order to examine the environmental and the
   mechanical properties of two fibre-reinforced concretes, namely Alfa
   fibres and polypropylene fibres. In this study, the life cycle
   assessment (LCA) method was used, since this process is likely to
   quantify the environmental impacts of concrete or concrete production
   industry. The environmental analyses showed that alfa fibres generate
   fewer impacts than polypropylene fibres. The results revealed that the
   use of the Alfa fibres reinforced concretes is efficient solution for
   climate change mitigation, for the reason that they generate: (1) a less
   fossil fuel depletion; (2) produce lower emissions of greenhouse gases;
   (3) develop a lesser atmospheric emission of particles, (4) reduce the
   marine ecotoxicity; and (5) participate in decreasing the photochemical
   oxydation.},

Abstract = {Climate projections(1-3) and observations over recent decades(4,5)
   indicate that precipitation in subtropical latitudes declines in
   response to anthropogenic warming, with significant implications for
   food production and population sustainability. However, this conclusion
   is derived from emissions scenarios with rapidly increasing radiative
   forcing to the year 2100(1,2), which may represent very different
   conditions from both past and future `equilibrium' warmer climates.
   Here, we examine multi-century future climate simulations and show that
   in the Southern Hemisphere subtropical drying ceases soon after global
   temperature stabilizes. Our results suggest that twenty-first century
   Southern Hemisphere subtropical drying is not a feature of warm climates
   per se, but is primarily a response to rapidly rising forcing and global
   temperatures, as tropical sea-surface temperatures rise more than
   southern subtropical sea-surface temperatures under transient warming.
   Subtropical drying may therefore be a temporary response to rapid
   warming: as greenhouse gas concentrations and global temperatures
   stabilize, Southern Hemisphere subtropical regions may experience
   positive precipitation trends.},

Title = {Human activities changed organic carbon transport in Chinese rivers
   during 2004-2018},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Rivers serve as regulators of global climate by releasing greenhouse
   gases, burying particulate carbon, and connecting different ecosystem
   carbon pools. However, long-term organic carbon (OC) transport features
   across different Asian rivers are not well known due to unavailable
   data. Based on routinely monitored environmental and hydrological data
   during 2004-2018, this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations
   in dissolved (DOC) and particulate OC (POC) transport across 41 rivers
   in China. Across different rivers, both DOC (1.35 - 16.8 mg/L) and POC
   (0.27 - 4.48 mg/L) concentrations covered wide ranges. The DOC content
   was high in the north and low in the south, with significantly higher (t
   test, p < 0.01) values for rivers north of 30N (5.39 +/- 3.66 mg/L vs.
   2.39 +/- 1.14 mg/L). Human activities greatly influenced the riverine
   DOC and POC distributions. The riverine ammonia nitrogen (NH+ 4-N)
   content was positively correlated with DOC (r = 0.81 and p < 0.01) and
   explained 85.59\% of its spatial variation. High vegetation coverage had
   significant effects on decreasing the riverine POC content, with r
   =-0.55 and p < 0.05. During 2004-2018, water pollution prevention and
   control strategies decreased DOC concentrations in 60.98\% of rivers;
   meanwhile, anthropogenic vegetation restoration and dam construction led
   to POC content decreases in 90.48\% of rivers. Importantly, along with
   DOC and POC changes, increasing DOC/POC ratios were found in 90.48\% of
   the rivers, with 42.86\% being significant, which indicated that Chinese
   rivers are losing their Asian features of low DOC/POC ratios due to
   artificial disturbance. This study is significant for accurately
   quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, carbon burial, and OC export to
   estuaries by Chinese rivers.},

Abstract = {Finding renewable alternative energy resources for fossil fuels
   substitution has become very vital due to the serious challenges faced
   by humankind at present such as environmental pollution, greenhouse gas
   emissions, climate change, crude oil price volatility, and fossil fuels
   exhaustion. Macroalgae (seaweeds) are fast-growing marine plants,
   providing several harvests per year without the need for arable land,
   fertilizer, and fresh water. Various types of ecosystems like coral
   reefs, mangrove forests, and rocky shores can efficiently host the
   seaweeds production systems. These characteristics have made them highly
   suitable feedstocks for third-generation bioethanol production. Iran has
   a huge potential in renewable energy resources owing to its unique
   geographical location and climatic features. The country borders with
   the Caspian Sea in the north and with the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of
   Oman in the south. Seaweeds farming can also play a key role in
   mitigating air pollution, increasing employment rate, sustaining fossil
   fuel resources, bioremediating contaminated water, and improving marine
   ecosystem in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. In the present
   article, macroalgae diversity, cultivation, and their conversion and
   upgrading technologies into bioethanol in Iran are scrutinized and
   discussed. Finally, the potential of Bushehr (the Persian Gulf) and
   Chabahar (the Gulf of Oman) coastlines for macroalgae cultivation is
   investigated. These locations receive the annual solar radiation in the
   range of 1680-1753 kWh/m(2) and the photosynthetically active radiation
   (PAR) in the range of 2.6-2.71 GJ/m(2)/year with 3051-3311.9 h sunshine
   per annum. Furthermore, the nutrient-rich and calm water with relatively
   stable pH, salinity, and temperature make these coasts suitable for
   macroalgae farming. A potential yield up to 147-153 t/ha/year can be
   obtained if proper native/engineered species, well-situated sites, and
   compatible cultivation techniques are selected.},

Abstract = {The soils of the Mediterranean Basin are the products of soil processes
   that have been governed by a unique convergence of highly differentiated
   natural and anthropogenic drivers. These soils are expected to be
   dramatically affected by future climate and societal changes. These
   changes imply that suitable adaptive management strategies for these
   resources cannot simply be transposed from experiments that are
   performed in other regions of the world. Following a framework that
   considers the chain of ``drivers-soil process-soil capital-ecosystem
   services/disservices,{''} the paper review the research undertaken in
   the Mediterranean area on three types of Mediterranean soil degradation
   than can be expected under global change: (i) soil losses due to the
   increase of drought and torrential rainfall; (ii) soil salinization due
   the increase of droughts, irrigation, and sea level; and (iii) soil
   carbon stock depletion with the increase of temperature and droughts.
   The possible strategies for mitigating each of these degradations have
   been largely addressed and are still studied in current research
   projects. They should include changes in agricultural practices, soil
   water management, and vegetal material. As a pre-requisite for the
   site-specific adaptations of such mitigation strategies within viable
   Mediterranean agrosystems, it is highlighted that methodological
   advances are necessary in integrated assessment of agricultural systems
   and in finer resolution soil mapping.},

Title = {Reductions in cost and greenhouse gas emissions with new bulk ship
   designs enabled by the Panama Canal expansion},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {341-349},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Historically, fuel costs have been small compared with the fixed costs
   of a bulk vessel, its crewing and management. Today, however, fuel
   accounts for more than 50\% of the total costs. In combination with an
   introduction of stricter energy efficiency requirements for new vessels,
   this might make design improvement a necessity for all new bulk vessels.
   This is in contradiction to traditional bulk vessel designs, where the
   focus has been on maximizing the cargo-carrying capacity at the lowest
   possible building cost and not on minimizing the energy consumption.
   Moreover, the Panama Canal has historically been an important design
   criterion, while the new canal locks from 2014 will significantly
   increase the maximum size of vessels that can pass. The present paper
   provides an assessment of cost and emissions as a function of
   alternative bulk vessel designs with focus on a vessel's beam, length
   and hull slenderness, expressed by the length displacement ratio for
   three fuel price scenarios. The result shows that with slenderer hull
   forms the emissions drop. With today's fuel price of 600 USD per ton of
   fuel, emissions can thus be reduced by up to 15-25\% at a negative
   abatement cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Climate Change Vulnerability and Risk Management Matrix for the
   Coastal Zone of The Gambia},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Global Climate Change is one of the dire challenges facing the
   international community today. Coastal zones are vulnerable to its
   impacts. An effective approach with long-term prospects in addressing
   climate change impacts is it's mainstreaming into development agenda of
   sectoral policies. A comprehensive risk and vulnerability assessment is
   a pre-requisite to ensure that the right adaptive response is taken for
   effective integration into developmental plans. The objective of this
   study is to evaluate and prioritize risks, vulnerability and adaptation
   issues of current and anticipated impacts of climate change on the
   coastal zone of The Gambia. The study will also give a methodological
   contribution for assessing risks, vulnerability and adaptation from the
   sub-national to local levels. The relevance of this study will be to
   create a link between the sub-national and local levels in order to
   facilitate the integration and mainstreaming of climate change into
   sectoral and local policies for more climate-resilient communities. This
   will aid in the promotion of strategic investment of constrained
   developmental resources to actualize successfully dynamic coping
   strategies, elude `maladaptation' and less compelling responsive
   measures. A purposive expert sampling technique was used in selecting
   respondents for the study. The findings of the study reveal that by the
   end of the 21st century, the climatic variables likely to have the
   highest impact on the coastal zone of The Gambia are `increased flood
   severity' and `increased temperature'. The coastal zone of The Gambia
   showed a high vulnerability to these climate change variables. The
   suggested adaptive response in addressing the impacts of increased flood
   intensity in the study area includes; improving regulations for
   restricting agriculture and livestock grazing activities to improve land
   cover; strengthening of early-warning systems, among others. The
   suggested adaptive response in addressing the increase in temperature
   includes: increase crop diversification and rotation to reduce total
   crop failure; switching to drought-tolerant crop and animal species,
   among others.},

Title = {Global warming and tropical cyclone damage to housing in the Philippines},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-60},
Abstract = {It is currently feared that the increase in surface sea temperature
   resulting from increasing levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the
   atmosphere could result in higher tropical cyclone intensity in the
   future. Although the economic consequences have been studied for a
   number of developed countries, very little work has been done on
   developing countries. The present paper assesses the likely effects that
   increased typhoon intensity will have on damage to housing by the year
   2085 in the Philippines, using a Monte Carlo simulation that magnifies
   the intensity of historical tropical cyclones between the years 1978 and
   2008. The simulation shows that direct damage to housing could increase
   between 17 and 58\%, depending on the adaptive capacity of each region
   in the Philippines and assuming the latter remains constant between now
   and 2085. The results clearly suggest the need to increase the
   resilience of local communities against the possible consequences of
   climate change.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies to maintain dunes as flexible coastal flood
   defense in The Netherlands},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {913-928},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Coastal dunes play an important role in coastal defense along sandy
   shorelines of the world. The majority of the shorelines experience
   erosion and this erosion is expected to accelerate under anthropogenic
   climate change and subsequent sea level rise. This paper investigates
   the impact of climate change, sea level rise and current management for
   coastal dunes in the Netherlands. Furthermore the paper discusses the
   implications of climate change projections for adaptation strategies
   into the future. Recent climate change scenarios for the Netherlands
   highlight rising temperature and accelerated sea-level rise. Their
   combined effects on dune-building processes are expected to be
   manifested through an increase in erosive forces at the expensive of
   accretive forces. In the Netherlands, a negative sand balance and inland
   migration of the beach-dune system has been successfully counteracted in
   the last decades through the application of sand nourishments. These
   have enhanced accretion on the one hand and limited erosion on the other
   hand. Generally, coastal protection has improved despite rising sea
   levels. Important preconditions that make this sand nourishment strategy
   possible are: a readily available sand resource that makes exploitation
   technically and economically feasible; a sound monitoring system
   supported by solid science; political consensus and a good institutional
   structure to implement the strategy. In the Netherlands, the necessary
   preconditions are already in place to successfully adapt to sea level
   rise. Given the expected accelerated rise in sea level and its potential
   effects on the dune-beach sediment balance, the annual sand nourishment
   will need to be intensified to ensure the preservation and integrity of
   the coastal zone.},

Year = {2020},

Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {Extreme sea levels (ESLs) in Europe could rise by as much as one metre
   or more by the end of this century due to climate change. This poses
   significant challenges to safeguard coastal communities. Here we present
   a comprehensive analysis of economically efficient protection scenarios
   along Europe's coastlines during the present century. We employ a
   probabilistic framework that integrates dynamic simulations of all ESL
   components and flood inundation, impact modelling and a cost-benefit
   analysis of raising dykes. We find that at least 83\% of flood damages
   in Europe could be avoided by elevating dykes in an economically
   efficient way along 23.7\%-32.1\% of Europe's coastline, specifically
   where high value conurbations exist. The European mean benefit to cost
   ratio of the investments varies from 8.3 to 14.9 while at country level
   this ranges between 1.6 and 34.3, with higher efficiencies for a
   scenario with high-end greenhouse gas emissions and strong
   socio-economic growth. There lacks a European cost-benefit analysis of
   possible protective measures against rising seas. Here the authors used
   a probabilistic data and modeling framework to estimate costs and
   benefits of coastal protection measures and found that at least 83\% of
   flood damages could be avoided by dyke improvements along a third of the
   European coastline.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal marshes contribute greatly to atmospheric greenhouse gases
   (GHGs) and have thus attracted considerable attention at regional and
   global scales. However, the relative importance of climates and soil
   variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large
   geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the
   spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal
   marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the
   climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2,
   CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8-310 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1),
   23.6-986 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.58-110 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1),
   respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to
   low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature.
   These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and
   subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total
   organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen,
   microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance
   were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN
   were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions
   across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC,
   MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly
   correlated with climatic temperature, 28-67\% of the variations in GHG
   emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes
   (\%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of
   projected annual increases of 2 or 4 degrees C by 2100, were larger in
   temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal
   marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming.
   The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese
   coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70\% of the annual
   emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively. These
   results suggest that coastal marshes will be important to future global
   warming and will play a critical role in global GHG emissions.},

Title = {Exploring the role of bureaucracy in the production of coastal risks,
   City of Cape Town, South Africa},

Abstract = {Cape Town is currently experiencing a range of coastal pressures
   consistent with a warming climate. Notably this includes evidence of a
   receding coastline in certain areas and shifting wind regimes. Coupled
   with an increasing demand for coastal development, the City of Cape Town
   as the administrative authority is presented with an unfolding scenario
   of uncharted waters. From a coastal management perspective this requires
   a reappraisal of its governance strategies. However, this paper
   demonstrates that various governance structures within the City, whilst
   designed to address these challenges, are instead competing with, and
   undermining each other. In the context of a coastal city these dissonant
   governance structures translate into conventional (Weberian) forms of
   bureaucracy that counter efforts at promoting Integrated Coastal
   Management, the key tenets being institutional learning, collaboration,
   deliberation, flexibility and adaptive management. The disjuncture
   between governance structures in turn is restricting the City's ability
   in achieving its own coastal adaption strategies, particularly the
   restoration and maintenance of dune systems as effective `buffers'
   against climate change induced pressures such as sea-level rise and
   storm surges. The procedural rigidity delivered by the bureaucracy is
   instead leading to a `pathology': risks are being created and their
   production perpetuated by the bureaucracy charged with mitigating these
   risks. We suggest that the role of informal networks are explored as a
   means to circumvent the `necessary evil' of bureaucracy, towards
   enabling stronger degrees of Integrated Coastal Management and
   ultimately successful climate change adaptation responses. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Global warming encourages interest worldwide to integrate large
   quantities of renewable energy into the power grid as these sources are
   free from greenhouse gas emissions as well as assisting to reduce the
   energy crisis. Demand for energy in the Capricornia region of
   Queensland, Australia is increasing due to expansion of the coal
   industry and the availability of nearby iconic tourist attractions such
   as the Great Barrier Reef. Therefore, to reduce the energy crisis as
   well as minimise global warming, a hybrid renewable energy integration
   system was developed to facilitate installation of significant renewable
   energy generation capacity into the grid in the subtropical climate of
   Central Queensland. The proposed hybrid renewable energy integration
   system comprises a prediction model that forecasts solar and wind
   generation in advance; a techno-economic model that analyses the
   techno-economic and environmental prospects of renewable energy;and a
   load management system by which utilities can manage customer load
   demand efficiently. It has been shown that a subtropical climatic region
   has significant potentialities for substantially increased use of
   renewable energy which can not only contribute to the reduction of
   global warming, but also reduce energy generation costs and help
   ameliorate the energy crisis. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Framing the application of Adaptation Pathways for agroforestry in
   Mediterranean drylands},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Adaptation Pathways is a decision support tool designed to create
   adaptation policies under different climate change scenarios. This tool
   has been used successfully in several sectors and contexts such as
   coastal and river adaptation, urban heat waves, floods and rural
   livelihoods but its use in natural resource management, has faced
   several challenges and limitations. In the sector of agroforestry its
   use has seldom been done or documented and one of the reasons for this
   may due to some of its specific challenges. In this study, these
   challenges were addressed when using the Adaptation Pathways for the
   adaptation planning of three case studies in the semi-arid Alentejo
   region, a Mediterranean dryland of southern Portugal. This tool was
   integrated in a participatory approach combined with the Scenario
   Workshop method, to plan the adaptation of the agriculture and forestry
   sector of one municipality (Me?rtola) and two agroforestry farms (221 ha
   and 1000 ha). The methodology included, for each case study, 20
   interviews, two workshops, literature review, expert analysis and the
   use of indicators of efficacy of adaptation measures, to define tipping
   points. The adaptation process and the resulting adaptation plans were
   evaluated by questionnaire and expert review. This combination of
   methods has supported the choice of effective adaptation measures for
   the case studies and when combined with several adaptation pathways and
   a landscape approach it supported the creation of integrated climate
   change adaptation plans that are now in implementation. We discuss how
   this combination of methods deals with limitation to Adaptation Pathways
   identified in the literature, conclude that the method was able to
   create adaptation plans that are now under implementation and present
   avenues for future research.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions from different land-use areas in the Littoral
   Zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {316-324},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A series of ecological projects, including forest and dike-pond
   projects, were constructed in the littoral zone of the Three Gorges
   Reservoir (TGR) to maintain the ecological safety of this area. Previous
   ecological designs mainly focused on the functions of ecological
   engineering for environmental purification, economic value and increased
   biodiversity. However, the variations in land-use may alter the
   emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which were ignored in our previous
   design. In this paper, the carbon sequestration benefits of ecological
   engineering were evaluated after dynamically monitoring the GHG
   emissions from different land-use sites during the growing
   (April-September) and submerged (October-March) seasons. The results
   showed that CH4 fluxes in the dike-ponds (3.76 CH4-mg m(-2) h(-1)) and
   rice paddies (6.09 +/- 1.60 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were significantly
   higher than those in the natural littoral zone (0.77 +/- 0.27 mg-CH4
   m(-2) mg-CH(4)m(-2) h(-1)) and forest project (0.57 +/- 0.31 mg-CH4
   m(-2) h(-1)) during the growing season. There were no significant
   differences in the CO2 fluxes from different land-use sites. The
   emission of N2O from different land-use sites was low and ranged from
   -0.02 to 0.07 mg-N2O m(-2) h(-1). The growing season contributed to more
   than 76\% of the cumulative annual GHG emissions. Direct GHG emissions
   and the carbon sequestration ability of species determined the net
   carbon sinks in the littoral zone. Net carbon sinks in the forest
   projects with different understory plant communities showed a small

Title = {Error analysis of the greenhouse-gases monitor instrument short wave
   infrared XCO2 retrieval algorithm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {We developed an algorithm (named GMI\_XCO2) to retrieve the global
   column-averaged dry air mole fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide
   (XCO2) for greenhouse-gases monitor instrument (GMI) and directional
   polarized camera (DPC) on the GF-5 satellite. This algorithm is designed
   to work in cloudless atmospheric conditions with aerosol optical
   thickness (AOT) < 0.3. To quantify the uncertainty level of the
   retrieved XCO2 when the aerosols and cirrus clouds occurred in
   retrieving XCO2 with the GMI short wave infrared (SWIR) data, we
   analyzed the errors rate caused by the six types of aerosols and cirrus
   clouds. The results indicated that in AOT range of 0.05 to 0.3 (550 nm),
   the uncertainties of aerosols could lead to errors of -0.27\% to 0.59\%,
   -0.32\% to 1.43\%, -0.10\% to 0.49\%, -0.12\% to 1.17\%, -0.35\% to
   0.49\%, and -0.02\% to -0.24\% for rural, dust, clean continental,
   maritime, urban, and soot aerosols, respectively. The retrieval results
   presented a large error due to cirrus clouds. In the cirrus optical
   thickness range of 0.05 to 0.8 (500 nm), the most underestimation is up
   to 26.25\% when the surface albedo is 0.05. The most overestimation is
   8.1\% when the surface albedo is 0.65. The retrieval results of GMI
   simulation data demonstrated that the accuracy of our algorithm is
   within 4 ppm (similar to 1\%) using the simultaneous measurement of
   aerosols and clouds from DPC. Moreover, the speed of our algorithm is
   faster than full-physics (FP) methods. We verified our algorithm with
   Greenhouse-gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) data in Beijing area during
   2016. The retrieval errors of most observations are within 4 ppm except
   for summer. Compared with the results of GOSAT, the correlation
   coefficient is 0.55 for the whole year data, increasing to 0.62 after
   excluding the summer data. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical

Title = {A mechanism of tropical precipitation change due to CO2 increase},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {238-243},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A recent GCM study indicates that a weakening of tropical circulation
   associated with a slight increase in tropical precipitation may occur
   when atmospheric CO2 is increased. To further understand the mechanism
   of atmospheric temperature and precipitation changes associated with the
   greenhouse gas increase, a numerical experiment was conducted using an
   atmospheric general circulation model to investigate the separate
   effects of CO2 increase and sea surface temperature (SST) increase. It
   has been shown that the effect of CO2 increase is a reduction of
   radiative cooling in the lower troposphere, leading to a reduction of
   tropical precipitation. When atmospheric CO2 concentration is doubled (
   quadrupled) without changing the SST, the tropical precipitation is
   reduced by about 3\% (6\%) in the model. The reduction of radiative
   cooling is a result of the overlap effect of the CO2 15-mum and water
   vapor absorption bands. On the other hand, the effect of SST increase is
   the increase in atmospheric temperature and water vapor, leading to
   increases in radiative cooling and tropical precipitation. When SST is
   uniformly raised 2degreesC without changing the atmospheric CO2
   concentration, the tropical precipitation is increased by about 6\%.},

Title = {The two-speed coastal climate adaptation economy in Australia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {190},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {There is increasing global concern that climate adaptation efforts are
   falling behind the increasing risks associated with climate change. A
   number of reviews have identified this general issue in multiple nations
   and jurisdictions. In Australia, it is argued here that adaptation of
   the coastal built environment is operating at two speeds: the two-speed
   adaptation economy. Large civil assets and facilities in Australia now
   mostly have adaptation plans and strategies in place; although progress
   in actual on-the-ground implementation is variable in some cases. By
   contrast, adaptation of coastal communities and settlements continues at
   a very slow pace with very few specific adaptation measures being
   implemented that were not already being implemented as business as usual
   for flood or erosion management. The reasons for these differences in
   adaptation progress is investigated here. A key outcome of the thinking
   presented here is the reinforcement of the result that adaptation of
   coastal communities is not a challenge of relocating buildings, but
   rather a challenge of incentivising and supporting communities to act.},

Title = {A decision-making process for wave energy converter and location pairing},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Global awareness concerning clean energy is increasing worldwide. Wave
   energy converters harvest energy from waves and help reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions. This research covers major aspects of the wave energy
   field including converters and installation-locations, and proposes a
   Decision-Making Process to identify optimum converter-location pairs for
   wave energy harvesting. This Process is based on the wave energy
   converter Selection-Guideline arising from essential features, and the
   synthesis of previous works so far focused on pinched-point locations.
   This Process yields a single map, denoting hotspot-areas for energy
   harvesting, and thereby wave-farm installations, based on multiple input
   information from the converters (including performance and installation
   depth), wave climate, resource availability and sustainability, area
   accessibility, restricted areas, power grid locations, population
   density, and energy demand, alongside local geographic features
   including touristic areas. Different spatial-resolution models along the
   Southeast Australian shelves, and thirty converters showed a high
   spatial-variation of the pairs nearshore. Devices with high maximum
   rated power are often, but not necessarily, the best for a given zone.
   Moreover, this Process is completed by the Energy Demand-Response Index
   that enables the division and ranking of the area into zones regarding
   the pairs' energy response to the energy demand at a reference-point
   such as a grid station. This research also shows that wave direction can
   significantly impact energy-production estimations. This Process can be
   applied to other zones worldwide and has the flexibility to include
   features that may not have been covered here.},

Title = {The environmental footprint of global food production},
Journal = {NATURE SUSTAINABILITY},
Abstract = {Producing sufficient food to support the planet's growing population
   places enormous strain on critical ecosystems. Quantifying and mapping
   the individual and cumulative pressures from greenhouse gases,
   freshwater use, habitat disturbance and nutrient pollution provides
   crucial insight into producing lower-impact, more sustainable foods.
   Feeding humanity puts enormous environmental pressure on our planet.
   These pressures are unequally distributed, yet we have piecemeal
   knowledge of how they accumulate across marine, freshwater and
   terrestrial systems. Here we present global geospatial analyses
   detailing greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater use, habitat disturbance
   and nutrient pollution generated by 99\% of total reported production of
   aquatic and terrestrial foods in 2017. We further rescale and combine
   these four pressures to map the estimated cumulative pressure, or
   `footprint', of food production. On land, we find five countries
   contribute nearly half of food's cumulative footprint. Aquatic systems
   produce only 1.1\% of food but 9.9\% of the global footprint. Which
   pressures drive these footprints vary substantially by food and country.
   Importantly, the cumulative pressure per unit of food production
   (efficiency) varies spatially for each food type such that rankings of
   foods by efficiency differ sharply among countries. These disparities
   provide the foundation for efforts to steer consumption towards
   lower-impact foods and ultimately the system-wide restructuring
   essential for sustainably feeding humanity.},

Title = {Environmental Implications of United States Coal Exports: A Comparative
   Life Cycle Assessment of Future Power System Scenarios},

Abstract = {Stricter emissions requirements on coal-fired power plants together with
   low natural gas prices have contributed to a recent decline in the use
   of coal for electricity generation in the United States. Faced with a
   shrinking domestic market, many coal companies are taking advantage of a
   growing coal export market. As a result, U.S. coal exports hit an
   all-time high in 2012, fueled largely by demand in Asia. This paper
   presents a comparative life cycle assessment of two scenarios: a
   baseline scenario in which coal continues to be burned domestically for
   power generation, and an export scenario in which coal is exported to
   Asia. For the coal export scenario we focus on the Morrow Pacific export
   project being planned in Oregon by Ambre Energy that would ship 8.8
   million tons of Powder River Basin (PRB) coal annually to Asian markets
   via rail, river barge, and ocean vessel. Air emissions (SOx, NOx, PM10,
   and CO(2)e) results assuming that the exported coal is burned for
   electricity generation in South Korea are compared to those of a
   business as usual case in which Oregon and Washington's coal plants,
   Boardman and Centralia, are retrofitted to comply with EPA emissions
   standards and continue their coal consumption. Findings show that
   although the environmental impacts of shipping PRB coal to Asia are
   significant, the combination of superior energy efficiency among newer
   South Korean coal-fired power plants and lower emissions from U.S.
   replacement of coal with natural gas could lead to a greenhouse gas
   reduction of 21\% in the case that imported PRB coal replaces other coal
   sources in this Asian country. If instead PRB coal were to replace
   natural gas or nuclear generation in South Korea, greenhouse gas
   emissions per unit of electricity generated would increase. Results are
   similar for other air emissions such as SOx, NOx and PM. This study
   provides a framework for comparing energy export scenarios and
   highlights the importance of complete life cycle assessment in
   determining net emissions effects resulting from energy export projects
   and related policy decisions.},

Abstract = {Recent declines of macroalgal forests due to climate change imply that
   the aquaculture production of macroalgae may also be negatively affected
   by ocean warming. It has previously been shown that nutrient enrichment
   can offset the negative impact of warming on the survival and growth of
   the cultivated macroalga Undaria pinnatifida, although it can also
   increase the risk of herbivory by unrecognized mesograzers. Observations
   of several hundreds or thousands of the isopod Cymodocea japonica around
   U. pinnatifida cultivation ropes in autumn, prompted the analysis of
   their size-frequency distribution, relationship between body size and
   consumption rate, and combined effects of elevated temperature and
   nutrient enrichment on the consumption rate of the algae by the isopod
   in the current study. Although the body size of the isopods collected in
   autumn was smaller than those collected in winter and spring, the
   consumption rate of 600 small isopods was similar to the rate of a large
   individual. Additionally, the consumption rate doubled in response to an
   increase in temperature from 15 to 18 degrees C and nutrient enrichment,
   and tripled with their combination. These results suggest that ocean
   warming combined with nutrient enrichment increase the risk of herbivory
   during U. pinnatifida cultivation, especially during isopod outbreak
   periods.},

Abstract = {For many years coal and oil have been used as energy sources. Currently
   oil is the dominant source of energy, but experts predict that in a few
   decades it will no longer be profitable. Burning fossil fuels generates
   atmospheric contaminants that give rise to the greenhouse effect that
   artificially warms the earth, damages the earth ozone layer, and
   produces acid rain, all of which are very dangerous for living beings.
   As a consequence, abnormal phenomena such as the melting of glaciers,
   changes in the Gulf Stream, unprecedented heat waves, floods,
   hurricanes, and damage to marine organisms are now occurring. Although
   there are many skeptics, there is a general consensus that the earth is
   warming up. In order to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions,
   the extensive use of alternative and cleaner sources of energy have been
   proposed, including CO2 emission-free nuclear energy and other
   alternative sources, among which are hydraulic, hydrogen, solar, eolic,
   biomass and geothermal. Another future alternative is to use methane
   hydrates, which have clean combustion and are believed to have
   considerable, still-unexplored reserves. It is also important to
   implement measures to improve energy efficiency for reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions. In this paper we review present and future energy
   sources, including both primary non-renewable and alternative sources of
   energy. There is still time to take corrective measures by replac
   measures, not to wait to start seeing ice caps to vanish. Then, it will
   be too late.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Adaptive management can be a very useful tool for assessing and
   improving coastal ecological engineering restoration projects. A
   shoreline restoration project using ecological engineering approaches to
   mitigate coastal erosion was developed and implemented in 2003 at Loyola
   Beach, Baffin Bay, TX. The project incorporated riprap, fiber matting,
   geotextile, and vegetation as an alternative to conventional hard
   structures for erosion control. As part of the restoration expansion, a
   detailed evaluation of the previous project was completed at several
   levels, including the landscape, geotechnical design, environmental and
   ecological considerations, and social and economic factors. The findings
   indicated that the vegetation and its underlying geotechnical integrity
   have played an important role in erosion mitigation. Overall the project
   was successful in the protection of the shoreline and was shown to be
   more ecologically beneficial than other hard structures. Based on the
   preliminary success of the initial project, the restoration techniques
   were adapted for another beach extension to the west. The assessment did
   reveal some weaknesses in the original project design including the need
   for more substantial toe protection and periodic maintenance
   requirements. Based on these assessments, some additional new methods
   for the restoration extension were proposed and implemented. The broader
   applicability of this restoration approach outside the local region has
   been presented through several outreach activities and delivered to
   coastal planners and land owners throughout the Texas Coastal Bend and
   Northern Mexico. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Reducing greenhouse gas emissions generated from energy sector in the
   following years is a compulsory step to the transition to low carbon
   resource efficient economy. Among various methods to reduce CO2
   emissions, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have a special
   importance. A promising carbon capture method to be applied in energy
   conversion processes for reducing the energy penalty associated with
   carbon capture is based on chemical looping systems.
   This paper investigates CO2 capture based on chemical looping systems
   suitable to be applied in an IGCC plant for energy vectors
   poly-generation with emphasis on hydrogen and power co-generation case.
   The coal-based IGCC cases produce about 400 - 600 MW net electricity and
   a flexible hydrogen output from zero up to 150 MW hydrogen (based on
   hydrogen lower heating value) with almost total carbon capture rate of
   the used fossil fuel. A particular accent is put in the paper on the
   assessment of process integration issues of gasifier island and syngas
   conditioning line with the chemical looping unit, mathematical modeling
   and simulation of whole plant, thermal and power integration of chemical
   looping unit in the whole IGCC plant (using pinch analysis) and
   discussing quality specifications for captured CO2 stream considering
   storage in geological formations or using for EOR.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Pages = {3974-3980},

Abstract = {We characterize the effect of regional temperature differences on
   battery electric vehicle (BEV) efficiency, range, and use-phase power
   plant CO2 emissions in the U.S. The efficiency of a BEV varies with
   ambient temperature due to battery efficiency and cabin climate control.
   We find that annual energy consumption of BEVs can increase by an
   average of 15\% in the Upper Midwest or in the Southwest compared to the
   Pacific Coast due to temperature differences. Greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions from BEVs vary primarily with marginal regional grid mix,
   which has three times the GHG intensity in the Upper Midwest as on the
   Pacific Coast. However, even within a grid region, REV emissions vary by
   up to 22\% due to spatial and temporal ambient temperature variation and
   its implications for vehicle efficiency and charging duration and
   timing. Cold climate regions also encounter days with substantial
   reduction in EV range: the average range of a Nissan Leaf on the coldest
   day of the year drops from 70 Miles on the Pacific Coast to less than 45
   miles in the Upper Midwest. These regional differences are large enough
   to affect adoption patterns and energy and environmental implications of
   BEVs relative to alternatives.},

Abstract = {The Sahel, the transition zone between the Saharan desert and the
   rainforests of Central Africa and the Guinean Coast, experienced a
   severe drying trend from the 1950s to the 1980s, from which there has
   been partial recovery. Continuation of either the drying trend or the
   more recent ameliorating trend would have far-ranging implications for
   the economy and ecology of the region. Coupled atmosphere/ocean climate
   models being used to simulate the future climate have had difficulty
   simulating Sahel rainfall variations comparable to those observed, thus
   calling into question their ability to predict future climate change in
   this region. We describe simulations using a new global climate model
   that capture several aspects of the 20th century rainfall record in the
   Sahel. An ensemble mean over eight realizations shows a drying trend in
   the second half of the century of nearly half of the observed amplitude.
   Individual realizations can be found that display striking similarity to
   the observed time series and drying pattern, consistent with the
   hypothesis that the observations are a superposition of an externally
   forced trend and internal variability. The drying trend in the ensemble
   mean of the model simulations is attributable to anthropogenic forcing,
   partly to an increase in aerosol loading and partly to an increase in
   greenhouse gases. The model projects a drier Sahel in the future, due
   primarily to increasing greenhouse gases.},

Abstract = {Local and Indigenous knowledge systems worldwide indicate adaptation and
   mitigation strategies to climate change. Particularly in regions that
   are massively affected by climatic changes, such as the Pacific Island
   States, there is a need for increased and combined research on the role
   which these knowledge systems can play internationally. For this reason,
   this article provides a synthesis of empirical results and approaches to
   local and Indigenous climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies
   in selected South Pacific Island States by using a meta-ethnographic
   approach. The reviewed literature is associated with the
   sub-disciplinary perspective of the Anthropology of Climate Change. The
   results of the meta-ethnographic analysis are discussed based on three
   thematic focal points: First, the empirical ground of local
   understandings of climate change and its theoretical
   conceptualization(s) are constituted. Second, the results of practices
   for adaptation to climate change are synthesized and presented in detail
   throughout one example. Third, the synthesis of climate change
   mitigation practices is outlined with a specific focus on
   human-environment relationships.},

Title = {Techno-economic feasibility analysis of Renewable-fed Power-to-Power
   (P2P) systems for small French islands},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {255},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {In this paper, the feasibility analysis of H2 and Battery based
   Power-to-Power (P2P) systems are presented from a techno-economic
   perspective. For this study, 21 small islands of France based in Europe
   are selected, being naturally endowed with renewable energy sources
   (RES) of solar and wind. For each island, three distinct energy storage
   options, i.e., hydrogen storage, battery storage and hydrogen + battery
   combined storage are discussed and explored. Optimum sizing of RES and
   P2P systems are achieved through employing particle swarm opti-mization
   (PSO) algorithm, keeping Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) as an objective
   function. The hydrogen and battery storage combination with an average
   LCOE value of 420Euro/MWh was found to be the most suitable option for
   all 21 reference islands. The associated Net Present Cost (NPC) was
   EUR564,388,050 which was lower than that for the other two storage
   options. The hybrid storage selection necessitated installation of 41 MW
   of photovoltaic (PV) modules and 122MW of wind turbines at these
   islands. The required storage capacity comprised of 7700MWh of hydrogen
   and 7MWh of battery storage combined with the auxiliaries. A
   considerable emphasis is also laid on highlighting the annual reduction
   of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other air pollutants through the adoption
   of the proposed RES-P2P integrated systems. The annual carbon dioxide
   equivalent measure (CO2,e) of all islands was computed to be around
   99507.52tons. It was revealed that more than 99 thousand tons of CO2
   emissions can be prevented by avoiding consumption of more than 34
   million liters of diesel per year.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {In cities with dry arid climate, air conditioning (AC) equipment is
   necessary for thermal comfort in indoor spaces. The use of this
   equipment generates an increase in electricity consumption and an
   increment in CO2 emissions to the environment; thus, one way to mitigate
   these negative effects is the Living Green Wall (LGW). The objective of
   this research is to assess the decrease in thermal gain, energy
   benefits, and estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are not
   emitted by the use of the LGW. Measurements of heat flux, solar
   radiation, and temperatures were made on a concrete wall and another
   with an LGW in a west-facing building in the city of Mexicali, Mexico.
   The results indicate that it is possible to reduce 49\% of the heat flow
   through the wall, which reduces the thermal load 102,212 Btu/h to the
   indoor space, implying the additional work of 8.53 tons of AC. This
   excess equals 985.6 kWh of electrical energy and generates a total of
   697 kg of CO2 emissions during the warm season. It is concluded that
   shading with an LWG becomes a very influential element to mitigate the
   heat fluxes towards the indoor spaces.},

Title = {Net CO2 and CH4 emissions from restored mangrove wetland: New insights
   based on a case study in estuary of the Pearl River, China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {811},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Mangroves have the potential to affect climate via C sequestration and
   methane (CH4) emissions. With half of the world's mangroves lost during
   the 20th century, mangrove restoration in mitigating greenhouse gases
   has been increasingly recognized. However, the carbon exchanges during
   restored processes still remain large uncertain. In this study, we
   analyzed the temporal variations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes and their
   environmental controls during 2019 and 2020 based on a closed-path eddy
   covariance (EC) system in a 12-year restored subtropical mangrove
   wetland, in estuary of the Pearl River, southeastern China. We also
   estimated the CO2 and CH4 fluxes and their climate effect from the
   beginning of restoration by Random Forest algorithm (RF). The EC
   observations showed that annually the 12-year restored mangrove acted as
   CO2 and CH4 sources, with net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE) of 82-175
   gCmiddotm- 2middota-1 and CH4 fluxes of 24.7-26.3 gCmiddotm-2middota-1.
   Low vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) and high ecosystem
   respiration (Re) caused net CO2 emissions in the mangroves. The
   estimation by RF indicated that the mangroves were always a CO2 source
   after the beginning of restoration, but the annual NEE was linearly
   decreased from 233 to 131 gCmiddotm-2middota-1 from 2008 to 2020. The
   annual CH4 emissions continually increased from 19.0 to 25.8
   gCmiddotm-2middota-1 after restoration. As a result, the restored
   mangrove had a positive effect on climate warming, with increased GWP
   from 1276 to 1386 g CO2-eq middotm-2middota-1 from 2008 to 2020. This is
   mainly due to lower GPP and higher Re by young restored mangroves, large
   water area as well as low salinity induced strong CH4 emissions. Our
   results indicate new sights that young restored mangrove with large area
   of water surface may act as carbon sources. However, the longterm
   climate and ecosystem benefits due to mangrove restoration should not be
   ignored in future. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities in the Caribbean
   through sustainable mangrove management},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {210},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The 2017 Atlantic storm season caused widespread damage to Caribbean
   nations including the British Virgin Islands. The winds and rainfall
   associated with Hurricanes Irma and Maria played their part in the
   destruction of infrastructure, livelihoods and the environment. With an
   increased interest in nature-based solutions to reduce flood risk,
   increasing the resilience of coastal communities and a focus on three of
   the most vulnerable communities in the Virgin Islands, we report on the
   use of flood risk vulnerability models based on remotely sensed
   satellite data and ecosystem services principles. Models were created
   with 4 primary aims to: (1) monitor the impact of storms and the
   recovery of mangroves, (2) assess the risk of flooding due to hurricane
   storm surges and extra-tropical storms (ground seas), (3) model
   opportunity areas for the restoration of red mangroves (Rhizophora
   mangle) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus) and (4) model and produce
   maps highlighting the predicted benefits that mangrove restoration will
   have on vulnerable coastal communities. Results highlight that between
   75 and 94\% of red mangroves in the three communities were negatively
   impacted by hurricanes in 2017. However, vulnerability models predict
   that even small-scale mangrove restoration initiatives can help to
   reduce the flood risk of homes and infrastructure up to 475 m inland.
   This work has provided the rationale for mangrove restoration in the
   Virgin Islands and presents an important tool for expansion across the
   wider Caribbean region that can be used to inform coastal restoration
   and resiliency building activities.},

Abstract = {The effect of obliquity and CO2 changes on Southern Hemispheric climate
   is studied with a series of numerical modeling experiments. Using the
   Earth system model of intermediate complexity
   Loch-VECODE-ECBilt-CLIO-Agism Model (LOVECLIM) and a coupled general
   circulation model {[}Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate
   (MIROC)], it is shown in time-slice simulations that phases of low
   obliquity enhance the meridional extratropical temperature gradient,
   increase the atmospheric baroclinicity, and intensify the lower and
   middle troposphere Southern Hemisphere westerlies and storm tracks.
   Furthermore, a transient model simulation is conducted with LOVECLIM
   that covers the greenhouse gas, ice sheet, and orbital forcing history
   of the past 408 ka. This simulation reproduces reconstructed
   glacial-interglacial variations in temperature and sea ice qualitatively
   well and shows that the meridional heat transport associated with the
   orbitally paced modulation of middle troposphere westerlies and storm
   tracks partly offsets the effects of the direct shortwave obliquity
   forcing over Antarctica, thereby reinforcing the high correlation
   between CO2 radiative forcing and Antarctic temperature. The overall
   timing of temperature changes in Antarctica is hence determined by a
   balance of shortwave obliquity forcing, atmospheric heat transport
   changes, and greenhouse gas forcing. A shorter 130-ka transient model
   experiment with constant CO2 concentrations further demonstrates that
   surface Southern Hemisphere westerlies are primarily modulated by the
   obliquity cycle rather than by the CO2 radiative forcing.},

Title = {Developing resilience to climate change impacts in Antarctica: An
   evaluation of Antarctic Treaty System protected area policy},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {12-22},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Antarctica is increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts, with
   the continent predicted to warm by -4 degrees C by 2100 under a
   `business as usual' greenhouse gas emission scenario. Simultaneously,
   human activity, primarily in the form of scientific research and the
   fishing and tourism industries, is putting increasing pressure on
   Antarctic and Southern Ocean environments and ecosystems. We evaluate
   the effectiveness of the Antarctic area protection system in promoting
   resilience to climate change impacts. Under the framework of the
   Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), terrestrial and marine areas can be
   designated to protect locations of scientific, environmental, historic
   and intrinsic value and to facilitate operational coordination to
   minimise environmental impact. However, climate change is not mentioned
   explicitly in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
   Treaty and is little considered in guidelines for the designation and
   management of the region's existing protected areas. Climate change
   impacts are considered in only 17\% of Antarctic Specially Protected
   Area (ASPA) management plans and, at a time when threats to Antarctic
   environments are increasing, the last decade has seen an 84\% decline in
   ASPA designation rate compared with levels in the 1980s. Nevertheless,
   momentum is building within the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
   Research (SCAR) and the ATS' s Committee on Environmental Protection
   (CEP) to deliver an evidence-based, integrated response to climate
   change that includes the use of protected areas. The Antarctic
   scientific community is well-placed to support decision-makers in the
   use of existing conservation management tools through provision of
   climate change forecasts at sub-regional scales, data on anticipated
   environmental change, and predicted species and ecosystems responses.
   Ultimately, reducing global greenhouse gas emission will provide the
   greatest protection from climate change impacts within Antarctica.},

Title = {N2O Emissions From the Northern Benguela Upwelling System},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {3317-3326},

Abstract = {The Benguela Upwelling System (BUS) is the most productive of all
   eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems and it hosts a well-developed
   oxygen minimum zone. As such, the BUS is a potential hotspot for
   production of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas derived from microbially
   driven decay of sinking organic matter. Yet, the extent at which
   near-surface waters emit N2O to the atmosphere in the BUS is highly
   uncertain. Here we present the first high-resolution surface
   measurements of N2O across the northern part of the BUS (nBUS). We found
   strong gradients with a threefold increase in N2O concentrations near
   the coast as compared with open ocean waters. Our observations show
   enhanced sea-to-air fluxes of N2O (up to 1.67 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) in
   association with local upwelling cells. Based on our data we suggest
   that the nBUS can account for 13\% of the total coastal upwelling source
   of N2O to the atmosphere.
   Plain Language Summary Nitrous oxide (N2O), commonly known as laughing
   gas, is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes both to Earth's warming
   and to the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. Typically, N2O is
   produced in the water column as a result of microbial decay of organic
   matter (under low oxygen conditions) and then it is transferred to the
   atmosphere at the air-sea interface. Hence, high productive regions
   associated with low oxygen waters could create hotspots for N2O
   production. Yet, emission estimates might have underestimated the
   potential of coastal regions due to data sparcity. We focus on the
   northern Benguela region, which is the most productive of four major
   coastal upwelling ecosystems. Here we aim to answer: what is the
   large-scale distribution and variability of air-sea fluxes of N2O? What
   is the impact of small-scale oceanographic features in N2O variability?
   and Do regional emissions of N2O need to be revisited? Based on the
   analysis of continuous highly resolved measurements, we suggest that the
   share of this region to the total N2O emitted by the global ocean is
   higher than previously thought. Considering that this region represents
   only 0.06\% of the ocean surface, we argue that the marine budget of
   this gas might need revision.},

Title = {Extreme sea level rise along the Indian Ocean coastline: observations
   and 21st century projections},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic sea-level rise poses challenges to coastal areas globally.
   The combined influence of rising mean sea level (MSL) and storm surges
   exacerbate the extreme sea level (ESL). Increasing ESL poses a major
   challenge for climate change adaptation of nearly 2.6 billion
   inhabitants in the Indian Ocean region. Yet, knowledge about past
   occurrences of ESL and its progression is limited. Combining multiple
   tide-gauge and satellite-derived sea-level data, we show that ESL has
   become more frequent, longer-lasting and intense along the Indian Ocean
   coastlines. We detect a 2-3-fold increase in ESL occurrence, with higher
   risk along the Arabian Sea coastline and the Indian Ocean Islands. Our
   results reveal that rising MSL is the primary contributor to ESL
   increase (more than 75\%), with additional contribution from
   intensifying tropical cyclones. A two-fold increase in ESL along the
   Indian Ocean coastline is detected with an additional 0.5 degrees C
   warming of the Indian Ocean relative to pre-industrial levels. Utilizing
   the likely range (17th-83rd percentile as the spread) of
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change MSL projections with
   considerable inter-model spread, we show that the Indian Ocean region
   will be exposed annually to the present-day 100 year ESL event by 2100,
   irrespective of the greenhouse-gas emission pathways, and by 2050 under
   the moderate-emission-mitigation-policy scenario. The study provides a
   robust regional estimate of ESL and its progression with rising MSL,
   which is important for climate change adaptation policies.},

Title = {Past and future adaptation pathways},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-44},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Adaptation pathways are increasingly being used as a foresight tool to
   help guide the implementation of climate change adaptation and
   deliberate transformation. This paper applies a pathways lens as a
   hindsight tool to provide new understanding about past change and
   adaptation relevant for improving future adaptation pathways approaches.
   Four case studies of past adaptations to change are examined: Solomon
   Islands Communities, Canadian forest-dependent communities, a
   Transylvanian village, and responses to climate adaptation policies in
   Australia. The results highlight that responses to change in these
   diverse case studies involve complex transitions that gradually create
   new conditions and trajectories; manifest as multiple but inter-related
   pathways of change and response at different social or spatial scales
   (e.g. different paths for different households or communities); have
   legacies and continuities across time that affect future pathways of
   change; are affected by power in complex ways; and can create further
   change and need for adaptation. Analyses also highlight that when
   working with prospective adaptation approaches as a response to climate
   change there is a need to consider: (1) underlying assumptions, values
   and principles associated with the future; (2) the existence of
   inter-connected multiple pathways and their implications for reinforcing
   existing social inequalities; and (3) how understanding past change
   provides inspiration for new and transformative futures. Overall, the
   paper concludes that shifts towards analyses for change rather than
   simply about change, such as adaptation pathways, will require more
   careful consideration of underlying ontological assumptions about the
   relationships between past, present and future.},

Title = {A feasibility assessment for co-locating and powering offshore
   aquaculture with wave energy in the United States},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Offshore aquaculture and marine renewable energy (energy from waves,
   tides, currents, and ocean gradients) are two developing ocean-based
   industries. Aquaculture, an industry that has typically relied on diesel
   for power, is expected to grow globally, presenting an opportunity to
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable sources as it
   expands. As the aquaculture industry moves further offshore and is
   situated in more energetic environments, the prospect to co-locate
   offshore aquaculture with wave energy increases. To improve
   understanding of this potential, a feasibility assessment was completed
   to estimate the energy needs and wave resource required to power
   offshore finfish aquaculture operations. The study found it is possible
   to power offshore aquaculture operations entirely with wave energy. A
   spatial analysis was then performed to assess the suitability of
   co-locating offshore finfish aquaculture and wave energy off California
   and Hawaii. Suitable locations were identified offshore of O'ahu,
   Hawaii, and northern California. Southern California was also assessed,
   using a lower wave resource, based on study areas evaluated by the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify Aquaculture
   Opportunity Areas, and while limited there are suitable locations that
   may warrant further evaluation. This study presents an analysis into the
   potential to pair wave energy with offshore aquaculture, and how various
   factors can help determine suitable areas for co-location. The methods
   developed in this study will support future identification of potential
   sites for development and decision-making to optimize the success of
   co-locating wave energy resources and offshore finfish aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Social resilience is the ability of community to cope the external
   stress that related with ecological/environmental changes. Ecological
   resilience is how fast environment could recovery from the incoming
   substance and could support community livelihood in that area. There is
   a clear link between social resilience and ecological resilience,
   especially for community that dependent on natural resources for their
   livelihood. This is preliminary study that will examine how social
   resilience could affect by ecological changes. Within this context, we
   explore the shock and adaption in Kepulauan Seribu Regency (DKI Jakarta
   Province) and Takalar Regency (South Sulawesi Province), Indonesia - a
   coastal community that using seaweed farming as their livelihood. This
   study presents a literature review and in-depth interview approach to
   explain more about how seaweed farmer can survive from the ecological
   changes and what is the alternative livelihood for their sustainability
   in that area. Seaweed cultivation is one of the coastal community
   livelihoods that dependent on natural resources and ecological
   condition. Seaweed cultivation has given a positive impact to local
   economic condition of coastal community but the changes of ecological
   condition could directly affect seaweed productivity. Ecological
   resilience in coastal area is how fast they could recovery from the
   incoming substance and always support community livelihood in that area.
   The quickness of ecological recovery is related to how much; and how
   long; and extensive the effect of incoming substance. Seaweed
   cultivation in Panggang Island (one island in Kepulauan Seribu islands)
   has started since 1986. The cultivation become booming since there are a
   high price of seaweed in this area. In 2000, there are Hugh reductions
   of seaweed production in Kepulauan Seribu. Farmers have tried to replant
   the seaweed but always failed. The new seed is become damaged and
   rotten. Since that time, there was no seaweed cultivation in Kepulauan
   Seribu. In 2013, one of the farmers in Kepulauan Seribu begins to try to
   grow seaweed. Seaweed seed start to grow well in mid-2014. According to
   the farmers on Panggang Island, successes and failures of seaweed
   cultivation is affected by changes in the harvesting season. In Takalar,
   production of seaweed cultivation constrained by environment factors
   like monsoon; urban development that causes water pollution; and issues
   about ``land{''} ownership.},

Title = {ICZM as a framework for climate change adaptation action - Experience
   from Cork Harbour, Ireland},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Using the example of ICZM implementation in Cork Harbour - an intensive
   multi-use setting - the potential to inform and advance the
   implementation of climate adaptation is examined. National level policy
   for climate adaptation is reviewed with a local ICZM initiative with a
   focus on process, principles and people. Lessons learned and critical
   contributions are identified that can inform endeavours in similar
   coastal environments, and ensure that ICZM is optimised to support the
   implementation of climate adaptation and resilience enhancement.
   Evidence suggests that despite being implemented through different
   institutional and policy frameworks, the local partnership-based ICZM
   model can provide enabling mechanisms, facilitate capacity building and
   harness knowledge exchange and learning to support the local scale
   implementation of national climate policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Most adaptation studies suggest that sea-level rise will lead to
   relocation as flooding worsens. Here we identified and evaluated
   potential adaptation strategies for adapting to sea-level rise, based on
   the experiences of four low-lying island communities in central
   Philippines that have experienced flooding during normal high tides
   since a 2013 earthquake that induced land subsidence. Coastal surveys,
   interviews and household questionnaires showed that island residents
   generally prefer in situ adaptation strategies rather than relocation to
   the mainland. These results are unexpected, particularly because a
   relocation programme has been developed by authorities on the mainland.
   Direct measurements during a flooding event indicate stilted housing as
   the most effective type of adaptation strategy. Many households have
   also raised their floors using coral stones, although this might
   inadvertently increase their vulnerability to typhoons and storm surges
   in the long-term.},

Abstract = {Understanding mechanisms that promote social-ecological resilience can
   inform future adaptation strategies. Among seafood dependent
   communities, these can be illuminated by assessing change among
   fisheries portfolios. Here, in collaboration with a Coast Salish Nation
   in British Columbia, Canada, we used expert Indigenous knowledge and
   network analyses to chronicle differences in fisheries portfolios pre
   and post a social-ecological regime shift. We then evaluated key drivers
   of change using semi-structured interviews. We found that while
   portfolios decreased in diversity of seafood types harvested and
   consumed among individuals overtime, portfolios increased in their
   diversification at the community level because more similar seafoods
   within less diverse individual portfolios were more commonly harvested
   and consumed by the Nation as a whole. Thus, diversity can operate
   simultaneously in opposing directions at different scales of
   organization. Experts identified four key mechanisms driving these
   changes, including commercial activities controlled by a centralized
   governance regime, intergenerational knowledge loss, adaptive learning
   to new ecologi-cal and economic opportunities, and the trading of
   seafood with other Indigenous communities. Unexpectedly, increased
   predation by marine mammals was also flagged as a key driver of change.
   Adaptation strategies that support access to and governance of diverse
   fisheries, exchange of seafoods among communities, and knowledge
   transfer among generations would promote social-ecological resilience,
   food security, and community well-being.},

Title = {Exploring the food-energy-water nexus approach to enhance coastal
   community resilience research and planning},
Journal = {GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Non-technical summary Coastal communities face environmental challenges
   that put food, energy, and water systems at risk. Although highly
   interdependent, it is unknown the extent to which coastal resilience
   research has considered interactions among food-energy-water systems.
   Twenty peer-reviewed articles were identified that focused on these
   systems and coastal resilience. Although a nexus approach was not
   employed universally, these studies most commonly addressed interactions
   among these systems related to acute hazards. They consistently
   acknowledged the influence of energy and transportation systems upon the
   others. As such, planners should incorporate linkages across all three
   systems during coastal resilience planning especially in relation to
   acute hazards. Technical summary Coastal communities strive for
   resilience in the face of an ever-growing suite of threats by planning
   and preparing for numerous uncertain futures. Food, energy, and water
   systems are highly interconnected and essential to the well-being of
   coastal communities. However, it is unknown the extent to which coastal
   resilience research has included food-energy-water nexus considerations.
   This study used a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed research
   articles and identified 20 studies that focused on food, energy, and
   water systems as related to coastal resilience. Results revealed four
   main findings: (1) the food-energy-water nexus approach was most
   commonly applied to coastal resilience in the study of US locations and

Title = {Groundwater Discharge as a Source of Dissolved Carbon and Greenhouse
   Gases in a Subtropical Estuary},
Journal = {ESTUARIES AND COASTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {639-656},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Groundwater may be highly enriched in dissolved carbon species, but its
   role as a source of carbon to coastal waters is still poorly
   constrained. Exports of deep and shallow groundwater-derived dissolved
   carbon species from a small subtropical estuary (Korogoro Creek,
   Australia, latitude -31.0478A degrees, longitude 153.0649A degrees) were
   quantified using a radium isotope mass balance model (Ra-233 and Ra-224,
   natural groundwater tracers) under two hydrological conditions. In
   addition, air-water exchange of carbon dioxide and methane in the
   estuary was estimated. The highest carbon inputs to the estuary were
   from deep fresh groundwater in the wet season. Most of the dissolved
   carbon delivered by groundwater and exported from the estuary to the
   coastal ocean was in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; 687
   mmol m(-2) estuary day(-1); 20 mmol m(-2) catchment day(-1),
   respectively), with a large export of alkalinity (23 mmol m(-2)
   catchment day(-1)). Average water to air flux of CO2 (869 mmol m(-2)
   day(-1)) and CH4 (26 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) were 5- and 43-fold higher,
   respectively, than the average global evasion in estuaries due to the
   large input of CO2- and CH4-enriched groundwater. The groundwater
   discharge contribution to carbon exports from the estuary for DIC,
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), alkalinity, CO2, and CH4 was 22, 41, 3,
   75, and 100 \%, respectively. The results show that CO2 and CH4 evasion
   rates from small subtropical estuaries surrounded by wetlands can be
   extremely high and that groundwater discharge had a major role in carbon
   export and evasion from the estuary and therefore should be accounted
   for in coastal carbon budgets.},

Title = {Marae-opoly: supporting localised Maori climate adaptation decisions

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Far from being passive and/or static victims of climate change,
   indigenous peoples are hybridizing knowledge systems, and challenging
   and negotiating new environmental and social realities to develop their
   own adaptation options within their own registers of what is place and
   culture appropriate. Our paper seeks to demonstrate how we, as guests on
   Maori land, were able to develop a partnership with a Maori community
   facing difficult adaptation decisions regarding climate change hazards
   through the pragmatic navigation of multi-disciplinary research and
   practice. In particular, we co-developed and tested the potential of a
   serious game (Marae-opoly) approach as a platform which assembles
   cross-cultural climate change knowledge to learn, safely experiment and
   inform adaptation decisions. Marae-opoly was developed bespoke to its
   intended context-to support the creation of mutually agreeable dynamic
   adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) for localized flood adaptation. Game
   material was generated by drawing together detailed local knowledge
   (i.e. hydrology, climate data, matauranga hapu) and situated adaptation
   options and accurate contextual data to create a credible gaming
   experience for the hapu of Tangoio Marae. We argue that the in-situ
   co-development process used to co-create Marae-opoly was fundamental in
   its success in achieving outcomes for the hapu. It also provided
   important lessons for the research team regarding how to enter as
   respectful guests and work together effectively to provide a resource to
   support our partners' adaptation decisions. The paper discusses the
   steps taken to establish research partnerships and develop the serious
   game and its subsequent playing, albeit we do not evaluate our
   indigenous research partners' adaptation decisions. Our contribution
   with this paper is in sharing an approach which cultivated the ground to
   enter as respectful guests and work together effectively to provide a
   resource for our partners' adaptation decisions.},

Title = {Diatoms for Carbon Sequestration and Bio-Based Manufacturing},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major greenhouse gas responsible for climate
   change. Diatoms, a natural sink of atmospheric CO2, can be cultivated
   industrially in autotrophic and mixotrophic modes for the purpose of
   CO(2)sequestration. In addition, the metabolic diversity exhibited by
   this group of photosynthetic organisms provides avenues to redirect the
   captured carbon into products of value. These include lipids, omega-3
   fatty acids, pigments, antioxidants, exopolysaccharides, sulphated
   polysaccharides, and other valuable metabolites that can be produced in
   environmentally sustainable bio-manufacturing processes. To realize the
   potential of diatoms, expansion of our knowledge of carbon supply,
   CO(2)uptake and fixation by these organisms, in conjunction with ways to
   enhance metabolic routing of the fixed carbon to products of value is
   required. In this review, current knowledge is explored, with an
   evaluation of the potential of diatoms for carbon capture and bio-based
   manufacturing.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {This article explores the drivers, benefits, and challenges facing
   climate change adaptation in the Maldives. It specifically investigates
   the ``Integrating Climate Change Risks into Resilient Island Planning in
   the Maldives{''} Program, or ICCR, a four-year \$9.3 million adaptation
   project being funded by the Least Developed Countries Fund, Maldivian
   Government and the United Nations Development Program, and nationally
   executed by the Ministry of Housing, Transport and Environment of the
   Maldivian Government. The article asks: what is the perception of
   coastal adaptation in the Maldives, and what are the potential
   contributions from the ICCR project? To answer this question, the
   article summarizes eight primary sectors vulnerable to climate change in
   the Maldives: human settlements, critical infrastructure, tourism,
   fisheries, health systems, water, food security, and coral reef
   biodiversity. It then describes the genesis and background behind the
   ICCR, which addresses many of these vulnerabilities by demonstrating
   coastal protection measures. Benefits to the ICCR include improving
   physical resilience by deploying ``soft{''} infrastructure,
   institutional resilience by training policymakers and enhancing good
   governance, and community resilience by strengthening community assets
   and awareness. Challenges include ensuring that adaptation efforts are
   enough to truly respond to climate vulnerability, lack of coordination,
   and short-term thinking among business and community leaders.},

Title = {Climate change-induced variations in blue and green water usage in US
   urban agriculture},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {348},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Urban agriculture could assist in meeting the growing global demand for
   food without overburdening agricultural areas. To fully realize the
   potential of urban agriculture, it is necessary to better understand the
   implications of urban agriculture and climate change on the
   food-energy-water nexus. The objective of this study was to investigate
   the influence of local climate change on irrigation requirements, and
   green and blue water usages for turf grass and three common urban
   agriculture crops (carrots, spinach, and sweet corn) in eight mid-sized
   U.S. cities. Baseline (1980-2010) and Future (2040-2050) daily climate
   data were combined with site-specific crop water uptake data to
   calculate irrigation requirements using the Irrigation Management System
   Model, IManSys, a numerical simulation model that uses a water balance
   approach. The irrigation requirements (IRRs) were further used to
   calculate the energy requirements and associated greenhouse gas
   emissions for the four crops in each location. Results showed the
   spatio-temporal impact of climate change on precipitation and
   evapotranspiration and consequently on crop IRRs. On the east coast,
   increases in summer precipitation during the crop growing seasons result
   in relatively small increases in blue water contributions (<222\%) to
   crop water demands. On the west coast, though, decreases in
   precipitation lead to more drastic increases in blue water contributions
   (>222\%) for these same crops. The energy requirements and greenhouse
   gas footprints of urban agriculture were weakly correlated to the blue
   water portion of the IRRs in individual cities but were largely impacted
   by the source of the water used. Overall, the results highlight the
   importance of appropriate and thoughtful crop selection for urban
   agriculture paired with environmentally sustainable water sourcing to
   maintain, or even reduce, future water and energy footprints of urban
   agriculture.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are vulnerable to
   climate change impacts including sea level rise, invasive species, ocean
   acidification, changes in rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and
   changing hazard regimes including hurricanes, floods and drought. Given
   high dependencies in Caribbean SIDS on natural resources for
   livelihoods, a focus on ecosystems and their interaction with people is
   essential for climate change adaptation. Increasingly, ecosystem-based
   adaptation (EbA) approaches are being highlighted as an approach to
   address climate change impacts. Specifically, EbA encourages the use of
   local and external knowledge about ecosystems to identify climate change
   adaptation approaches. This paper critically reviews EbA in Caribbean
   SIDS, focusing on the need to integrate local and external knowledge. An
   analysis of current EbA in the Caribbean is undertaken alongside a
   review of methodologies used to integrate local and external expertise
   for EbA. Finally key gaps, lessons learnt and suggested ways forward for
   EbA in Caribbean SIDS and potentially further afield are identified.},

Title = {A transdisciplinary modeling framework for the participatory design of
   dynamic adaptive policy pathways},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Efficient policymaking is crucial towards climate change mitigation.
   However, policies' successful implementation depends largely on the
   context where they are applied. Classic decision-making used to be based
   on a static plan that was considered optimal for the ``most likely{''}
   future contextual outcome. However, predicting the most probable
   evolution of this context has been proved unsuccessful, since it is
   vulnerable to unanticipated parameter change. Dynamic Adaptive Policy
   Pathways can address this problem focusing on the design of short-term
   policies, with simultaneous definition of adaptive interventions to be
   chosen on the long-term. This article presents a transdisciplinary
   modeling framework, which builds on the original Dynamic Adaptive Policy
   Pathways methodology. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework
   the authors used it to explore the evolution of the small-scale solar
   photovoltaics share in Greece, towards the achievement of the national
   capacity targets of 2025 and 2030. Model outcomes facilitated the
   identification of several pathways achieving the capacity targets, while
   reducing the risk for retroactive policy changes. Overall, the presented
   study demonstrates potential to support the design of adaptive policies
   over contextual evolutions so that social, economic and technological
   aspects of integrative planning are balanced towards the achievement of
   climate targets.},

Title = {Strengthening coastal adaptation planning through scenario analysis: A
   beneficial but incomplete solution},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is an increasing priority for coastal
   management. European Union and Member State adaptation policies and
   strategies have been promulgated but associated with minimal delivery of
   adaptation interventions and tangible gains in resilience. Generic
   stages of adaptation and barriers to adaptation have been identified:
   various tools or instruments have potential to strengthen adaptation
   delivery. Scenario analysis is one tool which provides a description of
   alternate possible future states and has been used to support adaptation
   planning. This work aims to assess how readily those engaged in coastal
   management decision-making are able to develop and utilise scenarios of
   change for adaptation and whether it represents a `best practice'
   approach for adaptation planning. The scenario analysis facilitated many
   aspects of the adaptation process, which ultimately led to a tractable
   adaptation strategy being produced. However, pathways for integrated
   approaches to co-deliver adaptation were less evident. The planning
   horizon, much beyond usual governmental budget and project cycles, the
   need for trade-offs and embedded institutional constraints meant that a
   majority of those who had started out on the scenario analysis became
   disengaged by its conclusion. The analysis undertaken concurs with
   theoretical work which projects a tail-off of the benefits of scenario
   analysis at the later stages of the adaptation cycle. The work concludes
   that scenario analysis offers the potential to overcome key barriers to
   adaptation progress. However, the gains may be limited as the
   institutional drivers for longer-term pro-active planning may be weak
   compared to present day roles, responsibilities and competitive
   pressures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study proposes a novel Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI)
   estimation method considering the Onboard Carbon Capture and Storage
   (OCCS) system. The OCCS selectively captures and stores carbon dioxide
   (CO2) contained in exhaust gas emitted from the internal combustion
   engines of a ship. It also utilizes a CO2 capture process, a CO2
   liquefaction process, and a CO2 storage tank. The status of greenhouse
   gas regulation for ships currently being discussed at the International
   Maritime Organization was investigated, and a modified EEDI estimation
   formula and a method for EEDI calculation considering the OCCS were
   evaluated. Case studies on a container feeder were conducted based on
   the proposed method in accordance with the EEDI regulations. The
   chemical absorption with an activated methyldiethanolamine solution was
   selected for the CO2 capture process. The captured CO2 was liquefied
   using cold energy from liquefied natural gas and ammonia. To improve the
   volume efficiency of the containment system, a prismatic pressure vessel
   was adopted for the CO2 storage tank. The results demonstrate that the
   required carbon capture ratio in the CO2 capture process is higher than
   the actual EEDI reduction rate.},

Title = {Social cognition of climate change in coastal community: A case study in
   Xiamen City, China},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Climate change has caused a series of social, economic and environmental
   consequences both at global and regional scales, especially for the
   urbanized coastal areas in China. Sea level rise and extreme weather
   threaten human and property safety, as well as sustainable development
   in China's densely populated coastal areas; all those factors bring new
   challenges to costal management. This paper takes a typical coastal
   city, Xiamen City as a case to study the residents' cognition of climate
   change, and based on questionnaire survey in coastal communities to
   explore the strategy development dealing with the climate change under
   integrated coastal management (ICM) framework. The social cognition
   survey includes three aspects: knowledge of the climate change,
   perception of the impact of climate change and response to the climate
   change. The results showed that the resident's knowledge on climate
   change and its risk was still at a relatively low level on average.
   Among effects of climate change, temperature rise can be easily
   identified by people, while sea level rise is less known by residents.
   Facing climate change, if residents have plans reactively, we think
   their attitudes are positive, i.e. evacuation is seen as negative. It is
   delight that 69.6\% residents' attitude to adapt climate change is
   positive. 42.0\% of residents prefer protective measures rather than
   adjustment measures when facing climate change. Furthermore, we explored
   the primary factors that influence residents' cognition and selection
   preference on adapting measures through logistic regression. Our study
   suggests that public cognition significantly affect public participation
   on climate change and the community-based planning and management on
   climate change is urgently in need in the rapidly developing
   urbanization coastal areas, which will play an important role in
   integrated coastal management.},

Abstract = {Waste management strategies have a relevant role in climate change
   mitigation. This work presents the cost-effectiveness analysis of
   implementing a composting plant and a landfill, with and without
   electricity generation, in Cabo Verde. The measures were initially
   selected under local stakeholder consultation under the Waste Roadmap of
   Cabo Verde project development, as well as all technical assumptions.
   The analysis was developed using the GACMO model, to build a marginal
   revenue abatement curve. The waste composting solution for large
   producers presents the largest volume of GHG emissions saved, 81
   ktCO(2)eq./year, at a low cost of 0.62 US\$/tCO(2)eq., thus supporting
   its implementation. In complement, the landfill gas electricity
   production shows positive yields of 40 US\$/tCO(2)eq., with savings of
   about 36ktCO(2)eq. per year, contributing to the greenhouse gas emission
   reduction targets of the country. The landfill gas flaring solution
   shows higher costs since it does not benefit from electricity
   generation. Following the Waste Roadmap development, these results are
   being considered in the definition of waste management operational plans
   in the various islands of the country.},

Abstract = {In terms of evaluating possible adaptations to climate change, one
   problem faced by decision-makers is how to separate the risks from
   present, natural climatic variations and extremes from those associated
   with future greenhouse-gas-induced changes in climate. In particular,
   this separation is necessary in order to identify the ``incremental
   costs{''} of adaptation associated with climate change. As reported
   here, this problem has been addressed by developing an enhanced version
   of an integrated model system called SimCLIM.
   The SimCLIM system simulates, both temporally and spatially, the impacts
   of both climate variability and change. The model system has recently
   been expanded in ways that allow the topic of ``incremental costs{''} of
   adaptation to be explored through simulation, with a particular focus on
   coastal risks. These improvements include:
   open-framework system, which allows user access to import climate data
   and impact models for different areas and resolutions;
   sea-level scenario generator, which includes the capacity for including
   regional and local components of sea-level change;
   land use scenario generator that allows the user to examine the
   implications for vulnerability under assumptions about different
   pathways and controls on future growth and development;
   capacity for transient simulations that complements the ``time-slice{''}
   approach to impact assessment and allows for time-dependent changes in
   climate and land use and their effects to be analysed;
   explicit capacity for examining adaptation options, including outputs
   that allow comparisons of simulations with and without climate change;
   economic tools for evaluation of impacts and adaptation options,
   specifically focussing on economic costs and benefits.
   This paper describes these improvements to SimCLIM and demonstrates
   their application through a pilot study of coastal flood risk from
   tropical cyclones in a community on the island of Rarotonga, Cook
   Islands. Multiple simulations are conducted with and without climate
   change, and with and without adaptation. The results thereby give clear
   indications of the relative magnitude of present and future impacts of
   tropical cyclones and the relative costs and benefits of adaptation
   options for reducing the risks.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses analysis of the global monthly sea surface
   temperatures using a reconstructed dataset that goes back to 1884. We
   use fractional integration methods to examine features such as
   persistence, seasonality, and time trends in the data. The results show
   that seasonality is a relevant issue, finding evidence of seasonal unit
   roots. With the seasonal component removed, persistence is also very
   significant, and, when looking at the data month by month, evidence of

Title = {Case history of environmental impacts of an Indonesian coal supply chain},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {47-56},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Coal will continue to be the most demanded energy source worldwide,
   which highlights the importance of better understanding current
   practices and environmental impacts of this industry. Indonesia is the
   largest coal exporter in the world, but studies evaluating the
   environmental impacts of the coal industry in this country are missing
   in the literature. A case study of the Indonesian coal supply is
   evaluated by using attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques
   to develop inventory data and to evaluate greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, depletion of fossil fuels (DFF), and water consumption
   associated with the production of coal from mining to the consumer's
   gate. Five scenarios are evaluated to identify opportunities for
   improvement. Material and energy inputs are inventoried through site
   visits and surveys, with complementary data added from the literature.
   Three pits producing sub-bituminous coal are evaluated where the
   processes of mining, coal transport to local and international markets,
   administrative operations, and water treatment are analyzed. Results are
   normalized by the functional unit defined as the energy content in the
   produced coal (expressed in GJ). Total GHG emissions are 4021 g
   CO(2)e/GJ, DFF is 39 MJ/GJ and water consumption is 41.5 L/GJ or 2 L/GJ
   if recycled water is considered. Mining operations are the largest
   source of GHG emissions and DFF, with overburden removal and transport
   responsible for more than one third of these impacts. Fugitive methane
   release and sea transport to international customers also have a
   significant impact on GHG emissions and DFF respectively. The energy
   return on investment (EROI) is 25.9 at the delivery point and 42 at the
   mine mouth indicating that this is a net energy producing operation.
   Alternative scenarios show that GHG emissions and DFF could be
   significantly reduced by increasing biodiesel content in the fuel mix of
   ground operations and by transporting overburden with a conveyor. (C)

Title = {Costs and benefits of adapting spatial planning to climate change:
   lessons learned from a large-scale urban development project in the

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},

Abstract = {Climate change increases the vulnerability of low-lying coastal areas.
   Careful spatial planning can reduce this vulnerability, provided that
   decision-makers have insight into the costs and benefits of adaptation
   options. This paper addresses the question which adaptation options are
   suitable, from an economic perspective, to adapt spatial planning to
   climate change at a regional scale. We apply social cost-benefit
   analysis to assess the net benefits of adaptation options that deal with
   the impacts of climate change-induced extreme events. From the methods
   applied and results obtained, we also aim at learning lessons for
   assessing climate adaptation options. The case study area, the
   Zuidplaspolder, is a large-scale urban development project in the
   Netherlands. The costs as well as the primary and secondary benefits of
   adaptation options relating to spatial planning (e.g. flood-proof
   housing and adjusted infrastructure) are identified and where possible
   quantified. Our results show that three adaptation options are not
   efficient investments, as the investment costs exceed the benefits of
   avoided damages. When we focus on `climate proofing' the total area of
   the Zuidplaspolder, when the costs and benefits of all the presented
   adaptation options are considered together, the total package has a
   positive net present value. The study shows that it is possible to
   anticipate climate change impacts and assess the costs and benefits of
   adjusting spatial planning. We have learned that scenario studies
   provide a useful tool but that decision-making under climate change
   uncertainty also requires insight into the probabilities of occurrence
   of weather extremes in the future.},

Abstract = {The global response to the challenge of increasingly rapid and severe
   climate change is shifting from a focus on mitigation and remediation of
   impacts to a pragmatic adaptation framework. Innovative adaptive
   solutions that transform the way in which we manage the world's oceans
   and, particularly, the harvesting of marine resources in a sustainable
   manner, are urgently needed. In that context, ICES Journal of Marine
   Science solicited contributions to the themed article set (TS),
   ``Exploring adaptation capacity of the world's oceans and marine
   resources to climate change{''}. We summarize the contributions included
   in this TS that provide examples of emerging climate change impacts,
   assess system risks at subnational and international scales, prove and
   evaluate different adaptation options and approaches, and explore
   societal and stakeholder perceptions. We also provide some ``food for
   thought{''} on possible future developments in a transdisciplinary
   ``adaptation science{''} working at the interface between ecology,
   socio-economics, and policy-governance, and that will have to provide
   concrete solutions to the challenges represented by climate-change and
   anthropogenic activity. Success will depend on the extent to which new
   knowledge and approaches can be integrated into the decision-making
   process to support evidence-based climate policy and ecosystem-based
   management. This includes testing their effectiveness in real systems,
   but also consider how social acceptance of adaptive measures will/will

Title = {Trends in Satellite Earth Observation for Permafrost Related Analyses-A
   Review},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change and associated Arctic amplification cause a degradation
   of permafrost which in turn has major implications for the environment.
   The potential turnover of frozen ground from a carbon sink to a carbon
   source, eroding coastlines, landslides, amplified surface deformation
   and endangerment of human infrastructure are some of the consequences
   connected with thawing permafrost. Satellite remote sensing is hereby a
   powerful tool to identify and monitor these features and processes on a
   spatially explicit, cheap, operational, long-term basis and up to
   circum-Arctic scale. By filtering after a selection of relevant
   keywords, a total of 325 articles from 30 international journals
   published during the last two decades were analyzed based on study
   location, spatio-temporal resolution of applied remote sensing data,
   platform, sensor combination and studied environmental focus for a
   comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, together
   with future challenges and opportunities. The temporal development of
   publication frequency, utilized platforms/sensors and the addressed
   environmental topic is thereby highlighted. The total number of
   publications more than doubled since 2015. Distinct geographical study
   hot spots were revealed, while at the same time large portions of the
   continuous permafrost zone are still only sparsely covered by satellite
   remote sensing investigations. Moreover, studies related to Arctic
   greenhouse gas emissions in the context of permafrost degradation appear
   heavily underrepresented. New tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)),
   methodologies (e.g., deep learning or data fusion etc.) and satellite
   data (e.g., the Methane Remote Sensing LiDAR Mission (Merlin) and the
   Sentinel-fleet) will thereby enable future studies to further
   investigate the distribution of permafrost, its thermal state and its
   implications on the environment such as thermokarst features and
   greenhouse gas emission rates on increasingly larger spatial and
   temporal scales.},

Journal = {TRANSPORT},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {The maritime transport industry continues to draw international
   attention on significant Greenhouse Gas emissions. The introduction of
   emissions taxes aims to control and reduce emissions. The uncertainty of
   carbon tax policy affects shipping companies' fleet planning and
   increases costs. We formulate the fleet planning problem under carbon
   tax policy uncertainty a multi-stage stochastic integer-programming
   model for the liner shipping companies. We develop a scenario tree to
   represent the structure of the carbon tax stochastic dynamics, and seek
   the optimal planning, which is adaptive to the policy uncertainty.
   Non-anticipativity constraint is applied to ensure the feasibility of
   the decisions in the dynamic environment. For the sake of comparison,
   the Perfect Information (PI) model is introduced as well. Based on a
   liner shipping application of our model, we find that under the policy
   uncertainty, companies charter more ships when exposed to high carbon
   tax risk, and spend more on fleet operation; meanwhile the CO2 emission
   volume will be reduced.},

Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has established the Energy
   Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) as the most important policy measure to
   reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping. A vessel's EEDI is
   based on sea trials at delivery, and vessels cannot exceed a threshold
   for emitted CO2 per ton-mile, depending on vessel type and size. From
   other industries such as cars we have learnt that testing methods must
   reflect realistic operating conditions to deliver the desired emission
   reductions. Present sea-trial procedures for EEDI adjust to calm water
   conditions' only, as a comparative basis, despite calm sea being the
   exception at sea. We find that this adjustment procedure excessively
   rewards full bodied bulky' hulls which perform well in calm water
   conditions. In contrast, hull forms optimized with respect to
   performance in realistic sea-conditions are not rewarded with the
   current EEDI procedures. Our results indicate that without adjusting the
   testing cycle requirements to also include a threshold for performance
   in waves (real sea), the desired reductions will be short on targets and
   GHG emissions could potentially increase.},

Abstract = {CO2-enhanced coalbed methane (CO2-ECBM) can improve coalbed methane
   production efficiency and simultaneously alleviate greenhouse gas
   emissions. In this paper, we integrated TOUGH2 and FLAC3D numerical
   simulation software to conduct hydro-mechanical coupling analysis for
   effects of hydrofracturing and secondary fracturing in CO2-ECBM. The
   simulation results show that the hydrofracturing and secondary
   fracturing treatments significantly increase the coal seam
   interconnectivity, enhancing overall injection and production. The
   reduction of the pore pressure near injection wells can effectively
   reduce the damage of gas injection well. Moreover, secondary fracturing
   can even increase cumulative gas production up to 32.5\%. In addition to
   rising fracture density, increasing the fracture length is also
   considered an efficacious procedure for enhancing permeability in the
   secondary fracturing process.},

Title = {Quantifying the fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and air
   pollution of a potential commercial manganese nodule mining operation},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {114},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Manganese nodules contain economically valuable metals which may be
   mined in the future to supply metals to a growing world population. Thus
   far, environmental research has focused mainly on impacts occurring at
   the seafloor or in the water column but largely neglected any impacts
   caused above the sea surface. Emissions of greenhouse gases and other
   air pollutants contribute to, inter alia, global warming, acidification
   and photochemical ozone formation, which all negatively affect
   ecosystems and humans. We quantify the annual fuel consumption and
   emissions associated with a potential nodule mining operation in the
   Clarion-Clipperton Zone with an annual production of 3 million thy tons.
   We base the assessment on publicly-accessible energy demand estimates
   from three different studies and complement this with a calculation of
   the fuel demand and emissions of nodule transport scenarios to three
   different destinations. The global warming, acidification and
   photochemical ozone formation potentials range between 82,600-482,000 t
   CO2-equivalent (-eq.), 1,880-11,197 t SO2-eq., and 1,390-8,734 t
   NOx-eq., respectively, depending on factors including the engine loads,
   specific fuel oil consumption and transport speeds. We then discuss the
   regulatory dimension surrounding the topic. As three separate regimes
   (climate change, deep-sea mining and shipping) are applicable, we
   analyze the applicable framework and provide an outlook for the future
   regulation of DSM-related GHG emissions.},

Abstract = {Global warming is a result of `temperature forcing', the net imbalance
   between energy fluxes entering and leaving the climate system and
   arising within it. At present humanity introduces temperature forcing
   through greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture, and thermal emissions
   from fuel burning. Up to now climate projections, based on projected GHG
   emissions and neglecting thermal emissions, typically foresee maximum
   forcing at a date occurring from midcentury onwards, followed by a slow
   decline due to elimination of carbon emissions. However, under
   reasonable scenarios of growth in primary energy use, even if we switch
   completely to generation by zero-carbon fuel burning (nuclear or fossil
   with carbon capture) temperature forcing will be sustained and even
   increase through the second half of the century as a result of the
   additional heat injected into the climate system. A potential solution
   to this problem is to develop energy generation technologies that remove
   heat from the climate system, or as a temporary solution `dump' heat in
   the deep ocean. Two such technologies, both relying on solar energy, are
   discussed in this paper.},

Journal = {INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY},

Abstract = {Two of the key drivers of biodiversity loss today are climate change and
   invasive species. Climate change is already having a measurable impact
   on species distributions, reproduction and behavior, and all evidence
   suggests that things will get worse even if we act tomorrow to mitigate
   any future increases in greenhouse gas emissions: temperature will
   increase, precipitation will change, sea level will rise and ocean
   chemistry will change. At the same time, biological invasions remain an
   important threat to biodiversity, causing species loss, changes in
   distribution and habitat degradation. Acting together, the impacts of
   each of these drivers of change are compounded and interactions between
   these two threats present even greater challenges to field
   conservationists as well as policymakers. Similarly, the social and
   economic impacts of climate change and invasive species, already
   substantial, will be magnified. Awareness of the links between the two
   should underpin all biodiversity management planning and policy.},

Abstract = {High-latitude ecosystems are experiencing the most rapid climate changes
   globally, and in many areas these changes are concurrent with shifts in
   patterns of herbivory. Individually, climate and herbivory are known to
   influence biosphere-atmosphere greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange; however,
   the interactive effects of climate and herbivory in driving GHG fluxes
   have been poorly quantified, especially in coastal systems that support
   large populations of migratory waterfowl. We investigated the magnitude
   and the climatic and physical controls of GHG exchange within the
   Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska across four distinct vegetation
   communities formed by herbivory and local microtopography. Net CO2 flux
   was greatest in the ungrazed Carex meadow community (3.97 +/- 0.58
   {[}SE] mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), but CH4 flux was greatest in the grazed
   community (14.00 +/- 6.56 nmol CH4 m(-2) s(-1)). The grazed community is
   also the only vegetation type where CH4 was a larger contributor than
   CO2 to overall GHG forcing. We found that vegetation community was an
   important predictor of CO2 and CH4 exchange, demonstrating that
   variation in regional gas exchange is best explained when the effect of
   grazing, determined by the difference between grazed and ungrazed
   communities, is included. Further, we identified an interaction between
   temperature and vegetation community, indicating that grazed regions
   could experience the greatest increases in CH4 emissions with warming.
   These results suggest that future GHG fluxes could be influenced by both
   climate and by changes in herbivore population dynamics that expand or
   contract the vegetation community most responsive to future temperature
   change.},

Abstract = {Livestock feed modification is a viable method for reducing methane
   emissions from ruminant livestock. Ruminant enteric methane is
   responsible approximately to 10\% of greenhouse gas emissions in
   Australia. Some species of macroalgae have antimethanogenic activity on
   in vitro fermentation. This study used in vitro fermentation with rumen
   inoculum to characterise increasing inclusion rates of the red macroalga
   Asparagopsis taxiformis on enteric methane production and digestive
   efficiency throughout 72-h fermentations. At dose levels 1\% of
   substrate organic matter there was minimal effect on gas and methane
   production. However, inclusion 2\% reduced gas and eliminated methane
   production in the fermentations indicating a minimum inhibitory dose
   level. There was no negative impact on substrate digestibility for
   macroalgae inclusion 5\%, however, a significant reduction was observed
   with 10\% inclusion. Total volatile fatty acids were not significantly
   affected with 2\% inclusion and the acetate levels were reduced in
   favour of increased propionate and, to a lesser extent, butyrate which
   increased linearly with increasing dose levels. A barrier to
   commercialisation of Asparagopsis is the mass production of this
   specific macroalgal biomass at a scale to provide supplementation to
   livestock. Another area requiring characterisation is the most
   appropriate method for processing (dehydration) and feeding to livestock
   in systems with variable feed quality and content. The in vitro
   assessment method used here clearly demonstrated that Asparagopsis can
   inhibit methanogenesis at very low inclusion levels whereas the effect
   in vivo has yet to be confirmed.},

Title = {Contributions of Natural and Anthropogenic Forcing Agents to the Early
   20th Century Warming},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {The warming observed in the early 20th century (1910-1940) is one of the
   most intriguing and less understood climate anomalies of the 20th
   century. To investigate the contributions of natural and anthropogenic
   factors to changes in the surface temperature, we performed seven model
   experiments using the chemistry-climate model with interactive ocean
   SOCOL3-MPIOM. Contributions of energetic particle precipitation, heavily
   (shortwave UV) and weakly (longwave UV, visible, and infrared) absorbed
   solar irradiances, well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs), tropospheric
   ozone precursors, and volcanic eruptions were considered separately.
   Model results suggest only about 0.3 K of global and annual mean warming
   during the considered 1910-1940 period, which is smaller than the trend
   obtained from observations by about 25\%. We found that half of the
   simulated global warming is caused by the increase of WMGHGs (CO2, CH4,
   and N2O), while the increase of the weakly absorbed solar irradiance is
   responsible for approximately one third of the total warming. Because
   the behavior of WMGHGs is well constrained, only higher solar forcing or
   the inclusion of new forcing mechanisms can help to reach better
   agreement with observations. The other forcing agents considered
   (heavily absorbed UV, energetic particles, volcanic eruptions, and
   tropospheric ozone precursors) contribute less than 20\% to the annual
   and global mean warming; however, they can be important on
   regional/seasonal scales.},

Title = {Techno-economical optimization of an integrated stand-alone hybrid solar

Journal = {ENERGY},

Abstract = {The integration of renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, biomass,
   ocean, geothermal energy) is gaining importance in the United Arab
   Emirates owing to the high energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. This paper presents the analysis and results of the
   performance and optimization of a stand-alone solar PV power system with
   single-axis (horizontal and vertical) and dual-axis solar trackers and a
   diesel generator (DG) for the city of Khorfakkan, Sharjah. The modeling,
   simulations, and optimization analysis of the hybrid energy system (HES)
   were performed with the HOMER software based on the daily energy
   consumption of 37.75 MWh in the study area. The simulation results show
   that employing an HES with dual-axis solar trackers is the best power
   system architecture considering the renewable fraction (48.55\%) and
   levelized cost of energy (LCOE; 0.25 \$/kWh). The proposed HES meets the
   annual energy demand of the city (13,778 MWh) without shortages and with
   an electricity excess of 9.81\%. In addition, the sensitivity analysis
   shows that the HES with dual-axis solar PV tracking system provides
   lower electricity costs (250 \$/MWh) and the highest GHG emission
   reduction (69.6\%, which is equivalent to the GHG emission reduction of
   a diesel engine consuming 682,279 gallons of diesel fuel). (C) 2019

Abstract = {The greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) are the primary reason for climate
   change, leading to disastrous events such as storms, droughts, sea-level
   rise, and floods already being felt worldwide. Many essential contracts
   and protocols have been discussed and implemented worldwide to reduce
   GHGE. Among them, The Paris Agreement, the most important global climate
   agreement to date, was adopted, and Turkey is one of the countries that
   signed. Similar to country-based incentives, to reduce GHGE globally,
   the United Nations (UN) has determined strategies at three action
   levels: government, private and public levels. Based on Turkey's current
   situation, in this study, a decision-making procedure that focuses on
   governmental action plans to reduce the GHGE in Turkey for the
   determined sectors by the UN environmental program is suggested. To do
   that, one of the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods
   Best-Worst method, is suggested based on z-numbers that can consider the
   data's impreciseness and the hesitancy of the experts. The proposed
   methodology is applied to prioritize 35 action plans concerning six
   sectors. Based on the 23-experts judgments, Energy, Industry, and
   Transportation are determined as the most critical sectors that should
   be debated. Moreover, committing to more ambitious nationally determined
   contributions and energy transition strategies is determined as the most
   appropriate action plan that the policy-makers can consider.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {This paper presents a life-cycle emissions analysis of conventional and
   natural gas-based marine transportation in the United States. We apply a
   total fuel cycleor well-to-propelleranalysis that evaluates emissions
   along the fuel production and delivery pathway, including feedstock
   extraction, processing, distribution, and use. We compare emissions
   profiles for methanol, liquefied natural gas, and low sulfur marine fuel
   in our analysis, with a focus on exploring tradeoffs across the
   following pollutants: greenhouse gases, particulate matter, sulfur
   oxides, and nitrogen oxides. For our greenhouse gas analysis, we apply
   global warming potentials that consider both near-term (20-year) and
   long-term (100-year) climate forcing impacts. We also conduct
   uncertainty analysis to evaluate the impacts of methane leakage within
   the natural gas recovery, processing, and distribution stages of its
   fuel cycle. Our results indicate that natural-gas based marine fuels can
   provide significant local environmental benefits compared to distillate
   fuel; however, these benefits come with a near-termand possibly
   long-termglobal warming penalty, unless such natural gas-based fuels are
   derived from renewable feedstock, such as biomass. These results point
   to the importance of controlling for methane leaks along the natural gas
   production process and the important role that renewable natural gas can
   play in the shipping sector. Decision-makers can use these results to
   inform decisions related to increasing the use of alternative fuels in
   short sea and coast-wise marine transportation systems.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {210-222},

Abstract = {Although estuarine tidal marshes are important contributors to the
   emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the relationship
   between carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) emission, and environmental
   factors, with respect to estuarine marshes, has not been clarified
   thoroughly. This study investigated the crucial factors controlling the
   emission of CO2 and CH4 from a freshwater marsh and a brackish marsh
   located in a subtropical estuary in southeastern China, as well as their
   magnitude. The duration of the study period was November 2013 to October
   2014. Relevant to both the field and incubation experiments, the CO2 and
   CH4 emissions from the two marshes showed pronounced seasonal
   variations. The CO2 and CH4 emissions from both marshes demonstrated
   significant positive correlations with the air/soil temperature (p <
   0.01), but negative correlations with the soil electrical conductivity
   and the pore water/tide water Cl- and SO42- (p < 0.01). The results
   indicate no significant difference in the CO2 emissions between the
   freshwater and brackish marshes in the subtropical estuary, whereas
   there was a difference in the CH4 emissions between the two sites (p <
   0.01). Although future sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion could
   reduce the CH4 emissions from the estuarine freshwater marshes, these
   factors had little effect on the CO2 emissions with respect to an
   increase in salinity of less than 5\%. The findings of this study could
   have important implications for estimating the global warming
   contributions of estuarine marshes along differing salinity gradients.

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Processed-based biogeochemical mathematical models are powerful tools
   that are increasingly being used to estimate potential carbon
   sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of management at a
   landscape level. These models can simulate some or all of the processes
   responsible for carbon sequestration and GHG emissions, which can
   relieve some of the burdensome in-situ monitoring requirements that make
   many blue carbon projects cost-prohibitive. Here we selectively review
   five publicly available and widely used biogeochemical models (MEM,

   limitations towards blue carbon project development. Of the five models,
   only the DNDC model can be applied to fully account for net
   sequestration as applicable to blue carbon offset methodologies. With
   further development, the DayCent and the combined MEM/PEPRMT models may

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions contribute significantly to the increased
   intensity of detrimental effects brought forth by climate change. Given
   that energy systems are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions,
   efforts are being undertaken to reduce their environmental impact while
   further improving their economic performance. Among these efforts is the
   development of polygeneration systems. Based on the principles of
   process integration, these systems consist of complex networks of
   integrated process units that yield multiple products for increased
   economic and environmental sustainability. Optimization techniques such
   as mathematical programming, provide design solutions to maximize the
   benefits delivered by these systems. A fuzzy linear programming model
   for the optimal design of offshore polygeneration systems was previously
   developed. However, the design limits of the system performance
   parameters have yet to be determined. Thus, this study improves upon the
   model through the generation of its Pareto frontier. The relationship
   between product demand objectives and the economic objectives of the
   model are investigated under varying levels of their respective
   prioritization. The fuzzy optimization of the polygeneration system
   yields an overall degree of satisfaction of 0.45 with the Sterling
   engine being excluded. Moreover, the interaction of the product demand
   and annual net profit objectives is identified to be conflicting in
   nature. The results of the study allow the decision-makers to easily
   identify the optimal design of the off-shore polygeneration system based
   on the respective level of prioritization given to the objectives. In
   addition, the generated Pareto frontier also visualizes the advantages
   and tradeoffs between the optimal designs available.},

Abstract = {Depending on their location along an estuarine salinity gradient, tidal
   marshes are thought to have different impacts on the chemical
   composition of the water during flooding. However, there is a lack of
   direct measurements of fluxes occurring between the marsh surface and
   the water column to corroborate this hypothesis. This study compared
   fluxes of nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) between the water
   column and the marsh surface and the emission of greenhouse gases, at
   four sites located along the salinity gradient of an estuary of
   north-western Wales (UK). The exchanges of dissolved organic carbon and
   nitrogen (DON), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), soluble reactive
   phosphorus and silicic acid, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide
   were measured during tidal inundation in May and September 2008 using in
   situ incubation chambers. There was no linear pattern along the salinity
   gradient and the concentration of nutrients and DOC in the flood water
   did not appear to control the biogeochemical processes driving the marsh
   surface/water column exchanges in the studied marshes. Multivariate
   analysis showed a clear discrimination in functioning between sites with
   the fresh and brackish marshes having a more similar functioning
   compared to low and middle marshes. The main differences between these
   two groupings were in the fluxes of DOC and nitrate. The phenology of
   plant species, soil organic matter content and soil oxygenation appear
   be the dominant factors explaining the observed fluxes. (C) 2012

Title = {Numerical modeling of Gondwana coal seams in India as coalbed methane
   reservoirs substituted for carbon dioxide sequestration},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {384-394},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {India has recently witnessed the production of coalbed methane (CBM) on
   a commercial scale. The analysis of Garg and Shukla (2009) summarizes
   that initial carbon dioxide storage opportunities should be ventured in
   CBM sector where the effective cost of the process is partly lowered due
   to enhanced recovery of methane. This research work was carried out to
   understand and establish the technical feasibility of CO2 driven
   enhanced CBM recovery in Indian coals. A regional scale underground coal
   seam/block was modeled using a commercial reservoir simulator, COMET3.
   It was found that approximately 218 Mm(3) of CO2 can be sequestered in
   place of 74 Mm(3) of CH4 produced from the chosen dimensions of coal
   block. The changes in fracture gas saturation, matrix CO2 concentration
   and matrix CH4 concentration with space and time were monitored.
   Eventually, the numerical values for peak saturation at certain time
   intervals have been reported. This study is an initial technical
   estimate for CO2 driven ECBM (enhanced coalbed methane) at a regional
   scale in India. The results are expected to prove useful not only to
   reduce India's contribution to greenhouse gases emission into the
   atmosphere but also to partially meet with the growing energy demand by
   enhanced recovery of methane from deep, unminable coal seams. (C) 2012

Title = {CO2 Efflux from Shrimp Ponds in Indonesia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {The conversion of mangrove forest to aquaculture ponds has been
   increasing in recent decades. One of major concerns of this habitat loss
   is the release of stored `blue' carbon from mangrove soils to the
   atmosphere. In this study, we assessed carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from
   soil in intensive shrimp ponds in Bali, Indonesia. We measured CO2
   efflux from the floors and walls of shrimp ponds. Rates of CO2 efflux
   within shrimp ponds were 4.37 kg CO2 m(-2) y(-1) from the walls and 1.60
   kg CO2 m(-2) y(-1) from the floors. Combining our findings with
   published data of aquaculture land use in Indonesia, we estimated that
   shrimp ponds in this region result in CO2 emissions to the atmosphere
   between 5.76 and 13.95 Tg y(-1). The results indicate that conversion of
   mangrove forests to aquaculture ponds contributes to greenhouse gas
   emissions that are comparable to peat forest conversion to other land
   uses in Indonesia. Higher magnitudes of CO2 emission may be released to
   atmosphere where ponds are constructed in newly cleared mangrove
   forests. This study indicates the need for incentives that can meet the
   target of aquaculture industry without expanding the converted mangrove
   areas, which will lead to increased CO2 released to atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Global warming and accompanying climate change may be caused by an
   increase in atmospheric greenhouse gasses generated by anthropogenic
   activities. In order to supply such a mechanism of global warming with a
   quantitative underpinning, we need to understand the multifaceted roles
   of the Earth's energy balance and material cycles. In this study, we
   propose a new one-dimensional simple Earth system model. The model
   consists of carbon and energy balance submodels with a north-south zonal
   structure. The two submodels are coupled by interactive feedback
   processes such as CO2 fertilization of net primary production (NPP) and
   temperature dependencies of NPP, soil respiration, and ocean surface
   chemistry. The most important characteristics of the model are not only
   that the model requires a relatively short calculation time for carbon
   and energy simulation compared with a General Circulation Model (GCM)
   and an Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC), but also
   that the model can simulate average latitudinal variations. In order to
   analyze the response of the Earth system due to increasing greenhouse
   gasses, several simulations were conducted in one dimension from the
   years 1750 to 2000. Evaluating terrestrial and oceanic carbon uptake
   output of the model in the meridional direction through comparison with
   observations and satellite data, we analyzed the time variation patterns
   of air temperature in low- and middle-latitude belts. The model
   successfully reproduced the temporal variation in each latitude belt and
   the latitudinal distribution pattern of carbon uptake. Therefore, this
   model could more accurately demonstrate a difference in the latitudinal
   response of air temperature than existing models. As a result of the
   model evaluations, we concluded that this new one-dimensional simple
   Earth system model is a good tool for conducting global warming
   simulations. From future projections using various emission scenarios,
   we showed that the spatial distribution of terrestrial carbon uptake may
   vary greatly, not only among models used for climate change simulations,
   but also amongst emission scenarios.},

Title = {Sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in global carbon pools},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-100},
Abstract = {Sequestering atmospheric CO2 is necessitated by its present
   concentration of 385 ppm and increasing at the rate of 2 ppm y(-1).
   Increase in atmospheric emission of CO2 with the attendant global
   warming and environmental degradation are driven by global energy
   demand. In comparison with the emission of 300 Pg C between 1850 and
   2000, total emission during the 21(st) century is estimated at 950 to
   2195 Pg, with an annual rate of emission of 20 to 35 Pg C y(-1).
   Reduction of CO2 atmospheric loading can be achieved by biological,
   chemical and technological options through either reducing or
   sequestering emissions. This article describes technological options of
   sequestering atmospheric CO2 into other global pools. Geologic
   sequestration involves underground storage of industrially emitted CO2
   into the geosphere for long-term and secure storage. Liquefied CO2 is
   injected about 1000 m below the ground surface either in stable porous
   rocks, oil wells, coal beds, or saline aquifers. Co-injecting CO2 along
   with H2S and SO2 is also possible. Over time, the trapped CO2 reacts
   with minerals to form carbonates, enhances oil recovery, or displaces
   coal bed methane. Deep injection of CO2 under the ocean creates a CO2
   lake which eventually penetrates into the sediments. Iron fertilization
   is another technique of enhancing the C pool in marine biota, notably
   phytoplankton. The so-called ``biological pumping'' is based on the
   ``iron hypothesis'' of transferring C to the ocean floor. Terrestrial C
   sequestration is based on the natural process of photosynthesis.
   Transfer of CO2 into the biotic pool and soil C pool via humification
   and formation of secondary carbonates has numerous ancillary benefits
   through enhancement of ecosystem services. Soil C sequestration is
   essential to improving soil quality, increasing use efficiency of
   agronomic input, and advancing world food security. It is also needed to
   improve water quality by filtration and denaturing of pollutants, and
   enhancing biodiversity by saving land for nature conservancy. Soil C
   sequestration is a low hanging fruit, and a bridge to the future until
   low-C or no-C fuel sources take effect.},

Title = {Environmental footprints of British Columbia wood pellets from a
   simplified life cycle analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {220-231},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Environmental footprints of wood pellets produced in British Columbia
   (BC) of Canada are to be estimated based on industry surveys and
   published emission factor data.
   The streamlined life cycle analysis starts from raw material acquisition
   and ends at port Rotterdam in Europe for exported pellets or North
   Vancouver port for domestically used pellets. The raw materials used for
   pellet production are dry and wet sawmill residues, and allocations are
   based on dry mass. The pellet production data are based on three pellets
   mills in western Canada.
   For every tonne of BC pellets exported, 295 kg CO2 equivalent greenhouse
   gases is released. The human health, ecosystem quality, and climate
   change impacts of the exported pellets can be reduced by 61\%, 66\%, and
   53\%, respectively, if the pellets stay in BC for local applications.
   Harvesting is the second highest impacting process, following marine
   transportation. The total amount of primary energy consumed for 1 tonne
   of exported pellets is 6,372 MJ, and approximately 35\% of it is
   attributed to marine transportation. Exported pellets have 16.4\% of
   nonrenewable energy content and an energy penalty of 33\% with energy
   penalty defined as the amount of primary energy consumed to produce and
   deliver one unit of process energy using the higher heating value. For
   domestically used pellets, the energy penalty is 21\% and the
   nonrenewable energy content is 8.59\%.
   Marine transportation is the main contributor for all impact categories.
   Improving the energy efficiency of the harvesting and pellet plant
   operations is also a way to effectively reduce these wood pellet's
   environmental footprints.},

Journal = {NATURE},

Volume = {424},
Number = {6950},
Pages = {754-757},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {The oceans represent a significant sink for atmospheric carbon
   dioxide(1). Variability in the strength of this sink occurs on
   interannual timescales, as a result of regional and basin-scale changes
   in the physical and biological parameters that control the flux of this
   greenhouse gas into and out of the surface mixed layer(2,3). Here we
   analyse a 13-year time series of oceanic carbon dioxide measurements
   from station ALOHA in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean near
   Hawaii(4), and find a significant decrease in the strength of the carbon
   dioxide sink over the period 1989-2001. We show that much of this
   reduction in sink strength can be attributed to an increase in the
   partial pressure of surface ocean carbon dioxide caused by excess
   evaporation and the accompanying concentration of solutes in the water
   mass. Our results suggest that carbon dioxide uptake by ocean waters can
   be strongly influenced by changes in regional precipitation and
   evaporation patterns brought on by climate variability.},

Title = {Addressing global warming and biodiversity through forest restoration

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {240},

Pages = {1-9},

Abstract = {The Climate Challenge is a partnership between the Department of Energy
   and the electric utility industry to reduce, avoid, and sequester
   greenhouse gases. A portion of the initiative, the sequestration of
   greenhouse gases, is the focus of this presentation. Over 4 million
   acres of bottomland hardwood forests were cleared for agriculture in the
   Mississippi River Valley in the 1970s. Reestablishing these forests
   would improve depleted wildlife habitats, serve as wildlife corridors,
   increase biodiversity, and decrease soil erosion. Also, Louisiana is
   losing coastal wetlands at a rate of approximately 25 square miles/year.
   This coastal erosion is due to a number of factors and many efforts are
   currently underway to address the matter. One such effort is the use of
   material generated in the dredging of navigational canals; however, this
   material is low in nutrient value, making the regeneration of marsh
   grasses more difficult. In addition, bottomland hardwood forests and
   coastal wetland grasses are excellent `carbon sinks' because they take
   carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in living plant
   tissue. Entergy Services, Inc. is an electric utility with a service
   territory that comprises portions of both the Lower Mississippi River
   Valley and the Gulf of Mexico coastline. This provides an opportunity to
   positively address both habitat losses noted above while at the same
   time addressing global warming, forest fragmentation, and biodiversity.
   Entergy, through its affiliation with the UtiliTree Carbon Company, is
   participating in projects that will investigate the feasibility of using
   bottomland hardwood reforestation on cleared marginal farmlands now
   managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the US
   Fish and Wildlife Service. Entergy has also begun a research project
   with the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Louisiana. The
   research is a compost demonstration project that will utilize wood waste
   generated through our tree-trimming program as a compost material that
   will be mixed with low nutrient dredge material to create new coastal
   wetlands. Taken together, Entergy's initiatives will be able to address
   global warming through carbon sequestration, restore fragmented forest
   habitats, reduce coastal erosion and improve the quality of a vital
   coastal aquatic nursery habitat. Efforts will be made to manage the
   created habitats for biodiversity. Pulling all these ideas together
   creates an effect in which the whole is greater than the sum, of the
   parts. In such a synergy of ideas, there are no losers and the winners
   are both industry participants and the environment. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {Coalbed methane (CBM) recovery is a crucial approach to realize the
   exploitation of a clean energy and the reduction of the greenhouse gas
   emission. In the past 10 years, remarkable achievements on CBM recovery
   have been obtained in China. However, some key difficulties still exist
   such as long borehole drilling in complicated geological condition, and
   poor gas drainage effect due to low permeability. In this study,
   intelligent and integrated techniques for CBM recovery are introduced.
   These integrated techniques mainly include underground CBM recovery
   techniques and ground well CBM recovery techniques. The underground CBM
   recovery techniques consist of the borehole formation technique, gas
   concentration improvement technique, and permeability enhancement
   technique. According to the division of mining-induced disturbance area,
   the ground well arrangement area and well structure type in
   mining-induced disturbance developing area and mining-induced
   disturbance stable area are optimized to significantly improve the
   ground well CBM recovery. Besides, automatic devices such as drilling
   pipe installation device are also developed to achieve remote control of
   data recording, which makes the integrated techniques intelligent. These
   techniques can provide key solutions to some long-term difficulties in
   CBM recovery.},

Title = {Large contribution of non-aquaculture period fluxes to the annual N2O
   emissions from aquaculture ponds in Southeast China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {582},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of major potent long-lived atmospheric
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) with a global warming potential of approximately
   300 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 100-year timespan. To
   date, only several studies have explored the contribution of N2O
   emission from aquaculture systems to global emission, but with large
   uncertainty. In this study, the spatiotemporal distribution of dissolved
   N2O concentrations along the water column within ponds, and the N2O
   fluxes over the whole annual cycle were determined in the shrimp ponds
   in the Min River Estuary, Southeast China. Our results showed that N2O
   concentrations did not differ among sampling depths, but varied
   significantly among sampling dates. The temporal variation of N2O
   concentration was significantly correlated with the concentrations of
   N-NH4+ and total dissolved nitrogen. The one year study found an annual
   mean N2O emission of 57.63 mu g N2O M-2 h(1 )that was equivalent to an
   annual emission of 504.9 mg N2O m(-2)yr(-1), demonstrating the
   aquaculture ponds as an important source of atmospheric N2O. The N2O
   fluxes during the non-aquaculture period were one to three orders larger
   than those in the aquaculture period, and accounted for approximately
   97\% of the annual total emissions from aquaculture ponds. Our results
   showed that the N2O emission during the non-aquaculture period should
   not be overlooked owing to its marked contribution to the annual N2O
   budget in mariculture ponds. Further studies on N2O production dynamics
   including the abundance and activity of nitrifying and denitrifying
   bacteria in coastal aquaculture ponds are needed to improve our
   understanding of N2O biogeochemical cycle and facilitate strategies to
   reduce N2O emission.},

Abstract = {Accounting guidelines exist for the recording of carbon flows in
   terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. Shelf sea sediments, while
   considered an important carbon store, have yet to receive comparable
   scrutiny. Here, we explore whether effective management of carbon stocks
   accumulating in shelf seas could contribute towards a nation's
   greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. We review the complexities
   of carbon transport and fate in shelf seas, and the geopolitical
   challenges of carbon accounting in climate governance because of the
   transboundary nature of carbon flows in the marine environment. New
   international accounting guidance and governance frameworks are needed
   to prompt climate action.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification is likely to have direct negative physiological
   consequences for ninny marine organisms, and cause indirect effects on
   marine ecosystems. Ocean acidification could also affect the oceans'
   current role as a net carbon sink by altering the oceanic calcium
   carbonate budget. Although ocean acidification and climate change are
   both caused by greenhouse gas emissions, ocean acidification is not
   climate change per se, and is often referred to as ``the other carbon
   dioxide (CO2) problem.{''} As the United States considers actions in
   response to climate change, it is critical to take into account not only
   the impact of CO2 emissions on the climate but also their ramifications
   for ocean chemistry. The metrics that currently guide the climate change
   debate are dominated by strategies to reduce thermal impacts on the
   terrestrial environment. In this article, I examine the effects of ocean
   acidification and why they should help guide decisionmakers in setting
   CO2 emissions goals.},

Title = {On the road to a sustainable transport mobility in isolated power
   systems: The role of light-duty powertrain electrification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {320},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Plug-in vehicles are seen as a promising path to reduce the road
   transport greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the singularities of
   small isolated power systems in terms of the high dependence of fossil
   fuel-based generation and the relative short distances travelled do
   require a particular analysis to evaluate the potential emission
   reduction. This paper describes a simulation study for estimating the
   energy consumption and the corresponding Well-to-Wheels GHG emissions of
   different light-duty powertrain architectures subjected to real world
   driving conditions, taking the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands) as a
   test case. The simulations have been carried out with a high-level
   vehicle powertrain system analysis tool, capable to estimate second-by
   second vehicle energy consumption. Road gradient, GHG grid intensity and
   battery capacity impact on the GHG emission reduction were analysed in
   detail. Based on the results, the current high carbon content of the
   grid and the additional weight of the large battery packs limit the
   potential benefit of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) with respect to
   hybrid architectures (HEV). The simulations also reveal that Plug-in
   Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) currently offer a great potential to
   reduce the GHG emissions. Unlike other geographical areas, the high
   Utility Factors derived from the short distances travelled ensure the
   proper use of this technology.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {479-488},

Abstract = {Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plays a major role in worldwide energy
   consumption as a clean source of energy with low greenhouse gases
   emission. LPG transportation is exhibited through networks of pipelines,
   maritime, and tracks. LPG transmission using pipeline is environmentally
   friendly owing to the low greenhouse gases emission and low energy
   requirements. This work is a comprehensive evaluation of transportation
   petroleum gas in liquid state and compressible liquid state concerning
   LPG density, temperature and pressure, flow velocity, and pump energy
   consumption under the impact of different ambient temperatures.
   Inevitably, the pipeline surface exchanges heat between LPG and
   surrounding soil owing to the temperature difference and change in
   elevation. To prevent phase change, it is important to pay attention for
   several parameters such as ambient temperature, thermal conductivity of
   pipeline materials, soil type, and change in elevation for safe,
   reliable, and economic transportation. Transporting LPG at high pressure
   requests smaller pipeline size and consumes less energy for pumps due to
   its higher density. Also, LPG transportation under moderate or low
   pressure is more likely exposed to phase change, thus more thermal
   insulation and pressure boosting stations required to maintain the phase
   envelope. The models developed in this work aim to advance the existing
   knowledge and serve as a guide for efficient design by underling the
   importance of the mentioned parameters.},

Title = {ANALYSIS OF A POSSIBILITY FOR FULFILLING PERSPECTIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR
   THE DESIGN ENERGY EFFICIENCY RATIO WITH RESPECT TO SHIP'S HULL MATERIAL
   SELECTION},
Journal = {MARINE INTELLECTUAL TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {101-106},
Abstract = {The work is devoted to solving the problem of reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions, for which the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
   proposes to use the normalized design energy efficiency ratio. To
   calculate the specified IMO ratio, the appropriate formula is
   recommended. The value obtained from it is compared with the norm, which
   is subsequently tightened according to the stages (phases) introduced.
   Achieving standard values can be done by increasing the ship's
   deadweight while maintaining the contours and displacement, and thus
   while maintaining the speed and power of the power plant. This is
   achieved by reducing the mass of a hull through the use of new
   structural materials. This work is devoted to research and analysis of
   the fundamental possibility of implementing such a path.
   Dry cargo vessel was selected as an object of study, designed for
   transportation of general and bulk cargoes. It has been established that
   the vessel does not meet the requirements of the IMO for the 3rd phase;
   therefore, calculations for new vessels were carried out in relation to
   this phase. When solving the task, the following methods were used:
   calculation of the hull as an equivalent beam, calculation of the hull
   plating mass according to the Free! Ship software program, as well as
   calculations of the ship hull displacements and stresses in the licensed
   ANSYS software. Titanium and aluminum alloys, carbon and fiberglass were
   considered as alternative materials for the steel hull and plating.
   The study showed that it is fundamentally possible to obtain compliance
   with the perspective IMO requirements for a dry cargo vessel through the
   use of alternative structural materials. The current high price of these
   materials and technologies for their use may be reduced over time.},

Abstract = {The main shoreline of the Abu Dhabi City Main Island is facing the
   Arabian (Persian) Gulf from the north-west side and is exposed to
   continuous current wave action. Therefore, a shore protection system was
   developed on this side from the Main Island. The shore protection system
   consists of onshore and offshore breakwaters, huge volumes of damped
   sand, and an artificial island known as the Lulu Island. In this study,
   the performance of the current shore protection system of Abu Dhabi City
   Main Island was evaluated using the Costal Graphical Wave (CGWAVE)
   2D-hydrodynamic model. The model can simulate the characteristics of the
   waves when they approach the breakwaters or the shoreline. Our study has
   shown that the breakwaters manage to dissipate most of the wave energy
   before the waves reach the Lulu Island, whereas this island protects the
   Abu Dhabi City shoreline by creating an elongated sea area between the
   island and the shoreline that is devoid of any wave action. The
   constructed shore protection system was also efficient in controlling
   beach erosion and flooding by damping the wave energy.},

Title = {Heterogeneity-assisted carbon dioxide storage in marine sediments},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {225},
Pages = {876-883},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Global climate change is a pressing problem caused by the accumulation
   of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Carbon
   dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is a promising component of a
   portfolio of options to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
   Meaningful capture and storage requires the permanent isolation of
   enormous amounts of CO2 away from the atmosphere. We investigate the
   effectiveness of heterogeneity-induced trapping mechanism, in potential
   synergy with a self-sealing gravitational trapping mechanism, for secure
   CO2 storage in marine sediments. We conduct the first comprehensive
   study on heterogeneous marine sediments with various thicknesses at
   various ocean depths. Prior studies of gravitational trapping have
   assumed homogeneous (deep-sea) sediments, but numerous studies suggest
   reservoir heterogeneity may enhance CO2 trapping. Heterogeneity can
   deter the upward migration of CO2 and prevent leakage through the
   seafloor into the seawater. Using geostatistically-based Monte Carlo
   simulations of CO2 transport in heterogeneous sediment, we show that
   strong spatial variability in permeability is a dominant physical
   mechanism for secure CO2 storage in marine sediments below 1.2 km water
   depth (less than half of the depth needed for the gravitational
   trapping). We identify thresholds for sediment thickness, mean
   permeability and porosity, and their relationships to meaningful
   injection rates. Our results for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico suggest that
   heterogeneity-assisted trapping has a greater areal extent with more
   than three times the CO2 storage capacity for secure offshore CO2
   storage than with gravitational trapping. These characteristics offer
   CO2 storage opportunities that are closer to coasts, more accessible,

Abstract = {Energized electron flows through biological systems sustain nature's
   complexity. They drive bacterial, archaeal, and fungal
   oxidation-reduction processes and enable to introduce CO2 and N-2 from
   the atmospheric pool. Electron flux-based food webs convert soil organic
   matter (SOM) in virgin forest and permafrost soils, over-fertilized
   agricultural land, grassland systems, compost/wastewater treatment
   plants, oceans, rain forests, savannahs, and forests of the temperate
   climate zones, and have their strategy adapted on the system in which
   they are active. Thus, the electron driving power is responsible in our
   industrializing world that carbon and nitrogen returns to the atmosphere
   presently with an annual N2O-N proportion of 0.5 to 4.2 terragrams (Tg)
   or an annual atmospheric N2O-N increase of 0.25 \%. N2O is a 300-times
   more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Nature's water-soluble soil carbon
   (C-H2O)/NO3 (-) ratio balancing is seen as a model of how N2O emissions
   could be kept in a tolerable range. Sub strategies beyond are (a) an
   annual 400-800 terragrams (Tg) photosynthate-C (90-95 \% sugars) release
   into plant rhizospheres, (b) spot-wise N enriching animal excrement and
   wide C/N ratio litter fall distributions, (c) viral shunts or life
   shortcuts to supporting O-2 consuming, N supplying, and denitrifying
   recycler communities, (d) subterranean organic-inorganic soil components
   mixing and O-2 diffusion promoting NO3 (-) formation, and (e) the
   release of nitrification inhibiting compounds as neem, karanjin, or
   specific humic acids which help in controlling nitrate formation and
   denitrification. Soil microbial transport vehicles are fungal hyphae,
   plant roots, and subterranean animals. Through their activities,
   aerobic-anaerobic gradients in the soil crumb mosaics emerge. Plant root
   intertissue spaces, animal guts, and co-transported soil crumbs where
   under carbon-dominated C-H2O/NO3 (-) ratios preferred microbes reside
   are mobile locations in well-aerated soils. In such reduction-equivalent
   surplus environments, denitrifying communities are forced to use during
   anaerobic respiration available nitrate-, nitrite ions, NO, and N2O
   economically. Though at carbon-dominated C-H2O/NO3 (-) ratios more N2O
   is reduced to N-2 than in nitrate surplus environments, a complete
   prevention of N2O emissions is not a reality and even not desirable from
   the climate point of view. After describing N2O formation and emissions
   from a compost pile, a municipal wastewater treatment plant, a
   constructed wetland, and mineral N-fertilizer, sewage sludge or
   nitrification inhibitor-stabilized N-fertilizer amended soils with their
   aerobic-anaerobic mosaics, this review tries to deduce exercisable CN
   (C-H2O/NO3) ratio shaping and N2O emission lowering strategies for
   ecologists, agriculturists, and waste managers in our industrializing
   world.},

Title = {Assessing tidal marsh resilience to sea-level rise at broad geographic

Abstract = {Tidal marshes and the ecosystem services they provide may be at risk
   from sea-level rise (SLR). Tidal marsh resilience to SLR can vary due to
   differences in local rates of SLR, geomorphology, sediment availability
   and other factors. Understanding differences in resilience is critical
   to inform coastal management and policy, but comparing resilience across
   marshes is hindered by a lack of simple, effective analysis tools.
   Quantitative, multi-metric indices are widely employed to inform
   management of benthic aquatic ecosystems, but not coastal wetlands.
   Here, we develop and apply tidal marsh resilience to sea-level rise
   (MARS) indices incorporating ten metrics that contribute to overall
   marsh resilience to SLR. We applied MARS indices to tidal marshes at 16
   National Estuarine Research Reserves across the conterminous U.S. This
   assessment revealed moderate resilience overall, although nearly all
   marshes had some indication of risk. Pacific marshes were generally more
   resilient to SLR than Atlantic ones, with the least resilient marshes
   found in southern New England. We provide a calculation tool to
   facilitate application of the MARS indices to additional marshes. MARS
   index scores can inform the choice of the most appropriate coastal
   management strategy for a marsh: moderate scores call for actions to
   enhance resilience while low scores suggest investment may be better
   directed to adaptation strategies such as creating opportunities for
   marsh migration rather than attempting to save existing marshes. The
   MARS indices thus provide a powerful new approach to evaluate tidal
   marsh resilience and to inform development of adaptation strategies in
   the face of SLR. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Societal Impact StatementEcosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is
   increasingly being used to reduce the impacts of climate change on
   vulnerable people and landscapes. The international EbA South project
   implemented EbA interventions across three countries (Mauritania, Nepal,
   the Seychelles), piloting the restoration of mountain, desert and
   coastal ecosystems to enhance the climate resilience of local
   communities. The experiences of the EbA South project across these
   distinct ecosystems and socio-economic environments provide unique
   insights into the adaptive management invariably required within EbA
   initiatives. This analysis also provides lessons on how to share
   knowledge among different stakeholders and countries to advance
   South-South cooperation.
   SummaryClimate change is having an increasingly negative impact on the
   world's most vulnerable societies. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) uses
   biodiversity and ecosystem services to help local communities adapt to
   the adverse impacts of climate change. This approach, which has the
   potential to be implemented across a wide range of ecosystem types and
   scales, is increasingly being adopted by governments and international
   donors within climate change adaptation initiatives. The objective of
   the EbA South project was to enhance the climate resilience of
   communities in Mauritania, Nepal, and the Seychelles by building
   institutional capacity, mobilizing knowledge and transferring EbA
   technologies based on China's experience in successfully implementing
   restoration. The project implemented EbA interventions in the drylands
   of Mauritania, Himalayan forests in Nepal, and the coastal zone of the
   Seychelles. All interventions were carefully monitored by researchers to
   generate scientific evidence of the impacts of EbA. Here, we provide
   implementers of EbA with the major lessons learned from the EbA South
   project, namely: (a) quantifying the full suite of ecosystem goods and
   services generated through EbA at a landscape scale; (b) budgeting in
   advance for management of time-consuming complexities related to
   socioeconomics and ecology such as land-use conflict, ineffective
   government structures, disagreements regarding intervention options, and
   challenging environmental conditions; (c) undertaking long-term research
   for adaptive management and documenting the project's successes; (d)
   providing platforms for effective communication and collaboration among
   stakeholders with different first languages; and (e) regularly adjusting
   exit strategies for maintenance of the EbA landscapes after closure of
   the project.},

Abstract = {Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests of the
   tropics. They are highly productive ecosystems with rates of primary
   production equal to those of tropical humid evergreen forests and coral
   reefs. Although mangroves occupy only 0.5\% of the global coastal area,
   they contribute 10-15\% (24 Tg C y(-1)) to coastal sediment carbon
   storage and export 10-11\% of the particulate terrestrial carbon to the
   ocean. Their disproportionate contribution to carbon sequestration is
   now perceived as a means for conservation and restoration and a way to
   help ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions. Of immediate concern are
   potential carbon losses to deforestation (90-970 Tg C y(-1)) that are
   greater than these ecosystems' rates of carbon storage. Large reservoirs
   of dissolved inorganic carbon in deep soils, pumped via subsurface
   pathways to adjacent waterways, are a large loss of carbon, at a
   potential rate up to 40\% of annual primary production. Patterns of
   carbon allocation and rates of carbon flux in mangrove forests are
   nearly identical to those of other tropical forests.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most important issues our world faces today
   and it is responsible for a number of natural disasters that threaten
   human life and existence. Carbon dioxide, produced from almost every
   energy consuming activity, is the dominant greenhouse gas responsible
   for global warming. Water desalination is an energy intensive activity,
   and when it is powered by conventional energy sources, significant
   amounts of CO2 are released. For every cubic metre of fresh water
   produced, there is a 2 kg of CO2 reduction if renewable energy sources
   (RES) are used instead of electricity from the local grid. On the other
   hand, the cost of fresh water produced by desalination is much less if
   conventional sources of energy are used.
   Making appropriate policy choices require information on both costs and
   benefits. So here we estimate the critical CO2 cost, above which
   desalination units should use renewable energy instead of conventional
   energy sources. It was found that the critical CO2 emissions cost can be
   close to the CO2 capture cost and in many cases less than the penalties
   imposed by the European Commission. Several case studies of water
   desalination in the Aegean islands verify the conclusions. (C) 2010

Abstract = {The academic literature on climate change communications is growing.
   However, the majority of this literature focuses on the issue of climate
   change mitigation in a developed country context, and there is little
   published material regarding communication in a developing country and
   adaptation context. Similarly, despite community-based approaches to
   climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction increasing in the
   Pacific Islands region, there is very limited guidance on how to
   effectively communicate climate change in a way that enhances people's
   resilience. This paper documents the experiences of organisations,
   including local and international non-government and faith-based
   organisations, governments, regional technical organisations and donor
   agencies in communicating climate change for adaptation in the Pacific
   region. Three key climate change communication challenges are
   highlighted and suggestions made for overcoming them based on results
   from interviews, a focus group discussion and an online forum. Finally,
   recommendations are made for good practice guidance in climate change
   communication that is empowering and culturally relevant.},

Title = {Production of hydrogen from offshore wind in China and cost-competitive
   supply to Japan},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {The Japanese government has announced a commitment to net-zero
   greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It envisages an important role for
   hydrogen in the nation's future energy economy. This paper explores the
   possibility that a significant source for this hydrogen could be
   produced by electrolysis fueled by power generated from offshore wind in
   China. Hydrogen could be delivered to Japan either as liquid, or bound
   to a chemical carrier such as toluene, or as a component of ammonia. The
   paper presents an analysis of factors determining the ultimate cost for
   this hydrogen, including expenses for production, storage, conversion,
   transport, and treatment at the destination. It concludes that the
   Chinese source could be delivered at a volume and cost consistent with
   Japan's idealized future projections.
   Hydrogen is regarded as important to Japan's clean energy transition.
   Here the authors consider the production of hydrogen by electrolysis
   fueled by offshore wind power in China, and the potential for delivery
   to Japan as part of Japan's transition.},

Abstract = {Preindustrial changes in the Asian summer monsoon climate from the 1700s
   to the 1850s were estimated with an atmospheric general circulation
   model (AGCM) using historical global land cover/use change data
   reconstructed for the last 300 years. Extended cultivation resulted in a
   decrease in monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent and
   southeastern China and an associated weakening of the Asian summer
   monsoon circulation. The precipitation decrease in India was marked and
   was consistent with the observational changes derived from examining the
   Himalayan ice cores for the concurrent period. Between the 1700s and the
   1850s, the anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases and aerosols were
   still minor; also, no long-term trends in natural climate variations,
   such as those caused by the ocean, solar activity, or volcanoes, were
   reported. Thus, we propose that the land cover/use change was the major
   source of disturbances to the climate during that period. This report
   will set forward quantitative examination of the actual impacts of land
   cover/use changes on Asian monsoons, relative to the impact of
   greenhouse gases and aerosols, viewed in the context of global warming
   on the interannual, decadal, and centennial time scales.},

   to analyze the model energy efficiency. In order to evaluate the
   feasibility and availability of the proposed model, experimental data
   acquired from the solar photovoltaic system testing, in a real-world
   large ro-ro ship, was collected and compared with the model output. The
   fuel consumption with and without the use of the solar photovoltaic
   system was used to analyze the ship's energy efficiency. The comparison
   results demonstrate that the proposed energy efficiency model for marine

Abstract = {Stratospheric water vapour (SWV), as a greenhouse gas, modulates the
   radiative energy budget of the climate system. It is sensitive to, and
   plays a significant role in the climate change. In this study, we
   investigate the SWV response to CO2 increase with the Whole Atmosphere
   Community Climate Model (WACCM). In addition, we study its possible
   feedback on stratospheric temperature and relevant mechanisms. In our
   model experiments, the CO2 concentration and sea surface temperature
   (SSTs) are changed at the same time, as well as separately, to enable
   separating the radiative-photochemical and dynamical response to CO2
   doubling scenarios. The model results show that the response of SWV to
   CO2 doubling is dominated by the changes in the SSTs, with an increase
   of the SWV concentration by similar to 6 to 10\% in most of the
   stratosphere and more than 10\% in the lower stratosphere, except for
   winter pole in the lower stratosphere, where the CO2 doubling decreases
   water vapour. The increase of SWV is mostly due to a dynamical response
   to the warm SSTs. Doubled CO2 induces warm SSTs globally and further
   leads to moist troposphere and a warmer tropical and subtropical
   tropopause, resulting in more water vapour entering stratosphere from
   below. As a greenhouse gas, large increase of SWV in the lower
   stratosphere, in turn, affects the stratospheric temperature, resulting
   in a warming of the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere,
   offsetting the cooling caused by CO2 doubling.},

Abstract = {While Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) face many
   challenges in their pursuit of sustainable resource development, climate
   change is among the most pressing and least addressed. Research has
   identified a host of expected or ongoing physical, biological,
   ecological, and social impacts of climate change on the marine
   environment, creating a strong climate change adaptation imperative for
   RFMOs. Through a case study of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
   Commission (IATTC), we describe two serious limitations of current RFMO
   climate change adaptation strategies: (1) a weakened efficacy of
   resource management and conservation policies caused by viewing climate
   change as a general climate stressor rather than a unique environmental
   challenge, and (2) a reliance on incremental policy reform, problematic
   because it may not enable a pace or scale of policy change proportional
   to the sustainable development challenges created by a rapidly changing
   ocean. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of incrementalism and
   outline potential solutions to the environmental and structural
   challenges facing the IATTC and other RFMOs, including the concept of
   adaptation pathways.},

Abstract = {The electrical energy consumption is expanding all over the globe and
   the gap between the demand of electrical power and generation is
   escalating day by day. In addition to conventional power generation,
   renewable energy systems are being integrated to meet the rising demand
   of electrical power. To provide reliable, cost effective power solutions
   and to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions effectively renewable energy
   resources such as solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal etc are more
   viable.
   The design of hybrid renewable energy system with battery backup has
   been proposed in this paper. For this hybrid system, the meteorological
   data of Solar Radiation, hourly wind speed for the Department of
   Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological
   University Hyderabad, Jagityal (Latitude18 degrees 26' N, longitude is
   79 degrees 7' E) are taken to meet the primary load of 100Kwh/day, 28Kw
   peak load. The technical performance of each component has been
   evaluated and finally sensitivity analysis is performed to optimize the
   proposed system at different conditions. The local solar radiation, wind
   data and load were analyzed and simulated in HOMER to assess the
   technical and economic viability of the integrated system.},

Abstract = {All renewable energy systems make some contribution to climate change.
   This is due to fuel combusted for their construction and as back up
   energy during their operation. Accurate calculation of greenhouse gas
   emission per kilowatt hour of electricity is difficult but is an
   important part of policy making and planning. This study, an attempt has
   been made to analyze and review the development and potential of wind
   and solar energy in India. LCA has been carried out for the on shore
   wind turbine and poly crystalline PV module. Based on the past studies,
   life cycle inventory data has been collected for the investigation.
   Using that data, the detailed investigation has been made for the
   existing grid connected 1.65 MW wind turbine project in and around
   Udumalpet, Tamil Nadu and 25 kW Roof top solar PV Power plant at Sewa
   Bhawan, New Delhi. Carbon intensity, energy pay back period and carbon
   pay back period for the above system have been calculated and compared
   with each other. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper presents the energy output of wind farms in terms of
   unadjusted energy, gross energy, renewable energy delivered, specific
   yield and wind farm capacity factor. The analysis also includes the
   comparison of energy output from two methods: (i) the RETScreen model
   and (ii) the actual frequency and wind turbine power curve. The energy
   output analysis is done using three wind energy conversion systems of
   rated capacity 600, 1000, and 1500 M. The study is performed for 30 MW
   installed capacity wind farms at five coastal locations in Saudi Arabia.
   Furthermore, the RETScreen software is also used to perform the
   economical feasibility study of the wind farms at these locations. The
   study concludes that of the five wind parks, Yanbo and Dhahran are the
   only two sites where wind park development is economically feasible.
   Finally, wind park development at Yanbo will result in a reduction in
   greenhouse gases of 31369, 23601, and 26087 tons each year,
   corresponding to 1500, 1000, and 600 M machine wind parks, respectively.
   On the other hand, at Dhahran, installation of wind machines of 1500,
   1000, and 600 M sizes will reduce the GHGs by 26183, 19247, and 21533
   tons per year. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Demand of energy is increasing continuously due to rapid development in
   industrialization, population, economic growth, and rising living
   standards. Therefore, energy production is very important for living
   things, human and industrial activities. Hydrogen is a clean energy that
   has a great potential to be an alternative fuel. Hydrogen is an
   environmentally friendly fuel that possesses a high energy yield,
   provides clean energy generation without pollution when burned in air,
   and produces no greenhouse gases when combusted. It is an odorless,
   colorless, tasteless, and non-poisonous gas. Hydrogen is a sustainable
   energy system, which is produced from available sources and is used in
   every application where fossil fuels are being used in transportation,
   residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, and for electricity
   generation. In nature, some microorganisms with biological processes can
   produce hydrogen gas. In this review, biohydrogen production from
   industrial waste substrate, microbial producers, bioprocessing
   strategies, and the recent developments are discussed with their

Abstract = {Following the latest trends in the research, development and promotion
   of clean energy technologies in order to solve serious problems of
   increased electricity consumption, greenhouse gases emissions, global
   warming and climate change, the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi
   Sad has designed the concept of microgrid based on application of
   different types of distributed energy resources. This paper presents the
   concept of the idea project of a faculty microgrid consisting of 2
   photovoltaic power plants, 2 wind turbines, biogas microturbine for
   combined heat and power production, 2 electric vehicles as prosumers,
   battery energy storage system, microgrid microcontroller, interface for
   connecting the microgrid to the main distribution grid, and electricity
   consumers. In order to enable and ensure the stable operation of the
   microgrid in the island mode, the technical specifications of the energy
   devices, control devices and measuring equipment that have been
   installed and planned are also analyzed and presented. The paper
   presents a techno-economic and environmental analysis of the application
   of the faculty microgrid, with a special focus on the annual energy
   production, investment costs and avoided CO2 emissions realized through
   the use of proposed distributed energy sources.},

Abstract = {Over the modern satellite era, substantial climatic changes have been
   observed in the Antarctic, including atmospheric and oceanic warming,
   ice sheet thinning and a general Antarctic-wide expansion of sea ice,
   followed by a more recent rapid loss. Although these changes, featuring
   strong zonal asymmetry, are partially influenced by increasing
   greenhouse gas emissions and stratospheric ozone depletion,
   tropical-polar teleconnections are believed to have a role through
   Rossby wave dynamics. In this Review, we synthesize understanding of
   tropical teleconnections to the Southern Hemisphere extratropics arising
   from the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
   and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, focusing on the mechanisms and
   long-term climatic impacts. These teleconnections have contributed to
   observed Antarctic and Southern Ocean changes, including regional rapid
   surface warming, pre-2015 sea ice expansion and its sudden reduction
   thereafter, changes in ocean heat content and accelerated thinning of
   most of the Antarctic ice sheet. However, due to limited observations
   and inherent model biases, uncertainties remain in understanding and
   assessing the importance of these teleconnections versus those arising
   from greenhouse gases, ozone recovery and internal variability.
   Sustained pan-Antarctic efforts towards long-term observations, and more
   realistic dynamics and parameterizations in high-resolution climate
   models, offer opportunities to reduce these uncertainties.
   Tropical teleconnections can influence polar climates through the
   generation of stationary Rossby waves. This Review outlines the dynamics
   and impacts of long-term tropical-polar connections on the Antarctic
   climate, which include warming trends and ice mass loss in West
   Antarctica.},

Abstract = {Aquaculture ponds are potentially large sources of atmospheric methane
   (CH4) that can exacerbate climate change. A thorough understanding of
   various CH4 biogeochemical processes occurring in the ponds is essential
   for the prediction and management of CH4 emissions arising from
   aquaculture. However, the variations in pond CH4 biogeochemical
   processes among estuaries and aquaculture stages remain poorly
   understood. In this study, we assessed the net sediment release,
   oxidation, and dissolved concentrations of CH4 in aquaculture ponds in
   two subtropical estuaries among three shrimp growth stages in Southeast
   China. Overall, porewater CH4 concentrations and sediment CH4 release
   rates varied greatly among different stages in the order: middle stage >
   final stage > initial stage. Water column CH4 concentrations and
   overlying water CH4 oxidation rates showed an increasing trend over the
   study period. Sediment CH4 release rates and dissolved CH4
   concentrations also varied considerably between the two estuaries. In
   the more saline Jiulong River Estuary, sediment CH4 release rate was
   lower while the shrimp survival rate and yield were higher as compared
   to the Min River Estuary with a lower water salinity. Our results
   suggest that both high water salinity and feed utilization efficiency
   can effectively mitigate CH4 emissions from the coastal shrimp ponds.
   Overall, the large magnitude of net CH4 emissions observed in our shrimp
   ponds highlights the urgency of formulating appropriate policies and
   building sustainable institutions that can strike a balance between
   land-based aquaculture development and greenhouse gas mitigation in the
   subtropical coastal regions.},

Abstract = {One inevitable consequence of climate change is the rising sea level,
   which could adversely affect critical infrastructures in the coastal
   regions. Thirteen percent of the world population and 39\% of the U.S.
   population resides in such coastal regions. Specifically, water
   resources and supporting water infrastructure in many coastal regions
   have become increasingly vulnerable to both quality and capacity issues.
   For example, nuisance-flooding events in low-lying coastal cities and
   salt-water intrusion into drinking water aquifers are becoming more
   frequent occurrences with rising sea levels. Several coastal states have
   already devised and implemented water infrastructure adaptation measures
   to effectively address the current and anticipated challenges of sea
   level rise. This paper presents the preliminary results of a
   comprehensive synthesis of water infrastructure adaptation practices in
   several coastal communities. A detailed review of policy documents
   published by various local, state and federal water infrastructure
   related agencies in the U.S. are reviewed to develop the database of
   water infrastructure adaptation strategies described in this paper.},

Abstract = {Fossil fuels (petroleum oil, natural gas) are the only type of fuel used
   for electric power generation to desalt seawater in Kuwait, Gulf
   Cooperation Countries (GCC), and all Arab Countries. The main
   constituents of fossil fuel are carbon (C) and hydrogen (H-2) besides
   small portions of impurities such as sulphur (S), nitrogen (N-2), oxygen
   (O-2), water moisture and particulate matters (ashes). When the fossil
   fuel is combusted (i.e. reacted with the oxygen in the air to generate
   heat), the produced gases include mainly carbon dioxide (CO2). water
   vapour, carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide
   (NO). The CO, SO2 and NO gases pollute the air and are harmful to human
   health and the environment. CO2 is the main component of the greenhouse
   gases (GHG) which cause global warming. The emission of CO2, CO and NO
   gases from power plants to the environment creates great international
   concern. The basics of the environmental issues related to fossil fuel
   combustion and its released gases are outlined in this paper. The
   emitted gases due to fuel combustion to produce electric power and
   distilled water in Kuwait and some Arab and other countries are
   calculated. The mitigation of GHG is also discussed.},

Title = {A possible Protocol to the Cape Town Convention on renewable energy
   equipment},
Journal = {UNIFORM LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {242-269},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The International Institute for the Unification of Private Law is
   currently considering the feasibility of a possible Protocol to the
   Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (Cape Town
   Convention) on matters specific to renewable energy equipment. The
   protection of the world climate requires global cooperation. A switch
   from fossil energy resources to the increased generation of energy from
   renewable resources can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but meeting the
   worldwide targets for an increased market share for renewables requires
   an enormous investment in renewable energy equipment. The secured
   transactions regime of the Cape Town Convention system whose strong
   protection of the secured creditor allows a reduction in borrowing costs
   for the financing of high-value equipment could facilitate such
   financing. Even though renewable energy equipment, such as wind
   turbines, solar panels, and other assets used in hydropower, geothermal,
   or biomass projects, is typically stationary and differs from the types
   of high-value mobile assets covered by the Cape Town Convention system
   so far, the general principles of this system are flexible enough to
   allow its extension to renewable energy equipment in general. Different
   categories of renewable energy equipment, however, are subject to
   different financing practices, and the legal issues they face are not
   identical. The strongest demand for a Protocol on renewable energy
   equipment would certainly be in the area of offshore wind energy
   equipment. In the interests of the viability of such a Protocol as an
   international instrument, other categories of renewable energy equipment
   should be included as well, but this requires a thorough assessment of
   whether these potentially involve conflicts between the rights of
   different secured creditors that could be solved under the rules of the
   Cape Town Convention and whether financing practices in project finance
   transactions could benefit from the availability of an additional
   security interest under international law.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) is expected, even without greenhouse gas emissions.
   As SLR is inevitable, adapting to its impacts has received increasing
   attention, and local governments are the key actors in this emerging
   agenda. This study indicates that adaptation planning for SLR should be
   integrated into two local major planning mechanisms in the United
   States: the local comprehensive plans and hazard mitigation plans. By
   evaluating 36 plans from 15 US coastal cities that are considered at
   high risk and vulnerable to rising sea levels, the results demonstrate
   that SLR is widely identified, but the overall quality of the plans to
   address it requires significant improvement. A detailed table of
   selected plans' characteristics is also provided as a lens on how
   localities tackle this challenging issue. The paper concludes with
   planning suggestions for coastal communities to better adapt to SLR.},

Title = {Evaluating a multispecies adaptive management framework: must
   uncertainty impede effective decision-making?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {50},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1431-1440},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Application of adaptive management to complex natural resource systems
   requires careful evaluation to ensure that the process leads to improved
   decision-making. As part of that evaluation, adaptive policies can be
   compared with alternative nonadaptive management scenarios. Also, the
   value of reducing structural (ecological) uncertainty to achieving
   management objectives can be quantified.
   A multispecies adaptive management framework was recently adopted by the
   Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission for sustainable harvest of
   Delaware Bay horseshoe crabs Limulus polyphemus, while maintaining
   adequate stopover habitat for migrating red knots Calidris canutus rufa,
   the focal shorebird species. The predictive model set encompassed the
   structural uncertainty in the relationships between horseshoe crab
   spawning, red knot weight gain and red knot vital rates. Stochastic
   dynamic programming was used to generate a state-dependent strategy for
   harvest decisions given that uncertainty. In this paper, we employed a
   management strategy evaluation approach to evaluate the performance of
   this adaptive management framework. Active adaptive management was used
   by including model weights as state variables in the optimization and
   reducing structural uncertainty by model weight updating.
   We found that the value of information for reducing structural
   uncertainty is expected to be low, because the uncertainty does not
   appear to impede effective management. Harvest policy responded to
   abundance levels of both species regardless of uncertainty in the
   specific relationship that generated those abundances. Thus, the
   expected horseshoe crab harvest and red knot abundance were similar when
   the population generating model was uncertain or known, and harvest
   policy was robust to structural uncertainty as specified.
   Synthesis and applications.The combination of management strategy
   evaluation with state-dependent strategies from stochastic dynamic
   programming was an informative approach to evaluate adaptive management
   performance and value of learning. Although natural resource decisions
   are characterized by uncertainty, not all uncertainty will cause
   decisions to be altered substantially, as we found in this case. It is
   important to incorporate uncertainty into the decision framing and
   evaluate the effect of reducing that uncertainty on achieving the
   desired outcomes.},

Title = {Responding to sea level rise: challenges and opportunities to govern

Journal = {MARITIME STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Coastal cities in parts of Indonesia are subject to many compounding
   pressures, including increasing population and industrial agglomeration,
   and are experiencing greater levels of relative sea level rise (SLR)
   given the impacts of climate change and large-scale subsidence. The
   sustainability and resilience of many coastal cities is being tested as
   they struggle to integrate many socio-technical, political and
   ecological dependencies within the city with the surrounding coastal
   environment. Governments at all levels have implemented a diversity of
   strategies to arrest relative sea level rise, but given the `wicked'
   nature of this problem, both policy solutions, proposed and implemented,
   have rarely achieved the outcomes needed. To a large extent, this is
   attributed to the ineffective governance framework which has led to
   policy failure, with multiple actors being motivated by different
   legislative, political, financial and social interests who prioritize
   specific beneficiaries and solutions. This article examines the
   governance challenges associated with sea level rise through case
   studies in Semarang and Demak, Indonesia. It highlights significant
   barriers that impede effective coastal adaptation including (1) the
   policy and motivations of differing levels of government. This includes
   a national government that emphasizes mega-infrastructure projects, a
   regional government that lacks the capacity and resources to address
   groundwater extraction and a local government that seeks low-cost hybrid
   engineering solutions given their financial and budgetary constraints;
   and (2) ipso facto a lack of coordination across scale, jurisdiction and
   sectors. This article also highlights several opportunities for
   community and civil society participation in nature-based solution (NBS)
   practices and implementation. This article finds that effective
   adaptation strategies in coastal areas require an integrated governance
   framework to improve policy implementation and coordination.},

Title = {Ecosystem carbon losses following a climate-induced mangrove mortality

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Drought events may induce mangrove mortality and dieback events
   worldwide as a result of climate extremes. As mangroves sequester large
   quantities of carbon, quantifying the losses of these stocks following
   climate disturbances may guide wetland governance strategies globally.
   In Southeast Brazil, we determined the total ecosystem carbon stocks
   (TECS) of pristine mangroves that were up to 1851 Mg of carbon per
   hectare (Mg C ha(-1)), which are the highest stocks measured from South
   American and raising estimates of Brazil's mangrove TECS to 0.52 Pg C. A
   mangrove mortality event in the same estuary resulted in a 14.6 \%
   decrease in TECS (270.5 Mg C ha(-1)) and loss of 20 \% of mangrove soil
   carbon within less than 2-years. Carbon dioxide emissions from this
   impact were 992.8 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1), which are slightly lower than
   emissions from land use disturbances on mangroves worldwide. Our results
   suggest that climate effects on mangroves can become significant sources
   of greenhouse gases globally.},

Title = {Gendered consequences of mobility for adaptation in small island

Journal = {ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {In recent years island communities have actively adapted in response to
   a complex combination of changes that has shaped life on the islands,
   and this has had gendered consequences. The gender ramifications of
   adaptation on islands are still largely neglected in adaptation
   policies, although they are increasingly being addressed in the
   scientific literature. Understanding gendered consequences is
   indispensable for a critical comprehension of adaptation on islands. It
   would help avoid the formulation of adaptation policies that tend to
   focus only on technical problems and solutions. Such solutions
   potentially run the risk of reducing island problems to only biophysical
   issues such as sea level rise or problems attributed to the size and
   isolation of the islands. This paper investigates the consequences of
   adaptation for the mobility of both women and men on two islands in the
   Maldives, a small island developing state (SIDS) that has experienced
   unprecedented changes in recent decades. The focus on mobility stems
   from the fact that it forms an integral social and cultural part of
   island life. Although gender and mobility are intrinsically linked, the
   gendered consequences of adaptation for mobility are understudied. This
   study used qualitative interviews to collect narratives. The results
   show that the adaptation interviewees describe from their living memory
   has only exacerbated gender inequality by influencing the mobility of
   men and women in different ways.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Climate change causes global effects on multiple levels. The
   anthropogenic input of greenhouse gases increases the atmospheric mean
   temperature. It furthermore leads to a higher probability of extreme
   weather events (e.g., heat waves, floods) and thus strongly impacts the
   habitats of humans, animals, and plants. Against this background,
   research and innovation activities are increasingly focusing on
   potential health-related aspects and feasible adaptation and mitigation
   strategies. Progressing urbanization and demographic change paired with
   the climate change-induced heat island effect exposes humans living in
   urban habitats to increasing health risks. By employing scientometric
   methods, this scoping study provides a systematic bird's eye view on the
   epistemic landscapes of climate change, its health-related effects, and
   possible technological and nature-based interventions and strategies in
   order to make urban areas climate proof. Based on a literature corpus
   consisting of 2614 research articles collected in SCOPUS, we applied
   network-based analysis and visualization techniques to map the different
   scientific communities, discourses and their interrelations. From a
   public health perspective, the results demonstrate the range of either
   direct or indirect health effects of climate change. Furthermore, the
   results indicate that a public health-related scientific discourse is
   converging with an urban planning and building science driven discourse
   oriented towards urban blue and green infrastructure. We conclude that
   this development might mirror the socio-political demand to tackle
   emerging climate change-induced challenges by transgressing disciplinary
   boundaries.},

Abstract = {Recent International Maritime Organization (IMO) decisions with respect
   to measures to reduce the emissions from maritime greenhouse gases
   (GHGs) suggest that the collaboration of all major stakeholders of
   shipbuilding and ship operations is required to address this complex
   techno-economical and highly political problem efficiently. This calls
   eventually for the development of proper design, operational knowledge,
   and assessment tools for the energy-efficient design and operation of
   ships, as suggested by the Second IMO GHG Study (2009). This type of
   coordination of the efforts of many maritime stakeholders, with often
   conflicting professional interests but ultimately commonly aiming at
   optimal ship design and operation solutions, has been addressed within a
   methodology developed in the EU-funded Logistics-Based (LOGBASED) Design
   Project (2004-2007). Based on the knowledge base developed within this
   project, a new parametric design software tool (PDT) has been developed
   by the National Technical University of Athens, Ship Design Laboratory
   (NTUA-SDL), for implementing an energy efficiency design and management
   procedure. The PDT is an integral part of an earlier developed holistic
   ship design optimization approach by NTUA-SDL that addresses the
   multi-objective ship design optimization problem. It provides
   Pareto-optimum solutions and a complete mapping of the design space in a
   comprehensive way for the final assessment and decision by all the
   involved stakeholders. The application of the tool to the design of a
   large oil tanker and alternatively to container ships is elaborated in
   the presented paper.},

Title = {Emission and absorption of greenhouse gases generated from marine shrimp
   production (Litopeneaus vannamei) in high salinity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {367-376},

Abstract = {This study aimed at identifying and quantifying greenhouse gas fluxes
   (CH4, CO2, and N2O) in Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp nurseries submitted
   to different culturing conditions. The experiment was carried out with a
   completely randomized design, with two treatments and four simultaneous
   replicates, totaling eight experimental units. Two management systems
   were tested. The first one (M1) used a stocking density of 92
   shrimp/m(2) and fertilizer maintenance through the application of
   calcium nitrate and molasses. The second one (M2) used a stocking
   density of 14 shrimp/m(2) without fertilizer maintenance. Feeding in
   both treatments consisted in supplying ration through the volley method.
   The results showed that there were variations in the pattern of gas
   emission in both treatments and in the concentrations of the evaluated
   gases. The recorded mean values of total gas flux were -314.87
   mg/m(2)/day of CH4, -3773.51 mg/m(2)/day of CO2, and 2.47 mg/m(2)/day of
   N2O in M1; and 653.89 mg/m(2)/day of CH4, 497.52 mg/m(2)/day of CO2, and
   25.59 mg/m(2)/day of N2O in M2. The results obtained in this study
   suggest that environmental and management conditions interfere with the
   cultivation system, which acts as either a source or drainage of gases.
   These emissions from shrimp farming are potentially critical, mainly due
   to (NO)-O-2 emissions, when compared to emissions from other production
   systems. Conversely, the cultivation of L. vannamei, particularly when
   carried out with the use of organic fertilizers such as molasses,
   presented a potential absorption of gases such as CH4 and CO2. The
   greatest fluxes of gases occurred at the beginning of the cultivation
   due to the initial fertilization. In addition, the contribution of
   molasses probably favored denitrification and increased natural
   productivity, which may have contributed to a lower emission of these
   gases compared to emissions of other systems where molasses was not
   used. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sun exposure, nest temperature and loggerhead turtle hatchlings:
   Implications for beach shading management strategies at sea turtle
   rookeries},

Abstract = {Sea turtle incubation biology is tightly linked to nest thermal
   conditions due to the effect temperature has on hatching success, sex
   determination, morphology and locomotion performance. Because of this
   relationship between nest temperature and hatchling outcomes, global
   warming presents an immediate threat to many sea turtle nesting beaches
   throughout the world. Even small rises in nest temperatures may skew sex
   ratios and, raise egg mortality and influence hatchling phenotypes
   adversely, impacting on hatchling recruitment and ultimately species
   survival at some rookeries. The development of adaptive management
   practices capable of minimizing the effects of increasing global
   temperature on nest temperatures is thus a priority for animals
   exhibiting temperature-dependent sex-determination, such as sea turtles.
   Here, the relationship between solar radiation exposure and nest
   temperatures at the Mon Repos turtle rookery, south east Queensland,
   Australia was explored and the relationship between nest temperature and
   hatchling attributes examined. Shading decreased nest temperature, and
   higher nest temperatures were associated with smaller sized hatchlings
   that had decreased locomotion performance. The use of shading to
   minimize nest temperature is a management strategy that may be used to
   mitigate detrimental effects of increased global temperatures at some
   rookeries. Here, we explored the viability of natural shading options,
   such as the planting of trees behind nesting beaches, for combating the
   adverse effect of increased nest temperature caused by increased air
   temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Constraints on radiative forcing and future climate change from

Journal = {NATURE},

Volume = {416},
Number = {6882},
Pages = {719-723},

Abstract = {The assessment of uncertainties in global warming projections is often
   based on expert judgement, because a number of key variables in climate
   change are poorly quantified. In particular, the sensitivity of climate
   to changing greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere and the
   radiative forcing effects by aerosols are not well constrained, leading
   to large uncertainties in global warming simulations(1). Here we present
   a Monte Carlo approach to produce probabilistic climate projections,
   using a climate model of reduced complexity. The uncertainties in the
   input parameters and in the model itself are taken into account, and
   past observations of oceanic and atmospheric warming are used to
   constrain the range of realistic model responses. We obtain a
   probability density function for the present-day total radiative
   forcing, giving 1.4 to 2.4 W m(-2) for the 5-95 per cent confidence
   range, narrowing the global-mean indirect aerosol effect to the range of
   0 to -1.2 W m(-2). Ensemble simulations for two illustrative emission
   scenarios suggest a 40 per cent probability that global-mean surface
   temperature increase will exceed the range predicted by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but only a 5 per cent
   probability that warming will fall below that range.},

Title = {REDUCING CLIMATE IMPACTS ON WATER RESOURCES AS THE LEGAL AND ECONOMIC
   BASIS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY IN THE EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES: THE CASE
   OF UKRAINE},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {As climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, the
   legal and economic issues of global environmental security deserve high
   praise. In the area of industrial competitiveness, where the negative
   effects of global climate change include floods and droughts, forest
   fires, and rising sea levels, climate change is highly problematic.
   Climate impacts affect public and private agricultural infrastructure
   (including the coastal zone), resulting in lost productivity and
   increased costs for agriculture. The article applies climate change on a
   global scale in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to determine
   how the mixtures and emissions of any one entity affect other areas
   (e.g., individual, community, company or country emissions). Exploring
   the theoretical and practical premises of climate change as a complex
   phenomenon, the novelty of this article is that it examines the current
   framework of the environmental-legal concept, not just the political
   implications of the legal framework. The research aim of the article
   lies in two dimensions: the European Union's current climate change
   policy framework (the climate and energy package, a set of climate
   change strategies and related policies targeting EU candidate
   countries); recent environmental operations in Ukraine as an EU
   candidate country under extraordinary conditions. This article examines
   recent changes in climate legislation and climate policy in EU member
   and candidate countries, as well as other highly developed countries,
   such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and China. Focusing on
   the impact of the EU Climate and Energy Package (2020 and 2030), this
   article examines the main implications of EU climate legislation
   regulating the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and promoting the role of
   renewable energy in global energy consumption and energy efficiency in
   general. As a result of this study, this analysis offers multifaceted
   conclusions based on the interaction of a number of current
   administrative acts on climate change and environmental policy on a
   global scale.},

Abstract = {The use of renewable energy is increasing all over the world. These
   resources provide clean energy without giving rise to pollution. Current
   study discussed the feasibility of providing electricity by using hybrid
   power system (photovoltaic/wind/diesel) to a distant hypothetical
   village, population of 100 households with an average of five family
   members per household. The study area, Nooriabad, lies in Sind, Pakistan
   (latitude=25.17 degrees N, longitude=67.8 degrees E and site
   elevation=180m above the mean sea level). Current study showed that the
   proposed hybrid system could be a viable solution for off-grid supply of
   electric power to remote areas in Pakistan. In the present case, a daily
   energy consumption of 205kWh and a peak power demand of 47kW were
   considered. The implementation of this project will result in the
   reduction of 69\% in greenhouse gases addition in the local atmosphere
   of the chosen site. The photovoltaic/wind/diesel/battery hybrid system
   is found to be an attractive option with levelized cost of energy of
   0.45 \$/kWh and with renewable energy penetration of 84\%. The
   sensitivity analysis showed that photovoltaic/wind/diesel/battery hybrid
   configuration is the only feasible system under given variations of
   different parameters.},

   assessment of the feasibility of the adaptation measures implemented by
   the farmers. First, it classified adaptation measures into specific
   categories: technology based, farm-based crop management,
   ecosystem-based adaptation, off-farm income diversification, and other
   measures. Second, it developed a multi-criteria assessment tool on
   adaptation measures based on stakeholder analysis and expert judgment
   based on four major feasibility criteria. Third, it determined the level
   of adaptation based on the combination of measures and the feasibility
   of the chosen measures by constructing a measure-based adaptation index
   (MAI). Finally, it came up with a model showing the factors influencing
   the MAI of the farmers. The results revealed that adaptation takes place
   at different levels in the two countries based on the diversity of
   measures, the feasibility of the various measures, and the varying
   conditions of saltwater inundation. The empirical evidence provides
   systematic support for the hypothesis that adaptation measures are
   influenced by a confluence of social, institutional, and economic
   factors.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases on
   earth and its continuous emission by manmade activities is leading to a
   rise in atmospheric temperature. On the other hand, various natural
   phenomena exist that contribute to the sequestration of atmospheric
   carbon dioxide, i. e. its capture and long-term storage. These phenomena
   include oceanic, geological and chemical processes happening on earth.
   In addition to the above-mentioned nonbiological methods, various
   biological methods viz. soil carbon sequestration and phytosequestration
   have also been contributing to fixation of atmospheric carbon.
   Phytosequestration is mainly performed by several photosynthetic
   mechanisms such as C-3, C-4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)
   pathways of plants, carboxysomes of cyanobacteria and pyrenoids of
   microalgae. For an effective mitigation of global climate change, it is
   required to stabilize the CO2 concentration to viable levels. It
   requires various permutations and combinations of naturally existing and
   engineering strategies. Although numerous strategies are in commodious
   use in the present times, the issues of sustainability and long-term
   stability still exist. We present an overview of the natural and manmade
   biological and nonbiological processes used today to reduce atmospheric
   CO2 levels and discuss the scope and limitations of each of them.},

Abstract = {Climate change is very basic and appears on earth. Climate change has
   become an issue that must be faced by humans today and in the future.
   One of the impacts of climate change can be found in coastal areas.
   Tsunamis and tidal floods repeatedly occur in coastal areas. One of the
   efforts to overcome sea level rise that causes tsunamis, erosion, and
   tidal flooding is mangrove forests. This study aims to determine public
   awareness of the occurrence of tidal flooding and tsunami and to find an
   easy and inexpensive way to overcome it. This research is integrated
   using the partial least square (PLS) approach and the coastal
   vulnerability index (CVI) approach to mangrove forests. The results
   showed that the awareness and assessment of the community to carry out
   mangrove forest restoration to overcome disasters caused by climate
   change must be managed and handled with a co-management approach..},

Abstract = {Surface observations have recorded large and incompletely understood
   changes to atmospheric methane (CH4) this century. However, their
   ability to reveal the responsible surface sources and sinks is limited
   by their geographical distribution, which is biased towards the northern
   midlatitudes. Data from Earth-orbiting satellites designed specifically
   to measure atmospheric CH4 have been available since 2009 with the
   launch of the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). We
   assess the added value of GOSAT to data collected by the US National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which have been the
   lynchpin for knowledge about atmospheric CH4 since the 1980s. To achieve
   that we use the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry transport model and an
   inverse method to infer a posteriori flux estimates from the NOAA and
   GOSAT data using common a priori emission inventories. We find the main
   benefit of GOSAT data is from its additional coverage over the tropics
   where we report large increases since the 2014/2016 El Nino, driven by
   biomass burning, biogenic emissions and energy production. We use data
   from the European TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument to show how better
   spatial coverage and resolution measurements allow us to quantify
   previously unattainable diffuse sources of CH4, thereby opening up a new
   research frontier. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue
   `Rising methane: is warming feeding warming? (part 1)'.},

Title = {Invasive Spartina alterniflora can mitigate N2O emission in coastal salt
   marshes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {147},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Although there are studies on nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in coastal salt
   marshes, temporal and spatial variations of this greenhouse gas are
   still uncertain. Especially salt marshes of the East China Sea coast
   covered by invasive Spartina alterniflora have shown controversial
   results. To analyse seasonal patterns of N2O fluxes and their
   relationship with environmental factors, three plots dominated by S.
   alterniflora, and differing in sediment salinity and vegetation history
   (P1, P2, P3), and one bare mudflat (P0) in a salt marsh of Nanhui shore
   in the southern fringe of Yangtze River estuary have been established.
   Monthly studies from March 2017 to January 2018 using a chamber
   technique showed that average N2O fluxes from all four plots ranged from
   -41.9 to 39.3 mu g N2O.m(-2).h(-1), whereas average flux (4.2 mu
   gN(2)O.m(-2).h(-1)) in P1, P2 and P3 was not significantly different
   from that measured in P0 (1.3 mu gN(2)O.m(-2).h(-1)). There was a clear
   seasonal difference: in spring and summer, all the sites showed slight
   emission while consumption prevailed in autumn and winter. In vegetated
   sites this trend was more remarkable than in the bare mudflat. N2O flux
   showed positive correlation (p <.05) with air and sediment temperature,
   and plant development (height of vegetation). Nitrate was not the
   limiting factor of N2O emission in the Yangtze estuary. In the salt
   marsh where vegetation community was mature, higher sediment salinity
   reduced N2O emission (P1 < P2) by influencing other environmental
   factors such as total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) content and
   sediment texture. In comparison with other tidal macrophytes S.
   alterniflora showed relatively low N2O emission. Therefore, it can be
   considered as a species for tidal zone stabilisation.},

Title = {Global climate change control: Is there a better strategy than reducing

Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {155},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1401-1497},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This Article identifies four major global climate change problems,
   analyzes whether the most Prominent of the greenhouse gas (GHG) control
   proposals is likely to be either effective or efficient in solving each
   of the problems, and then extensively analyzes both management and
   technological alternatives to the Proposals. Efforts to reduce emissions
   of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide, in a decentralized way or even in a few
   countries (such as the United States or under the Kyoto Protocol)
   without equivalent actions by all the other countries of the world,
   particularly the most rapidly growing ones, cannot realistically achieve
   the temperature change limits most emission control advocates believe
   are necessary to avoid dangerous climatic changes, and would be unlikely
   to do so even with the cooperation of these other countries. This
   Article concludes that the most effective and efficient solution would
   be to use a concept long proven by nature to reduce the radiation
   reaching the earth by adding particles optimized for this purpose to the
   stratosphere to scatter a small portion of the incoming sunlight back
   into space, as well as to undertake a new effort to better understand
   and reduce ocean acidification. Current temperature change goals could
   be quickly achieved by stratospheric scattering at a very modest cost
   without the need for costly adaptation, human lifestyle changes, or the
   general public's active cooperation, all required by rigorous emission
   controls. Although stratospheric scattering would not reduce ocean
   acidification, for which several remedies are explored in this Article,
   it appears to be the most effective and efficient first step toward
   global climate change control. Stratospheric scattering is not currently
   being pursued or even developed, however; such development is
   particularly needed to verify the lack of significant adverse
   environmental effects of this remedy. Reducing GHG emissions to the
   extent proposed by advocates, even if achievable, would cost many
   trillions of dollars, and is best viewed as a last resort rather than
   the Preferred strategy.},

Abstract = {The Ovar coastline is characterized as one of the coastal areas with the

   social, environmental, and economic factors. It is in this territory
   that the INCCA project's case study is located, involving stakeholders
   with technical, scientific, and operational knowledge in the
   co-management of the coastal stretch. In the scope of the involvement
   intended for the project's development, five participatory events were
   held, involving local authorities, civil protection, public entities,
   academia, and the general community. These events allowed a
   multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder analysis of the challenges and
   possible solutions to mitigate coastal erosion, representing the
   definition of a shared vision for the coastline's future in this
   municipality. This work presents the main results of this participatory
   process as well as reflections on the importance of active citizenship
   instruments and stakeholder involvement for integrated coastal
   management in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {Organic carbon (OC) burial and greenhouse gas emission of inland waters
   plays an increasingly evident role in the carbon balance of the
   continents, and particularly young reservoirs in the tropics emit
   methane (CH4) at high rates. Here we show that an old, temperate
   reservoir acts simultaneously as a strong OC sink and CH4 source,
   because the high sedimentation rate supplies reactive organic matter to
   deep, anoxic sediment strata, fuelling methanogenesis and gas bubble
   emission (ebullition) of CH4 from the sediment. Damming of the river has
   resulted in the build-up of highly methanogenic sediments under a
   shallow water column, facilitating the transformation of fixed CO2 to
   atmospheric CH4. Similar high OC burial and CH4 ebullition is expected
   in other reservoirs and natural river deltas. Citation: Sobek, S., T.

Title = {The role of natural fluctuations and factors of external forcing in the
   Early 20th Century Warming in Northern Hemisphere},
Journal = {LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {455-474},
Abstract = {The warming in the first half of the 20th century in the Northern
   Hemisphere, the Early Twentieth Century Warming was comparable in
   magnitude to the current warming but occurred at a time when the growth
   rate of the greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere was 4-5
   times slower than in recent decades. The mechanisms of the early warming
   are still a subject of discussion. The Early Twentieth Century Warming
   was most pronounced in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere,
   and the recent reconstructions consistently indicate a significant
   negative anomaly of the Arctic sea ice area during early warming period
   linked with enhanced Atlantic water inflow to the Arctic and amplified
   warming in high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Assessment of
   contributions of internal variability and external natural and
   anthropogenic factors to this climatic anomaly is a key issue for
   understanding historical and modern climate dynamics. The paper
   overviews mechanisms of the Early Twentieth Century Warming associated
   with various internal variability and external anthropogenic and natural
   factors. An analysis of the findings on the topic of long-term studies
   of climate variations in the Northern Hemisphere during the period of
   instrumental observations does not allow one to attribute the Early
   Twentieth Century Warming to one particular mechanism of internal
   climate variability or external forcing of the climate. It is most
   likely, that this event was caused by a combined effect of long-term
   climatic fluctuations in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific Ocean
   with a noticeable contribution of external radiative forcing associated
   with a decrease in volcanic activity, changes in solar activity, and an
   increase of greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere due to
   anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, this climate variation in high
   latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere was enhanced by a number of
   positive feedbacks.},

   variations by means of a three-box energy balance model},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {617-646},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {An analytic solution of an energy balance model (EBM) is presented which
   can be used as a recursive filter for time series analysis. It is shown
   that the EBM can reproduce the solution of a coupled atmosphere-ocean
   general circulation model (AOGCM) experiment. Contrary to the AOGCM, the
   EBM easily allows for variations in climate sensitivity to satisfy the
   full range of uncertainty concerned with this parameter. The recursive
   filter is applied to two natural and two anthropogenic forcing
   mechanisms which are expressed in terms of heating rate anomaly time
   series: volcanism, solar activity, greenhouse gases (GHG), and
   anthropogenic tropospheric aerosols. Thus, we obtain modelled global
   mean temperature variations as a response to the different forcings and
   with respect to the uncertainty in the forcing approximations and
   climate sensitivity. In addition, it is shown that the observed
   (ENSO-corrected) global mean temperature time series within the period
   from 1866 to 1997 can be explained by the external forcings which have
   been considered and an additional white noise forcing. In this way we
   are able to separate different signals and compare them. As a result,
   global anthropogenic climate change due to GHG forcing can be detected
   at a high level of significance without considering spatial patterns of
   climate change but including natural forcing, which is usually not done.
   Furthermore, it is shown that solar forcing alone does not lead to
   significant climate change, whereas solar and volcanic forcing together
   lead to a significant natural climate change signal. Anthropogenic
   climate change due to GHG forcing may partly be masked by anthropogenic
   aerosol cooling.},

   disasters: A case study for coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Quantified flood risk assessments focus on asset losses, neglecting
   longer-term impacts to household welfare via income and consumption
   losses. The extent of welfare losses depends upon resilience - the
   ability to anticipate, resist, cope, recover and learn from a shock.
   Here, we use a novel welfare loss modelling framework and perform a
   high-resolution spatial analysis in coastal Bangladesh to quantify
   welfare losses from a tropical cyclone under present and future climatic
   and socio-economic conditions. We further test various adaptation
   options that are intended to enhance resilience. Results show that poor
   households experience, on average, 7\% of the asset losses, but 42\% of
   the welfare losses. Combining dike heightening, post-disaster support
   and stronger housing can reduce welfare losses by up to 70\%, and foster
   sustainable development by benefitting the poor, increasing resilience
   and demonstrating robustness under socio-economic and climatic
   uncertainties. Thus, a welfare orientated perspective helps to identify
   adaptation options that enhance resilience and leave no-one behind.},

Title = {Salt marsh die-off and recovery reveal disparity between the recovery of
   ecosystem structure and service provision},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {179},
Pages = {1-5},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems, such as sand dunes, salt marshes, and mangroves,
   stabilize shorelines and protect coastal populations. In New England,
   salt marshes have experienced widespread cordgrass (Spartina
   alterniflora) die-off and habitat loss, and it is unknown how this has
   affected their ability to provide coastal protection. We quantified wave
   attenuation and shoreline stability on healthy, die-off and recovered
   marsh creek banks. We found that coastal protection has been severely
   compromised by salt marsh die-off, and that to date, S. alterniflora
   recovery, while superficially impressive, has not returned this
   ecosystem service to the levels of intact marshes. Climate driven
   sea-level rise and predicted increases in the frequency and severity of
   storms over the next century will likely further increase the
   vulnerability of coastal populations. Therefore, recovery of coastal
   protection is essential for maintaining the ecological and economic
   wellbeing of coastal communities. Our results suggest that
   quantification of the recovery of ecosystem services should be employed
   in order to successfully measure recovery in degraded ecosystems. (C)

Title = {The Importance of the Montreal Protocol in Protecting Earth's
   Hydroclimate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {The 1987 Montreal Protocol regulating emissions of chlorofluorocarbons
   (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) was motivated
   primarily by the harm to human health and ecosystems arising from
   increased exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation associated with
   depletion of the ozone layer. It is now known that the Montreal Protocol
   has helped reduce radiative forcing of the climate system since CFCs are
   greenhouse gases (GHGs), and that ozone depletion (which is now on the
   verge of reversing) has been the dominant driver of atmospheric
   circulation changes in the Southern Hemisphere in the last half century.
   This paper demonstrates that the Montreal Protocol also significantly
   protects Earth's hydroclimate. Using the Community Atmospheric Model,
   version 3 (CAM3), coupled to a simple mixed layer ocean, it is shown
   that in the world avoided (i.e., with CFC emissions not regulated), the
   subtropical dry zones would be substantially drier, and the middle- and
   high-latitude regions considerably wetter in the coming decade (2020-29)
   than in a world without ozone depletion. Surprisingly, these changes are
   very similar, in both pattern and magnitude, to those caused by
   projected increases in GHG concentrations over the same period. It is
   further shown that, by dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms, both
   the stratospheric ozone depletion and increased CFCs contribute to these
   changes. The results herein imply that, as a consequence of the Montreal
   Protocol, changes in the hydrological cycle in the coming decade will be
   only half as strong as what they otherwise would be.},

Abstract = {Current power generation scenarios all over the world are not climate
   friendly as the generation systems are mainly dependent on fossil fuels
   that produce greenhouse gas (GHG). As renewable energies (especially
   solar and wind energies) have the sustainable characteristics, by
   replacing the conventional energy system with them, it is possible to
   significantly contribute to reducing the dependency on fossil fuels as
   well as GHG emissions. Though biomass is the primary renewable source in
   Bangladesh, this study is exploring new options in photovoltaic (PV) and
   on-shore wind in the 0.5-2MW capacity range. This research presents
   environmental and socio-economic impacts of grid-connected hybrid
   (PV/wind) power systems by investigating the potentials of the solar and
   wind energy with considering various sensitivity variables for two
   different locations, namely Magnama and Dinajpur, in Bangladesh. The
   main goal of this research is to generate the lowest possible adverse
   socio-economic and environmental impacts ensuring a certain degree of
   monetary benefits. Three sizes of plants have been chosen for
   quantifying the variations in socio-economic and environmental impacts.
   It is found that the proposed model of the hybrid power system can
   maximise the benefits by reducing the adverse effects of conventional
   power plants.},

Title = {Simulated analysis of summer climate on centennial time scale in eastern
   China during the last millennium},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {56},
Number = {21},
Pages = {2229-2235},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Using Lanczos filtered simulation results from the ECHO-G coupled
   ocean-atmosphere model, this study analyzes the spatiotemporal structure
   of temperature and precipitation on centennial time scale to examine how
   climate change in eastern China responded to external forcing during the
   last millennium. The conclusions are (1) eastern China experienced a
   warm-cold-warm climate transition, and the transition from the warm
   period to the cold period was slower than the cold to warm transition
   which followed it. There was more rainfall in the warm periods, and the
   transitional peak and valley of precipitation lag those of temperature.
   The effective solar radiation and solar irradiance have significant
   impacts on the temporal variation of both temperature and precipitation.
   Volcanic activity plays an important role in the sudden drop of
   temperature before the Present Warm Period (PWP). There is a positive
   correlation between precipitation and volcanic activity before 1400
   A.D., and a negative relationship between the two thereafter. The
   concentration of greenhouse gases increases in the PWP, and the
   temperature and precipitation increase accordingly. (2) The spatial
   pattern of the first leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of
   temperature on centennial time scale is consistent with that on the
   inter-annual/inter-decadal (IA-ID) time scales; namely, the entirety of
   eastern China is of the same sign. This pattern has good coherence with
   effective solar radiation and the concentrations of greenhouse gases.
   The first leading EOF mode of precipitation on centennial time scale is
   totally different from that on the IA-ID time scales. The first leading
   mode of centennial time scale changes consistently over the entirety of
   eastern China, while the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and
   Yellow Rivers are the opposite to the rest of eastern China is the
   leading spatial pattern on IA-ID time scale. The distribution of
   precipitation on centennial time scale is affected by solar irradiance
   and greenhouse gas concentrations.},

Title = {Status of renewable capacity for electricity generation and future
   prospects in Korea: Global trends and domestic strategies},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {1524-1533},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The global community has recently begun adopting renewable energy in
   order to reduce the production of greenhouse gases and address the issue
   of global warming. In particular, each nation is increasing its
   electricity generation from renewables to reduce fossil fuel usage,
   which accounts for about 78\% of global final energy consumption, as
   well as being the key cause of greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, this
   study analyzes the overseas renewable capacity for electricity
   generation and presents the issues facing the Korean renewable capacity
   for electricity generation, in addition to outlining a strategy and
   direction for Korea's future supply of electricity generated from
   renewables. The total global renewable capacity for electricity
   generation in 2013 was about 1560 GW, whereas in contrast, the total
   domestic renewable capacity or electricity generation in 2013 was about
   4.251 GW.
   In analyzing the Korean capacity as a percentage of the total global
   capacity by each sector, Korean hydro was shown to provide 0.17\% of the
   global total, wind 0.17\%, solar PV 1.09\%, bio 0.19\% and ocean
   48.11\%. In addition, this study compares the domestic renewable
   capacity with the renewable capacity in OECD countries, and in countries
   with a similar GDP to that of Korea. The results show that compared with
   other OECD countries, Korea is ranked lowest in terms of renewables as a
   percentage of total electricity generation 3.7\% with the exception of
   Turkey and Israel. Even compared with countries that did not set 2020
   targets for electricity generation from renewables, Korea's renewable
   capacity was ranked the lowest. Accordingly, intensive investment in
   solar PV and wind is required to expand the domestic renewable capacity,
   keep pace with the trends in global capacity and investment, and meet
   Korea's global commitments.},

Abstract = {Trees are known to emit methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), with
   tropical wetland trees being considerable CH4 sources. Little is known
   about CH4 and especially N2O exchange of trees growing in tropical rain
   forests under nonflooded conditions.
   We determined CH4 and N2O exchange of stems of six dominant tree
   species, cryptogamic stem covers, soils and volcanic surfaces at the
   start of the rainy season in a 400-yr-old tropical lowland rain forest
   situated on a basaltic lava flow (Reunion Island). We aimed to
   understand the unknown role in greenhouse gas fluxes of these atypical
   tropical rain forests on basaltic lava flows.
   The stems studied were net sinks for atmospheric CH4 and N2O, as were
   cryptogams, which seemed to be co-responsible for the stem uptake. In
   contrast with more commonly studied rain forests, the soil and
   previously unexplored volcanic surfaces consumed CH4. Their N2O fluxes
   were negligible.
   Greenhouse gas uptake potential by trees and cryptogams constitutes a
   novel and unique finding, thus showing that plants can serve not only as
   emitters, but also as consumers of CH4 and N2O. The volcanic tropical
   lowland rain forest appears to be an important CH4 sink, as well as a
   possible N2O sink.},

Abstract = {The integration of solar energy systems into buildings via photovoltaic
   (PV) and other technologies can curb the amount of greenhouse gas
   emissions produced by buildings. However, the performance of solar
   energy systems is highly dependent on climatic and economic conditions.
   In this regard, the techno-economic feasibility of building attached PV
   systems are studied for three scenarios considering three cities of Iran
   namely Tehran, Tabriz, and Kish Island, which have different climatic
   conditions. The result shows that the PV systems can annually meet
   4.5-20\% of the electricity needs for Tehran, 3.0-13\% for Tabriz and
   2.0-11.5\% for Kish Island. Moreover, roof mounted PV systems were found
   to be a better alternative to envelope attached systems in technical and
   economic terms. The payback period for the solar energy systems was
   found to be between 8.7 and 14.3 years for Tehran, 14.2 and 22.6 years
   for Tabriz, and 11.6 and 21.1 for Kish Island.},

Abstract = {The development and deployment of Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
   (CCS) technology is a cornerstone of the Norwegian government's climate
   strategy. A number of projects are currently evaluated/planned along the
   Norwegian West Coast, one at Tjeldbergodden. CO2 from this project will
   be utilized in part for enhanced oil recovery in the Halten oil field,
   in the Norwegian Sea. We study a potential design of such a system. A
   combined cycle power plant with a gross power output of 832 MW is
   combined with CO2 capture plant based on a post-combustion capture using
   amines as a solvent. The captured CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery
   (EOR). We employ a hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) method to assess
   the environmental impacts of the system. The study focuses on the
   modifications and operations of the platform during EOR. We allocate the
   impacts connected to the capture Of CO2 to electricity production, and
   the impacts connected to the transport and storage Of CO2 to the oil
   produced. Our study shows a substantial reduction of the greenhouse gas
   emissions from power production by 80\% to 75 g.(kW.h)(-1). It also
   indicates a reduction of the emissions associated with oil production
   per unit oil produced, mostly due to the increased oil production.
   Reductions are especially significant if the additional power demand due
   to EOR leads to power supply from the land.},

Abstract = {Potential for, and limits to, adaptation to environmental changes are
   critical for resilience and risk mitigation. The Mediterranean basin is
   a mosaic of biodiversity-rich ecosystems long affected by human
   influence, whose resilience is now questioned by climate change. After
   reviewing the different components of biological adaptation, we present
   the main characteristics of marine and terrestrial biodiversity in the
   Mediterranean basin and of the pressures they face. Taking climatic
   trends into consideration, we discuss the adaptive potential of a range
   of ecosystems dominated by species without active dispersal. We argue
   that the high heterogeneity of Mediterranean landscapes and seascapes
   constitutes a laboratory for the study of adaptation when environmental
   conditions change rapidly and may provide opportunities for adaptation
   and adaptability of species and ecosystems. Adaptive management in the
   Mediterranean can and should harness the nature-based solutions offered
   by both ecological and evolutionary processes for increasing the
   resilience of ecosystems to climate change.},

Title = {A Prefeasibility Solar Photovoltaic Tool for Tropical Small Island
   Developing States},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) are the lowest emitters of
   greenhouse gases yet are the most vulnerable to the impacts of global
   climate warming. Many islands, such as the Caribbean islands, identified
   solar photovoltaics as a technology for reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions from their electricity sector. However, prefeasibility
   economic studies for photovoltaics are challenging as operational
   photovoltaic system data are nonexistent, and the measured solar
   radiation datasets are limited. Thus, a prefeasibility PV tool that uses
   ground-measured global horizontal irradiation and a supplementary
   photovoltaic derating factor model is proposed for use in tropical SIDS.
   In addition, the bias of a modelled irradiation dataset was quantified
   with limited solar radiation data for a tropical Caribbean SIDS,
   Trinidad and Tobago. For this SIDS, the tool estimates the annual energy
   output of a 50 MW photovoltaic system to be 57,890 MWh and the levelized
   cost of electricity to be USD 0.12/kWh. The performance of the proposed
   tool was comparable with two existing prefeasibility models, RETScreen
   and SAM, which use past ground measurements and modelled data,
   respectively. The biases in the annual irradiation data for RETScreen
   and SAM were determined to be 6\% and 25\%, respectively, against the
   solar irradiance dataset used. The proposed tool may be useful for first
   approximation prefeasibility photovoltaic studies in similar regions
   with limited climatic data.},

Title = {Renewable energy energy programmes in the South Pacific - Are these a
   solution to dependency?},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {500-508},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Like many small island states, a number of Pacific Island countries
   (PICs) have ambitious renewable energy programmes in place. In some
   cases, the programmes include the objective of electricity generated
   from ``100\% renewable energy{''} by 2020 or 2025. The motivations for
   these ambitious programmes are commendable: to reduce dependency on
   imported oil fuels and to be seen to contribute towards reduction in
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   The paper reviews renewable electricity generation policy and programmes
   in four PICs - Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga and Tuvalu - and implementation
   of the programmes to date. To illustrate the broader relevance of the
   issue, these programmes are compared with those of Maldives and
   Seychelles. Concerns identified include the ambitious goals and almost
   total reliance on solar photo-voltaic (PV) technology to supply
   electricity in small and remote islands. Our central argument is that
   dependency on oil imports will be replaced with dependency on technical
   support given the complex nature of PV technology compared with diesel
   particularly where high PV fractions are proposed. The lack of interest
   in biofuel, particularly coconut oil, is seen as a missed opportunity to
   use an endogenous energy resource that could form a useful part of the
   renewable energy mix.},

Title = {Ocean Warming Pattern Effect On Global And Regional Climate Change},
Journal = {AGU ADVANCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases cause the planet to warm,
   and the ocean uptake of anthropogenic heat slows the warming, preventing
   the climate system from equilibrating with the increasing radiative
   forcing. The uneven ocean surface warming affects regional changes in
   tropical rainfall, El Nino, and the global climate sensitivity. Thus,
   the study of ocean warming patterns bridges the oceanatmospheric
   dynamics community focusing on spatial patterns on one hand and the
   climate change community with a traditional emphasis on the planetary
   energy budget and radiative feedback on the other.
   Plain Language Summary The ocean surface warming pattern has emerged as
   a research frontier in climate science in relation to regional climate
   change and global climate sensitivity. In the high-latitudes,
   observations have largely confirmed the interhemispheric asymmetry in
   ocean warming climate models predicted between the North Atlantic and
   Southern Ocean, a pattern resulting from the pole-to-pole deep ocean
   overturning circulation. In the tropics, the ocean warming pattern is
   closely coupled with atmospheric convection and circulation, modulating
   tropical cyclone statistics and El Nino influence in faraway regions
   such as western North America. While climate sensitivity is often
   considered a constant inherent to a given model, recent studies show
   that it varies in time as the heat exchange between the surface and deep
   oceans causes the ocean surface warming pattern to evolve. This warming
   pattern effect highlights the challenges in estimating climate
   sensitivity from instrumental observations, which feature evolving
   radiative forcing (greenhouse gases vs. aerosols) as well as unforced
   internal variability.},

Abstract = {Mediterranean climates are characterized by strong seasonal contrasts
   between dry summers and wet winters. Changes in winter rainfall are
   critical for regional socioeconomic development, but are difficult to
   simulate accurately(1) and reconstruct on Quaternary timescales. This is
   partly because regional hydroclimate records that cover multiple
   glacial-interglacial cycles(2,3) with different orbital geometries,
   global ice volume and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are
   scarce. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of change and their
   persistence remain unexplored. Here we show that, over the past 1.36
   million years, wet winters in the northcentral Mediterranean tend to
   occur with high contrasts in local, seasonal insolation and a vigorous
   African summer monsoon. Our proxy time series from Lake Ohrid on the
   Balkan Peninsula, together with a 784,000-year transient climate model
   hindcast, suggest that increased sea surface temperatures amplify local
   cyclone development and refuel North Atlantic low-pressure systems that
   enter the Mediterranean during phases of low continental ice volume and
   high concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. A comparison with
   modern reanalysis data shows that current drivers of the amount of
   rainfall in the Mediterranean share some similarities to those that
   drive the reconstructed increases in precipitation. Our data cover
   multiple insolation maxima and are therefore an important benchmark for
   testing climate model performance.},

Abstract = {Heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks have been acquiring more frequency
   and intensity in the Canary Islands during the last decades. Both
   climatic hazards are known to produce impacts on human health such as
   mortality (due to heat waves) and morbidity (due to dusty weather). This
   work addresses possible climate adaptation policies in Tenerife assuming
   the increasing impact of heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks in the
   island under a climate change scenario. It explores the institutional
   setting of climate change adaptation planning in Tenerife and evaluates
   the statu quo of adaptation planning in the island through the
   engagement of key social actors. An historical review of the local and
   regional press articles and legislation, an in-depth round of
   interviews, together with questionnaires to the main social actors
   allows framing the social and political context in which climate change
   adaptation in Tenerife is embedded. Key social actors were engaged,
   including international organisations, atmospheric research centres,
   local Universities, regional and insular governments, trade unions, and
   environmental NGOs, among others. The main obstacles mentioned by the
   social actors that hinder the development of an effective climate
   adaptation policy address scientific knowledge, data collection and
   policy making, focusing on the uncertainty of climate models, the lack
   of epidemiological data and contrasting opinions regarding the existing
   climate adaptation policies. Public participation, mainstreaming of
   climate policies and an integrated approach between mitigation and
   adaptation plans were identified as key policy issues. The outcomes of
   this study could be meaningful for climate adaptation initiatives at
   local or regional level, such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, that
   intend to promote climate resilience through the setup of climate
   adaptation strategies and plans at municipality level.},

Abstract = {Global warming induced by greenhouse gases is increasing wildfire
   frequencies and scale. Since wildfire again releases greenhouse
   gases(GHGs) into the air, the vicious cycle is repeated. Satellite
   remote sensing is a useful tool for detecting wildfire. However,
   estimating the GHGs emission from wildfire has not been challenged yet.
   Wildfires are estimated to be responsible for, on average, around 30\%
   of global total CO emissions, 10\% of methane emissions, 38\% of
   tropospheric ozone, and over 86\% of black carbon. So we need to
   quantify the emitted gases by biomass combustions, which can be measured
   by the FRP (fire radiative power) derived from the spectral
   characteristics of satellite sensors. This paper described the algorithm
   for retrieval of FRP using COMS(Communication, Ocean and Meteorological
   Satellite), the Korean geostationary meteorological satellite. The FRP
   of wildfire is retrieved by single waveband methods suitable to COMS
   channels. The retrieval of FRP is dependent on the emissivity of each
   bandwidth. So, we used MODIS NDVI through a spatio-temporal calibration
   for the emissivity calculations. We made sure that the FRP in wildfire
   pixel is much higher than its spatially and temporally neighboring
   pixels. For future work, we should quantify the relationships between
   FRP and the biomass combustion according to fuel types.},

Title = {A mathematical model applied to investigate the potential impact of
   global warming on marine ecosystems},
Journal = {APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {19-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A mathematical model with time-varying parameters is newly proposed to
   describe the potential effects of rapid global warming on marine
   ecosystems. The time-varying parameters are assumed to vary in time, for
   example, environmental factors or a change in marine organisms. The
   existence of the proposed model is verified, as well as the stability of
   each equilibrium point is investigated. Beside, simulations, as well as
   a case study, are also carried out to justify the findings of this study
   comparing with others. It is found that global warming, because of the
   rapid concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs), is leading marine
   ecosystems to an imbalanced situation by reducing significantly the
   marine plankton and fishery resources. Moreover, it is shown that if the
   density of marine plankton or its ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2)
   can be increased, it can improve marine fishery resources by reducing
   global warming. Beside, this study could explain how marine ecosystems
   may change in the future as a result of rapid global warming. This study
   predicts that if the present situation of rapid global warming continues
   for the next 50 years unabated, it can damage marine ecosystems
   especially fishery resources in the long run. Overall, this study
   establishes a mathematical relationship between the environment and
   marine ecosystems that could contribute to environmental and fisheries
   management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {TOURISM MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {12-22},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Florida, one of the world's most visited tourist destinations, holds one
   of the most vulnerable positions as a result of climate change. Through
   a quantitative survey, this study gathered the responses of 432 tourists
   who had previously visited Florida, with a hypothetical scenario of
   changed climatic conditions. The examination of the tourist perspective
   showed the presence of ample sunshine and factors related to beach
   comfort as the reasons for choosing the destination. In a scenario were
   beaches disappear and tropical diseases become more widespread, the
   majority of respondents stated they would choose a different
   destination. However, respondents would reconsider their intentions if
   adaptation measures such as reduced prices, coastal habitat conservation
   and measures to protect beaches from erosion and coastal areas from
   inundation were in place. The findings suggest that seasonal and
   geographic shifts in tourism demand could be mitigated by the
   implementation of adaptation measures at the destination level.},

Abstract = {Oceanic absorption of heat generated by greenhouse gas emissions has
   resulted in warming of the dark ocean (>200 m) that contains a large
   refractory DOM (RDOM) pool. However, changes in microbially mediated
   production and degradation dynamics for RDOM components in response to
   warming of dark marginal basins remain unclear. Herein, we integrated
   data from the dark South China, Mediterranean and Japan Seas
   (temperature range: 0.09-15.1 degrees C) to demonstrate that in situ
   production efficiency of two ubiquitous humic-like fluorophores
   increased at higher dark ocean temperature, whereas chromophores at a
   wavelength of 325 nm (a(CDOM)(325)) changed from production to
   degradation at higher temperature. Increased oxygen consumption and a
   reduction of labile substrates in future warmer dark ocean environments
   may initiate the final degradation of some semi-refractory components,
   thereby increasing the recalcitrance of RDOM, but decreasing the DOM
   inventory in dark basins and creating a positive feedback to rising
   atmospheric CO2.},

Abstract = {Global and regional climate change caused by greenhouse gases emissions
   has stimulated interest in developing various technologies (such as
   carbon dioxide (CO2) geologic sequestration in brine reservoirs) to
   reduce the concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. This study develops
   a statistical framework to identify gravitational CO2 trapping processes
   and to quantitatively evaluate both CO2 injectivity (or storage
   capacity) and leakage potential from marine sediments which exhibit
   heterogeneous permeability and variable thicknesses. We focus on sets of
   geostatistically-based heterogeneous models populated with fluid flow
   parameters from several reservoir sites in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
   (GOM). A computationally efficient uncertainty quantification study was
   conducted with results suggesting that permeability heterogeneity and
   anisotropy, seawater depth, and sediment thickness can all significantly
   impact CO2 flow and trapping. Large permeability/porosity heterogeneity
   can enhance gravitational, capillary, and dissolution trapping, which
   acts to deter CO2 upward migration and subsequent leakage onto the
   seafloor. When log permeability variance is 5, self-sealing with
   heterogeneity-enhanced gravitation trapping can be achieved even when
   water depth is 1.2 km. This extends the previously identified
   self-sealing condition that water depth be greater than 2.7 km. Our
   results have yielded valuable insight into the conditions under which
   safe storage of CO2 can be achieved in offshore environments. The
   developed statistical framework is general and can be adapted to study
   other offshore sites worldwide. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Using flood risks and potential impacts of sea level change within the
   U.S. Great Lakes region over the past 20 years, we explore the
   association between coordinated planning effort as a form of multilevel
   climate governance and community resilience attributes under climate
   risk. Content analysis and coastal adaptation principles allowed us to
   evaluate coordinated planning effort at county and state levels to
   derive a horizontal or vertical coordination index which was then used
   to evaluate if synergies generated among plans were correlated with
   climate risk mitigation and enhanced adaptation to climate change.
   Further, we incorporated evaluation results of varied community
   resilience characteristics and coordinated planning effort metrics in
   the context of climate change. Empirical results suggest that the extent
   of coordinated planning effort at the county and state levels is closely
   associated with coastal community resilience and climate change
   adaptation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change has a different impact on each member of society. To
   reduce the damage caused by climate change, adaptation activities are
   being initiated, such as expanding the capacity of social
   infrastructures, and each stakeholder wants these adaptations to work in
   his or her favor. Therefore, a methodology is needed to determine
   adaptation measures that are most beneficial to all members of society.
   In this paper, a framework is proposed for producing an adaptation
   strategy that minimizes conflict between stakeholders. This framework
   casts the process of organizing climate change adaptations as a game and
   defines each community member as a stakeholder, each adaptation measure
   as a strategy, and the minimization of loss from future climate change
   as a payoff. In a case study involving sea level rise in Suncheon Bay,
   Korea, this framework is used to generate an optimal plan for minimizing
   conflicts while considering the losses of the central government, local
   governments, and local communities. The game theoretic results from the
   proposed framework enable a balanced distribution of responsibilities
   among stakeholders to achieve infrastructure adaptation to climate
   change.},

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {407-423},
Abstract = {Community-based adaptation (CBA) has emerged as an important component
   of the global response to climate change. Numerous tools have been
   developed to support communities to adapt, and to guide the agencies
   that they work with. Despite the proliferation of CBA tools, a number of
   critical challenges exist. For example, CBA tools often overlap, and
   there is confusion regarding when and how the tools should be applied.
   There is a lack of tools that communicate climate information in locally
   relevant ways; support the application of resilience as a unifying
   framework; support monitoring and evaluation of CBA; and provide
   technical guidance on the implementation of locally appropriate
   adaptation options. Additionally, guidance is needed to move from
   community-led vulnerability assessments to adaptation actions. This
   article explores these challenges, offers guidance on tool selection,
   tailoring, and development, and provides lessons learned based on the
   results from a multiyear CBA program by a consortium of organizations in
   Vanuatu. These lessons are relevant to the development and
   implementation of CBA activities globally.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {182},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In a context of growing concern about climate change and its potential
   consequences for coastal systems, adaptation is becoming more important
   than ever before. This paper presents a national planning framework for
   adaptation to climate change, which is pioneer in the field as it is
   multi-sectoral and focuses specifically on coastal areas, pursuing the
   safety of their communities in an uncertain future. The strategy is
   statutory as it emanates from the new Spanish Coastal Law, which in
   addition to many other implications includes the compulsory development
   of a Spanish Strategy for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change (SSCACC)
   and its submission to Strategic Environmental Assessment. This paper
   covers the fundamental aspects of both the SSCACC and the accompanying
   Strategic Environmental Study, providing recommendations on the
   assessment of coastal risks triggered by climate change and extreme
   events, adaptation and risk reduction planning and implementation, and
   monitoring. Additionally, this work gives insight into the wide-ranging
   consultation process carried out prior to the SSCACC's approval and the
   stakeholders involved, and how the SSCACC handles climate change
   uncertainty and struggles for overcoming barriers.},

Abstract = {Carrying out wildlife conservation in a changing climate requires
   planning on long timescales at both a site and network level, while also
   having the flexibility to adapt actions at sites over short timescales
   in response to changing conditions and new information. The Royal
   Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a land-owning wildlife
   conservation charity in the UK, achieves this on its nature reserves
   through its system of management planning. This involves setting
   network-wide objectives which inform the 25-year vision and 5-year
   conservation objectives for each site. Progress toward achieving each
   site's conservation objectives is reviewed annually, to identify any
   adjustments which might be needed to the site's management. The
   conservation objectives and 25-year vision of each site are reviewed
   every 5 years. Significant long-term impacts of climate change most
   frequently identified at RSPB reserves are: loss of intertidal habitat
   through coastal squeeze, loss of low-lying islands due to higher sea
   levels and coastal erosion, loss of coastal freshwater and brackish
   wetlands due to increased coastal flooding, and changes in the hydrology
   of wetlands. The main types of adaptation measures in place on RSPB
   reserves to address climate change-related impacts are: re-creation of
   intertidal habitat, re-creation and restoration of freshwater wetlands
   away from vulnerable coastal areas, blocking artificial drainage on
   peatlands, and addressing pressures on freshwater supply for lowland wet
   grasslands in eastern and southeastern England. Developing partnerships
   between organizations has been crucial in delivering large-scale
   adaptation projects.},

Title = {Introduction: Autochthonous human adaptation to biodiversity change in

Abstract = {Rapid biodiversity change that is already occurring across the globe is
   accelerating, with major and often negative consequences for human
   well-being. Biodiversity change is partly driven by climate change, but
   it has many other interacting drivers that are also driving human
   adaptation, including invasive species, land-use change, pollution and
   overexploitation. Humans are adapting to changes in well-being that are
   related with these biodiversity drivers and other forces and pressures.
   Adaptation, in turn, has feedbacks both for biodiversity change and
   human well-being; however, to date, these processes have received little
   science or policy attention. This Special Issue introduces human
   adaptation to biodiversity change as a science-policy issue. Research on
   human adaptation to biodiversity change requires new methods and tools
   as well as conceptual evolution, as social-ecological systems and
   environmental change adaptation approaches must be reconsidered when
   they are applied to different processes and contexts-where biodiversity
   change drivers are highly significant, where people are responding
   principally to changes in species, species communities and related
   ecosystem processes, and where adaptation entails changes in the
   management of biodiversity and related resource use regimes. The
   research was carried out in different marine and terrestrial
   environments across the globe. All of the studies consider adaptation
   among highly biodiversity-reliant populations, including Indigenous
   Peoples in the Americas and Europe, farmers in Asia and marine resource
   users in Europe and the Pacific. The concept of autochthonous adaptation
   is introduced to specifically address adaptation to environmental change
   in local systems, which also considers that local adaptation is
   conditioned by multi-scalar influences and occurs in synergy or conflict
   with adaptations of other non-local agents and actors who enable or
   constrain autochthonous adaptation options.},

Title = {Modelling climate change impacts on distribution of Himalayan pheasants},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Well known at landscape regions, the environmental change will influence
   the mountain ecosystem around the globe. The impacts of climate change
   on animal-specific interaction remain inadequately reported. For the
   assessment of mountain biological systems, environmental models assume a
   significant job in recognizing and monitoring critical habitat under the
   potential future climatic conditions. Our paper, utilizing the
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs-2050), the future global
   warming climatic scenarios, explores the trend of range shifts of
   Himalayan pheasants in the Eastern Himalayas based on an ensemble
   technique. The prediction model demonstrated that the core zone habitat
   of the Himalayan pheasants would have shifted towards higher altitude
   and latitude gradients with the greenhouse gaseous intensification.
   Under the extreme future climatic scenario, the species may reach
   towards Sky Island of the Himalayan regions. Therefore, a legitimate
   policy is essential to implement on time for the mitigation of the
   greenhouse gaseous emission. The outcome of this article illuminated
   that the present protected areas (PAs) of the Eastern Himalayas appeared
   to be inadequate regarding conservation measures of Himalayan Pheasants
   due to the current range may go rapidly beyond the protected zones. The
   shifting of the range of the Himalayan pheasants under future climatic
   scenarios will offer an indication for conservation directives to
   formulate appropriate strategies for habitat management of the
   threatened animals of the Himalayan ecosystem before the door of
   annihilation.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {1454-1462},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)
   concentration, saturation and fluxes in rivers (Beitang drainage river,
   Dagu drainage rive, Duliujianhe river, Yongdingxinhe river and Nanyunhe
   river) of Tianjin city (Haihe watershed) were investigated during July
   and October in 2014, and January and April in 2015 by static headspace
   gas chromatography method and the two-layer model of diffusive gas
   exchange. The influence of environmental variables on greenhouse gases
   (GHGs) concentration under the disturbance of anthropogenic activities
   was discussed by Spearman correlative analysis and multiple stepwise
   regression analysis. The results showed that the concentration and
   fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were seasonally variable with > winter > fall
   > summer, spring > summer > winter > fall and summer > spring > winter >
   fall for concentrations and spring > summer > fall > winter, spring >
   summer > winter > fall and summer > spring > fall > winter for fluxes
   respectively. The GHGs concentration and saturation were higher in
   comprehensively polluted river sites and lower in lightly polluted river
   sites. The three GHGs emission fluxes in two sewage draining rivers of
   Tianjin were clearly higher than those of other rivers (natural rivers)
   and the spatial variation of CH4 was more obvious than the others. CO2
   and N2O air-water interface emission fluxes of the sewage draining
   rivers in four seasons were about 1.20-2.41 times and 1.13-3.12 times of
   those in the natural rivers. The CH4 emission fluxes of the sewage
   draining rivers were 3.09 times in fall to 10.87 times in spring of
   those in the natural rivers in different season. The wind speed, water
   temperature and air temperature were related to GHGs concentrations.
   Nitrate and nitrite (NO3- + NO2--N) and ammonia (NH4+-N) were positively
   correlated with CO2 concentration and CH4 concentration; and dissolved
   oxygen (DO) concentration was negatively correlated with CH4
   concentration and N2O concentration. The effect of human activities on
   carbon and nitrogen cycling in river is great. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Identifying effective adaptation strategies for coastal communities
   dependent on marine resources and impacted by climate change can be
   difficult due to the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems. The task is
   more difficult if current and predicted shifts in social and economic
   trends are considered. Information about social and economic change is
   often limited to qualitative data. A combination of qualitative and
   quantitative models provide the flexibility to allow the assessment of
   current and future ecological and socio-economic risks and can provide
   information on alternative adaptations. Here, we demonstrate how
   stakeholder input, qualitative models and Bayesian belief networks
   (BBNs) can provide semi-quantitative predictions, including uncertainty
   levels, for the assessment of climate and non-climate-driven change in a
   case study community. Issues are identified, including the need to
   increase the capacity of the community to cope with change. Adaptation
   strategies are identified that alter positive feedback cycles
   contributing to a continued decline in population, local employment and
   retail spending. For instance, the diversification of employment
   opportunities and the attraction of new residents of different ages
   would be beneficial in preventing further population decline. Some
   impacts of climate change can be combated through recreational bag or
   size limits and monitoring of popular range-shifted species that are
   currently unmanaged, to reduce the potential for excessive removal. Our
   results also demonstrate that combining BBNs and qualitative models can
   assist with the effective communication of information between
   stakeholders and researchers. Furthermore, the combination of techniques
   provides a dynamic, learning-based, semi-quantitative approach for the
   assessment of climate and socio-economic impacts and the identification
   of potential adaptation strategies.},

Number = {29},
Pages = {38552-38562},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the globalizing world, many factors such as rapidly increasing
   population, production and consumption habits, and economic growth cause
   climate changes. The carbon footprint is a measure of CO2 emissions
   released into the atmosphere, which increases day by day, causing
   glaciers to melt and increase sea level, reduce water resources, and
   global warming. For Turkey, as a country trying to complete its economic
   development, signed international agreements such as the Paris Climate
   Agreement and Kyoto Protocol to reduce the carbon footprint give great
   importance to the studies estimating carbon footprint and making
   policies to reduce it. For this reason, in this study it is aimed to
   estimate the greenhouse gas emissions of Turkey in the year 2030 and to
   determine its damages to the economy. Time series forecasting algorithm
   in the WEKA data mining software was used for analysis, and population,
   gross domestic product, energy production, and energy consumption were
   used as independent variables. As a result of analysis using data from
   the years 1990-2017, as long as Turkey continues its course of gradually
   increasing the amount of current greenhouse gas emissions in the year
   2030, 728.3016 metric tons of CO2 equivalent will be reached. It appears
   that these estimates remain below the rate of Turkey's commitments at
   the Paris Climate Agreement that is considered to be promising for
   Turkey. However, the estimations in other studies should not be ignored;
   policy makers should determine policies accordingly.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The decarbonization of the shipping industry has risen to a new level of
   significance on the agendas of policy makers and strategic decision
   makers. This paper focuses on the likely cost implications for the
   shipping industry of recently implemented, and future planned policies
   that seek to reduce the carbon footprint of the sector. The scale of the
   problem is presented through a summary review of the International
   Maritime Organization's fourth greenhouse gas study of 2020. The
   regulatory context, which is emerging as a response to overcoming this
   challenge, is analyzed at both the global and EU level. The potential
   cost implications for the future, in terms of this new regulatory
   context, are then analyzed on the basis of a review of academic and
   industry sources. Our paper concludes that alternative, zero-carbon
   fuels are the best way forward, but that operational and technological
   innovations will not be sufficient to bring about the complete
   decarbonization of the industry within the foreseeable future. Thus,
   market-based measures are required. Finally, the options available, and
   the likely implications of each of these options, is addressed,
   suggesting that there will be both winners and losers in the race to
   decarbonize the shipping industry.},

Pages = {1-28},
Abstract = {Variability of the atmospheric and oceanic circulations in the earth
   system gives rise to an array of naturally occurring dynamical modes.
   Instead of being spatially independent or spatially uniform, climate
   variability in different parts of the globe is orchestrated by one or a
   combination of several climate modes, and global changes take place with
   a distinctive spatial pattern resembling that of the modes-related
   climate anomalies. Climate impact on the dynamics of terrestrial and
   marine biosphere also demonstrates clear signals for the mode effects.
   In this review, we view modes as an important attribute of climate
   variability, changes, and impact and emphasize the emerging concept that
   future climate changes may be manifest as changes in the leading modes
   of the climate system. The focus of this review is on three of the
   leading modes: the North Atlantic Oscillation, the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.},

Title = {Potential influence of Yucca extract as feed additive on greenhouse
   gases emission for a cleaner livestock and aquaculture farming - A
   review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {239},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Creating a balance between minimizing environmental impacts and
   intensification, of livestock and aquaculture, is important to ensure
   sustainable animal-protein production. Application of natural additives
   that are suitable for cleaner animal production is a necessity. Yucca
   schidigera is capable of this and because it could grow in desert area,
   makes it a potential asset in the face of global warming-related climate
   changes. Thirty-five studies were used as data, which include in vitro
   and in vivo evaluations. About 43\%, 28.6\% and 31\% were proportion of
   ruminant, monogastric and aquaculture species used for this study. Yucca
   schidigera showed that it is capable of reducing aerial ammonia
   concentration in pens, and ammonia odour from manure. In ruminant, Yucca
   could reduce methane emission, lower nitrous oxide emission, reduce
   urinary and fecal nitrogen. Yucca extract could be used to improve water
   quality by reducing the concentration of total ammonia nitrogen and
   nitrate in fresh and marine water used for aquaculture. Therefore, to
   reduce livestock footprint, Yucca may be included in the diet of cattle,
   sheep, goat, horses, rabbit, fishes, and shrimps with a positive result.
   The reviewed publications provide strong support for the use of Yucca
   extract as feed additive to reduce nutrient excretion and environmental
   impact of animal-protein production. This study, however, shows that
   there is need for more in vivo studies of Yucca in swine rabbit, horses
   and even poultry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Perceptions of climate change and adaptation: A subarctic archipelago
   perspective (Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon, North America)},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {215},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Climate change is projected to challenge adaptation capacity in small
   islands worldwide due to rising temperatures, sea-level rise, extreme
   events and changing rainfall patterns. However, adaptation planning and
   implementation may be delayed where people perceive a lack of urgency
   and put forward competing priorities such as economic development. Here,
   we assess perceptions of climate change and adaptation in
   Saint-Pierre-and Miquelon, a subarctic archipelago located south of
   Newfoundland, Canada. We performed and analysed a social survey reaching
   289 individuals out of a population of 6260, through a questionnaire
   conducted both faceto-face and online. We show that inhabitants of
   Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon generally have a clear understanding of
   climate change and perceive adaptation as urgent for a number of
   vulnerable coastal sites. Despite some disagreements on adaptation
   options and the timing for implementation, it is noteworthy that even
   relocation action is mentioned and sometimes requested. We show that
   perceptions of climate change and of adaptation within
   Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon are heavily influenced by place attachment,
   personal experience of coastal hazards and environmental awareness. From
   a methodological point of view, our results highlight the relevance of
   using online surveys in well-connected but geographically isolated
   communities. From an adaptation perspective, our results suggest that
   people's perceptions and beliefs are not only a barrier, but rather
   offer in some cases opportunities for adaptation planning and
   implementation. Such favourable attitudes toward adaptation do not exist
   across all small islands, so our results may be useful in determining
   the conditions under which people's perceptions are conducive to
   adaptation.},

Abstract = {The specific objective of our project on CO2 ocean sequestration is to
   investigate its technical feasibility and to improve the understanding
   of any associated environmental impacts. Our ultimate goal is to
   minimize any impacts associated with the eventual use of ocean carbon
   sequestration to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
   The project will continue through March 31, 2002, with a field
   experiment to take place in the summer of 2001 off the Kona Coast of
   Hawaii. At GHGT-4 in Interlaken, we presented a paper detailing our
   plans. The purpose of this paper is to present an update on our progress
   to date and our plans to complete the project. The coauthors of this
   paper are members of the project's Technical Committee, which has been

Abstract = {While there is little dissent in the scientific community that climate
   change directly correlates to human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions,
   action to reduce those emissions has not followed from the United States
   and many other governments around the world. Meanwhile, climate changes
   are already underway, and will continue to some degree even if emissions
   are drastically curtailed, thanks to emissions already in the
   atmosphere. Some countries and states are making their own plans to
   adapt to expected impacts including higher sea levels, more intense
   rainfall, droughts, heat waves, and loss of water supplies-and to reduce
   their local emissions. In this Global Forum, three experts highlight
   efforts by national and local governments in planning for 2100 and
   beyond. From the Netherlands, Arthur Mynett (2011); from Bangladesh,

Abstract = {This paper presents research being undertaken as part of the EPSRC
   Supergen Flex Net consortium to analyse the spatial and temporal
   behaviour of the UK wave, tidal, on- and off- shore wind resources. The
   UK has extensive renewable resources that can potentially be developed
   to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation.
   The study explores the availability of tidal current energy in terms of
   its timing, location and extent. The tidal resource is highly spatially
   and temporally variable. For tidal current energy to be economically
   exploited, certain conditions need to be fulfilled. Principally the
   strength of the resource needs to be quantified before it can be
   effectively utilised. This paper looks at the energy output from a case
   study site and considers matters that need to be addressed with
   intermittent but predictable energy such as tidal currents. Tidal
   current velocity distributions for this site are obtained and used to
   evaluate the energy that can be exploited by a typical device. Future
   work is intended to combine outputs from this research with similar
   datasets for other renewable resources in order to examine their
   combined impact and integration into the existing electrical network
   infrastructure.},

Title = {Carbon Footprint-Energy Detection for Desalination Small Plant
   Adaptation Response},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) system, which can be used as a decision
   support tool for managing environmental sustainability, includes carbon
   footprint assessment as one of the available methodologies. In this
   study, a carbon footprint assessment was used to investigate seawater
   production systems of a desalination plant in Senok, Kelantan, Malaysia.
   Three stages of the desalination plant processing system were
   investigated and the inventory database was developed using the relevant
   model framework. Subsequently, measurements and interpretations were
   performed on several key indicators such as greenhouse gases, energy
   efficiency, acidic gases, smog, and toxic gases. Overall, the results of
   the study indicate that the Reverse Osmosis (RO) technology that is used
   in the desalination plant in the study area is one of the best options
   to meet the demands of the environmental sustainability agenda (SDGs).
   This is due to the lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, of about 3.5 x
   10(-2) kg of CO2 eq per m(3)/year, that was recorded for the entire
   operation of the system. However, several factors that influence
   important errors in carbon footprint decisions, such as the lack of EIA
   reporting data and the literature on carbon footprint in the Malaysian
   scenario, in addition to direct and indirect carbon input calculations,
   need to be identified in more detail in future research.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities are crafting adaptation strategies to confront sea
   level rise (SLR). Unfortunately, cost-benefit analyses that assess SLR
   risks often fail to capture important political and social feedbacks.
   For example, adaptation measures (e.g., beach nourishment) can trigger
   greater development, undermining the value of adaptation infrastructure,
   incentivizing development, and increasing risks. We integrate diverse
   literature and data to develop a hypothesis and system dynamics model of
   coastal community responses to SLR. We apply the model to two U.S.
   communities, showing how political influence drives trajectories of
   infrastructure provision, cost, and vulnerability. We find that delayed
   feedbacks between perceived SLR risk and infrastructure investments
   mediate relationships between political capital, migration, and economic
   development. Community wealth and political influence may only delay the
   overshoot and collapse of its population and economy, as the virtuous
   cycles linking growth with infrastructure investment give way to vicious
   cycles of mounting infrastructure costs, political resistance to
   additional investment, and greater vulnerability. Copyright (c) 2018

Title = {Are Changes in Global Precipitation Constrained by the Tropospheric
   Energy Budget?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {499-517},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A tropospheric energy budget argument is used to analyze
   twentieth-century precipitation changes. It is found that global and
   ocean-mean general circulation model (GCM) precipitation changes can be
   understood as being due to the competing direct and
   surface-temperature-dependent effects of external climate forcings. In
   agreement with previous work, precipitation is found to respond more
   strongly to anthropogenic and volcanic sulfate aerosol and solar forcing
   than to greenhouse gas and black carbon aerosol forcing per unit
   temperature. This is due to the significant direct effects of greenhouse
   gas and black carbon forcing. Given that the relative importance of
   different forcings may change in the twenty-first century, the ratio of
   global precipitation change to global temperature change may be quite
   different. Differences in GCM twentieth-and twenty-first-century values
   are tractable via the energy budget framework in some, but not all,
   models. Changes in land-mean precipitation, on the other hand, cannot be
   understood at all with the method used here, even if land-ocean heat
   transfer is considered. In conclusion, the tropospheric energy budget is
   a useful concept for understanding the precipitation response to
   different forcings but it does not fully explain precipitation changes
   even in the global mean.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {96-104},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Prawns and shrimp are among the most popular seafood consumed globally
   and their production is responsible for a range of environmental impacts
   in wild capture fisheries and associated supply chains. Management of
   the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery has been promoted as a sustainable
   model for other countries to emulate, although broader environmental
   impacts, such as those relating to energy and water use or greenhouse
   gas emissions are not currently monitored under sustainability
   assessments. We use life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the
   environmental impacts of the white banana prawn (Fenneropenaeus
   merguiensis). Fishing operations were the main source of impacts for the
   supply chain examined, contributing 4.3 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) prawn or 63\%
   of the overall global warming potential. This result was lower than
   emissions reported for other prawn species, including tiger prawns from
   the same fishery. Processing and storage were key contributors to
   ecotoxicity while transport made a negligible contribution to any impact
   category. We discuss how LCA can complement existing fisheries
   management, and broaden current seafood sustainability assessments
   including the potential for emerging fishery-specific indicators to
   improve the efficacy of seafood LCAs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {An integrated spatial planning model for climate change adaptation in
   coastal zones},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This research highlights the spatial planning approach for coastal
   sustainability and adaptation to climate change. The dilemma of spatial
   planning in a dynamic and complex coastal environment as well as the
   establishment of a coastal buffer zone as an adaptation measure for
   climate change are elaborated upon. In particular, this study outlines
   the limitations of two of the traditional approaches used for spatial
   planning (optimization and simulation) and the opportunities that
   present themselves when combining both models for coastal zone planning.
   As a result, this study has developed an integrated modeling framework
   called MOPSD (multi-Objective Programming and System Dynamic) that can
   be used for spatial land use planning in coastal areas. The case study
   is Cijin Island, located next to the Kaohsiung harbor, Taiwan; this
   location demonstrates that the proposed MOPSD modeling approach
   generates superior results when compared to each of the two traditional
   methods. This is mainly attributed to the consideration of deterministic
   and dynamic characteristics when evaluating the climate change
   adaptation at risk of coastal erosion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are increasingly affected by climate-induced disturbances
   that are magnified by increasing ocean temperatures. Loss of coral reefs
   strongly affects people whose livelihoods and wellbeing depend on the
   ecosystem services reefs provide. Yet the effects of coral loss and the
   capacity of people and businesses to adapt to it are poorly understood,
   particularly in the private sector. To address this gap, we surveyed
   about half (57 of 109) of Australian reef tourism operators to
   understand how they were affected by and responded to severe impacts
   from bleaching and cyclones. Reef restoration and spatial
   diversification were the primary responses to severe bleaching impacts,
   while for cyclone-impacts coping measures and product diversification
   were more important. Restoration responses were strongly linked to the
   severity of impacts. Our findings provide empirical support for the
   importance of response diversity, spatial heterogeneity, and learning
   for social-ecological resilience.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To cope effectively with the impacts of climate change, people will need
   to change existing practices or behaviours within existing
   social-ecological systems (adaptation) or enact more fundamental changes
   that can alter dominant social-ecological relationships and create new
   systems or futures (transformation). Here we use multilevel network
   modelling to examine how different domains of adaptive capacity-assets,
   flexibility, organization, learning, socio-cognitive constructs and
   agency-are related to adaptive and transformative actions. We find
   evidence consistent with an influence process in which aspects of social
   organization (exposure to others in social networks) encourage both
   adaptive and transformative actions among Papua New Guinean islanders
   experiencing climate change impacts. Adaptive and transformative actions
   are also related to social-ecological network structures between people
   and ecological resources that enable learning and the internalization of
   ecological feedbacks. Agency is also key, yet we show that while
   perceived power may encourage adaptations, it may discourage more
   transformative actions.
   Multilevel network modelling shows that social network exposure promotes
   both adaptive and transformative responses to climate change among Papua
   New Guinean islanders. Different social-ecological network structures
   are associated with adaptation versus transformation.},

   the time horizon of 100 years. Here, we investigated the variation of
   soil CH4 fluxes, soil physiochemical properties, and CH4-related
   bacteria community composition of two forests in China. We measured CH4
   fluxes using static chambers and analyzed soil bacterial communities
   using next-generation high-throughput sequencing in a temperate
   broad-leaved deciduous forest at Baotianman Nature Reserve (TBDF-BTM)
   and a tropical rainforest at Jianfengling National Natural Reserve
   (TRF-JFL). Our results showed that the soils from both sites were CH4
   sinks. Significant variation in soil CH4 fluxes was found at TBDF-BTM
   exclusively, while no seasonal variation in the CH4 uptake was observed
   at TRF-JFL. The CH4 fluxes at TBDF-BTM were substantially higher than
   those at TRF-JFL during all seasons. One genus of methanotrophs and
   three genera of methylotrophs were detected at both sites, though they
   had no direct relationship with soil CH4 fluxes. Water-filled pore space
   and soil total carbon content are the main factors controlling the soil
   CH4 fluxes at TBDF-BTM. At TRF-JFL, the soil CH4 fluxes showed no
   significant correlations with any of the soil properties. This study
   improves our understanding of soil CH4 fluxes and their influencing
   factors in forests in different climatic zones and provides a reference
   for future investigation of forest soil CH4 fluxes, the forest ecosystem
   carbon cycle, and the forest CH4 model.},

Abstract = {Coastal cities are susceptible to the impacts of waves, flooding, storm
   surge, and sea-level rise. In response to these threats, coastal
   jurisdictions have invested in engineered shoreline defenses such as
   breakwaters and sea walls that are costly to implement and maintain.
   Thus, there is an increasing recognition that nature-based defenses
   provided by healthy ecosystems like coral reefs can be an effective and
   cost-efficient alternative to mitigate the impacts of climatic hazards
   while simultaneously restoring ecosystem services. Unfortunately, coral
   reefs have experienced degradation worldwide, lowering their potential
   for wave-energy dissipation. As coastal vulnerability increases with the
   loss of natural barriers, it is imperative to design and test novel
   resilience solutions. Our study quantifies the benefits of hybrid
   artificial reefs for wave mitigation in a wave-tank simulator using
   periodic waves of three heights (0.10, 0.16, and 0.24 m) at two water
   levels (0.55 and 0.65 m) defined considering the Froude similarity with
   a prototype reef structure in South Florida. Experiments showed that an
   artificial trapezoidal reef model reduces wave height (> 35\%) and wave
   energy (up to 63\%) under realistic wave conditions. Moreover, adding
   coral skeletons ofAcropora cervicornisto simulate reef restoration onto
   the model mitigates up to an additional 10\% of wave height and 14\% of
   wave energy through increased friction, supporting the use of hybrid
   approaches that integrate both gray and green infrastructure to enhance
   coastal resilience. Exploring wave-tank simulations provides a better
   understanding of wave effects before implementing larger and more costly
   projects in the field.},

Title = {The impact of climate change policy on the risk of water stress in
   southern and eastern Asia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The adequacy of freshwater resources remains a critical challenge for a
   sustainable and growing society. We present a self-consistent risk-based
   assessment of water availability and use under future climate change and
   socioeconomic growth by midcentury across southern and eastern Asia
   (SEA). We employ large ensemble scenarios from an integrated modeling
   framework that are consistent across the spectrum of regional climate,
   population, and economic projections. We find socioeconomic growth
   contributes to an increase in water stress across the entire ensemble.
   However, climate change drives the ensemble central tendency toward an
   increase in water stress in China but a reduction in India, with a
   considerable spread across the ensemble. Nevertheless, the most
   deleterious unabated climate-change impact is a low probability but
   salient extreme increase in water stress over China and India. In these
   outcomes, annual withdrawals will routinely exceed water-storage
   capacity. A modest greenhouse gas mitigation pathway eliminates the
   likelihood of these extreme outcomes and also benefits hundreds of
   millions of people at risk to various levels of water stress increase.
   Over SEA we estimate an additional 200 million people under threat of
   facing at least heavily water-stressed conditions from climate change
   and socioeconomic growth, but the mitigation scenario reduces the
   additional population-under-threat by 30\% (60 million). Nevertheless,
   there remains a 1-in-2 chance that 100 million people across SEA
   experience a 50\% increase in water stress and a 1-in-10 chance they
   experience a doubling of water stress. Therefore, widespread adaptive
   measures may be required over the coming decades to meet these
   unavoidable risks in water shortfalls.},

Abstract = {Climate change induced great challenges for agriculture, particularly
   implementation of new farming practices. Adaptation to climate change
   requires sustainable and environmentally friendly farm-level management
   practices and methods, and most promising of them are offered by an
   ecosystem approach and agroecological principles. The paper presents the
   results of the research, which has twofold aim: 1) to determine the most
   promising ecosystem based adaptation measures to climate change for
   Latvia's crop farms via evaluating recommendations; 2) to evaluate the
   implementation and possibilities of adaptation measures via assessing
   trends in Latvia, as well as comparing status among the countries in the
   Baltic Sea region. The data was obtained from the EU and national
   statistical database. The mixed research, combining suitable qualitative
   and quantitative research methods, was used. Most promising adaptation
   measures to climate change for implementation in the Latvia's crop farms
   could be combination of conservation agriculture practices (i.e. minimum
   soil disturbance, crop diversification, and permanent soil cover) with
   agroecological farm management practices. The results show that in
   Latvia, with the exception in the organic agriculture sector, in
   particular in the organic farming, the above mentioned climate
   adaptation measures at farm level have not yet been introduced and
   implemented sufficiently and effectively, especially compared to other
   EU countries in the Baltic Sea region.},

Abstract = {Urban electrification with renewables is a crucial strategy for
   achieving low-carbon and climate-resilient communities. Given the
   different types of power customers (e.g., residential, commercial and
   industrial), this work develops a systematic and straightforward
   framework for the optimal planning of urban solar/wind/biomass (/natural
   gas) systems at neighbourhood scale using the actual real-time hourly
   electric loads. In achieving this objective, we defined three power
   scenarios (i) 100\% natural gas; (ii) natural gas and renewables; (iii)
   100\% renewables (e.g., solar/wind/biomass) and identified the hybrid
   systems with the least NPC for each of the three power scenarios. Our
   results indicate that providing per kilowatt-hour renewable electricity
   to the industrial sector (0.385 USD/kWh) costs 4\% less than the
   commercial (0.399 USD/kWh) and about 5\% less than the residential
   sector (0.418 USD/kWh) at neighbourhood scales. The more significant
   cost of electricity (COE) of the residential system is primarily due to
   the greater batteries to solar PV fractions. Also, COE of
   solar/wind/biomass plant showed to be three times less than the
   equivalent solar/wind power system. Likewise, by integrating a low
   emission natural gas (NG) generator to the hybrid solar/wind/biomass
   plant, the system's COE reduced by 30\% while resulting in close to
   three order-of-magnitude higher annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   To address the model accuracy concerning the uncertainty and variations
   associated with input variables, we further conducted the sensitivity
   analysis of the systems' COE address the model accuracy concerning the
   uncertainty and variations associated with input variables by changes in
   the discount rate and capital cost of the PV panels and batteries. As a
   result, systems' COE was detected to be more sensitive to the capital
   cost of batteries than solar panels. This study can help decision-makers
   in developing more effective policies and mechanisms to support the
   urban hybrid renewable energy systems.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a risk-cost-benefit based framework to assess the
   potential hurricane damage risks to residential construction and
   investigate the cost-effectiveness of different adaptation strategies
   under various wind speed change scenarios due to climate change. It is
   estimated that hurricanes caused \$6 billion annually in the US in
   recent years. Changes in hurricane intensity or/and frequency may be
   expected due to the changing climate. This paper proposes a framework to
   refine hurricane risk assessment by accounting for the impacts the
   changing climate may have on hurricane intensity and/or frequency.
   Various adaptation strategies will be developed in an attempt to
   mitigate damage costs. Three case study locations (Miami-Dade County,
   New Hanover County, Galveston County) are presented. This study finds
   that climate change may have a substantial impact on damage estimation
   in coastal areas, and that certain adaptation strategies can
   cost-effectively decrease the damage.},

Abstract = {Background: Climate change is a critical concern globally and small
   island developing states in the Pacific region are especially vulnerable
   to climate change-related phenomena. Pacific Islands have been
   identified as being amongst the countries most vulnerable to the health
   impacts of climate change. The purpose of this paper is to describe
   impacts of climate change on food and nutrition security in Pacific
   Island countries, the mechanisms linking climate change and nutrition,
   and strategies and policies to address them. Method: A literature review
   and documentary analysis was undertaken. Case materials from Pacific
   Island countries are used to illustrate both climate change impacts and
   promising strategies. Results: Climate change exacerbates the existing
   burden of malnutrition. Food and nutrition security are affected through
   changes in local food production and transition from traditional
   nutritious diets to dependence on less nutritious imported foods,
   undermining efforts to reduce hunger and promote nutrition.
   Undernutrition, in turn, weakens climate resilience and the coping
   strategies of vulnerable populations. Nutrition-sensitive adaptation and
   mitigation measures, climate-resilient and nutrition-sensitive
   agriculture development, improved maternal and child care and health,
   and both community development and food system resilience measures are
   proposed as means to address the impacts of climate change on food and
   nutrition security. Conclusion: Pacific Island countries should not face
   these challenges alone. Strengthened global, regional and community
   responses to organize better preparedness, adaptation and mitigation
   against climate change and its impact on nutrition in Pacific island
   countries is needed. Specific opportunities to address these issues in
   the Pacific will be presented.},

Abstract = {Microbially mediated biogeochemical processes are crucial for climate
   regulation and may be disrupted by anthropogenic contaminants. To better
   manage contaminants, we need tools that make real-time causal links
   between stressors and altered microbial functions, and the potential
   consequences for ecosystem services such as climate regulation. In a
   manipulative field experiment, we used metatranscriptomics to
   investigate the impact of excess organic enrichment and metal
   contamination on the gene expression of nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms
   in coastal sediments. Our gene expression data suggest that excess
   organic enrichment results in (i) higher transcript levels of genes
   involved in the production of toxic ammonia and hydrogen sulfide and
   (ii) lower transcript levels associated with the degradation of a
   greenhouse gas (nitrous oxide). However, metal contamination did not
   have any significant impact on gene expression. We reveal the genetic
   mechanisms that may lead to altered productivity and greenhouse gas
   production in coastal sediments due to anthropogenic contaminants. Our
   data highlight the applicability of metatranscriptomics as a management
   tool that provides an immense breadth of information and can identify
   potentially impacted process measurements that need further
   investigation.},

Abstract = {The Pearl River (Zhujiang) ranks as the 13th or the 14th largest river
   in the world and is the 2nd largest in China in terms of annual water
   discharge. It is also the second largest river entering into the South
   China Sea. The three major tributaries, namely, the Xijiang (West
   River), the Beijiang (North River) and the Dongjiang (East River) are
   highly eutrophicated in the region of the Pearl River Delta because of
   the high nutrient and sediment loading. At places, the dissolved oxygen
   saturation level becomes as low as 2\%. Naturally, CH4, N2O, and CO2 are
   highly supersaturated.
   Once the river water discharges into the main estuary, the Lingdingyang,
   it tends to flow out on the western side while open ocean waters with
   lower nutrient contents and pCO(2) but higher salinity and pH values
   enter on the eastern side. Largely as a result of mixing with the open
   ocean water but partly because of biological consumption, pCO(2) quickly
   reduces to near saturation only tens of kilometers off the mouth of the
   estuary. The \% saturation of CH4 and N2O is also greatly reduced but
   the continental shelf remains as a source of these greenhouse gases to
   the atmosphere. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An optimization method is used for determining the electric power to be
   supplied at the different nodes of a microgrid with the aim of reducing
   generation costs, losses by electricity transmission, and greenhouse gas
   emissions, while simultaneously maintaining the energy quality at all
   points of supply. The optimization problem is complex due to the various
   restrictions inherent to the distributed energy resources in the
   microgrid. The generation sources include diesel engines, photovoltaic
   panels, wind turbines, and fuel cells, each of them conveniently
   represented by specific mathematical models. Simulation examples are
   presented for both island and non -island operation modes. The problem
   is solved through a particle swarm optimization algorithm that
   efficiently provides acceptable solutions.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change: Social-ecological resilience in a Canadian
   Western Arctic community},
Journal = {CONSERVATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Human adaptation remains an insufficiently studied part of the subject
   of climate change. This paper examines the questions of adaptation and
   change in terms of social-ecological resilience using lessons from a
   place-specific case study. The Inuvialuit people of the small community
   of Sachs Harbour in Canada's western Arctic have been tracking climate
   change throughout the 1990s. We analyze the adaptive capacity of this
   community to deal with climate change. Short-term responses to changes
   in land-based activities, which are identified as coping mechanisms, are
   one component of this adaptive capacity. The second component is related
   to cultural and ecological adaptations of the Inuvialuit for life in a
   highly variable and uncertain environment; these represent long-term
   adaptive strategies. These two types of strategies are, in fact, on a
   continuum in space and time. This study suggests new ways in which
   theory and practice can be combined by showing how societies may adapt
   to climate change at multiple scales. Switching species and adjusting
   the ``where, when, and how{''} of hunting are examples of shorter-term
   responses. On the other hand, adaptations such as flexibility in
   seasonal hunting patterns, traditional knowledge that allows the
   community to diversity hunting activities, networks for sharing food and
   other resources, and intercommunity trade are longer-term, culturally
   ingrained mechanisms. Individuals, households, and the community as a
   whole also provide feedback on their responses to change. Newly
   developing co-management institutions create additional linkages for
   feedback across different levels, enhancing the capacity for learning
   and self-organization of the local inhabitants and making it possible
   for them to transmit community concerns to regional, national, and
   international levels.},

Abstract = {The World Bank and the Intergovernmental panel on climate change have
   concluded that human activities such as fossil fuel combustion have
   caused higher average temperatures, more violent weather patterns and
   higher sea levels. Governments, politicians and corporations have
   started to take steps to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other
   greenhouse gases to reduce its imbalance in the atmosphere, and in so
   doing, diminish the impacts it will have in the near future. While these
   parties have recognized the importance of significantly reducing
   emissions in the coming decades, there are currently no policies in the
   USA to accomplish these goals. At the same time that the need to reduce
   emissions become more and more apparent, the realization that the
   world's current economy is highly carbon-dependent and that shifting to
   renewable energy sources would be extremely expensive as well, thus
   compelling governments to approach the problem cautiously. Maybe because
   of this reality, governments have preferred emissions trading schemes
   over emissions caps and taxes with no trading. Unlike a cap affecting
   carbon emitters uniformly, the trading schemes that have been introduced
   recently allow for a collective cap on emissions under which emitters
   are held to standards which can be achieved by reducing emission's or by
   buying carbon credits, which are emissions reductions that have been
   achieved by a different third party. At this time, the Kyoto Protocol is
   the most comprehensive of the commitments governments have made toward
   the ultimate aim of curbing greenhouse gases. Under its umbrella, many

Title = {The Role of Urban Growth in Resilience of Communities Under Flood Risk},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Flood risk to urban communities is increasing significantly as a result
   of the integrated effects of climate change and socioeconomic
   development. The latter effect is one of the main drivers of rising
   flood risk has received less attention in comparison to climate change.
   Economic development and population growth are major causes of urban
   expansion in flood-prone areas, and a comprehensive understanding of the
   impact of urban growth on flood risk is an essential ingredient of
   effective flood risk management. At the same time, planning for
   community resilience has become a national and worldwide imperative in
   recent years. Enhancements to community resilience require
   well-integrated and enormous long-term public and private investments.
   Accordingly, comprehensive urban growth plans should take rising flood
   risk into account to ensure future resilient communities through careful
   collaboration between engineers, geologists, socialists, economists, and
   urban planners within the framework of life-cycle analysis. This paper
   highlights the importance of including urban growth in accurate future
   flood risk assessment and how planning for future urbanization should
   include measurement science-based strategies in developing policies to
   achieve more resilient communities.},

Title = {A typology of responsibility for coastal flood risk adaptation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {The management of coastal flood risk is adapting to meet the challenges
   and increased risks posed by population change as well as by climate
   change, especially sea level rise. Protection is being targeted to areas
   where the benefits are highest, while elsewhere there is a shift towards
   more localized ``living with floods{''} and ``resilience{''} approaches.
   Such decentralized approaches to flood risk management (FRM) require a
   diverse range of stakeholder groups to be engaged as ``flood risk
   citizens{''}. Engagement of households in FRM is central to this
   process. Despite significant research on stakeholder engagement in
   coastal and flood risk management, there is less focus on the nature of
   responsibility in coastal adaptation. There is no framework by which to
   assess the different types of responsibility in hazard management and
   adaptation, and little research on the implications of expecting these
   responsibilities of stakeholder groups. In this paper, we identify five
   types of responsibility that are embedded throughout the disaster risk
   reduction cycle of managing coastal flooding. We build this ``typology
   of responsibility{''} on existing work on the evolution of stakeholder
   engagement and stakeholder responsibility relationships in risk
   management processes, and a dataset of institutional stakeholder
   interviews and households surveys conducted across three case studies in
   England, the United Kingdom, in 2018 and 2019. We analyze the interviews
   using thematic analysis to explore institutional stakeholder perceptions
   of responsibility in coastal FRM, and analyze the household survey
   through descriptive and inferential statistics. By developing the first
   disaster risk reduction focused typology of responsibility for coastal
   flooding, we provide researchers and decision-makers with a tool to
   guide their planning and allocation of responsibilities in risk
   management for floods and other climate-driven hazards.},

Title = {The techno-economic feasibility of a coastal zero-energy hotel building
   supported by the hybrid wind-wave energy system},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization brings with it economic growth as well as energy
   demand increase. Numerous greenhouse gas emissions are emitted by city
   activities, given the tiny proportion of renewable energy utilization
   for electricity generation. This paper investigates the feasibility of
   utilizing the wave energy converter and offshore wind turbine to support
   the coastal zero-energy building. With the systematic investigations and
   analyzes, it takes multi-objectives guaranteeing both economic and
   environmental improvement. The performance of the instantaneous work is
   achieved by the simulation study in the simulation software TRNSYS 18
   where the building services, storage systems, and renewable energy units
   are all set up From the aspect of the thermal energy system efficiency,
   the coefficient of performance is used. The advantageous temperature of
   seawater is shown by the alternative heat exchanger to the air-cooled
   cooling tower. By replacing the electric heater with the heat pump, the
   electricity demand of the heating system is reduced to 26\%. Two energy
   matching criteria, ``on-site electrical energy matching'' and ``on-site
   electrical energy fraction'', assess the technical performance with a
   series of wind-wave ratios. The results indicate the combined renewable
   system highly offsets the power shortage of a single resource.
   Accordingly, a significant reduction of annual equivalent CO2 emissions
   is reached. Further, the related techno-economic behaviors are analyzed
   by relative net present value and relative simple payback period. The
   evaluations roughly show the feasibility within a 20-year working
   period. That means the model is a practical solution profitable and
   environmentally friendly. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Distinct energy budgets for anthropogenic and natural changes during
   global warming hiatus},
Journal = {NATURE GEOSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Earth's energy budget for the past four decades can now be
   closed(1), and it supports anthropogenic greenhouse forcing as the cause
   for climate warming. However, closure depends on invoking an
   unrealistically large increase in aerosol cooling(2) during the
   so-called global warming hiatus since the late 1990s (refs 3,4) that was
   due partly to tropical Pacific Ocean cooling(5-7). The difficulty with
   this closure lies in the assumption that the same climate feedback
   applies to both anthropogenic warming and natural cooling. Here we
   analyse climate model simulations with and without anthropogenic
   increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, and show that
   top-of-the-atmosphere radiation and global mean surface temperature are
   much less tightly coupled for natural decadal variability than for the
   greenhouse-gas-induced response, implying distinct climate feedback
   between anthropogenic warming and natural variability. In addition, we
   identify a phase difference between top-of-the-atmosphere radiation and
   global mean surface temperature such that ocean heat uptake tends to
   slow down during the surface warming hiatus. This result deviates from
   existing energy theory but we find that it is broadly consistent with
   observations. Our study highlights the importance of developing metrics
   that distinguish anthropogenic change from natural variations to
   attribute climate variability and to estimate climate sensitivity from
   observations.},

Title = {Transition pathway towards 100\% renewable energy across the sectors of
   power, heat, transport, and desalination for the Philippines},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},

Abstract = {Transition towards sustainable energy systems is of utmost importance to
   avert global consequences of climate change. Within the framework of the
   Paris Agreement and Marrakech Communique, this study analyses an energy
   transition pathway utilising renewable resources for the Philippines.
   The transition study is performed from 2015 to 2050 on a high temporal
   and spatial resolution data, using a linear optimisation tool. From the
   results of this study, technically, a 100\% fossil free energy system in
   2050 is possible, with a cost structure comparable to an energy system
   in 2015, while having zero greenhouse gas emissions. Solar PV as a
   generation and batteries a as storage technology form the backbone of
   the energy system during the transition. Direct and indirect
   electrification across all sectors would result in an efficiency gain of
   more than 50\% in 2050, while keeping the total annual investment within
   20-55 beuro. Heat pumps, electrical heating, and solar thermal
   technologies would supply heat, whereas, direct electricity and
   synthetic fuels would fuel the energy needs of the transport sector. The
   results indicate that, indigenous renewable resources in the Philippines
   could power the demand from all energy sectors, thereby, bringing
   various socio-economic benefits.},

Title = {Carbon footprint analysis of chemical enhanced primary treatment and
   sludge incineration for sewage treatment in Hong Kong},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {272},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The potential of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sewage management
   of metropolis is a critical concern in the water-energy-nexus. With
   limited space and costly labor, the chemical enhanced primary treatment
   (CEPT) process associated with sludge incineration was developed in Hong
   Kong for sewage and sludge treatment, respectively. However, the
   potential impacts of direct discharge of CEPT effluent in the receiving
   waterbody, i.e., the possible GHGs emissions after the expected increase
   of total wastewater loads, have never been addressed. Using Hong Kong as
   a research platform, this study developed nine scenarios with different
   wastewater and sludge treatment processes to study the energy profiles
   and direct/indirect carbon emissions. The impacts from different
   emission sources to global warming were evaluated. Two of the scenarios
   represent the ongoing Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works
   (SCISTW) and Shatin Sewage Treatment Works (STSTW), of which CEPT and
   activated sludge process (ASP) were in operation, respectively. The
   results showed that the energy efficiency of the SCISTW (0.065 kW h .
   m(-3)) wastewater treated) was 71\% lower than that of the STSTW (0.224
   kW h . m(-3)), but the GHG emission was higher in the CEPT plant (0.625
   kg CO2-e . m(-3)) than the ASP plant (0.408 kg CO2-e.m(-3)). The
   addition of biological process and sludge digester in SCISTW would
   increase the energy consumption to 0.080 kW h, but reduce the GHG
   emissions by 70\% (to 0.185 kg CO2-e . m(-3)). Sending the sludge cake
   to incineration would eliminate 64\% of the GHG emissions from STSTW.
   Applying CEPT in the system may further reduce GHG emissions due to
   changed sludge combination, which may also be beneficial to energy
   recovery. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Emissions of black carbon (BC) particles from anthropogenic and natural
   sources contribute to climate change and human health impacts.
   Therefore, they need to be accurately quantified to develop an effective
   mitigation strategy. Although the spread of the emission flux estimates
   for China have recently narrowed under the constraints of atmospheric
   observations, consensus has not been reached regarding the dominant
   emission sector. Here, we quantified the contribution of the residential
   sector, as 64\% (44-82\%) in 2019, using the response of the observed
   atmospheric concentration in the outflowing air during Feb-Mar 2020,
   with the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic and restricted human
   activities over China. In detail, the BC emission fluxes, estimated
   after removing effects from meteorological variability, dropped only
   slightly (- 18\%) during Feb-Mar 2020 from the levels in the previous
   year for selected air masses of Chinese origin, suggesting the
   contributions from the transport and industry sectors (36\%) were
   smaller than the rest from the residential sector (64\%). Carbon
   monoxide (CO) behaved differently, with larger emission reductions (-
   35\%) in the period Feb-Mar 2020, suggesting dominance of
   non-residential (i.e., transport and industry) sectors, which
   contributed 70\% (48-100\%) emission during 2019. The estimated BC/CO
   emission ratio for these sectors will help to further constrain
   bottom-up emission inventories. We comprehensively provide a clear
   scientific evidence supporting mitigation policies targeting reduction
   in residential BC emissions from China by demonstrating the economic
   feasibility using marginal abatement cost curves.},

Abstract = {The end-Permian biotic crisis is commonly associated with rapid and
   severe climatic changes. These climatic changes are commonly suggested
   to have originated from solid Earth carbon degassing (leading to global
   warming), but aerosol- and ash-induced cooling induced by lava degassing
   has been suggested as well. The application of an Earth System Model of
   Intermediate Complexity has enabled a visualisation of the major
   climatic shifts on the supercontinent Pangaea caused by rapid
   temperature changes due to changed radiative properties from greenhouse
   gases. The reconstructed reference climate was validated by latest
   Permian climate indicative sediments to investigate the possible
   climatic shifts. From a set of 22 reconstructions which varied with
   temperature a minimum global annual mean temperature of 18.2 degrees C
   for the late Permian climate prior to the climatic perturbation event
   was determined. Starting from this pre-event setup, global warming and
   global cooling scenarios were simulated. The response of the end Permian
   climate system to temperature increase and decrease show marked
   differences. While global cooling is followed by major climatic changes
   in the high latitudes and replacement of boreal biomes by tundra and
   polar frost, the changes during global warming are less pronounced with
   only locally increasing aridity compensated by humidisation in other
   regions. The different behaviour of the climatic belts under warm and
   cold conditions is accompanied by different climate sensitivities caused
   by different strength of the snow cover-albedo feedback. Thus, changes
   in the energy balance of the latest Permian surface-troposphere system
   have a 30\% higher perturbation potential during cold climate conditions
   than during warmhouse conditions. Therefore substantial global cooling
   resulting in coldhouse climate conditions and an annual global mean
   temperature below 18 degrees C is more efficient in perturbing the Earth
   palaeoclimate during the end-Permian warmhouse. The results suggest that
   global cooling mechanisms as injection of sulphur aerosols and ash
   particles from the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province into the Late
   Permian palaeoatmosphere have a higher climate perturbation potential
   than a warming due to carbon greenhouse gases with a similar magnitude
   of radiative forcing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Oceanic people and places are increasingly labelled as either
   `resilient' or `vulnerable' to disasters and climate change. Resilience
   is often described in disaster discourse as a strategy designed to
   overcome vulnerability by helping communities to `bounce back' in the
   wake of `natural' disasters. Using ethnographic research conducted with
   Community Disaster and Climate Change Committees (CDCs) in Vanuatu in
   the wake of Tropical Cyclone Pam, this paper seeks to problematise
   disaster responses that see the `community' as a space to be acted upon
   by outsiders, or where people will respond in a unified way to the
   challenges of rebuilding after disaster. Using political ecology
   framings this paper critiques the ideas of resilience that appear
   entrenched in community-based disaster and climate change adaptation
   discourse and practice in Oceania. Rather than presupposing resilience
   or vulnerability, this paper details the dispersal and distribution
   power and agency amongst individual actors and groups that either
   supported or manipulated, the distribution of goods by Community
   Disaster Committees. In this way, it moves beyond the limitations of
   conceptual framings of resilience in disaster management and climate
   change into a more considered appraisal of power, by exploring what
   James Ferguson has termed `the politics of distribution' in the context
   of disaster.},

Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Land utilisation by the solar energy industry and other sectors, such as
   residential and agriculture, has become increasingly competitive in
   recent years. Therefore, space optimisation is essential to reduce
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while optimising electricity generation
   and profiting from the solar power plant. This article aims to discuss
   the different configurations of integrated photovoltaic (PV) systems,
   which combine the requirement features of a ground-mounted photovoltaic
   farm (GMPV) grouped into three systems: PV-wind, building integrated- or
   applied- PV (BIPV/BAPV) and agrophotovoltaic (agroPV). These systems
   generate electricity but differ because PV-wind systems generate
   electricity from two energy sources, whilst BIPV/BAPV systems utilise
   existing building space. Improving these systems, the agroPV system
   combines the benefits of producing power and using the vacant ground
   beneath the PV panels by cultivating crops. As a result, the BIPV system
   possesses the lowest emission rate with a range of -0.906-0.071
   kgCO(2)eq/kWh. The manufacturing PV system's emission rate for these
   systems is highly affected. Meanwhile, the longest energy payback time
   (EPBT) is 6.3 years (BAPV), and the shortest is 0.5 years (GMPV). GMPV
   has the lowest EPBT due to the high electricity production of the plant,
   which allows the immediate repayment of the primary energy consumed.
   GMPV system has the lowest levelised cost of energy (LCOE) with the
   range of \$0.04-\$0.13/kWh. Meanwhile, the agroPV system has a good
   performance with an emission rate of 0.02 kgCO(2)eq/kWh, comparable to
   GMPV systems and lower than other integrated systems in terms of
   emission. The system has the LCOE of similar to\$0.1/kWh, which is
   slightly higher than GMPV systems due to the system's higher cost but
   still provides monetary benefit.},

Title = {Is urbanisation also the culprit of climate change? - Evidence from
   Australian cities},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this study, daily maximum and minimum air temperature (T-max and
   T-min), evaporation and rainfall data (1960-2011 period) were analysed
   for three Australian metropolitan cities, viz., Sydney, Melbourne and
   Brisbane, to understand whether urbanisation has influenced temperature,
   evaporation and rainfall in these cities and thus had an influence on
   the longer-term local climate variability. A total of nine key locations
   in each city were considered and one location in each city was a
   control. A modified segmented regression analysis was employed to
   understand the overall climate change and linear regression analysis to
   evaluate the impacts of urbanisation.
   The study indicates a significant overall climate change during the
   1986-2011 period when compared with the 1960-1985 periods, and
   urbanisation added to the overall climate change. There were
   statistically significant increases in T-max and T-min for Sydney and
   decreases for Melbourne, decrease in T-max and increase in T-min for
   Brisbane. On the other hand, evaporation values decreased for Sydney and
   Brisbane but increased for Melbourne. There was a statistically
   significant increase in rainfall for Brisbane only. The study suggests
   that climate change adaptation strategies and policies need to consider
   urbanisation, alongwith greenhouse gases, to cope with future climate
   change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, is
   increasingly being used as a management for climate change mitigation by
   removing and sequestering carbon in the atmosphere. Mangrove
   rehabilitation activity held by the National Park since 2005, is one of
   the efforts to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions. However, the
   growth and distribution of mangroves are non -optimal due to unfavorable
   environmental conditions. This certainly has an impact on the amount of
   carbon stock stored in mangroves. Therefore, this research aims 1) to
   estimate the potential carbon stock in restored mangroves on above
   ground (ABG), below ground (BGB), and soil carbon, and 2) to estimate
   the economic valuation of mangrove services as carbon storage. We
   calculate the carbon stock in ABG and BGB mangrove using a
   non-destructive method (allometric formula), while the calculation of
   soil carbon is carried out by analyzing the C-Organic content using
   mangrove rehabilitation (ABG+BGB+soil carbon) is 634.54 tonC/ha and CO2
   sequestration is 2328.75 tCO(2)/ha. The economic value of mangrove
   rehabilitation for environmental services in storing carbon reached
   375,202,308 IDR for the voluntary market and 980,528,697 IDR for the
   regulatory compliance (Clean Development Mechanism). The results can be
   used as initial information on mangrove ecosystem management policies,
   specifically as carbon storage for sustainable mangrove rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) provides a globally significant
   demonstration of the effectiveness of large-scale networks of marine
   reserves in contributing to integrated, adaptive management.
   Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits
   of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef
   habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity
   conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than
   smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit
   overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating,
   crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which
   consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef
   ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of
   compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take
   zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses
   comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions
   illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice
   conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine
   reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic
   analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting
   environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by
   reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor. Recent
   implementation of an Outlook Report provides regular, formal review of
   environmental condition and management and links to policy responses,
   key aspects of adaptive management. Given the major threat posed by
   climate change, the expanded network of marine reserves provides a
   critical and cost-effective contribution to enhancing the resilience of
   the Great Barrier Reef.},

Abstract = {Tropical beaches provide coastal flood protection, income from tourism,
   and habitat for flagship species. They urgently need protection from
   erosion, which is being exacerbated by changing climate and coastal
   development. Traditional coastal engineering solutions are expensive,
   provide unstable temporary solutions, and often disrupt natural sediment
   transport. Instead, natural foreshore stabilization and nourishment may
   provide a sustainable and resilient long-term solution. Field flume and
   ecosystem process measurements, along with data from the literature,
   show that sediment stabilization by seagrass in combination with
   sediment-producing calcifying algae in the foreshore form an effective
   mechanism for maintaining tropical beaches worldwide. The long-term
   efficacy of this type of nature-based beach management is shown at a
   large scale by comparing vegetated and unvegetated coastal profiles. We
   argue that preserving and restoring vegetated beach foreshore ecosystems
   offers a viable, self-sustaining alternative to traditional engineering
   solutions, increasing the resilience of coastal areas to climate change.},

Abstract = {In this paper we propose a framework for evaluating how prepared
   California resource managers are for risks of continued climate change.
   The framework presented suggests three critical dimensions of
   preparedness - awareness of climate-related risks, analytic capacity to
   translate such climate risks information into specific planning and
   management activities, and the extent of actions taken to address the
   risks. We illustrate the application of this framework in this paper
   through preliminary research of California coastal managers where we
   identify limited awareness of climate-change related risks, limited
   analytic capacity, and significant constraints on the abilities of
   institutions and individuals to take adaptation actions. Our analysis
   suggests that for California to realize its significant adaptive
   capacity and be able to manage the unavoidable impacts of climate
   change, resource managers need to be engaged more effectively in future
   discussions of managing climate risks in the state.},

Title = {Natural gas as a marine fuel},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {87},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {153-167},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper provides new knowledge about the life-cycle emissions of
   natural gas compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels in the marine
   sector. While natural gas will reduce local air pollutants, such as
   sulfur oxides and particulate matter, the implications for greenhouse
   gases depend on how the natural gas is extracted, processed,
   distributed, and used. Applying a ``technology warming potential{''}
   (TWP) approach, natural gas as a marine fuel achieves climate parity
   within 30 years for diesel ignited engines, though could take up to 190
   years to reach climate parity with conventional fuels in a spark ignited
   engine. Movement towards natural gas as a marine fuel continues to
   progress, and conditions exist in some regions to make a near-term
   transition to natural gas feasible. Liquefied natural gas in marine
   transportation is likely to be incentivized where economics favoring
   natural gas is coupled with air emissions public policy targets. To
   ensure that climate neutral conversion is achieved with the least delay,
   TWP results highlight the important role of energy policy for
   infrastructure development of upstream pathways and onboard ship systems
   technology innovation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered a leading technology for
   reducing CO2 emissions from fossil-fuelled electricity generation plants
   and could permit the continued use of coal and gas whilst meeting
   greenhouse gas targets. However considerable energy is required for the
   capture, compression, transport and storage steps involved. In this
   paper, energy penalty information in the literature is reviewed, and
   thermodynamically ideal and ``real world{''} energy penalty values are
   calculated. For a sub-critical pulverized coal (PC) plant, the energy
   penalty values for 100\% capture are 48.6\% and 43.5\% for liquefied
   CO2, and for CO2 compressed to 11 MPa, respectively. When assumptions
   for supercritical plants were incorporated, results were in broad
   agreement with published values arising from process modelling. However,
   we show that energy use in existing capture operations is considerably
   greater than indicated by most projections. Full CCS demonstration
   plants are now required to verify modelled energy penalty values.
   However, it appears unlikely that CCS will deliver significant CO2
   reductions in a timely fashion. In addition, many uncertainties remain
   over the permanence Of CO2 storage, either in geological formations, or
   beneath the ocean. We conclude that further investment in CCS should be
   seriously questioned by policy makers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Evaluating the dominant components of warming in Pliocene climate
   simulations},
Journal = {CLIMATE OF THE PAST},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-90},
Abstract = {The Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) is the first
   coordinated climate model comparison for a warmer palaeoclimate with
   atmospheric CO2 significantly higher than pre-industrial concentrations.
   The simulations of the mid-Pliocene warm period show global warming of
   between 1.8 and 3.6 degrees C above pre-industrial surface air
   temperatures, with significant polar amplification. Here we perform
   energy balance calculations on all eight of the coupled ocean-atmosphere
   simulations within PlioMIP Experiment 2 to evaluate the causes of the
   increased temperatures and differences between the models. In the
   tropics simulated warming is dominated by greenhouse gas increases, with
   the cloud component of planetary albedo enhancing the warming in most of
   the models, but by widely varying amounts. The responses to mid-Pliocene
   climate forcing in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes are
   substantially different between the climate models, with the only
   consistent response being a warming due to increased greenhouse gases.
   In the high latitudes all the energy balance components become
   important, but the dominant warming influence comes from the clear sky
   albedo, only partially offset by the increases in the cooling impact of
   cloud albedo. This demonstrates the importance of specified ice sheet
   and high latitude vegetation boundary conditions and simulated sea ice
   and snow albedo feedbacks. The largest components in the overall
   uncertainty are associated with clouds in the tropics and polar clear
   sky albedo, particularly in sea ice regions. These simulations show that
   albedo feedbacks, particularly those of sea ice and ice sheets, provide
   the most significant enhancements to high latitude warming in the
   Pliocene.},

Abstract = {The vegetation cover of terrestrial ecosystems plays an important role
   in the regulation of energy and mass exchange in the atmosphere-land
   surface system. In particular, plants actively absorb atmospheric carbon
   dioxide, thereby reducing the greenhouse effect. An important
   quantitative characteristic of the vegetation cover is its net primary
   production. Changes in the terrestrial net primary production under
   possible climate changes in the 21 st century are estimated. The
   computations are based on the dependence of net primary production on
   the surface radiation balance and evaporation. This dependence is
   derived using the relationship between the thermal conditions (annual
   total of effective daily mean surface temperature) and the radiation
   balance. Possible changes in the net primary production over Russia
   under a I degreesC increase in the annual mean global surface
   temperature are estimated by using the atmosphere-ocean general
   circulation models ECHAM4/OPYC3 and HadCM3 and the
   intermediate-complexity IAP RAS climate model for anthropogenic
   scenarios of greenhouse gas changes. The results obtained are used to
   estimate the atmospheric carbon sink associated with changes in the
   vegetation cover.},

   1990's. The dramatic decrease of sediment supplies from rivers caused
   rapid erosion at the delta and estuary areas, especially in the
   abandoned Yellow River Delta. Most sandy coasts along the Peninsula were
   eroded due to lack of sand supply and interruption of alongshore
   sediment drift, sand dredging from the beach or the offshore area caused
   serious erosion during short time. Sea-level rise causes slow but
   constant shoreline retreats and became a more serious threat. Different
   types of hard solutions for coastal protection against erosion were used
   in Shandong. Seawalls are most widely used, especially at the Yellow
   River Delta and city center waterfront. Groynes, jetties and breakwater
   are used on the north and east sandy coast of the Peninsula. Hard
   approaches are effective to protect the coast erosion but not change the
   erosion causes and led secondary impact on the coast. Soft engineering
   solution or the combined solutions are taken into acts. Beach
   nourishment is mostly considered as the better soft solution, especially
   to those tourists attracting sandy beaches along the Shandong coast.
   Long term monitoring and continuous lessons learning from the coastal
   erosion management will be adaptive for better coast solution in the
   future. (C) 2018 China Geology Editorial Office.},

Title = {Economic Analysis of Impacts of Sea Level Rise and Adaptation Strategies
   in Transportation},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2012},
Number = {2273},
Pages = {54-61},
Abstract = {Although the causes of the sea level rise (SLR) are hotly debated,
   almost no disagreement exists that sea levels will continue to rise. The
   SLR is likely to have significant impacts on coastal transportation
   infrastructure. Adaptations in response to the SLR are in urgent need.
   Facing various adaptation strategies, decision makers need information
   on the impacts of different SLR scenarios as well as the economic
   trade-offs of various adaptation strategies. This research attempts to
   quantify the economic impacts of the SLR as well as the costs and
   benefits of adaptation strategies by using cost-benefit analysis at the
   local level. Hillsborough County, Florida, is used as a case study, and
   two projected scenarios for the SLR are applied to it. Light detection
   and ranging data, parcel land use data, and transportation network data
   for the county are employed to estimate the impacts of the two
   scenarios. Three adaptation strategies are suggested to the proposed SLR
   scenarios. Then cost-benefit analysis is conducted for each strategy
   under the two scenarios that consider the impacts of both direct
   inundation costs and indirect travel time costs. On the basis of the
   present values of the net benefits in the proposed strategies, managed
   retreat with critical infrastructure protection is the best adaptation
   strategy for the SLR in the long run and the length of shoreline
   protection is the most sensitive to the net benefits.},

Abstract = {The potential habitability of an exoplanet is traditionally assessed by
   determining whether its orbit falls within the circumstellar habitable
   zone of its star, defined as the distance at which water could be liquid
   on the surface of a planet (Kopparapu et al.,2013). Traditionally, these
   limits are determined by radiative-convective climate models, which are
   used to predict surface temperatures at user-specified levels of
   greenhouse gases. This approach ignores the vital question of the
   (bio)geochemical plausibility of the proposed chemical abundances.
   Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas in Earth's
   atmosphere in terms of regulating planetary temperature, with the
   long-term concentration controlled by the balance between volcanic
   outgassing and the sequestration of CO2 via chemical weathering and
   sedimentation, as modulated by ocean chemistry, circulation, and
   biological (microbial) productivity. We developed a model that
   incorporates key aspects of Earth's short- and long-term biogeochemical
   carbon cycle to explore the potential changes in the CO2 greenhouse due
   to variance in planet size and stellar insolation. We find that proposed
   changes in global topography, tectonics, and the hydrological cycle on
   larger planets result in proportionally greater surface temperatures for
   a given incident flux. For planets between 0.5 and 2R(circle plus), the
   effect of these changes results in average global surface temperature
   deviations of up to 20K, which suggests that these relationships must be
   considered in future studies of planetary habitability.},

Title = {Utilization of renewable energy sources in desalination of geothermal
   water for agriculture},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {513},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The agricultural sector, which is highly dependent on water, is urged to
   build on improved water management practices and explore available
   options to match supply and demand because of the water scarcity risks
   and a sustainable and productive agri-food chain. Geothermal water is an
   energy source used to generate electricity and/or heat. After harnessing
   its energy, the remaining water can be used as a water source for
   irrigation following treatment because of its high ionic content.
   Geothermal fields are mostly located in rural areas where agricultural
   activities exist. This would be a good match to decrease the
   transportation cost of irrigation water. The energy demand of the
   desalination process for agriculture is higher, requiring additional
   post-treatment processes. Fossil fuels to fulfill the energy
   requirements are becoming expensive, and greenhouse gas emissions are
   harmful to the environment. Thus, efforts should be directed towards
   integrating renewable energy resources into desalination process. This
   work focuses on presenting a comprehensive review of geothermal water
   desalination which is powered by renewable energy and provides specific
   cases from Turkey and Poland. Furthermore, possible new generation
   renewable energy systems in desalination are introduced, considering
   their potential application in the desalination of geothermal water for
   agricultural irrigation.},

Abstract = {Comprehensive and accurate city-level carbon dioxide emissions inventory
   is key to success in China's pursuit of low-carbon development. Based on
   a high-resolution gridded data, this paper evaluates and benchmarks the
   carbon emissions efficiency of 280 Chinese cities using three different
   methods, i.e., composite index, data envelopment analysis and stochastic
   frontier analysis. The comparative analysis reveals that the average
   carbon emissions efficiency of Chinese cities is about 70-90\%, with
   only 9 efficient cities (3\%). Although the ranking of intermediate
   cities varies greatly according to the method employed, the most and
   least carbon-efficient cities remain consistent. While the
   best-performing cities are found in the coastal regions, the
   worst-performing cities are located in the central and western regions,
   which suggests an imbalanced low-carbon development in China. Guided by
   the results, local governments are encouraged to compete and learn from
   similar ranking benchmarks in a new regime of ``Top Runner City{''}.
   Finally, the scores of carbon emissions efficiency can provide a
   scientific basis for the bottom-up allocation of carbon emissions rights
   to boost the development of the nationwide carbon market in China.},

Title = {Analyzing the Prospect of Hybrid Energy in the Cement Industry of
   Pakistan, Using HOMER Pro},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Cement manufacturing is one of the most energy-intensive industries in
   the world. Most of the cost of producing cement is accounted for in
   terms of fuel consumption and power expenditure. Thermal power plants
   are a significant contributor to electricity generation in countries
   such as Pakistan. They are, however, inherently inefficient, and
   environmentally unfriendly. In this paper, the authors investigated the
   possibility of delivering hybrid energy to Pakistani cement plants. Five
   cement plants-Askari Cement Plant, Wah (ACPW); Bestway Cement Plant,
   Kalar Kahar (BCPKK); Bestway Cement Plant, Farooqia (BCPF); Bestway
   Cement Plant, Hattar (BCPH); and DG Cement Plant, Chakwal (DGCPC)-were
   selected. The possibility of implementing the four off-grid hybrid
   energy models (HEMs) was investigated for the intended cement plants,
   using HOMER Pro software. A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was
   carried out, based on objectives including the net present cost (NPC),
   the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. HEM-1 was comprised of PV, converter, and a fuel cell. HEM-2
   had only a diesel generator, and acted as a base case in this study.
   HEM-3 had solar panels and a battery-converter system. In HEM-4, diesel
   generators, PV, and converters were considered. Based on the NPC, the
   optimal model was HEM-4, having a 0.249 USD/KWh LCOE in islanded
   systems. The NPC and operating costs were USD 540 M and USD 32.5 M per
   year, respectively, with a 29.80\% reduction in the CO2 emissions
   compared to the base case. Based on the GHG emission, HEM-1 and HEM-3
   were the best models, with 0\% GHG emissions. The results confirmed that
   the proposed HEMs can sustainably provide electricity for 24 h a day to
   the sites under consideration, with minimum objectives.},

Title = {Alien plant introductions and greenhouse gas emissions: Insights from
   Gunnera tinctoria invasions},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {775},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Plant invasions represent a major global change in land/vegetation
   coverwith the potential to significantly modify greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. To get a better understanding of the impacts of terrestrial
   invasive plants on soil GHG emissions we report, firstly, on experiments
   conducted on invasive populations of the N-fixing herbaceous species
   Gunnera tinctoria in Ireland, and secondly, compare our results with
   published information based on a systematic reviewof the literature. For
   G. tinctoria populations, therewas a >50\% reduction in soil CO2
   emissions, mainly due to a reduction in autotrophic respiration, but
   with little impact on annual N2O or CH4 budgets. One year after the
   removal of G. tinctoria, soil GHG emissions returned to values
   comparable to uninvaded areas and thiswas associatedwith the
   reestablishment of the vegetation and an increased root biomass per unit
   area. If G. tinctoria covered 10\% of abandoned agricultural land in
   Ireland, this could be associatedwith a reduction of approximately 8\%
   (or 4.988 Mt CO(2)eq y(-1)) of the country's national CO2 emissions.
   Comparisons of these results with literature values were difficult
   because of the often low and limited sampling effort of previous
   investigations, a failure to assess all three major GHGs and because of
   marked seasonal variations. We found 46 studies that documented results
   for 16 species. From the studies that measured soil respiration, it was
   enhanced in only 45\% of cases, questioning the assumption that invasive
   plants always increase soil CO2 emissions. In 25 cases that analysed
   methane, CH4 emissions increased in 76\% of them, but all of these were
   conducted in wetlands. In only two cases were N-fixing species
   associated with enhanced N2O emissions. Our results argue for more
   detailed and comprehensive assessments of the effect of plant invasions
   on GHG emissions and their global impact. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Drivers of vulnerability to climate change and adaptive responses of
   forest-edge farming households in major agro-ecological zones of Nigeria},
Journal = {GEOJOURNAL},
Abstract = {An understanding of forest communities' risk factors for climate
   variation, adaptation trajectories, and how agroecological differences
   shape their responses are critical to future policy formulation in
   Nigeria. Therefore, drivers of vulnerability to climate change and
   adaptation options of forest communities' farming households in major
   agro-ecological zones of Nigeria were investigated. Data were collected,
   using an interview schedule, from 183 forest-edge households in savanna,
   mangrove, and rainforest agro-ecologies. Descriptive statistics and
   analysis of variance were used to analyse the data. Respondents
   cultivated 6.4 +/- 2.6 acres of farmland. Changes in rainfall patterns
   were most experienced in the rainforest and savanna whereas, it was
   temperature fluctuation in the mangrove. Crop farming was the worst hit
   by climate change among other livelihoods. Crop rotation in the savanna
   and mangrove ((x) over bar =2.12; 2.44, respectively) and mixed farming
   in the rainforest ( (x) over bar = 2.52) were top adaptation priorities
   while crop insurance was the least. Low paying livelihood alternatives (
   (x) over bar = 1.54), illiteracy ( (x) over bar = 1.73), and lack of
   infrastructure ( (x) over bar = 1.38) were major social vulnerability
   drivers of climate change in the savanna, mangrove, and rainforest,
   respectively. Major political and economic drivers were inconsistent
   government policy and poverty, respectively. The use of adaptation
   measures was not significantly different in the agro-ecologies, whereas,
   the livelihood impact of climate change was (F = 9.990; p < 0.05).
   Social and environmental drivers of vulnerability to climate change
   differ in the forest communities, and adaptation priorities varied
   according to zones.},

Abstract = {The integration of wave energy devices and coastal structures may be an
   innovative and sustainable way to achieve energy production purposes
   with a secondary benefit of coastal protection, which can increase
   accessibility and reduce the costs of wave energy technology. In this
   paper, a 3-D theoretical model was developed to investigate the
   hydrodynamic efficiency and breakwater function of a periodic array of
   oscillating buoys embedded in a caisson breakwater. The generalized
   radiation problem was solved to derive generalized radiation force. The
   theoretical model was validated using Haskind's relation and energy flux
   conservation law. The influences of wave/geometrical parameters and PTO
   damping were revealed. In particular, hydrodynamic phenomenon of
   multiple orders reflected and transmitted propagating waves and their
   influence on wave power extraction and coastal protection was examined.
   Results show that a satisfactory hydrodynamic efficiency and coastal
   defense are realized simultaneously under oblique waves for this
   proposed system. A decline of hydrodynamic efficiency is found beyond a
   critical wavenumber, accompanied by the occurrence of the strong
   reflection phenomenon. The findings of this paper contribute towards the
   preliminary design of the hybrid breakwater-WEC system for the synergy
   effect between the wave energy devices and breakwaters. (c) 2022

Abstract = {The population of the maritime region of Quebec is vulnerable to coastal
   erosion that will be affected by climate change (CC). Sea level rise,
   extreme events such as storms and intense rainfall, ice climate, thaw
   and frost cycles can increase erosion and affect coastal
   infrastructures. In 2005, a three-year research project was initiated to
   facilitate the adaptation process of coastal communities. The project
   team addressed the issue though a multidisciplinary approach and a
   participative method that promotes transfer of scientific information
   and research of consensus. This participative process was designed to
   facilitate the transfer of socio economic, environmental, technical and
   scientific information to the policy makers. Project benefits include
   the following: inserting science of climate and coastal dynamics in the
   decision process at regional and national levels, improving
   communications between stake holders and accelerating the implementation

Abstract = {Rise in temperature and annual precipitation, changes in seasonal
   rainfall patterns, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, and
   increased salinity in river water have been observed in Bangladesh in
   the recent years. Rising temperature will elevate total power
   consumption and peak power demand especially during the pre-monsoon hot
   summer season, reduce power plant efficiency and transformer lifetime,
   and increase the transmission loss. More frequent and severe extreme
   weather events may cause more disruption in power generation and
   distribution, and more damage of power infrastructure. Lower river flow
   in dry season may cause water scarcity in power plants and hamper the
   production. Increased salinity in river water due to sea level rise may
   lead to corrosion and leakages in power plants located in the coastal
   region of Bangladesh. A diversified, decentralized, and climate
   resilient power system can reduce negative impacts of climate change on
   power sector of Bangladesh. Adaptation and mitigation strategies must be
   incorporated in the planning and development of new power systems and
   the reformation of existing power systems of Bangladesh.},

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {185-201},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Few conservation projects consider climate impacts or have a process for
   developing adaptation strategies. To advance climate adaptation for
   biodiversity conservation, we tested a step-by-step approach to
   developing adaptation strategies with 20 projects from diverse
   geographies. Project teams assessed likely climate impacts using
   historical climate data, future climate predictions, expert input, and
   scientific literature. They then developed adaptation strategies that
   considered ecosystems and species of concern, project goals, climate
   impacts, and indicators of progress. Project teams identified 176 likely
   climate impacts and developed adaptation strategies to address 42 of
   these impacts. The most common impacts were to habitat quantity or
   quality, and to hydrologic regimes. Nearly half of expected impacts were
   temperature-mediated. Twelve projects indicated that the project focus,
   either focal ecosystems and species or project boundaries, need to
   change as a result of considering climate impacts. More than half of the
   adaptation strategies were resistance strategies aimed at preserving the
   status quo. The rest aimed to make ecosystems and species more resilient
   in the face of expected changes. All projects altered strategies in some
   way, either by adding new actions, or by adjusting existing actions.
   Habitat restoration and enactment of policies and regulations were the
   most frequently prescribed, though every adaptation strategy required a
   unique combination of actions. While the effectiveness of these
   adaptation strategies remains to be evaluated, the application of
   consistent guidance has yielded important early lessons about how, when,
   and how often conservation projects may need to be modified to adapt to
   climate change.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {9-13},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Economic intensification continues to increase along many of the world's
   coastlines. This intensification, which includes asset and
   infrastructure intensification, along with the increasing likelihood of
   inundation associated with sea level rise, implies an increasing risk
   profile for many coastal communities. In response, many cities and
   owners of major civil infrastructure have commissioned climate risk and
   adaptation studies in order to develop adaptation strategies. In many
   cases the same methods, terminology and approaches have been applied in
   studies of adaptation options for entire communities as for individual
   structures and assets. It is argued here that as a result of the
   different scales and complexity between whole communities and individual
   assets or structures, it is desirable that tailored approaches to
   identifying adaptation options need to be applied. In particular, it is
   recommended that categorising settlement and infrastructure studies into
   either community-scale, or infrastructure-scale problems will help to
   ensure that the most appropriate methodological approaches are be used.

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming, and
   active development of renewable energy has become popular in resource
   utilization. Wind power, as the second largest renewable energy source,
   plays an important role in the power industry, and clarifying the carbon
   footprint and carbon emission intensity of wind farms is the basis for
   their rational use. Although the study of the carbon footprint of wind
   farms has attracted considerable attention, the characteristics of the
   carbon footprint and carbon emission intensity of wind farms in
   grassland areas compared with other types of wind farms have not been
   determined to date. As an important part of the world's largest Eurasian
   grassland, the installed capacity of wind farms in the grasslands of
   Inner Mongolia ranks first in China. In this study, the carbon footprint
   of the production, transportation, construction, operation, and disposal
   stages was evaluated by using the life cycle assessment method in a 49.5
   MW wind farm in the Inner Mongolia grassland, and its carbon emission
   intensity was explored in depth. The results showed the following: (1)
   The carbon footprint of the wind farm in the grassland area was 18701.29
   t, of which the construction stage accounted for the largest proportion
   at 56.74\%, and the other stages, ranging from highest to lowest, were
   production, disposal, transportation, and operation stages, which were
   28.18\%, 12.08\%, 2.76\%, and 0.24\%, respectively. (2) The carbon
   footprint of material recycling was 18726.53 t, and the reduced carbon
   emissions accounted for 50.03\% of the total carbon emissions. (3) The
   carbon emission intensity of the wind farm was 6.57 g/kWh, which is
   approximately 148.45 times, 72.91 times, 127.85 times, and 3.50 times
   less than the carbon emission intensity of the four non-renewable energy
   sources of coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear power, respectively. (4)
   Wind power have lower carbon emission intensities than the four
   renewable energy sources of hydropower, biomass, and photovoltaics. This
   study highlights the very important role played by system boundaries
   when employing life cycles to evaluate carbon footprints. Compared with
   offshore wind farms and non-grassland wind farms, grassland wind farms
   have the lowest carbon emission intensity. The promotion of wind farms
   has excellent potential in grassland areas.},

Title = {Assessment of coastal risk reduction and adaptation-labelled responses
   in Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean)},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {This study assesses changes in coastal risk reduction and
   adaptation-labelled responses in Mauritius Island since the 1960s. Using
   research documents, interviews, field observations, image analysis, and
   case studies, it analyses evolutions in public and private stakeholders'
   strategies, and the levers and barriers at play. Based on 60 beach
   sites, it reveals the prevalence (76.7\%) of hard protection compared
   with no response (8.3\%), ecosystem-based responses (3.3\%), and
   combined responses (11.7\%) and a nation-wide shift from hard and
   one-size-fits-all responses to soft and place-specific responses. This
   shift was driven by the failure of initial hard protection measures,
   which has pushed the Government of Mauritius to improve beach management
   practices, promote retreat where hard protection had failed, resort to
   external expertise and funding to design a well-informed risk reduction
   and adaptation policy, and implement demonstration projects. The
   ``learning-by-doing{''} process and increased external support have thus
   allowed progress in risk reduction and adaptation at publicly managed
   beach sites. In contrast, privately managed (i.e. by residents and hotel
   companies) beach sites often exhibit increased risks, as a result of the
   proliferation of uncoordinated technical interventions, related
   cascading (beach loss, spread of coastal erosion downdrift), and lock-in
   effects. This study provides guidance for the ground-rooted and
   systematic analysis of coastal risk reduction and adaptation responses
   and their drivers at the local and national scale. It could serve as a
   first basis for framing nation-wide assessments aimed at taking stock of
   recent progress in coastal risk reduction and adaptation worldwide and
   help overcome barriers to adaptation.},

Title = {Changing sources and processes sustaining surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes
   along a tropical river to reservoir system},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1333-1350},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Freshwaters are important emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane
   (CH4), two potent greenhouse gases (GHGs). While aquatic surface GHG
   fluxes have been extensively measured, there is much less information
   about their underlying sources. In lakes and reservoirs, surface GHG can
   originate from horizontal riverine flow, the hypolimnion, littoral
   sediments, and water column metabolism. These sources are generally
   studied separately, leading to a fragmented assessment of their relative
   role in sustaining CO2 and CH4 surface fluxes. In this study, we
   quantified sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 in the epilimnion along a
   hydrological continuum in a permanently stratified tropical reservoir
   (Borneo). Results showed that horizontal inputs are an important source
   of both CO2 and CH4 (> 90 \% of surface emissions) in the upstream
   reservoir branches. However, this contribution fades along the
   hydrological continuum, becoming negligible in the main basin of the
   reservoir, where CO2 and CH4 are uncoupled and driven by different
   processes. In the main basin, vertical CO2 inputs and sediment CH4
   inputs contributed to on average 60 \% and 23 \% respectively to the
   surface fluxes of the corresponding gas. Water column metabolism
   exhibited wide amplitude and range for both gases, making it a highly
   variable component, but with a large potential to influence surface GHG
   budgets in either direction. Overall our results show that sources
   sustaining surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes vary spatially and between the two
   gases, with internal metabolism acting as a fluctuating but key
   modulator. However, this study also highlights challenges and knowledge
   gaps related to estimating ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 metabolism, which
   hinder aquatic GHG flux predictions.},

Title = {Comparison of Effective Radiative Forcing Calculations Using Multiple
   Methods, Drivers, and Models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},
Number = {8},
Pages = {4382-4394},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {We compare six methods of estimating effective radiative forcing (ERF)
   using a set of atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. This is the
   first multiforcing agent, multimodel evaluation of ERF values calculated
   using different methods. We demonstrate that previously reported
   apparent consistency between the ERF values derived from fixed sea
   surface temperature simulations and linear regression holds for most
   climate forcings, excluding black carbon (BC). When land adjustment is
   accounted for, however, the fixed sea surface temperature ERF values are
   generally 10-30\% larger than ERFs derived using linear regression
   across all forcing agents, with a much larger (similar to 70-100\%)
   discrepancy for BC. Except for BC, this difference can be largely
   reduced by either using radiative kernel techniques or by exponential
   regression. Responses of clouds and their effects on shortwave radiation
   show the strongest variability in all experiments, limiting the
   application of regression-based ERF in small forcing simulations.
   Plain Language Summary Climate drivers such as greenhouse gases and
   aerosols influence the Earth's climate by perturbing the Earth's energy
   budget at the top of the atmosphere, which is referred to as effective
   radiative forcing (ERF) when the atmospheric response is included in the
   calculation. ERF plays a crucial role in understanding the climate
   response to these drivers and predicting long-term climate change.
   Previously, ERFs have been estimated for greenhouse gases using two
   techniques that generally lead to similar values. Here we show that such
   consistency holds for most climate drivers. ERF values estimated from
   different methods may differ by 10-50\%, and this difference may reach
   70-100\% for black carbon. Regression techniques do not work well in
   some models when imposed forcings are relatively small.},

Title = {The disaster resilience assessment of coastal areas: A method for
   improving the stakeholders' participation},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {214},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Increasing frequency, intensity and severity of natural hazards
   associated to climate change are among the pressing challenges the world
   is facing requiring greater resilience for communities. This challenge
   calls for new policies and actions at regional and local level having
   the concept of resilience as their main driver and core component.
   However in order to prioriotirise and invest in the resilience building,
   the actors involved in the governance of a territory and in the
   implementation of Disaster Risk Reduction measures must first recognize
   the multifacted nature of resilience and the importance of its
   measurement. Priorities, resilience meaning and metrics are subject to
   different interpretations, making resilience a societal complex issue.
   To this end the paper aims to provide a new method for the incorporation
   of multilevel stakeholders' view in the assessment of the inherent
   resilience of a place and in the design of a metric based Resilience
   Index (RI). The new approach integrates the Disaster Resilience of Place
   (DROP) model and the use of semi-structured interviews with a standpoint
   in the Grounded Theory Methodology to facilitate both the assessment of
   resilience in a quantitative manner and an in-depth analysis of the
   context. The method has been applied in the framework of coastal
   exposure to flood, by involving 18 municipalites of the Po River Delta
   (Italy). The interactions of the, physical and anthropogenic processes
   in the Po River Delta requires a better understanding in terms of
   resilince to support sustainable management and spatial planning actions
   in the context of climate change. The analysis spreads across different
   administrative boundaries and complex and dynamic natural systems that
   have recreational, residential and economic functions. The results
   demonstrate the potentiality of the method to guide different local
   actors in their disaster resilience strategy and in the identification
   of priorities.},

Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) manifests as the temperature rise in built-up
   urban areas relative to the surrounding rural countryside, largely
   because of the relatively greater proportion of incident solar energy
   that is absorbed and stored by man-made materials. The direct impact of
   UHI can be significant on both daytime and night-time temperatures, and
   the indirect impacts include increased air conditioning loads,
   deteriorated air and water quality, reduced pavement lifetimes, and
   exacerbated heat waves. Modifying the thermal properties and emissivity
   of roofs and paved surfaces and increasing the vegetated area within the
   city are potential mitigation strategies. A quantitative comparison of
   their efficacies and costs suggests that so-called cool roofs are likely
   the most cost-effective UHI mitigation strategy. However, additional
   research is needed on how to modify surface emissivities and dynamically
   control surface and material properties, as well as on the health and
   socioeconomic impacts of UHI.},

Journal = {ENERGY TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Hydrate-based CO2 storage is considered a potentially effective way of
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions and slowing down global warming.
   Herein, the locations in the ocean and permafrost that meet the
   requirements for hydrate-based CO2 storage are summarized. Furthermore,
   research progress and shortcomings of hydrate-based CO2 storage are
   analyzed. The two main methods for hydrate-based CO2 storage are direct
   CO2 hydrate storage and CO2-CH4 hydrate replacement. Direct CO2 hydrate
   storage on the seabed and in the subsea (or permafrost) is proposed, and
   CO2 formation experiments on different scales are conducted. Various
   porous media are used to simulate the natural sediment and investigate
   the hydrate formation equilibrium and kinetics. CO2-CH4 replacement is
   preferred because it combines the benefits of CO2 storage and CH4
   production. The hydrate equilibrium of different CO2-CH4 mixture
   hydrates is measured using different methods. Nuclear magnetic resonance
   and Raman spectroscopy are commonly used to study the hydrate structure
   characteristics and mass transfer properties. Macrokinetics are usually
   conducted in a high-pressure vessel to analyze the effects of the
   experimental conditions on the replacement results. Nevertheless, the
   replacement rate and hydrate properties should be investigated further.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH},

Volume = {11},

Pages = {825-844},
Abstract = {We used OCO-2 products and considered three factors that potentially
   affect CO2 concentration in Indonesia: sea surface temperature (SST),
   forest fires and vegetation. From 2014 to 2016, CO2 concentration in
   Indonesia showed a trend of increase, which is consistent with the
   global increase reported by the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite
   (GOSAT) Project. As an archipelago country, the results indicate that
   SST has a direct effect on the CO2 concentration in Indonesia. Their
   changing exhibits similar fluctuations; meanwhile, CO2 concentration and
   SST also presented positive correlation. In 2015, the number of fire
   hotspots suddenly increased to 140,699, because of occurrence of the
   worst forest fire. Due to special geographic conditions, forest fires
   did not induce CO2 concentration changes in Indonesia, but CO2
   concentration in the corresponding islands showed a trend of increase.
   CO2 concentration increased in Kalimantan during the occurrence of
   forest fire in September-October 2014, and CO2 concentration increased
   in Kalimantan and Sumatra during the occurrence of forest fire in
   September-October 2015. Vegetation indices were stable and presented no
   correlation with CO2 concentration. This study demonstrated that OCO-2
   is capable of monitoring CO2 concentration at a regional scale;
   additionally, an effective method for using OCO-2 Level 2 products is
   proposed.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise will cause spatial shifts in economic activity over the

   of greenhouse gas emissions, permanent flooding is projected to reduce
   global real GDP by 0.19 percent in present value terms. By the year
   2200, a projected 1.46 percent of the population will be displaced.
   Losses in coastal localities are much larger. When ignoring the dynamic
   response of investment and migration, the loss in real GDP in 2200
   increases from 0.11 percent to 4.5 percent.},

Title = {Prevention of Potential Hazards Associated with Marine Gas Hydrate
   Exploitation: A Review},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Marine gas hydrates (MGHs), which have great potential for exploitation
   and utilization, account for around 99\% of all global natural gas
   hydrate resources under current prospecting technique. However, there
   are several potential hazards associated with their production and
   development. These are classified into four categories by this paper:
   marine geohazards, greenhouse gas emissions, marine ecological hazards,
   and marine engineering hazards. In order to prevent these risks from
   occurring, the concept of lifecycle management of hazards prevention
   during the development and production from MGHs is proposed and divided
   into three stages: preparation, production control, and post-production
   protection. Of these stages, economic evaluation of the resource is the
   foundation; gas production methods are the key; with monitoring,
   assessment, and early warning as the guarantee. A production test in the
   Shenhu area of the South China Sea shows that MGH exploration and
   development can be planned using the three-steps methodology:
   commercializing and developing research ideas in the short term,
   maintaining economic levels of production in the medium term, and
   forming a global forum to discuss effective MGH development in the long
   term. When increasing MGH development is combined with the lifecycle
   management of hazards prevention system, and technological innovations
   are combined with global cooperation to solve the risks associated with
   MGH development, then safe access to a new source of clean energy may be
   obtained.},

Abstract = {The long term impact posed by climate change risk remains unclear and is
   subject to diverse interpretations from different maritime stakeholders.
   The inter-dynamics between climate change and ports can also
   significantly diversify in different geographical regions. Consequently,
   risk and cost data used to support climate adaptation is of high
   uncertainty and in many occasions, real data is often unavailable and
   incomplete. This paper presents a risk and cost evaluation methodology
   that can be applied to the analysis of port climate change adaptation
   measures in situations where data uncertainty is high. Risk and cost
   criteria are used in a decision-making model for the selection of
   climate adaptation measures. Information produced using a fuzzy-Bayesian
   risk analysis approach is utilized to evaluate risk reduction outcomes
   from the use of adaptation measures in ports. An evidential reasoning
   approach is then employed to synthesize the risk reduction data as
   inputs to the decision-making model. The results can assist policymakers
   in developing efficient adaptation measures that take into account the
   reduction in the likelihood of risks, their possible consequences, their
   timeframe, and costs incurred.
   A technical study across 14 major container ports in Greater China is
   presented to demonstrate the interaction between cost and risk analysis,
   and to highlight the applicability of the stated methodology in
   practice. The paper offers a useful analytical tool for assessing
   climate change risks to ports and selecting the most cost-effective
   adaptation measures in uncertain conditions. It can also be used to
   compare the practitioners' perceptions of climate risks across different
   geographical regions, and to evaluate improvements after implementation
   of the selected adaptation measures with potential budgetary
   constraints. The methodology, together with the illustrative cases,
   provides important insights on how to develop efficient climate change
   adaptation measures in a supply chain context to improve the
   sustainability of development and enhance adaptation measures for ports,
   port cities, intermodal transport, supply chains, and urban and regional
   planning in general. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Avoiding the most serious climate change impacts will require informed
   policy decisions. This in turn will require information regarding the
   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions required to stabilize climate in a
   state not too much warmer than today. A new low emission scenario is
   simulated in a global climate model to show how some of the impacts from
   climate change can be averted through mitigation. Compared to a
   non-intervention reference scenario, emission reductions of about 70\%
   by 2100 are required to prevent roughly half the change in temperature
   and precipitation that would otherwise occur. By 2100, the resulting
   stabilized global climate would ensure preservation of considerable
   Arctic sea ice and permafrost areas. Future heat waves would be 55\%
   less intense, and sea level rise from thermal expansion would be about
   57\% lower than if a non-mitigation scenario was followed. Citation:

Title = {Carbon sequestration in soil and biomass under native and non-native

Volume = {479},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {61-76},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aims Mangrove ecosystems can help mitigate climate change by
   sequestering significant amounts of carbon (C) from the atmosphere and
   ocean, contributing to regional ``blue carbon{''} stocks. However, it is
   unclear whether non-native species introduced in coastal wetlands can
   function as a more efficient carbon sink. Methods By examining two
   dominant mangrove species, native Kandelia obovata (KO) and exotic
   Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. (SA), at the Qi'ao Island, China, we
   quantified and compared ecosystem C storage, C sequestration rate,
   source and stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) under different
   vegetation covers. Results \& conclusion Our results showed that both
   species acted as strong carbon sinks relative to mudflat reference, with
   overall ecosystem C storage being comparable under KO (410 Mg C ha(-1))
   and SA with different stand ages (224-452 Mg C ha(-1)), but a few times
   higher than corresponding unvegetated mudflat. However, by excluding SOC
   accumulation from prior land use (i.e., unvegetated mudflat), non-native
   species (i.e., SA) showed a significantly higher ecosystem carbon
   sequestration rate (8.2-16.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than native KO (4.5 Mg
   C ha(-1) yr(-1)), owing largely to fast biomass carbon sequestration in
   SA ecosystem. Relative to mudflat reference, the input of autochthonous
   source (mangrove tissues) contributed substantially to additional carbon
   sequestration under mangroves. It should be noted that the relative size
   of carbon sequestration in non-native mangroves is also affected by
   factors related to ecosystem, climate, soil properties and land use, the
   differences still exist among locations, and ecosystem modeling with
   field validation is desirable for regional estimation of carbon stocks
   and sequestration rates.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of plasma-assisted ethylene production from
   rich-in-methane gas streams},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY \& FUELS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1351-1362},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Herein, the sustainability of plasma-assisted processes for ethylene
   production from rich-in-methane gas streams namely, natural and shale
   gas, is investigated by performing life cycle assessment (LCA). Two
   plasma-assisted process alternatives, a direct gas conversion to
   ethylene (one-step) and a stepwise gas conversion to acetylene followed
   by acetylene-to-ethylene hydrogenation (two-step), both previously
   demonstrated in the lab and modeled on a large scale, are evaluated
   using the SimaPro (R) software and ecoinvent database. Different
   scenarios regarding purge stream utilization and electricity sources are
   considered for both process alternatives. On the basis of LCA results,
   it is highly probable (confidence interval 93.5\%) that the two-step
   process results in a lower carbon footprint than the one-step process.
   The two-step process, powered by electricity generated by wind turbines
   and utilizing the purge stream as the byproduct (instead of flaring it),
   produces the lowest carbon footprint among all studied scenarios. When
   natural gas is utilized as the feedstock, the two-step plasma-assisted
   ethylene production process is more environmentally sustainable than
   other peer processes (i.e. thermally driven and bio-based). When shale
   gas is used, greenhouse gas emissions decrease compared to natural gas,
   resulting in a comparable carbon footprint to the conventional (naphtha
   cracking) process. Further, aside from ethylene production onshore,
   plasma reactors can also be employed for ethylene production offshore,
   thereby valorizing currently wasted rich-in-methane gas streams and thus
   reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.},

Abstract = {Globally, shrimp farming has had devastating effects on mangrove
   forests. However, mangroves are the most carbon-rich forests, with blue
   carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions
   seriously augmented due to devastating effects on mangrove forests.
   Nevertheless, integrated mangrove-shrimp cultivation has emerged as a
   part of the potential solution to blue carbon emissions. Integrated
   mangrove-shrimp farming is also known as organic aquaculture if
   deforested mangrove area does not exceed 50\% of the total farm area.
   Mangrove destruction is not permitted in organic aquaculture and the
   former mangrove area in parts of the shrimp farm shall be reforested to
   at least 50\% during a period of maximum 5 years according to Naturland
   organic aquaculture standards. This article reviews integrated
   mangrove-shrimp cultivation that can help to sequester blue carbon
   through mangrove restoration, which can be an option for climate change
   mitigation. However, the adoption of integrated mangrove-shrimp
   cultivation could face several challenges that need to be addressed in
   order to realize substantial benefits from blue carbon sequestration.},

Title = {Novel microbial community composition and carbon biogeochemistry emerge
   over time following saltwater intrusion in wetlands},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {549-561},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sea level rise and changes in precipitation can cause saltwater
   intrusion into historically freshwater wetlands, leading to shifts in
   microbial metabolism that alter greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon
   sequestration. Saltwater intrusion modifies soil physicochemistry and
   can immediately affect microbial metabolism, but further alterations to
   biogeochemical processing can occur over time as microbial communities
   adapt to the changed environmental conditions. To assess temporal
   changes in microbial community composition and biogeochemical activity
   due to saltwater intrusion, soil cores were transplanted from a tidal
   freshwater marsh to a downstream mesohaline marsh and periodically
   sampled over 1 year. This experimental saltwater intrusion produced
   immediate changes in carbon mineralization rates, whereas shifts in the
   community composition developed more gradually. Salinity affected the
   composition of the prokaryotic community but did not exert a strong
   influence on the community composition of fungi. After only 1 week of
   saltwater exposure, carbon dioxide production doubled and methane
   production decreased by three orders of magnitude. By 1 month, carbon
   dioxide production in the transplant was comparable to the saltwater
   controls. Over time, we observed a partial recovery in methane
   production which strongly correlated with an increase in the relative
   abundance of three orders of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Taken
   together, our results suggest that ecosystem responses to saltwater
   intrusion are dynamic over time as complex interactions develop between
   microbial communities and the soil organic carbon pool. The gradual
   changes in microbial community structure we observed suggest that
   previously freshwater wetlands may not experience an equilibration of
   ecosystem function until long after initial saltwater intrusion. Our
   results suggest that during this transitional period, likely lasting
   years to decades, these ecosystems may exhibit enhanced greenhouse gas
   production through greater soil respiration and continued
   methanogenesis.},

Title = {A first-phase screening method for site selection of large-scale solar
   plants with an application to Italy},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Increasing the exploitation of renewable energy sources (RES) is a key
   element for reducing the detrimental consequences of greenhouse-gases
   emissions and for satisfying the growing demand for energy. Solar power
   plays a central role having the potential to completely satisfy the
   world energetic needs. Locating optimal sites for installing solar
   plants is therefore an important task deeply affecting the long term
   profitability of such plants. The present paper proposes a filtering
   method to select a subset of efficient locations in order to reduce the
   dimensionality of the original problem when a large territory is
   screened for locating optimal sites for largescale solar plants. It is
   based on the idea of preference relations and Pareto dominance and,
   avoiding to operate an inter-comparison of different locations'
   attributes, it can be considered assumptions-free. Moreover, the paper
   applies such filtering method, together with an analysis of economic
   viability, to Italy, a country with relatively high potentials in terms
   of solar energy that currently lacks an optimal site selection analysis.
   Once applied, the filter reduces the original set of feasible locations
   by more than 99\%. The resulting Pareto efficient locations, evaluated
   through five selected criteria, are concentrated in the southern part of
   Italy and, particularly, in the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, where
   also the economic viable locations are mostly found.},

Abstract = {Antarctica is the most isolated continent on Earth, but it has not
   escaped the negative impacts of human activity. The unique marine
   ecosystems of Antarctica and their endemic faunas are affected on local
   and regional scales by overharvesting, pollution, and the introduction
   of alien species. Global climate change is also having deleterious
   impacts: rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification already
   threaten benthic and pelagic food webs. The Antarctic Treaty System can
   address local- to regional-scale impacts, but it does not have purview
   over the global problems that impinge on Antarctica, such as emissions
   of greenhouse gases. Failure to address human impacts simultaneously at
   all scales will lead to the degradation of Antarctic marine ecosystems
   and the homogenization of their composition, structure, and processes
   with marine ecosystems elsewhere.},

Title = {A synthesis of methane emissions from shallow vegetated coastal
   ecosystems},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2988-3005},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs; i.e., mangroves, salt marshes, and
   seagrasses) play a critical role in global carbon (C) cycling, storing
   10x more C than temperate forests. Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse
   gas, can form in the sediments of these ecosystems. Currently, CH4
   emissions are a missing component of VCE C budgets. This review
   summarizes 97 studies describing CH4 fluxes from mangrove, salt marsh,
   and seagrass ecosystems and discusses factors controlling CH4 flux in
   these systems. CH4 fluxes from these ecosystems were highly variable yet
   they all act as net methane sources (median, range; mangrove: 279.17,
   -67.33 to 72,867.83; salt marsh: 224.44, -92.60 to 94,129.68; seagrass:
   64.80, 1.25-401.50 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1)). Together CH4 emissions
   from mangrove, salt marsh, and seagrass ecosystems are about 0.33-0.39
   Tmol CH4-C/year-an addition that increases the current global marine CH4
   budget by more than 60\%. The majority (\~{}45\%) of this increase is
   driven by mangrove CH4 fluxes. While organic matter content and quality
   were commonly reported in individual studies as the most important
   environmental factors driving CH4 flux, they were not significant
   predictors of CH4 flux when data were combined across studies. Salinity
   was negatively correlated with CH4 emissions from salt marshes, but not
   seagrasses and mangroves. Thus the available data suggest that other
   environmental drivers are important for predicting CH4 emissions in
   vegetated coastal systems. Finally, we examine stressor effects on CH4
   emissions from VCEs and we hypothesize that future changes in
   temperature and other anthropogenic activites (e.g., nitrogen loading)
   will likely increase CH4 emissions from these ecosystems. Overall, this
   review highlights the current and growing importance of VCEs in the
   global marine CH4 budget.},

Title = {Accumulation of soil carbon drives denitrification potential and lab

   development},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {72-80},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {We measured sediment organic carbon and nitrogen accumulation and rates
   of denitrification enzyme activity and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, N2O)
   production from slurries of sediments of a mudflat that formed in 2002,
   a young (8-year-old) natural Spartina alterniflora salt marsh that
   developed on part of the mudfiat, and four mature (>200 years old) salt
   marshes in southeastern Georgia to examine microbial processes related
   to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling during succession from mudflat to
   mature marsh. Soil organic C and N and C: N ratio (0-30 cm) increased
   across the chronosequence from mudflat (791 +/- 35 g C/m(2), 125 +/- 17
   g N/m(2)) to young marsh (2520 +/- 131 g C/m(2), 190 +/- 10 g N/m(2)) to
   mature marshes (5827 +/- 250 g C/m(2), 372 +/- 20 g N/m(2)). After 8
   years of colonization by S. alterniflora, sediment organic carbon
   increased 3.2 times, and nitrogen increased 1.5 times relative to the
   mudflat The high rate of organic C and N accumulation based on time
   series measurements (188 g C/m(2)/yr, 7.8 g N/m(2)/yr) and feldspar
   marker layers (359 g C/m(2)/yr, 26.2 g N/m(2)/yr) was attributed to high
   accretion (3 cm/yr) in this low elevation (0.18 m NAVD88) emerging
   marsh. Carbon dioxide production increased with increasing sediment
   organic C from mudfiat to mature marshes. Un-amended denitrification
   enzyme activity, measured in slurry incubations, ranged from an average
   of 0.020 +/- 0.005 mu g g(-1) hr(-1) in the mature marshes to 0.094 +/-
   0.03 mu g g(-1), hr(-1) in the young marsh. We also measured
   denitrification potential in slurry incubations amended with C
   (glucose), N (nitrate), and C + N to assess the potential for substrate
   limitations. Denitrification potential in the mudflat did not show
   strong nutrient limitation. In the young marsh, denitrification
   potential was C-limited, and in the mature marsh, it was co-limited by C
   and N. In July samples, CO2 production showed a statistically
   significant increase with age from the mudfiat to the mature marshes.
   However, in both months, CO2 production efficiency (expressed on a per g
   C basis) was significantly higher in the mudfiat sediment slurries than
   in the young marsh and mature marsh samples. Spartina colonization of
   mudflats and the subsequent accumulation of organic matter are key to
   enriching sediment organic C and N pools that control microbial
   heterotrophy, particularly denitrification and CO2 production, which
   play important roles in marsh C and N cycling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {A holistic zero waste biorefinery approach for macroalgal biomass
   utilization: A review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {716},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {The growing concerns over the depleting fossil fuels and increase in the
   release of greenhouse gas emissions have necessitated the search for the
   potential biomass source for alternative energy generation. In this
   context, third generation biomass specifically maroalgae has gained a
   lot of research interest in the recent years for energy and products
   generation such as ethanol, butanol, alginates, agars, and carrageenans.
   There are a few reviews available in scientific domain on macroalgal
   biomass utilization for bioethanol production but none of them has
   addressed precisely from phenolic precursor compounds to the entire
   ethanol production process and its bottlenecks. Here, we explained
   critically the processes involved in bioethanol, value added products
   and chemicals production utilizing macroalgal biomass as a feedstock
   along with its zero waste feasibility approach. Apart from this, we have
   also summarized the major issues linked to the macroalgae based biofuels
   and bioproducts generation processes and their possible corrective
   measures. Biorelinery is a promising way to generate multiple products
   from a single source with short processing time. Thus, this review also
   focuses on the recent advancement in the macroalgal biomass scaling up
   and how this could help in the growth of macroalgal biorefinery industry
   in the near future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Principles for operationalizing climate change adaptation strategies to

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Effective publicly developed adaptation strategies are crucial in
   managing the impacts of Climate Change. Adaptation strategy development
   is particularly complex in estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems
   because of their diverse environmental values, extensive human
   utilisation and the complex socioecological systems they support.
   Although many generic adaptation frameworks are available they cannot
   provide specific guidance for locally relevant strategy development. In
   contrast, situation-specific tools work well for their intended purpose
   but are usually unsuitable for a different situation. The gap between
   generic frameworks and situation-specific tools is addressed in this
   study by developing a set of general principles to provide guidance for
   the efficient and robust development of adaptation strategies. The nine
   principles comprise a conceptualisation of the various factors that are
   likely to have an effect on the success or otherwise of an adaptation
   strategy and they apply in any situation. An example `adaptation
   checklist' that serves as a guide to practitioners in the field, will
   help ensure that all critical components are covered during the
   development of an adaptation strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Coastal flooding risks are becoming increasingly important because of
   the increasing vulnerability of coastal territories and the rise of
   ocean levels in relation to climate change. Studying the adaptation to
   these phenomena requires taking into account the coping strategies
   (problem-focused or emotional-focused coping) implemented by the
   inhabitants of the exposed territories. A theoretical model of
   situational and dispositional factors determining these strategies has
   been proposed and tested empirically with 583 inhabitants of the island
   of Guadeloupe, which is exposed to said coastal flooding risk. The fit
   index confirms the adequacy of the model. The results indicate that
   coastal flooding risk perception, difficulties to regulate emotions, and
   place attachment predict avoidance coping. Vigilant coping is only
   predicted by perceived action efficiency. The roles of duration of
   residence and distance from the sea have been highlighted.},

Volume = {43},
Number = {16},
Pages = {6406-6413},

Abstract = {In order to make the best choice between renewable energy technologies,
   it is important to be able to compare these technologies on the basis of
   their sustainability, which may include a variety of social,
   environmental, and economic indicators. This study examined the
   comparative sustainability of four renewable electricity technologies in
   terms of their life cycle CO2 emissions and embodied energy, from
   construction to decommissioning and including maintenance (periodic
   component replacement plus machinery use), using life cycle analysis.
   The models developed were based on case studies of power plants in New
   Zealand, comprising geothermal, large-scale hydroelectric, tidal (a
   proposed scheme), and wind-farm electricity generation. The comparative
   results showed that tidal power generation was associated with 1.8 g of
   CO2/kWh wind with 3.0 g of CO2/kWh, hydroelectric with 4.6 g of CO2/kWh,
   and geothermal with 5.6 g of CO2/kWh (not including fugitive emissions),
   and that tidal power generation was associated with 42.3 kJ/kWh, wind
   with 70.2 kJ/kWh, hydroelectric with 55.0 kJ/kWh, and geothermal with
   94.6 kJ/kWh. Other environmental indicators, as well as social and
   economic indicators, should be applied to gain a complete picture of the
   technologies studied.},

Title = {Seaweed: A potential climate change solution},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {159},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change and environmental deterioration have spurred a blue
   carbon economic model in which fuel and food may be produced from marine
   ecosystems through the processes of carbon sequestration, carbon
   storage, and carbon harvest to substitute fossil products. This review
   discusses the potential of seaweed as a blue carbon sink and a renewable
   and sustainable energy source in the biogenic carbon cycle in the
   context of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Data
   were collected from more than 100 scientific articles, reliable
   organizations, and industry resources to a concise explanation and novel
   perspective on how seaweed can contribute considerably to the newly
   emerging blue carbon economy and revolutionary tools to combat climate
   change in the long term. According to the findings, seaweed has all the
   features required to be classified as a blue carbon habitat and a
   massive carbon sink. Besides its function in climate change adaptation
   and mitigation, seaweed is also a prelude to attaining a bioeconomy by
   lowering the reliance on fossil fuel. Documented evidence supports
   various applications in sectors as diverse as human meals, livestock
   feed, biofuels, and renewable feedstocks. However, the literature also
   identifies barriers to the implementation of seaweed farming operations.
   This review provides evidence that seaweed farming and industries are
   potential alternatives for future energy, decarbonization, and food
   security, mitigating global climate change and attaining economic growth
   and sustainable livelihoods.},

Abstract = {Local adaptation to climate change is essential for vulnerable coastal
   communities faced with increasing threats to livelihood and safety. This
   paper seeks to understand the micro-level enabling conditions for
   climate change adaptation through a livelihood lens in a study of six
   coastal villages in Bacacay in the province of Albay, Philippines. Albay
   is a high-risk province due to hydrometeorological and geophysical
   hazards. The analysis of livelihood resilience utilizing the Sustainable
   Livelihoods Approach shows that a soft adaptation strategy focusing on
   enhancing human and social capital needs to be undertaken to increase
   adaptive capacity and build resilience in the study area. Moreover, the
   micro-level variations in the villages suggest that the understanding of
   local conditions is indispensable in planning and formulation of
   appropriate adaptation strategies and actions at local level.},

Title = {Simulated and reconstructed winter temperature in the eastern China

Abstract = {The reconstructed temperature anomalies in the eastern China were
   compared with the output from a 1000-year model simulation in an attempt
   to evaluate the model's regional simulation skills and to understand the
   causes of climate change in China over the last millennium. The
   reconstructed data are the winter half-year temperature anomalies in the
   central region of eastern China (25 degrees-40 degrees N, east of 105
   degrees E) for the last 1000 years with a 30-year resolution. The model
   used is the global atmosphere-ocean coupled climate model, ECHO-G, which
   was driven by time-varying external forcings including solar radiation,
   volcanic eruptions, and greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2 and CH4) for
   the same period. The correlation coefficient between the simulated and
   reconstructed time series is 0.37, which is statistically significant at
   a confidence level of 97.5\%. The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) during
   1000-1300 A.D., the Little Ice Age (LIA) during 1300-1850 A.D. and the
   modern warming period after 1900 A.D. are all recognizable from both the
   simulated and reconstructed temperatures. The anomalies associated with
   the MA and the modern warming simulated by the model are in good
   consistency with the reconstructed counterpart. In particular during the
   Maunder sun-spot minimum (1670-171.0 A.D.), both the simulated and
   reconstructed temperature anomalies reach their minima without any phase
   difference. But in the earlier MWP, significant discrepancies exist
   between the simulation and the reconstruction, which might reflect the
   degrading quality of the reconstruction data. The range of the simulated
   anomalies (1.62 K) is comparable with that of reconstructed (2.0 K).
   Diagnosis of the model results indicates that, during the last
   millennium, variations in solar radiation and volcanic activity are the
   main controlling factors on regional temperature change, while in the
   recent 100 years, the change of the concentration of greenhouse gases
   plays most important role in explaining the rapid temperature rising.},

Abstract = {Prospective evaluation of the lifecycle impacts of aviation biofuel
   production in Abu Dhabi, UAE based on a production system that
   integrates aquaculture, saltwater agriculture, and mangrove
   silviculture, termed an Integrated Seawater Energy Agriculture System
   (ISEAS) in order to investigate its energetic and environmental
   potential compared to conventional fuels.
   We compare the hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) produced from
   ISEAS against fossil jet fuel using a life cycle assessment (LCA)
   methodology. Based on a detailed description of the production process,
   we use data from a wide-ranging literature review and experimental
   results from the specific location to make informed assumptions for the
   range of the process inputs and yields. We then analyze several process
   configuration scenarios with different ranges.
   ISEAS can produce aviation biofuels, electricity, and food while
   afforesting coastal desert land, acting as a long-term sink for carbon,
   minimizing freshwater consumption, and having beneficial land use
   impacts when compared to fossil jet fuel production. Based on a
   sensitivity analysis, we show that ISEAS HRJ emits 38 to 68\% less
   greenhouse gases than fossil jet fuel and yields an overall positive net
   energy balance under all scenarios except one with an extensive use of
   desalinated water.
   ISEAS offers a promising pathway for integrating aquaculture and
   seawater agriculture in arid regions. It is essentially a process to
   sustainably augment aquaculture-based products by using its waste as a
   biofuel resource. Achieving positive emissions results depend critically
   on minimizing freshwater use, maximizing biomass yield and to a lesser
   extent the performance of biomass gasification.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},

Abstract = {This study examines trends in Antarctic temperature and A(PSC), a
   temperature proxy for the area of polar stratospheric clouds, in an
   ensemble of Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) chemistry-climate
   model (CCM) simulations of the 21st century. A selection of greenhouse
   gas, ozone-depleting substance, and sea surface temperature scenarios is
   used to test the trend sensitivity to these parameters. One scenario is
   used to compare temperature trends in two versions of the GEOS CCM. An
   extended austral winter season is examined in detail. In May, June, and
   July, the expected future increase in CO2-related radiative cooling
   drives temperature trends in the Antarctic lower stratosphere. At 50
   hPa, a 1-3 K cooling is expected between 2000 and 2100. Ozone levels
   increase, despite this robust cooling signal and the consequent increase
   in A(PSC), suggesting the enhancement of stratospheric transport in
   future. In the lower stratosphere, the choice of climate change
   scenarios does not affect the magnitude of the early winter cooling.
   Midwinter temperature trends are generally small. In October, A(PSC)
   trends have the same sign as the prescribed halogen trends. That is,
   there are negative A(PSC) trends in ``realistic future{''} simulations,
   where halogen loading decreases in accordance with the Montreal Protocol
   and CO2 continues to increase. In these simulations, the speed of ozone
   recovery is not influenced by either the choice of sea surface
   temperature and greenhouse gas scenarios or by the model version.},

   aspects of transformability, adaptability, and self organizing, a
   coastal expert group (Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology)
   and an educational institution (University of the West Indies) formed a

Abstract = {Any stretch of a coastline warrants protection measure when it
   experiences an erosion rate beyond a threshold value, and when the
   seasonal littoral drift changes fail to restore equilibrium. The causes
   for coastal erosion can either be natural, man-made or a combination of
   both. The natural causes include extreme storm events, inland/basins
   interventions responsible for sediment sinks, the action of waves on the
   coasts and Sea level rise due to climate change. The man-made causes are
   often related to developmental activities such as the construction of
   ports, fishing harbours, structures for wave and tidal energy converters
   and tourism development related activities. To counter or minimize
   coastal erosion, the protection measures are broadly classified as hard
   and soft measures. A few case studies along the Indian coast based on
   both approaches are considered and their performance characteristics are
   presented, the merits and demerits of both methods are highlighted, are

Abstract = {Abatement of carbon dioxide emissions by capturing CO2 from flue gases
   and other process streams can be achieved using available technology
   although at substantial cost. Having captured the gas, it must be
   sequestered in such a way that it does not reach the atmosphere for
   several hundred years. There are many options available for storing CO2;
   assessments by the IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme and others have
   shown that many of these are relatively inexpensive, compared with the
   cost of capturing the gas in the first place. However, there are
   significant uncertainties involved in most of these schemes, indicating
   the need for further research and development in order to reduce the
   risks of their application.
   In this paper, a summary will be given of recent progress in CO2
   storage, including an overview of work on aquifer storage, ocean storage
   and the storage role of forests. External influences on decisions about
   CO2 storage will be discussed. Opportunities will be examined for
   further research to progress these technologies. Future possibilities
   for practical work on storage of CO2 will be discussed. (C) 1997

Abstract = {The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine sediments, most
   obviously at cold seeps, is a major sink for this important greenhouse
   gas and is associated with the precipitation of carbonates. The
   geological record of seep carbonates provides insights into the
   long-term dynamics of this process. Since the Late Jurassic, rates of
   seep-carbonate precipitation have been high during times of low sea
   levels and cold deep-water temperatures, and vice versa. One possibility
   is that sea-level fall decreases the thickness of the methane hydrate
   stability zone in the sediment so that gas hydrates decompose in deeper
   sediments, thereby increasing seepage and carbonate precipitation.
   Alternatively, low deep-water temperature facilitates gas hydrate
   formation on continental slopes and may thereby increase methane
   availability for AOM-performing consortia and associated carbonate
   precipitation. These correlations and their potential causes may be of
   interest for the modelling of global carbon budgets and of past and
   future climates.},

Title = {Caribbean Small-Scale Fishers' Strategies for Extreme Weather Events:
   Lessons for Adaptive Capacity from the Dominican Republic and Belize},

Abstract = {Understanding how Caribbean small-scale fishers can adapt to climate
   change is critical to sustaining coastal communities and livelihoods in
   the region. Fishers continuously adapt their practices to climate
   variability and recurring extreme weather events, such as hurricanes.
   However, it remains unclear how their ``everyday{''} responses
   contribute to building their adaptive capacity for future changes and
   unpredictable extreme climate events. This paper identifies and analyzes
   strategies used by fishers in the Dominican Republic and Belize to deal
   with extreme weather events and climate variability. We draw on two
   separate case studies to identify their current autonomous adaptive
   strategies and explore how these align with broader dimensions of
   adaptive capacity. We find that fishers in both countries respond to
   changes and climate variability by relying on three strategies: (1)
   storing, saving and borrowing resources, (2) using experiential
   knowledge, flexibility and mobility, and (3) diversifying livelihoods
   and intensifying fishing. We show that fishers build their adaptive
   capacity on flexibility to sustain their livelihoods and on local
   knowledge to mitigate risk and damage from extreme weather events. The
   paper argues that the adaptive responses used by fishers in the
   Dominican Republic and in Belize can sustain their livelihoods but
   cannot enable a long term and transformative adaptation to ongoing and
   cumulative climate changes.},

Abstract = {Los Angeles (LA) County's coastal areas are highly valued for their
   natural benefits and their economic contributions to the region. While
   LA County already has a high level of exposure to flooding (e.g. people,
   ports, and harbors), climate change and sea level rise will increase
   flood risk; anticipating this risk requires adaptation planning to
   mitigate social, economic, and physical damage. This study provides an
   overview of the potential effects of sea level rise on coastal LA County
   and describes adaptation pathways and estimates associated costs in
   order to cope with sea level rise. An adaptation pathway in this study
   is defined as the collection of measures (e.g., beach nourishment, dune
   restoration, flood-proofing buildings, and levees) required to lower
   flood risk. The aim of using different adaptation pathways is to enable
   a transition from one methodology to another over time. These pathways
   address uncertainty in future projections, allowing for flexibility
   among policies and potentially spreading the costs over time.
   Maintaining beaches, dunes, and their natural dynamics is the foundation
   of each of the three adaptation pathways, which address the importance
   of beaches for recreation, environmental value, and flood protection. In
   some scenarios, owing to high projections of sea level rise, additional
   technical engineering options such as levees and sluices may be needed
   to reduce flood risk. The research suggests three adaptation pathways,
   anticipating a +1 ft (0.3 m) to +7 ft (+2 m) sea level rise by year
   2100. Total adaptation costs vary between \$4.3 and \$6.4 bn, depending
   on measures included in the adaptation pathway.},

Abstract = {This study investigates an appropriate combined cycle as the electric
   propulsion system in a large container ship. A gas turbine combined
   cycle and molten carbonate fuel cell-steam turbine cycle are considered;
   the gas turbine uses LNG or hythane fuels. Because it is difficult to
   choose an appropriate propulsion system from only one perspective,
   comprehensive and unbiased analyses refer to the system performance,
   eco-efficiency, and economic feasibility for three configurations. An
   LNG-fueled COGES (combined gas turbine and steam integrated electric
   drive system) seems to be a promising alternative with regards to
   economic feasibility as well as a greenhouse gas regulation. The
   following alternative is the molten carbonate fuel cell-steam turbine
   cycle. A hythane-fueled COGES has a relatively low economic feasibility
   but will be the sole propulsion system if the regulation of greenhouse
   gas emission from shipping is stringent. On the other hand, the carbon
   taxation and implementation of an incentive for hydrogen fuel may
   facilitate a greener shipping environment; the additional eco-friendly
   policy for the shipping industry needs to be provided, shortly soon. (C)

Title = {Public Value of Marine Biodiesel Technology Development in South Korea},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Biodiesel (BD) is often regarded as a carbon-neutral fuel. Many
   countries are investing resources in biodiesel technology development to
   respond to the need to improve energy sustainability and the threat of
   climate change. Since 2009, the South Korean Government has invested a
   considerable amount of money in developing marine BD (MBD) technology
   that converts carbon dioxide into diesel using marine microalgae
   cultivated in large quantities with the help of waste heat from nuclear
   power plants and/or coal-fired power plants. If the development is
   successful, 4800 tons of MBD a year, approximately 1820 cars fully
   fueled annually, will be produced from 2019. Furthermore, the South
   Korean Government is expected to continue to invest in MBD to improve
   the market share after 2019. Quantitative information about the public
   value of MBD technology development is widely demanded by the
   Government. This study aims to investigate the public value of MBD
   technology, the attributes of which it considers to be the reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions, the mitigation of air pollutant emissions, new
   job creation, and the improvement of energy security. A choice
   experiment (CE) survey of 600 people was conducted during July 2016. The
   trade-offs among the attributes and the price were evaluated in the
   survey. The CE data were examined through a multinomial logit model. The
   marginal values for a 1\%p reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, 1\%p
   mitigation of air pollutant emissions, the creation of 100 new jobs, and
   an improvement of energy security caused by MBD technology development
   are computed to be KRW 1082.7 (USD 0.9), 918.1 (0.8), and 258.3 (0.2)
   per household per month, respectively.},

Abstract = {Climate change projections to the year 2100 may miss
   physical-biogeochemical feedbacks that emerge later from the cumulative
   effects of climate warming. In a coupled climate simulation to the year
   2300, the westerly winds strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters
   warm, and sea ice disappears, leading to intense nutrient trapping in
   the Southern Ocean. The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient
   redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface
   nutrient reductions north of 30 degrees S drive steady declines in
   primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41\%,
   respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by
   lower-trophic-level productivity, decrease by more than 20\% globally
   and by nearly 60\% in the North Atlantic. Continued high levels of
   greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity

   mainstreaming in German and Dutch water management},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, governments in many countries began to integrate
   or mainstream climate change adaptation into a range of sectors.
   Comprehensive multi-sectoral adaptation strategies have emerged as the
   preferred approach across Europe. The German Adaptation Strategy is a
   prominent example for such a comprehensive strategy. It addresses 14
   sectors with national key issues and measures, and it provides
   orientation for other (mainly sub-national) actors. Against this trend,
   the Netherlands has pursued climate change adaptation mainly through a
   sectorally focused approach: the Dutch Delta Programme. Building on
   existing programmes,Governments in many it facilitates analysis and
   strategy development for long-term water management at a national scale
   with a strong regional focus. The present paper compares the two
   dissimilar governance approaches mainly with regard to how and to what
   degree they mainstream adaptation into water and coastal zone management
   in selected regions. After discussing strengths and weaknesses of the
   two approaches, we conclude that the more common multi-sectoral approach
   applied in Germany and most other OECD countries is not necessarily
   superior to sectorally focused approaches. Although the Dutch and the
   German cases appear to resemble alternatives, we highlight that their
   combination holds the promise to compensate for each other's weaknesses.
   Overall, we argue that diversity in the governance of climate change
   adaptation is desirable because it can help to prevent that several

   Phenology under Unique Challenges of Tidal Setting},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {While growth history of vegetation within upland systems is well
   studied, plant phenology within coastal tidal systems is less
   understood. Landscape-scale, satellite-derived indicators of plant
   greenness may not adequately represent seasonality of vegetation biomass
   and productivity within tidal wetlands due to limitations of cloud
   cover, satellite temporal frequency, and attenuation of plant signals by
   tidal flooding. However, understanding plant phenology is necessary to
   gain insight into aboveground biomass, photosynthetic activity, and
   carbon sequestration. In this study, we use a modeling approach to
   estimate plant greenness throughout a year in tidal wetlands located
   within the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. We used variables such as EVI
   history, temperature, and elevation to predict plant greenness on a
   14-day timestep. We found this approach accurately estimated plant
   greenness, with larger error observed within more dynamic restored
   wetlands, particularly at early post-restoration stages. We also found
   modeled EVI can be used as an input variable into greenhouse gas models,
   allowing for an estimate of carbon sequestration and gross primary
   production. Our strategy can be further developed in future research by
   assessing restoration and management effects on wetland phenological
   dynamics and through incorporating the entire Sentinel-2 time series
   once it becomes available within Google Earth Engine.},

Title = {Resilience and Social Adaptation to Climate Change Impacts in
   Small-Scale Fisheries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Small-cale fisheries are important for livelihoods, food security, jobs
   and income worldwide. However, they face major challenges, including the
   increasing effects of climate change that pose serious risks to coastal
   ecosystems and fishing communities. Although scientific research on
   climate change impacts has increased in recent years, few studies have
   explored the social impacts on small-scale fisheries. Using Galicia
   (Spain) as a case study, we investigated individual and household-level
   adaptive responses to climate change among fishers in three fishing
   guilds (Cambados, Campelo, and Redondela). Specifically, we estimated
   the economic vulnerability of shellfishers and assessed the diversity of
   social adaptive responses used to deal with climate change. Although
   fishers' income strongly depends on shellfishing in all studied areas,
   our findings show that less fishing experience and lower engagement in
   fisher associations tend to increase the economic vulnerability of the
   fishers. The fishers' vulnerability decreases as the size of households
   increases, while fishers who pay a mortgage and who live in households
   with fewer active members tend to be more vulnerable. The findings also
   show that Galician shellfishers have developed a wide range of
   adaptation strategies to anticipate and respond to climate change
   impacts, namely harvesting pricier and more abundant species, reducing
   household expenses and increasing social involvement in shellfishery
   associations. Although the adaptive strategies have helped Galician
   fishers to deal with climate change impacts, several threats to the
   sustainability of shellfisheries remain, such as a decrease in the
   abundance of key native shellfish species, and a high dependence on
   public and private aid to ensure reasonable incomes for shellfisheries.
   These findings are of interest and relevance to other similar
   small-scale fisheries around the world facing similar climate change
   challenges.},

Title = {A Review of Cost Estimates for Flood Adaptation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Floods are the most devastating of global natural disasters, and flood
   adaptation measures are needed to reduce future risk. Researchers have
   started to evaluate the costs and benefits of flood adaptation, but
   information regarding the cost of different flood adaptation measures is
   often not available or is hidden in non-peer-reviewed literature. Recent
   review studies have explored cost estimates for different aspects of
   flood adaptation, such as nature-based solutions. This study aims to
   contribute empirical data regarding the cost of flood adaptation by
   compiling peer-reviewed literature and research reports. The focus is on
   construction costs and expenses for operation and maintenance. This
   paper integrates the unit cost information of six main flood adaptation
   measure categories: (1) the flood-proofing of buildings, (2) flood
   protection, (3) beach nourishment and dunes, (4) nature-based solutions
   for coastal ecosystems, (5) channel management and nature-based
   solutions for riverine systems, and (6) urban drainage. Cost estimates
   are corrected for inflation and converted to U.S. dollars (2016).
   Measures are described, and cost figures for both developed and
   developing countries are provided. The results of this study can be used
   as input for economic-assessment studies on flood adaptation measures.},

Title = {MOSES A Novel Observation System to Monitor Dynamic Events across Earth

Volume = {103},

Pages = {E339-E348},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Modular Observation Solutions of Earth Systems (MOSES) is a novel
   observation system that is specifically designed to unravel the impact
   of distinct, dynamic events on the long-term development of
   environmental systems. Hydrometeorological extremes such as the recent
   European droughts or the floods of 2013 caused severe and lasting
   environmental damage. Modeling studies suggest that abrupt permafrost
   thaw events accelerate Arctic greenhouse gas emissions. Short-lived
   ocean eddies seem to comprise a significant share of the marine carbon
   uptake or release. Although there is increasing evidence that such
   dynamic events bear the potential for major environmental impacts, our
   knowledge on the processes they trigger is still very limited. MOSES
   aims at capturing such events, from their formation to their end, with
   high spatial and temporal resolution. As such, the observation system
   extends and complements existing national and international observation
   networks, which are mostly designed for long-term monitoring. Several
   German Helmholtz Association centers have developed this research
   facility as a mobile and modular ``system of systems{''} to record
   energy, water, greenhouse gas, and nutrient cycles on the land surface,
   in coastal regions, in the ocean, in polar regions, and in the
   atmosphere-but especially the interactions between the Earth
   compartments. During the implementation period (2017-21), the measuring
   systems were put into operation and test campaigns were performed to
   establish event-driven campaign routines. With MOSES's regular operation
   starting in 2022, the observation system will then be ready for
   cross-compartment and cross-discipline research on the environmental
   impacts of dynamic events.},

Title = {Projecting shifts in thermal habitat for 686 species on the North
   American continental shelf},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Recent shifts in the geographic distribution of marine species have been
   linked to shifts in preferred thermal habitats. These shifts in
   distribution have already posed challenges for living marine resource
   management, and there is a strong need for projections of how species
   might be impacted by future changes in ocean temperatures during the
   21st century. We modeled thermal habitat for 686 marine species in the
   Atlantic and Pacific oceans using long-term ecological survey data from
   the North American continental shelves. These habitat models were
   coupled to output from sixteen general circulation models that were run
   under high (RCP 8.5) and low (RCP 2.6) future greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios over the 21 st century to produce 32 possible future outcomes
   for each species. The models generally agreed on the magnitude and
   direction of future shifts for some species (448 or 429 under RCP 8.5
   and RCP 2.6, respectively), but strongly disagreed for other species
   (116 or 120 respectively). This allowed us to identify species with more
   or less robust predictions. Future shifts in species distributions were
   generally poleward and followed the coastline, but also varied among
   regions and species. Species from the U.S. and Canadian west coast
   including the Gulf of Alaska had the highest projected magnitude shifts
   in distribution, and many species shifted more than 1000 km under the
   high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Following a strong mitigation
   scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement would likely produce
   substantially smaller shifts and less disruption to marine management
   efforts. Our projections offer an important tool for identifying
   species, fisheries, and management efforts that are particularly

Title = {Social resilience to climate and water-related disasters in the Poyang
   Lake area (East China) over the past 2000 years},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The largest freshwater lake in China, the Poyang Lake, experienced a
   long history of evolution with combined influences from both climate
   factors and human activities. Along with the dramatic changes of water
   related disasters such as flood and drought, local society developed
   various strategies to cope with the water problems. This paper
   investigated the evolution of the Poyang Lake area, the flood and
   drought disasters, and the society resilience using statistical
   analysis, spatial analysis, and a combination of qualitative and
   quantitative approaches. Historical data on climate, population, flood
   and drought, water engineering, and social economics were collected to
   support a detailed examination of the climate-hazard-society
   relationships. The results indicate that: (a) the lake area was mainly
   influenced by the warm and rainy climate and expanded significantly
   before the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD). Since the large-scale southward
   population migration in the Yuan Dynasty, intensive reclamation of
   wetlands surrounding the lake plus the effects of a colder climate
   shrank the lake area sharply. (b) The frequency of water-related
   disasters was gradually increasing during the past 2000 years,
   especially since 12th century, as a result of climate change and
   population growth. (c) Despite significant change in climate and
   increasing flood and drought, local people in Poyang Lake area adopted
   various water engineering to prevent flood and coast training measures
   to protect farmland, which enabled the social surviving and continuous
   economic development. Social resilience in Poyang Lake was highly
   correlated with lake changes and associated water hazards. (d)
   Presently, more ecological strategies have been adopted to mitigate the
   risk of flood and drought at the Poyang Lake area. The study emphasizes
   the influences of climate and water environment and the coping
   activities of human society, and thus contributes to a specific
   understanding of resilient living with big lakes.},

Abstract = {Adaptive management of natural resources is an iterative process of
   decision making whereby management strategies are progressively changed
   or adjusted in response to new information. Despite an increasing focus
   on the need for adaptive conservation strategies, there remain few
   applied examples. We describe the 9-year process of adaptive
   comanagement of a marine protected area network in Kubulau District,
   Fiji. In 2011, a review of protected area boundaries and management
   rules was motivated by the need to enhance management effectiveness and
   the desire to improve resilience to climate change. Through a series of
   consultations, with the Wildlife Conservation Society providing
   scientific input to community decision making, the network of marine
   protected areas was reconfigured so as to maximize resilience and
   compliance. Factors identified as contributing to this outcome include
   well-defined resource-access rights; community respect for a flexible
   system of customary governance; long-term commitment and presence of
   comanagement partners; supportive policy environment for comanagement;
   synthesis of traditional management approaches with systematic
   monitoring; and district-wide coordination, which provided a broader
   spatial context for adaptive-management decision making.},

Abstract = {Electric water heaters consumes major part of energy in residential
   sector and hence there is a need to find an economical solution. One
   potential solution is to use solar water heating (SWH) systems. The aim
   of this work is to assess the techno-economic viability of SWH
   technologies for domestic purpose. In this study, different types of SWH
   collectors like evacuated tube and glazed collectors are simulated using
   RETScreen software whose credibility is widely accepted for calculating
   energy production, life cycle assessment, greenhouse gas emissions, and
   fuel savings for SWH applications. Calculations are performed to obtain
   at least 50 \% solar fraction on the basis of number of SWH collectors.
   Other considerations involve collector's types, slope angle, tracking
   mode, collector thermal loses, collector optical efficiency, and back up
   fuel which is electricity in our case.
   Simulations are performed for five different cities of Saudi Arabia.
   Choices are being made to cover different geographical coordinates of
   the kingdom that involve Jeddah (western coast), Dhahran (eastern
   coast), Tabuk (north), Riyadh (center), and Bisha (south). Simulated
   results based on solar radiations on the horizontal and tilted surface,
   solar fraction, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy savings are used
   for comparative analysis of different types of solar collectors while
   net present value, payback period, benefit to cost ratio, and annual
   life cycle savings are the deciding factors for economic viability of
   these systems. Results indicate that under same prevailing conditions
   Bisha is the most attractive while Tabuk is the least suitable place for
   solar SWH technology.},

Abstract = {Mountain glaciers are key indicators of climate change. Their response
   is revealed by the environmental equilibrium-line altitude (ELA), i.e.
   the regional altitude of zero mass balance averaged over a long period
   of time. We introduce a simple approach for distributed modelling of the
   environmental ELA over the entire European Alps based on the
   parameterization of ELA in terms of summer temperature and annual
   precipitation at a glacier. We use 200 years of climate records and
   forecasts to model environmental ELA from 1901 to 2100 at 5 arcmin grid
   cell resolution. Historical environmental ELAs are reconstructed based
   on precipitation from the Long-term Alpine Precipitation reconstruction
   (LAPrec) dataset and temperature from the Historical Instrumental
   climatological Surface Time series of the greater Alpine region
   (HISTALP). The simulations of future environmental ELAs are forced with
   high-resolution EURO-CORDEX regional climate model projections for the
   European domain using three different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios
   (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP). Our reconstructions
   yielded an environmental ELA across the European Alps of 2980 m above
   sea level for the period 1901-1930, with a rise of 114 m in the period
   1971-2000. The environmental ELA is projected to exceed the maximum
   elevation of 69\%, 81\% and 92\% of the glaciers in the European Alps by
   2071-2100 under mitigation (RCP2.6), stabilization (RCP4.5) and high
   greenhouse gas emission (RCP8.5) scenarios, respectively.},

Title = {Adapting water resources systems to climate change in tropical areas:
   Ecuadorian coast},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {703},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase rainfall and temperature in the
   tropical areas of the Ecuadorian coast. The increase in temperature will
   also increase evapotranspiration therefore, future water balance on
   Ecuadorian coast will have a slight variation. Changes in precipitation
   patterns and evapotranspiration will produce an increase in the water
   requirements for current crops, so an imbalance in the water resources
   systems between natural resources and water demands is expected. This
   study presents water resources management as an adaptation measure to
   climate change for reducing vulnerability in tropical areas.
   Twelve bias-corrected climate projections are used, from: two AR5
   General Circulation Models (GCMs), two Representative Concentration
   Pathways, 4.5-8.5 scenarios, and three time periods, short-term
   (2010-2039), medium-term (2040-2069) and long-term (2070-2099). These
   data were incorporated into the Lumped Temez Hydrological Model. Climate
   change scenarios predict for the long-term period both a mean rainfall
   and temperature increases up to 22\%-2.8 degrees C, respectively.
   Besides, the potential evapotranspiration will increase until 12\% by
   Penman-Monteith method and 60\% by Thornthwaite method. Therefore,
   natural water resources will finally have an increase of 19\%
   {[}8-30\%]. Additionally, water requirements for crops will increase
   around 4\% and 45\%.
   As this research shows, in tropical regions, currently viable water
   resources systems could become unsustainable under climate change
   scenarios. To guarantee the water supply in the future additional
   measures are required as reservoir operation rules and irrigation
   efficiency improvement of system from 0.43 to 0.65, which it involves
   improving the distribution and application system. In study area future
   irrigation areas have been estimated for 13,268 ha, which under climate
   change scenarios is unsustainable, only 11,500 ha could be expanded with
   a very high irrigation efficiency of 0.73. Therefore, in tropical areas
   the effect of climate change on expansion projects for irrigated areas
   should be considered to ensure the functioning systems. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals in managed
   ecosystems has generally focused on direct land-atmosphere fluxes, but
   in peatlands a significant proportion of total carbon loss occurs via
   fluvial transport. This study considers the composition of this
   `waterborne carbon' flux, its potential contribution to GHG emissions,
   and the extent to which it may change in response to land-management.
   The work describes, and builds on, a methodology to account for major
   components of these emissions developed for the 2013 Wetland Supplement
   of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We identify two major
   components of GHG emissions from waterbodies draining organic soil: i)
   `on site' emissions of methane (and to a lesser extent CO2) from
   drainage ditches located within the peatland; and ii) `off site'
   emissions of CO2 resulting from downstream oxidation of dissolved and
   particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) within the aquatic system.
   Methane emissions from ditches were found to be large in many cases
   (mean 60 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1) based on all reported values), countering
   the view that methane emissions cease following wetland drainage.
   Emissions were greatest from ditches in intensive agricultural
   peatlands, but data were sparse and showed high variability. For DOC,
   the magnitude of the natural flux varied strongly with latitude, from 5
   g C m(-2) year(-1) in northern boreal peatlands to 60 g C m(-2) year(-1)
   in tropical peatlands. Available data suggest that DOC fluxes increase
   by around 60 \% following drainage, and that this increase may be
   reversed in the longer-term through re-wetting, although variability
   between studies was high, especially in relation to re-wetting response.
   Evidence regarding the fate of DOC is complex and inconclusive, but
   overall suggests that the majority of DOC exported from peatlands is
   converted to CO2 through photo- and/or bio-degradation in rivers,
   standing waters and oceans. The contribution of POC export to GHG
   emissions is even more uncertain, but we estimate that over half of
   exported POC may eventually be converted to CO2. Although POC fluxes are
   normally small, they can become very large when bare peat surfaces are
   exposed to fluvial erosion. Overall, we estimate that waterborne carbon
   emissions may contribute about 1-4 t CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) of
   additional GHG emissions from drained peatlands. For a number of worked
   examples this represented around 15-50 \% of total GHG emissions.},

Abstract = {Coastal regions worldwide are during the process of rapid urban
   expansion. However, expanded urban settlements in land-sea interfaces
   have been faced with unprecedented threats from climate change related
   hazards. Adaptation to coastal hazards has received increasing attention
   from city managers and planners. Adaptation and land management
   practices are largely informed by remote sensing and land change
   modeling. This paper establishes a framework that integrates land change
   analysis, coastal flooding, and sea level rise adaptation. Multilayer
   perceptron neural network, similarity learning, and binary logistic
   regression were applied to analyze spatiotemporal changes of
   residential, commercial, and other built-up areas in Bay County,
   Florida, USA. The prediction maps of 2030 were produced by three models
   under four policy scenarios that included the population relocation
   strategy. Validation results reveal that three models return overall
   acceptable accuracies but generate distinct landscape patterns.
   Predictions indicate that planned retreat of residents can greatly
   reduce urban vulnerability to sea level rise induced flooding. While
   managed realignment of the coast brings large benefits, the paper
   recommends different mixes of adaptation strategies for different parts
   of the globe, and advocates the application of reflective land use
   planning to foster a more disaster resilient coastal community.},

Abstract = {Substantial increases in shale gas production due to advances in
   hydraulic fracturing have created tremendous monetization and
   sustainable development opportunities, one of which is liquified natural
   gas (LNG). The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has targeted
   reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by 50\% by 2050.
   Conventional shipping fuels currently used are heavy fuel oil (HFO) and
   marine gas/diesel oil (MGO/MDO). There has been growing interest in
   using LNG as a shipping fuel because of its competitive cost,
   availability, and the presence of bunkering infrastructure. A thorough
   literature review of LNG life cycle GHG emissions shows variation
   depending on the following factors: shale gas extraction, pretreatment,
   pipeline transportation distance, liquefaction plant
   capacity/technology, and ship propulsion system. Compared to
   conventional fuels, LNG can reduce life cycle emissions up to 18\%.
   Incorporating renewables-based power generation in liquefaction can
   reduce emissions by a further 5\%-10\% (renewable-assisted LNG). The
   reduction potential and economic effects of this modification on LNG
   cost are examined and it is shown that low wind-based electricity prices
   can make renewable-assisted LNG competitive. A comprehensive
   understanding of the factors impacting LNG emissions help identify the
   current and future potential of LNG in reducing shipping industry
   emissions and providing a short-term transitional fuel until it is
   supplanted with decarbonized fuels. This paper also uses water-energy
   nexus to examine the impact of responsible water management on the
   carbon footprint of LNG.},

Abstract = {The current global context has highlighted the limits of fossil
   resources. Regarding the sharp increases in emissions of greenhouse
   gases, the awareness of sustainable development issues and renewable
   energy becomes more considerable. The development of renewable energies,
   in particular marine energies, could be done with the identification of
   energy deposits. Due to its geographical position, bordered by both the
   Mediterranean and Atlantic seas, Morocco has a great renewable energy
   resources potential, especially the Marine Renewable Energy (MRE/EMR).
   This last one is characterized by its predictability and potential that
   is not exploited yet. The current work includes the simulation of
   velocity and the characterization of the marine renewable energy
   resource, more precisely the marine currents, on a Moroccan coastal
   zone, the Tarfaya zone, with a spatial resolution of 200 m. It concerns
   the numerical modeling of marine currents, which allows to describe
   their speed on the studied area. The proposed contribution was made
   using the SWAN digital model. The characteristics obtained will be
   presented as tables of values and maps.},

Title = {Potential future methane emission hot spots in Greenland},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate models have been making significant progress encompassing an
   increasing number of complex feedback mechanisms from natural
   ecosystems. Permafrost thaw and subsequent induced greenhouse gas
   emissions, however, remain a challenge for climate models at large.
   Deducing permafrost conditions and associated greenhouse gas emissions
   from parameters that are simulated in climate models would be a helpful
   step towards estimating emission budgets from permafrost regions. Here
   we use a regional climate model with a 5 km horizontal resolution to
   assess future potential methane (CH4) emissions over presently
   unglaciated areas in Greenland under an RCP8.5 scenario. A simple frost
   index is applied to estimate permafrost conditions from the model
   output. CH4 flux measurements from two stations in Greenland; Nuuk
   representing sub-Arctic and Zackenberg high-Arctic climate, are used to
   establish a relationship between emissions and near surface air
   temperature. Permafrost conditions in Greenland change drastically by
   the end of the 21st century in an RCP8.5 climate. Continuous permafrost
   remains stable only in North Greenland, the north-west coast, the
   northern tip of Disko Island, and Nuussuaq. Southern Greenland
   conditions only sustain sporadic permafrost conditions and largely at
   high elevations, whereas former permafrost in other regions thaws. The
   increasing thawed soil leads to increasing CH4 emissions. Especially the
   area surrounding Kangerlussuaq, Scoresby Land, and the southern coast of
   Greenland exhibit potentially high emissions during the longer growing
   season. The constructed maps and budgets combining modelled permafrost
   conditions with observed CH4 fluxes from CH4 promoting sites represent a
   useful tool to identify areas in need of additional monitoring as they
   highlight potential CH4 hot spots.},

Title = {Urban land planning: The role of a Master Plan in influencing local
   temperatures},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Land use planning (LUP) is central for managing issues related to
   climatic variation in urban environments. However, Master Plans (MPs)
   usually do not include climatic aspects, and few studies have addressed
   climate change at the urban scale, especially in developing countries.
   This paper proposes a framework with ten categories for assessment of
   climatic variation in urban LUP. Each category comprises attributes that
   describe a complex of relationships in influencing local temperature
   variations. They are analyzed for the case of the Master Plan of Porto
   Alegre (MPPA), the Southernmost metropolis of Brazil. It is concluded
   that the MPPA is strongly grounded in climate-related land and zoning
   coordination, but exhibits weaknesses in building, cartographical and
   social aspects considered synergistically relevant for tackling problems
   related to urban climate variation. Furthermore, the MPPA does not
   contain provisions related to monitoring of local climate and greenhouse
   gases (GHG) emissions and it is ineffective for improving energy
   efficiency. Specific MPPA failures stemming from these weaknesses
   include: an increase of 21.79\% in the city's urbanized area from 1986
   to 2011 to accommodate a similar increase in population, with
   significant horizontal sprawl; average temperature rise of 0.392 degrees
   C from 1991-2000 to 2001-2010, with statistically significant increases
   in temperature found since 1931; significant vehicle traffic increases,
   especially since 2007. From these findings, it is possible to conclude
   that the MPPA does not offer answers to all the imbalances related to
   land use, and therefore gives insufficient support to tackle the issue
   of rising temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Review of Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty Applications Using
   Green Infrastructure for Flood Management},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) approaches are well-suited
   for making decisions about infrastructure to manage flooding exacerbated
   by climate change. One important system for climate resilience and flood
   management is green infrastructure, which refers to a network of natural
   and semi-engineered areas that provides ecosystem functions. Green
   infrastructure is often characterized as a low-regret strategy with
   multiple co-benefits under uncertainty. These attributes enable green
   infrastructure to be an important adaptation strategy under DMDU
   frameworks for flood management. However, DMDU analyses that include
   green infrastructure are still relatively limited, perhaps due to
   computational or modeling complexity and other barriers. This paper
   identifies and reviews publications in the flood management literature
   that use DMDU frameworks and refer to green infrastructure adaptation
   strategies, in order to identify trends and inform future research. The
   reviewed publications are categorized according to a variety of
   performance metrics, climate change scenarios, DMDU metrics, and
   hydrologic modeling techniques, and represent several adaptation
   strategies applied to case studies on five continents using a range of
   data sources and assumptions. This paper highlights a number of
   solutions that can be employed to facilitate additional research at the
   intersection of these fields. Primary among these is the transparent
   documentation and use of open source models, methods, and data. Future
   research should also focus on communication among different
   stakeholders, particularly in ensuring definitions, assumptions, and
   data requirements are clear. These partnerships can facilitate effective
   application of robust strategies such as green infrastructure for urban
   adaptation to the effects of climate change.},

Title = {Spring soil CO2 and CH4 emissions in the Yellow River Delta wetland,
   China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {190},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change has become a global concern. Coastal wetlands play an
   important role in the global carbon cycle and significantly contribute
   to the emission and absorption of the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4. In
   this study, the temporal and spatial variations of soil CO2 and CH4
   emission fluxes, soil total carbon, total organic carbon, and carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotopes of four vegetation areas (Suaeda salsa,
   Phragmites australis, Tamarix chinensis, and farmland) and a bare beach
   in the Yellow River Delta wetland were observed in the spring of
   2011-2013. Soil organic carbon delta 13C ranged from -25.43--23.69 parts
   per thousand and soil organic carbon content from 0.311 to 1.42\%, and
   the two were significantly negatively correlated, indicating a low
   decomposition degree of soil organic matter. The soil CO2 emission
   fluxes in the study period were carbon emissions. In the area with
   mainly Tamarix chinensis, the 3-year average CO2 emission flux was the
   highest, in the area with predominantly Phragmites australisthe lowest.
   The soil CH4 emission flux in the spring of 2011 was a carbon
   absorption, whereas it was a carbon emission in the spring of 2012 and
   2013. Its 3-year average was the highest in the bare beach area and the
   lowest in the Tamarix ramosissima area. Based on Pearson correlation
   analysis combined with RDA and multiple linear regression analysis, we
   found that the main factors affecting soil CO2 and CH4 emission fluxes
   may be the fast decomposition rate of soil organic matter, the content
   of soil carbon and organic carbon, and the low degree of soil organic
   matter decomposition.},

Abstract = {Trends in the locations and technologies of UK electricity generation
   plant suggest that demand for cooling water abstractions from rivers
   will decrease in the coming decades, unless there is widespread uptake
   of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). CCS may prove to be
   essential if the UK is to achieve its carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas
   emission targets. `Decarbonisation' strategies that rely on CCS are
   therefore potentially at risk of not having sufficient cooling water in
   periods of low river flows. In this paper, regional freshwater demands
   for cooling water are assessed against regional freshwater availability
   at low flows in a scenario of medium climate change. In the strategy
   with high CCS, demands for water greatly exceed current and future
   availability in the north-west (NW) England, Humber, East (E) Midlands
   and Thames regions. These risks can be mitigated by increasing the
   penetration of hybrid cooling systems or shifting generating capacity to
   estuaries or the coast. The former could reduce national water use by up
   to 35\%, whereas applying the latter in the NW England, Humber and E
   Midlands regions offers nationwide reductions from 30 to 50\%.},

Abstract = {Climate Change has emerged as one of the grand global challenges facing
   humanity. The dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas that seems to be
   contributing to the climate change problem, carbon dioxide (COD, has a
   complex cycle through the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. The
   combustion of fossil fuels (power production, transportation, etc.)
   remains the largest source of anthropogenic CO2 to the Earth's
   atmosphere. Up until very recently, the quantification of fossil fuel
   CO2 was understood only at coarse space and time scales. A recent
   research effort has greatly improved this space/time quantification
   resulting in source data at a resolution of less than 10 km(2)/hr at the
   surface of North America. By providing visual tools to examine this new,
   high resolution CO2 data, we can better understand the way that CO2 is
   transmitted within the atmosphere and how it is exchanged with other
   components of the Earth System. We have developed interactive visual
   analytic tools, which allows for easy data manipulation, analysis, and
   extraction. The Visualization system is aimed for a wide range Of users
   which include researchers and political leaders. The goal is to help
   assist these people in analyzing data and enabling new policy options in
   mitigation of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the U.S.},

Abstract = {A large number of prospective climate scenarios rely on Carbon Dioxide
   Removal (CDR) technologies to limit global warming below 2 degrees C. To
   date, however, a comprehensive understanding of the overall life-cycle
   environmental impacts of CDR technologies is missing. We present a
   critical review on conducted Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of a
   comprehensive set of CDR technologies: afforestation and reforestation,
   biochar, soil carbon sequestration, enhanced weathering, ocean
   fertilisation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and direct air
   carbon capture and storage. One of the key observations is that
   emissions avoided due to substitution of certain processes (due to
   system expansion in LCA) can be easily misinterpreted as negative
   emissions, i.e. as carbon removal from the atmosphere. Based on the
   observed inconsistencies and shortcomings, we recommend to interpret
   available CDR LCA results with caution. To improve the understanding of
   environmental implications of CDR deployment, we recommend (1) to
   conduct LCAs with multiple environmental impact categories, (2) to
   consider the temporal aspect of emissions in biomass-related CDR
   technologies, (3) to focus on so far overlooked CDR technologies, (4) to
   be as transparent as possible regarding methodological choices, (5) to
   capture environmental side-effects, and (6) to distinguish between
   `avoided emissions' and `negative emissions' - only negative emissions
   correspond to permanent removal from the atmosphere. We conclude that
   more comprehensive and rigorous LCAs are needed to help inform the
   design of CDR technology portfolios and to aid in anticipatory
   governance.},

Abstract = {Land use change, coupled with rapid human population growth, has
   increased ecosystem degradation, giving rise to ecosystem restoration
   initiatives worldwide. We conducted an assessment and reflection using a
   feedback framework for strategic adaptive management in three woodland
   restoration initiatives in South Africa. This is because assessment and
   reflection are critical components for successful strategic adaptive
   management. We found that the three restoration initiatives have had a
   limited emphasis on sustainable livelihood driven outcomes, because the
   initiatives mainly aimed to restore biodiversity, ecosystem
   infrastructure and ecosystem services. Consequently, we propose a
   modified livelihood framework that suggests a more inclusive approach
   towards achieving positive human outcome-driven restoration of degraded
   woodlands. Based on the framework, we emphasise that restoration
   initiatives should seek to invest in ecosystem restoration in the
   context of sustainable development goals, to enhance people's
   livelihoods, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Harmonizing
   the competing needs for resource allocation, sustainable interventions
   and livelihoods sustenance will be important, given the limited extent
   of alternative locally based livelihood options in the rural
   disadvantaged areas. This is because most of the rural population is
   largely dependent on woodland ecosystem services for their livelihoods.
   We then suggest that to ensure that human-driven outcomes are also
   equally prioritised; the assessment, reflection and feedback framework
   and the livelihoods framework should form part of restoration
   initiatives.

Title = {Desalting seawater in Qatar by renewable energy: a feasibility study},
Journal = {DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT},

Abstract = {Qatar is an arid country and suffers severe lack of natural water
   resources. Groundwater is overexploited and has become seriously
   depleted with deteriorating quality. Non-conventional alternative water
   resources, mainly desalted seawater (DW) and treated wastewater are used
   and are slowly being expanded to serve potable agricultural, and
   industrial needs. Qatar's population growth, almost doubled in less than
   10 years, has increased the demand for potable water and is exerting
   pressure on the government to build additional desalting plants. The
   multi-stage flash (MSF) desalting is the predominant method that is used
   in Qatar. Its energy consumption is high-an average 270 kJ/kg thermal
   energy and 14.4 kJ/kg pumping energy. In the present paper, several
   different types of desalting sweater methods of less consumed energy
   than the MSF are reviewed. Burning fossil fuel, mainly natural gas, to
   supply the energy needed for DW units increases the emission of air
   polluting gases as well as greenhouse gases such as CO2 and NOx.
   Moreover, concentrated brine that is discharged from the MSF plants
   pollutes the marine and terrestrial environment. This brine is at higher
   temperature than the seawater temperature and is mixed with chemicals
   such as chlorine. The present paper also examines the feasibility of
   using renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind energies, to
   run the SWRO desalting plants, as well as selecting the suitably driven
   renewable energy operating the SW. To protect the environment and to
   make the DW more sustainable as a potable water source, renewable energy
   and more energy-efficient desalting methods should be used.},

Title = {A numerical simulation of anthropogenic climate change},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-65},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Results are presented from a recent high resolution transient climate
   change experiment carried out at the Max Planck Institute for
   Meteorology, Hamburg. The experiment is discussed in the light of the
   greenhouse warming experiment by Arrhenius, The transient calculation
   started in January 1860 and continued until the end of the 21st century.
   The effect of individual greenhouse gases has been incorporated using
   observed data until 1990 and thereafter assumed emissions according to
   (IPCC) scenario IS92a. Validation of the coupled model shows a realistic
   simulation of observed coupled modes such as El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation. The simulated low frequency variability at middle and high
   latitudes resembles, by and large, the observed one. A detailed
   evaluation over Scandinavia shows that the model reproduces the typical
   very strong interannual variability of this region. The result shows a
   small warming until present in broad agreement with observations. There
   is a strong positive feedback with water vapor but a negative feedback
   with clouds. The evaluation is concentrated at the time the
   concentration of the greenhouse gases has doubled compared to the
   starting time. Such a doubling is expected to take place in 2030-2040.
   The energy cycle is slowly changing and a gradual increase in the
   absorption of short-wave radiation in the atmosphere and an increase in
   the net long-wave radiation at the ground are noted. The latent heat
   flux from the surface of the earth increases while the sensible heat
   flux decreases. The hydrological cycle increases very slowly and mainly
   over land. After 1990, a rapid warming is starting which goes on with
   superimposed minor multidecadal variations until the end of the run.
   Overall global warming amounts to some 3.5 degrees C for the period 1990
   to 2100. At the time of greenhouse gas doubling, the global warming
   amounts to 1.9 degrees C. The typical feedback pattern for the early
   part of the run continues with increasing amplitude and so do the
   changes in the hydrological cycle. The warming pattern shows a strong
   amplitude in the Arctic associated with a marked retreat of Arctic sea
   ice. The overall warming over the Scandinavian area is one to two
   degrees higher than the global average superimposed upon a similar high
   interannual variability as in the present climate.},

Abstract = {It is opinion that climate change on the planet is largely dependent on
   the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and that this effect
   is related largely to human activities that make CO2. Reducing the
   discharge of CO2 has therefore become a common objective of the
   international community, including China. There are various actions that
   are proposed for the reduction of the gas: increased use of renewable
   sources, nuclear, energy saving, capture and storage in underground or
   in deep ocean etc. The paper, however, pays particular attention to the
   contribution that CO2 is able to provide both in industrial processes
   and as a raw material employed in production processes, to obtain
   products and goods, and ultimately, to the way in which, from a waste
   product with a high environmental impact (like CO2) it is possible to
   create economic value.},

Title = {Economic evaluation of climate risk adaptation strategies: Cost-benefit
   analysis of flood protection in Tabasco, Mexico},
Journal = {ATMOSFERA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {101-120},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Economic losses as a result of natural hazards have been rising over the
   past few decades due to socio-economic development and perhaps climate
   change. This upwards trend is projected to continue, highlighting the
   need for adequate adaptation strategies. This raises the question of how
   to determine which adaptation strategies are preferred to cope with
   uncertain climate change impacts. This study shows how a
   multi-disciplinary cascade of hazard modelling, risk modelling, and a
   cost-benefit analysis can be applied to provide a first indicator of
   economically efficient adaptation strategies. We apply this approach to
   an analysis of flood risk and the desirability of flood protection in
   the state of Tabasco in Mexico, which faces severe flooding on an almost
   yearly basis. The results show that expected annual damage caused by
   coastal flooding is expected to increase from 0.53 billion USD today up
   to 4.12 billion USD in 2080 due to socio-economic development and
   climate change. For river floods, expected annual damages are estimated
   to increase from 1.79 billion USD up to 10.6 billion USD in 2080 if no
   adaptation measures are taken. Based on the estimated risk and
   cost-benefit analysis of installing flood protection infrastructure, we
   determined the economically optimal protection standards for both river
   and coastal floods as at least 100 years, if we take into account
   climate change. Our main conclusions are robust to key uncertainties
   about climate change impacts on flood risks, indirect damage caused by
   floods, the width of the protected floodplains, and the adopted social
   discount rate. We discuss how our multi-disciplinary approach can assist
   policy-makers in decisions about flood risk management, and how future
   research can extend our method to more refined local analyses which are
   needed to guide local adaptation planning.},

Abstract = {Recent global climate changes have increased the frequency of disasters.
   Therefore, land-use plans should immediately account for climate change
   impacts, which can help to reduce the risks and damage associated with

   interviews to explore climate change issues and strategies for two
   townships along the coastal areas of Chiayi County, Taiwan. Accordingly,
   this study follows the guidelines from Taiwan's Adaptation Strategy to
   Climate Change to work out sustainable adaptation plans for the coastal
   areas. Basic principles are proposed for disaster prevention and
   mitigation, adaptation, and transformation. In accordance with these
   principles, strategies are suggested for five areas: managing water
   resources, restoring the ecological habitat, constructing
   community-based green energy storage systems, ensuring safety and
   reforming the landscape. The last section concludes the study.},

Title = {Threshold effects of hazard mitigation in coastal human-environmental
   systems},
Journal = {EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-45},
Abstract = {Despite improved scientific insight into physical and social dynamics
   related to natural disasters, the financial cost of extreme events
   continues to rise. This paradox is particularly evident along developed
   coastlines, where future hazards are projected to intensify with
   consequences of climate change, and where the presence of valuable
   infrastructure exacerbates risk. By design, coastal hazard mitigation
   buffers human activities against the variability of natural phenomena
   such as storms. But hazard mitigation also sets up feed-backs between
   human and natural dynamics. This paper explores developed coastlines as
   exemplary coupled human-environmental systems in which hazard mitigation
   is the key coupling mechanism. Results from a simplified numerical model
   of an agent-managed seawall illustrate the nonlinear effects that
   economic and physical thresholds can impart into coastal
   human-environmental system dynamics. The scale of mitigation action
   affects the time frame over which human activities and natural hazards
   interact. By accelerating environmental changes observable in some
   settings over human timescales of years to decades, climate change may
   temporarily strengthen the coupling between human and environmental
   dynamics. However, climate change could ultimately result in weaker
   coupling at those human timescales as mitigation actions increasingly
   engage global-scale systems.},

   bibliometric analysis, the bibliometrix package in the R software was
   used in combination with the VOSviewer software. The outcomes of
   bibliometric analysis are the most ranked articles, journals, authors,

   bibliographic coupling analysis identified five research clusters: (1)
   decarbonization and emission reduction measures, (2) speed management,
   (3) policy and regulations, (4) economic and organizational factors, and
   (5) alternative energy sources. Future research directions are proposed

Abstract = {A coupled atmosphere-ocean-carbon cycle model is used to examine the
   long term climate implications of various 2050 greenhouse gas emission
   reduction targets. All emission targets considered with less than 60\%
   global reduction by 2050 break the 2.0 degrees C threshold warming this
   century, a number that some have argued represents an upper bound on
   manageable climate warming. Even when emissions are stabilized at 90\%
   below present levels at 2050, this 2.0 degrees C threshold is eventually
   broken. Our results suggest that if a 2.0 degrees C warming is to be
   avoided, direct CO2 capture from the air, together with subsequent
   sequestration, would eventually have to be introduced in addition to
   sustained 90\% global carbon emissions reductions by 2050.},

Abstract = {Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) is a follow on mission of ADEOS
   and ADEOS2. It is under phase A study in NASDA (National Space
   Development Agency of Japan). GCOM is not a series of satellites but a
   mission and its concept is to continuously monitor geophysical
   parameters which are critical to understand global change phenomena,
   especially phenomena related to climate change. The measurements of
   geophysical parameters will continue more than 15 years after the launch
   of ADEOS2. The fist generation of GCOM is now composed of 2 satellites,
   i.e. GCOM-A1 and GCOM-B1. The target of GCOM-A1 is to monitor greenhouse
   gases distribution and ozone as well as ozone related constituents from
   oblique orbit. The target of GCOM-B1 is to measure geophysical
   parameters which are uncertain in the today's climate models. Those
   parameters include, but not limited to, optical thickness of aerosols
   and clouds, thermal fluxes, carbon fluxes, sink and source of greenhouse
   gases, etc. GCOM-B1 will carry three core instruments, i.e. SGLI (GLI
   follow on), AMSR2 (AMSR follow on), alpha-Seat (SeaWinds follow on).
   Another candidate instrument is ATRAS (IMG follow on). The orbit of
   GCOM-B1 will be a sun synchronous orbit, which is almost the same as
   ADEOS2. GCOM-B1 is especially powerful for the monitoring of oceanic
   processes. It can observe sea surface temperature, ocean color and sea
   surface winds simultaneously by 3 sensors, i.e. SGLI, alpha-Seat and
   AMSR2. GCOM-A1 is planned to be launched in Feb. 2005 while GCOM-B1 is
   planned to be launched in Aug. 2006.},

Abstract = {The development of adaptive policies for the management of dynamic and
   complex ecosystems, such as marine and coastal environments, asks for
   flexible and innovative tools which account for multifaceted issues,
   uncertainties and cope with a wide range of future conditions. To date,
   several tools and methods to support the design and implementation of
   adaptive policies have been developed by the research community (e.g.
   data processing and management, stakeholder analysis and participatory
   methods, numerical and simulation models, assessment approaches). The
   paper proposes a (four) step-wise methodology to review, analyze,
   classify and select existing tools dealing with social, economic and
   environmental issues. Firstly, existing toolboxes were retrieved.
   Secondly, an in-depth analysis was performed to classify their potential
   for the development and implementation of adaptive policies in marine
   areas. Thirdly, selected tools were included in the `Database of tools
   and methods' of the wider Adaptive Marine Policy Tool Box, designed
   within the EU-FP7 PERSEUS project (Policy-oriented Environmental
   Research in Southern European Seas) to support policy makers with the
   application of an Adaptive Policy Framework. Finally, a review process
   was performed based on several qualitative criteria and expert judgment,
   which allowed to identify a set of valuable `flag tools' useful to
   implement each step of the Adaptive Policy Framework.},

Title = {Consolidating soil carbon turnover models by improved estimates of
   belowground carbon input},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {World soil carbon (C) stocks are third only to those in the ocean and
   earth crust, and represent twice the amount currently present in the
   atmosphere. Therefore, any small change in the amount of soil organic C
   (SOC) may affect carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere.
   Dynamic models of SOC help reveal the interaction among soil carbon
   systems, climate and land management, and they are also frequently used
   to help assess SOC dynamics. Those models often use allometric functions
   to calculate soil C inputs in which the amount of C in both above and
   below ground crop residues are assumed to be proportional to crop
   harvest yield. Here we argue that simulating changes in SOC stocks based
   on C input that are proportional to crop yield is not supported by data
   from long-term experiments with measured SOC changes. Rather, there is
   evidence that root C inputs are largely independent of crop yield, but
   crop specific. We discuss implications of applying fixed belowground C
   input regardless of crop yield on agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation
   and accounting.},

Abstract = {Long-term flood risk adaptation and decision making are complex because
   the future is full of deep uncertainties. Flexibility and robustness can
   be used to deal with future uncertainty. This study developed an
   integrated modeling framework that extends previous studies to the
   spatial domain to assess the future flood risks and the cost and benefit
   of three adaptation measures for four types of buildings in Shanghai.
   Real options analysis (ROA) and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP)
   were integrated to develop a dynamic adaptation pathway and identify
   robust adaptation options. The results show that: (1) Sea level rise and
   land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in
   Shanghai; (2) Among the three flood control measures, wet-floodproofing
   has the best economic performance in terms of both the net present value
   and the benefit/cost ratio, followed by dry-floodproofing, and
   elevation; (3) Dry-floodproofing can be used at the beginning of the
   future period (2030-2100), and it can be replaced by wet-floodproofing
   in 2035-2042; the elevation measure also shows good performance at the
   beginning of implementation, but its performance will decline after
   2041-2045; (4) The combined strategy of dry- and wet-floodproofing in
   2044-2046 and a hybrid strategy combining the three measures should be
   the optimal solution for reducing the flood risks in 2047-2051. The
   methodology developed in this study can provide insights for coastal
   cities to formulate cost-effective and feasible adaptation strategies in
   a deeply uncertain future.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Observational and atmospheric inversion studies find that the strength
   of the Southern Ocean carbon dioxide (CO2) sink is not increasing,
   despite rising atmospheric CO2. However, this is yet to be captured by
   contemporary coupled-climate-carbon-models used to predict future
   climate. We show that by accounting for stratospheric ozone depletion in
   a coupled-climate-carbon-model, the ventilation of carbon rich deep
   water is enhanced through stronger winds, increasing surface water CO2
   at a rate in good agreement with observed trends. We find that Southern
   Ocean uptake is reduced by 2.47 PgC (1987-2004) and is consistent with
   atmospheric inversion studies. The enhanced ventilation also accelerates
   ocean acidification, despite lesser Southern Ocean CO2 uptake. Our
   results link two important anthropogenic changes: stratospheric ozone
   depletion and greenhouse gas increases; and suggest that studies of
   future climate that neglect stratospheric ozone depletion likely
   overestimate regional and global oceanic CO2 uptake and underestimate
   the impact of ocean acidification. Citation: Lenton, A., F. Codron, L.

Title = {Climate Change Impacts on the Seasonal Variation of Hydro-Physical
   Characteristics in the Persian Gulf},
Journal = {ESTUARIES AND COASTS},
Abstract = {Climate change affects atmospheric circulation patterns and intensifies
   recurrent extreme weather events across the globe. It has resulted in
   increasing air temperatures, rising sea levels, and alterations in
   precipitation patterns, which will immensely influence the
   hydro-environment regime in semi-enclosed water bodies (e.g., gulfs and
   estuaries). The Persian Gulf (PG), the world's hottest sea, is a
   regional hotspot for climate change. This study investigates how the
   interplay between climate change and the meteorological variables
   affects salinity, temperature, and density of water mass concerning
   water circulation patterns (WCPs) in PG. It contributes to representing
   a perspective of meteorological conditions over the region and
   projecting expected seasonal variations of PG hydro-physical properties
   at the beginning of the next decade. For these purposes, we used the
   downscaled data of 2030 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 (representative
   concentration pathway) scenarios to run the hydrodynamic model and also
   used a 54-year time series (1948-2002) for reference model representing
   the historical state (HS). The findings project distinguishable
   temperature rise (reaching 37 \& DEG;C in summer over vast areas),
   salinity rise in most parts (up to +5.4 practical salinity units
   relative to HS at the northwestern head in spring), and an increase in
   vertical density gradients leading to an increase in speeds of surface
   currents. These alterations in physical properties significantly
   influence chemical and biological processes in PG, potentially resulting
   in aquatic degradation and ecological issues. Therefore, the findings
   are remarkable for policymakers to develop adaptation management plans
   in the PG region in line with sustainable development goals.},

Title = {The capacity to adapt?: communities in a changing climate, environment,
   and economy on the northern Andaman coast of Thailand},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The health and productivity of marine ecosystems, habitats, and
   fisheries are deteriorating on the Andaman coast of Thailand. Because of
   their high dependence on natural resources and proximity to the ocean,
   coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to climate-induced
   changes in the marine environment. These communities must also adapt to
   the impacts of management interventions and conservation initiatives,
   including marine protected areas, which have livelihood implications.
   Further, communities on the Andaman coast are also experiencing a range
   of new economic opportunities associated in particular with tourism and
   agriculture. These complex and ongoing changes require integrated
   assessment of, and deliberate planning to increase, the adaptive
   capacity of communities so that they may respond to: (1) environmental
   degradation and fisheries declines through effective management
   interventions or conservation initiatives, (2) new economic
   opportunities to reduce dependence on fisheries, and (3) the increasing
   impacts of climate change. Our results are from a mixed methods study,
   which used surveys and interviews to examine multiple dimensions of the
   adaptive capacity of seven island communities near marine protected
   areas on the Andaman coast of Thailand. Results show that communities
   had low adaptive capacity with respect to environmental degradation and
   fisheries declines, and to management and conservation interventions, as
   well as uneven levels of adaptive capacity to economic opportunities.
   Though communities and households were experiencing the impacts of
   climate change, especially storm events, changing seasons and weather
   patterns, and erosion, they were reacting to these changes with limited
   knowledge of climate change per se. We recommend interventions, in the
   form of policies, programs, and actions, at multiple scales for
   increasing the adaptive capacity of Thailand's coastal communities to
   change. The analytical and methodological approach used for examining
   adaptive capacity could be easily modified and applied to other contexts
   and locales.},

Abstract = {Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas inducing climate change.
   Increased global CO2 emissions, estimated at 8.4 Pg C yr(-1) at present,
   have accelerated from 1\% yr(-1) during 1990-1999 to 2.5\% yr(-1) during
   2000-2009 (ref. 1). The carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems is the
   greatest unknown in the global C budget because the actual magnitude,
   location and causes of terrestrial sinks are uncertain(2); estimates of
   terrestrial C uptake, therefore, are often based on the residuals
   between direct measurements of the atmospheric sink and well-constrained
   models of ocean uptake of CO2 (ref. 3). Here we report significant
   terrestrial C accumulation caused by CO2 enhancement to net ecosystem
   productivity in an intact, undisturbed arid ecosystem(4-8) following ten
   years of exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2. Results provide direct
   evidence that CO2 fertilization substantially increases ecosystem C
   storage and that arid ecosystems are significant, previously
   unrecognized, sinks for atmospheric CO2 that must be accounted for in
   efforts to constrain terrestrial and global C cycles.},

Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation destroy coral
   reefs, the ecosystem services they provide, and the livelihoods of close
   to a billion people who depend on these services. Restoration approaches
   to increase the resilience of corals are therefore necessary to counter
   environmental pressures relevant to climate change projections. In this
   Review, we examine the natural processes that can increase the adaptive
   capacity of coral holobionts, with the aim of preserving ecosystem
   functioning under future ocean conditions. Current approaches that
   centre around restoring reef cover can be integrated with emerging
   approaches to enhance coral stress resilience and, thereby, allow reefs
   to regrow under a new set of environmental conditions. Emerging
   approaches such as standardized acute thermal stress assays, selective
   sexual propagation, coral probiotics, and environmental hardening could
   be feasible and scalable in the real world. However, they must follow
   decision-making criteria that consider the different reef,
   environmental, and ecological conditions. The implementation of adaptive
   interventions tailored around nature-based solutions will require
   standardized frameworks, appropriate ecological risk-benefit
   assessments, and analytical routines for consistent and effective
   utilization and global coordination.
   Anthropogenic climate change and environmental deterioration are driving
   global degradation of coral reefs. This Review examines how the natural
   adaptive capacity of coral holobionts can be harnessed and expanded to
   counter the ongoing loss of coral reefs.},

Title = {Carbon cycle of an urban watershed: exports, sources, and metabolism},
Journal = {BIOGEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {126},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {173-195},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rivers transport and transform significant quantities of carbon to
   coastal zones globally. Urbanization and climate change impact the
   transport and transformation of carbon by altering hydrology, water
   temperatures, and in-stream metabolism rates. Changes in exports,
   sources, and metabolism of carbon influence ecosystem processes, food
   webs, and greenhouse gases. We characterized exports, sources, and
   metabolism of carbon in four urban watersheds using a combination of
   discrete stream chemistry measurements and continuous water-quality
   sensors. Over three years, watershed DOC exports in the
   Baltimore-Washington D.C. metropolitan area ranged from 9 to 23 kg
   ha(-1) year(-1). DIC exports ranged from 19 to 59 kg ha(-1) year(-1).
   Daily contributions from in-stream metabolism varied between -65 and 90
   \% of DIC export depending on stream size and streamflow conditions.
   Negative contributions from metabolism occurred on days when streams
   were autotrophic. All streams were heterotrophic during 60 to 87 \% of
   each year, but showed significant peaks in autotrophy during spring and
   summer. Differences in the timing and magnitude of peaks in springtime
   net ecosystem productivity were likely driven by varying light
   availability across streams of different sizes and riparian shading. CO2
   was consistently over-saturated with respect to the atmosphere on all
   sampling dates and was 0.25-2.9 mg C L-1. Exports, sources, and
   metabolism of DOC and DIC showed strong predictable patterns across
   streamflow. Thus, we present a new conceptual model for predicting
   carbon transport and transformation across changing streamflow and light
   availability (with impacts on sources and fluxes of DOC, DIC, and CO2).
   Overall, our results and conceptual model suggest that urbanization
   accelerates the transition of streams from transporters to transformers
   of carbon across streamflow, with implications for timing and magnitude
   of CO2 fluxes, river alkalinization, and oxygen demand in downstream
   waters.},

Title = {Feasibility study for carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) in
   the Danish North Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An innovative addition to the conventional oil and gas extraction by
   introducing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques in the Danish North
   Sea is something which has been sought for long time. Combining the
   offshore EOR technology with the carbon capture and storage (CCS) is
   considered to be a possibly attractive solution as the associated
   benefit is twofold: (1) increased oil recovery through miscible
   displacement via CO2 pushing the hydrocarbons out of the reservoir and
   (2) the disposal of a greenhouse gas such as the CO2. A feasibility
   study for implementing a carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCUS)
   project is presented in the scope of this study, in a North Sea Chalk
   Field which is the oldest and one of the largest oilfields in the Danish
   sector, both for the technical and the economic merit, by means of using
   a commercial reservoir simulation package. The capital (CAPEX) and
   operational (OPEX) expenditures associated with such a long term
   development project is estimated. Results suggest that around 100
   million barrels of additional oil reserves can be unlocked via CO2
   injection, while 40 million tones of CO2 is being trapped in the
   reservoir.},

Title = {Identifying the interacting roles of stressors in driving the global

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Identifying the type and strength of interactions between local
   anthropogenic and other stressors can help to set achievable management
   targets for degraded marine ecosystems and support their resilience by
   identifying local actions. We undertook a meta-analysis, using data from
   118 studies to test the hypothesis that ongoing global declines in the
   dominant habitat along temperate rocky coastlines, forests of
   canopy-forming algae and/or their replacement by mat-forming algae are
   driven by the nonadditive interactions between local anthropogenic
   stressors that can be addressed through management actions (fishing,
   heavy metal pollution, nutrient enrichment and high sediment loads) and
   other stressors (presence of competitors or grazers, removal of canopy
   algae, limiting or excessive light, low or high salinity, increasing
   temperature, high wave exposure and high UV or CO2), not as easily
   amenable to management actions. In general, the cumulative effects of
   local anthropogenic and other stressors had negative effects on the
   growth and survival of canopy-forming algae. Conversely, the growth or
   survival of mat-forming algae was either unaffected or significantly
   enhanced by the same pairs of stressors. Contrary to our predictions,
   the majority of interactions between stressors were additive. There were
   however synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment and heavy
   metals, the presence of competitors, low light and increasing
   temperature, leading to amplified negative effects on canopy-forming
   algae. There were also synergistic interactions between nutrient
   enrichment and increasing CO2 and temperature leading to amplified
   positive effects on mat-forming algae. Our review of the current
   literature shows that management of nutrient levels, rather than
   fishing, heavy metal pollution or high sediment loads, would provide the
   greatest opportunity for preventing the shift from canopy to mat-forming
   algae, particularly in enclosed bays or estuaries because of the higher
   prevalence of synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment with
   other local and global stressors, and as such it should be prioritized.},

Title = {The cost of reducing CO2 emissions - Methodological approach,
   illustrated by the Danish energy plan},
Journal = {BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4-5},
Pages = {325-331},
Abstract = {Within the last years development of greenhouse gas reduction strategies
   has become a vital part of both international and national planning.
   When developing energy and environmental strategies it is highly
   relevant to gain an insight into how to prioritise among various
   technology options available. One of the tools available for this
   purpose is the construction of cost-reduction curves, relating the
   marginal cost of CO2 reduction and the quantity of the reduced emission
   to specific technology options. This paper outlines different approaches
   for establishing cost-reduction curves for CO2 emissions, and a case
   based on the Danish Energy21-plan is analysed illustrating one of these
   approaches. The analysis is carried out from the broad perspective of
   the overall energy system, but with the main emphasis on renewable
   energy technologies, especially the use of wind energy and biomass in
   the Danish system;
   The paper concludes that the construction of reduction cost curves is
   helpful in two ways: (1) to decompose existing energy strategies
   (scenarios) into individual reduction options and (2) to compare new
   options with an existing strategy. In both cases the reduction cost
   curve highlights those technological options that have the highest
   reduction potential and the lowest marginal costs, and vice versa. Based
   on the case of the Danish energy plan, the results of the analyses show
   that a number of reduction options with significant reduction potentials
   are available at relatively low marginal costs.
   Among others can be mentioned increased use of combined heat and power
   (CHP), substituting conventional coal-fired CHP plants with biomass ones
   and the development of offshore wind turbines: (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially carbon dioxide
   (CO2), caused global warming. Therefore, mitigation of CO2 emissions is
   needed by utilizing seagrass potential as carbon storage in biomass.
   This study aims to determine the carbon storage of above and below
   ground seagrass in Pokemon Beach in August 2020. The research method
   used a survey method and descriptive explorative. Samples were taken
   from 3 stations with line and quadrant transects using the purposive
   sampling method. Measurement of water quality parameters was performed
   in-situ. Analysis of seagrass carbon storage was measured using the loss
   on ignition (LOI) method. The results showed that there are 4 different
   types of seagrass: Enhalus acoroides, Thalasssia hemprichii, Cymodocea
   rotundata, and Halophila ovalis, with T. hemprichii dominating. The
   total density was 295.62 ind/m(2), with a 21.29\% coverage rate. The
   overall biomass was 74.42 g/m(2), with the above ground biomass of 35.80
   g/m(2) and the below ground at 38.62 g/m(2). Carbon storage amounted to
   0.23 tons C/ha, consisting of above ground 0.10 tons C/ha and below
   ground of 0.13 tons C/ha. The total carbon stock reached 1.13 tons C in
   the seagrass area of 4903 ha, with an above ground carbon stock of 0.51
   tons C and below ground of 0.62 tons C. In general, the below ground
   seagrass in Pokemon Beach was the largest, storing more carbon.},

Title = {Integrating Collaboration, Adaptive Management, and Scenario-Planning:
   Experiences at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {There is growing recognition that public lands cannot be managed as
   islands; rather, land management must address the ecological, social,
   and temporal complexity that often spans jurisdictions and traditional
   planning horizons. Collaborative decision making and adaptive management
   (CAM) have been promoted as methods to reconcile competing societal
   demands and respond to complex ecosystem dynamics. We detail the
   experiences of land managers and stakeholders in using CAM at Las
   Cienegas National Conservation Area (LCNCA), a highly valued site under
   the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The CAM process
   at Las Cienegas is marked by strong stakeholder engagement, with four
   core elements: (1) shared watershed goals with measurable resource
   objectives; (2) relevant and reliable scientific information; (3)
   mechanisms to incorporate new information into decision making; and (4)
   shared learning to improve both the process and management actions. The
   combination of stakeholder engagement and adaptive management has led to
   agreement on contentious issues, more innovative solutions, and more
   effective land management. However, the region is now experiencing rapid
   changes outside managers' control, including climate change, human
   population growth, and reduced federal budgets, with large but
   unpredictable impacts on natural resources. Although the CAM experience
   provides a strong foundation for making the difficult and contentious
   management decisions that such changes are likely to require, neither
   collaboration nor adaptive management provides a sufficient structure
   for addressing the externalities that drive uncontrollable and
   unpredictable change. As a result, LCNCA is exploring two specific
   modifications to CAM that may better address emerging challenges,
   including: (1) creating nested resource objectives to distinguish
   between those objectives that may be crucial to maintaining ecological
   resilience from those that may hinder a flexible response to climate
   change, and (2) incorporating scenario planning into CAM to explore how
   climate change may interact with other drivers and alter options for the
   future, to identify robust management actions, and to prioritize
   ecological monitoring efforts. The experiences at LCNCA demonstrate how
   collaboration and adaptive management can be used to improve social and
   environmental outcomes and, with modifications, may help address the
   full range of complexity and change that threatens to overwhelm even the
   best efforts to sustain public lands.},

Volume = {77},

Pages = {67-88},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Changes in climatic conditions, together with urban population growth,
   are making the development of tools to help disaster planners and policy
   makers select mitigation and adaptation measures a priority. The Coastal
   Cities at Risk (CCaR) project is a multidisciplinary team project
   involving four large coastal cities: Manila (The Philippines), Bangkok
   (Thailand), Lagos (Nigeria) and Vancouver (Canada). One of the project
   objectives includes development of a system dynamics simulation model to
   assess the resilience of the participating cities to climate change
   caused by sea level rise and riverine flooding. The resilience model is
   designed to integrate physical, economic, health, social and
   organizational impacts of climate change. This paper presents the
   methodology for providing spatial and temporal information on climate
   change health impacts for use in the resilience simulator. Basic
   population data, disease burden and physical conditions are integrated
   in the development of a composite health impact map. The output of this
   mapping exercise provides a more fully integrated view of population
   health to allow for the development of more targeted adaptive and risk
   reduction strategies at a local level for the City of Metro Vancouver.
   This methodology has been applied using data for 3 years, 2001, 2006 and
   2011 in order to give a dynamic simulation of health impacts using the
   resilience simulator. The final maps indicate that the Richmond and
   Delta regions of Metro Vancouver are more vulnerable to climate change
   caused by sea level rise and flooding compared to other municipalities.
   The paper demonstrates how composite health impact maps can be used both
   as an input for resilience modeling, as well as a ``stand-alone{''}
   product for the assessment and development of mitigation and adaptive
   strategies for coastal cities.},

   as the difficult geographical and cost accessibility, improving their
   modest technical capabilities and making the full system ecofriendly.
   Besides, their application to power off-grid ``structures and
   facilities{''} requiring a large amount of energy (>50 kW) such as
   heavyweight carriers (e.g. boats and trucks) and for instance those
   located far away from the main grid such as small-size islands and
   mines, will have an immediate impact on the decrease of greenhouse gas
   emissions to the atmosphere. Herein we present an overview of recent
   efforts to develop green and advanced electrode and electrolyte
   materials for future sustainable batteries. Further, we will also
   highlight both current second-life and end-of-life battery disposal
   sustainable strategies that are applied towards a zero-carbon future.},

Abstract = {Increasing trends in global warming already evident, the likelihood of
   further rise continuing, and their impacts give urgency to addressing
   carbon sequestration technologies more coherently and effectively.
   Carbon dioxide (CO2) is responsible for over half the warming potential
   of all greenhouse gases (GHG), due to the dependence of world economies
   on fossil fuels. The processes involving CO2 capture and storage (CCS)
   are gaining attention as an alternative for reducing CO2 concentration
   in the ambient air. However, these technologies are considered as
   short-term solutions, as there are still concerns about the
   environmental sustainability of these processes. A promising technology
   could be the biological capture of CO2 using microalgae due to its
   unmatched advantages over higher plants and ocean fertilization.
   Microalgae are phototrophic microorganisms with simple nutritional
   requirements, and comprising the major primary producers on this planet.
   Specific pathways include autotrophic production via both open pond or
   closed photobioreactor (PBR) systems. Photosynthetic efficiency of
   microalgae ranged from 10-20 \% in comparison with 1-2 \% of most
   terrestrial plants. Some algal species, during their exponential growth,
   can double their biomass in periods as short as 3.5 hours. Moreover,
   advantage of being tolerant of high concentration of CO2 (flue gas), low
   light intensity requirements, environmentally sustainable, and
   co-producing added value products put these as the favoured organisms.
   Advantages of microalgae in comparison with other sequestration
   methodologies are discussed, which includes the cultivation systems, the
   key process parameters, wastewater treatment, harvesting and the novel
   bio-products produced by microalgal biomass.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {Aerosols are one of the key factors influencing the hydrological cycle
   and radiation balance of the climate system. Although most aerosols
   deposit near their sources, the induced cooling effect is on a global
   scale and can influence the tropical atmosphere through slow processes,
   such as air-sea interactions. This study analyzes several simulations of
   fully coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models under the influence of
   anthropogenic aerosols, with the concentrations of greenhouse gases kept
   constant. In the cooling simulations, precipitation is reduced in deep
   convective areas but increased around the edges of convective areas,
   which is opposite to the ``rich-get-richer{''} phenomenon in global
   warming scenarios in the first-order approximation. Tropical convection
   is intensified with a shallower depth, and tropical circulations are
   enhanced. The anomalous gross moist stability (M `) mechanism and the
   upped-ante mechanism can be used to explain the dynamic and
   thermodynamic processes in the changes in tropical precipitation and
   convection. There is a northward cross-equatorial energy transport due
   to the cooler Northern Hemisphere in most of the simulations, together
   with the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)
   and the enhancement of the Hadley circulation. The enhancement of the
   Hadley circulation is more consistent between models than the changes of
   the Walker circulation. The change in the Hadley circulation is not as
   negligible as in the warming cases in previous studies, which supports
   the consistency of the ITCZ shift in cooling simulations.},

   show that aquaculture, which has substantial economic value, will
   suffer, and they highlight the need for management policies to mitigate
   the adverse effects of climate change. Extrapolation of these

Abstract = {Wind energy offers significant potential for greenhouse gas emissions
   reductions. Most applications have been developed onshore but the
   planning and siting conflicts with other land uses have created
   considerable interest and motivated research to offshore wind energy
   establishments.
   In this paper, a systematic methodology in order to investigate the most
   efficient areas of offshore wind farms' siting in Greece is performed,
   integrating multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) tools.
   In the first level of analysis, all coastal areas that don't fulfill a
   certain set of criteria (wind velocity, protected areas, water depth)
   are identified with the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
   and excluded from further analysis. The Analytical Hierarchy Process is
   performed in the evaluation phase and pairwise comparisons provide the
   most appropriate sites to locate offshore wind farms. Information
   concerning evaluation criteria (average wind velocity, distance to
   protected areas, distance to ship routes, distance to the shore and
   distance of possible connection to the existing electricity network) is
   retrieved through GIS, eliminating the subjectivity in judgments. The
   whole methodology contributes to the portrait of the geographic analysis
   and stands as the last image of the space characteristics suitable for
   offshore wind farms.},

Abstract = {Our planet has a natural ecosystem comprised of living organisms and
   methane hydrates in deep marine environments. This ecosystem was
   constructed in the present work to examine the influence that subtle
   temperature fluctuations could have on the dynamic stability of the
   hydrate deposits. The coupled mass and energy balance equations that
   describe the microbial bioreactions, their consumption by feather duster
   worms, and methane hydrate dissociation confirm that the bioreaction
   kinetics is dominated by endothermic methanogenic metabolism that
   stabilizes methane hydrates with a fragile tolerance to 0.001 K
   temperature increases. The feather duster worms also stabilize the
   hydrates via their selective consumption of methanotrophs that could
   otherwise overtake the system by their exothermic metabolism. Critical
   ocean temperature limits exist, beyond which hydrate dissociations would
   cause underwater eruptions of methane into the sea. Historical ocean
   temperature records and gas hydrate inventory estimates combined with
   our model suggest that hydrate deposits as deep as 560 m below sea level
   could already be at risk, whereas the methane hydrate stability zone
   will retreat deeper as the ocean temperature rises. Slowing its retreat
   could avoid the massive release of greenhouse gas.},

Title = {Comparison of the Economic Performances of Three Sulphur Oxides
   Emissions Abatement Solutions for a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ship-source air pollutants, especially sulphur oxides (SOx), have a
   major impact on human health, the marine environment and the natural
   resources. Therefore, control of SOx emissions has become a main concern
   in the maritime industry. The International Maritime Organization (IMO)
   has set a global limit on sulphur content of 0.50\% m/m (mass by mass)
   in marine fuels which has entered into effect on 1 January 2020.To
   comply with the sulphur limits, ship owners are facing the need to
   select suitable abatement solutions. The choice of a suitable solution
   is a compromise among many issues, but the economic performance offers
   the basis for which ones are attractive to ship owners. Currently, there
   are three technologically feasible SOx abatement solutions that could be
   used by ships, namely, liquified natural gas (LNG) as a fuel (Solution
   A), scrubbers (Solution B) and low-sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) (Solution C).
   To compare the economic performances of the mentioned three solutions
   for a newbuilding very large crude carrier (VLCC), this paper proposes a
   voyage expenses-based method (VEM). It was found that, within the
   initial target payback period of 6 years, Solution A and C are more
   expensive than Solution B, while Solution C is more competitive than
   Solution A. Five scenarios of target payback years were assumed to
   compare the trends of the three proposed solutions. The results show
   that Solution B maintains its comparative advantage. As the assumed
   target payback years becomes longer, the economy of Solution A gradually
   improves and the economics of Solution B and C gradually decline. A
   comparison between Solution A and C shows 6.5 years is a turning point.
   The advantage of Solution A is prominent after this payback period. In
   addition, the performance of a certain solution in terms of adaptability
   to the IMO greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations is also a factor
   that ship owner need to consider when making decisions. In conclusion,
   when the IMO air pollutant regulations and GHG regulations are
   considered simultaneously, the advantages of using LNG are obvious.},

Abstract = {In the context of the need to significantly reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions from personal transportation, a new process for the production
   of e-methanol is presented. It is a CO2 hydrogenation process, powered
   mainly by renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic electricity,
   with direct capture of carbon dioxide from the ambient air. With the
   main objective of estimating the feasibility and the impact of such a
   large-scale plant, the various components are evaluated in terms of
   masses and quantities necessary for an annual fuel production of 500,000
   tons. The main reactor is analyzed to assess the required quantities of
   hydrogen and CO2. The production of hydrogen from the electrolysis of
   water is estimated, as well as the electrical power required and
   supplied by a large photovoltaic plant. The size of a realistic plant
   and its footprint are estimated. In addition, the mass of seawater to be
   desalinized and split in the electrolyser is calculated. The CO2 capture
   system is evaluated in the form of the mass of air to be extracted from
   the ambient air. The parameters of the system and its subcomponents are
   summarized for ease of understanding of the significance and size of the
   processing plant.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {169},
Number = {2},
Pages = {139-166},
Abstract = {Gastropods from wave-exposed shores are typically smaller and
   thinner-shelled with a larger foot than gastropods from protected
   shores. We investigated the value of these adaptations by comparing the
   survival and growth of one exposed shore species and one protected shore
   species of Littorina transplanted to wave-exposed and protected shores.
   Adult snails on exposed shores with heavy surf had reduced winter growth
   rates and low over-winter survival rates. Demographic studies of the
   exposed shore species showed that few adults survived the winter at the
   most exposed sites; recruitment to the following year's population was
   primarily from small juveniles that overwintered between barnacles and
   within algae. The protected shore species had slightly lower survival
   than the exposed shore species on exposed shores. The protected shore
   species was also more susceptible to dislodgement in a flow tank. The
   low winter growth rates and survival may explain why the large,
   late-maturing, protected shore species does not occur on exposed shores.
   Adult snails on protected shores had moderate winter growth rates and
   moderate over-winter survival. The exposed shore species survived very
   poorly on protected shores, in part because of predation by shore crabs.
   In laboratory experiments the thin-shelled exposed shore species was
   significantly preferred by shore crabs and withstood significantly less
   force. The small size, thin shell, and large shell aperture of the
   exposed shore species makes it vulnerable to the shore crabs and may
   explain why it does not occur on protected shores.},

Abstract = {In coastal regions of the U.S. maritime transportation system,
   compelling reasons exist for implementing measures for climate change
   adaptation. As the effects of climate change amplify the impacts of
   natural hazards, a critical aspect of the nation's overall resiliency
   includes the ability of the maritime and coastal sectors to recover
   effectively from external shocks and to adapt to changing environmental
   conditions in order to continue to provide the services the nation
   relies upon for economic viability and homeland security. This requires
   adaptation for physical infrastructure as well as organizational,
   operational, and community elements throughout the maritime
   transportation system. This paper provides a literature review of port
   climate adaptation approaches, which highlights the established need and
   opportunities for collaboration among coastal stakeholders to implement
   climate adaptation in port communities. The current lack of federal
   support in the United States for climate adaptation in the maritime
   sector emphasizes the need for novel methods and approaches to
   facilitate adaptation at individual port and regional levels. A case
   study from the port community of Hampton Roads, Virginia provides an
   example of the time and effort dedicated to stakeholder collaboration to
   encourage local understanding of climate risks in order to facilitate
   successful adaptation.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Because of the complexity and speed of environmental, climatic, and
   socio-political change in coastal marine social-ecological systems,
   there is significant academic and applied interest in assessing and
   fostering the adaptive capacity of coastal communities. Adaptive
   capacity refers to the latent ability of a system to respond proactively
   and positively to stressors or opportunities. A variety of qualitative,
   quantitative, and participatory approaches have been developed and
   applied to understand and assess adaptive capacity, each with different
   benefits, drawbacks, insights, and implications. Drawing on case studies
   of coastal communities from around the globe, we describe and compare 11
   approaches that are often used to study adaptive capacity of social and
   ecological systems in the face of social, environmental, and climatic
   change. We synthesize lessons from a series of case studies to present
   important considerations to frame research and to choose an assessment
   approach, key challenges to analyze adaptive capacity in linked
   social-ecological systems, and good practices to link results to action
   to foster adaptive capacity. We suggest that more attention be given to
   integrated social-ecological assessments and that greater effort be
   placed on evaluation and monitoring of adaptive capacity over time and
   across scales. Overall, although sustainability science holds a promise
   of providing solutions to real world problems, we found that too few
   assessments seem to lead to tangible outcomes or actions to foster
   adaptive capacity in social-ecological systems.},

   Change Abatement Policies},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2010},
Number = {2163},
Pages = {65-72},
Abstract = {Although the connection between the storms along the coast of the Gulf
   of Mexico in 2005 and global climate change is still being debated, the
   fact that low-income communities are more likely to bear the greatest
   burden and are more vulnerable to potential future climate change and
   rising sea levels is widely acknowledged. Adding to this problem,
   greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming are income
   dependent: people with the highest incomes, both globally and within
   specific communities, tend to pollute more than those with the lowest
   incomes. A policy dilemma thus arises when abatement strategies involve
   regressive financing or when the benefits of such strategies are
   concentrated within higher-income groups. Low-income communities are in
   effect subsidizing the pollution abatement of higher-income communities.
   This paper reviews a range of evidence showing the unequal
   vulnerabilities, responsibilities, benefits, and costs from climate
   change and climate change policies. A framework for the evaluation of
   climate change mitigation strategies in the transportation sector is
   then proposed. This framework incorporates these equity issues along
   with other traditional measures of policy effectiveness. Exactly how
   these various inequities are incorporated and valued is highly case
   specific and is proposed as the subject of future research.},

Volume = {2672},

Abstract = {Climate change puts at risk all current and future transport projects.
   Investing proactively in climate adaptation of transport infrastructure
   is paramount to providing resilience and sustainable transport systems
   that may promote social and economic growth. Despite the importance of
   such investments, the financial resources of many road administrations
   are constrained, creating an urgent need to allocate these resources
   efficiently to capture the highest social, environmental, and economic
   benefits. This paper aims to tackle this issue by presenting a
   methodology to prioritize climate change adaptation interventions based
   on a set of economic, social, and risk reduction criteria. This method
   uses a network-wide approach to the road system in order to capture
   co-benefits, redundancies, and costs of disruption of road segments due
   to flood events. All underlying data in each of the criteria is part of
   a geospatial database that includes the location of agriculture, fishery
   production areas, high poverty, and flood maps. The methodology was
   developed at the request of the World Bank Africa Team to support the
   Government of Mozambique to prioritize climate change adaptation
   intervention in two central provinces, Zambezia and Nampula. After
   combining criteria for agriculture, fishery, poverty, network
   criticality, and hazard risk, the results suggest that most roads in the
   coastal districts of these provinces could be identified as top priority
   for climate change adaptation interventions.},

Abstract = {Peat growth in temperate peat-forming wetlands is believed to have been
   one of the major climate regulation mechanisms throughout the late
   Phanerozoic era. Since plant life first evolved on land, peat-forming
   wetlands have been significant terrestrial carbon sinks, which could
   well explain the variations in atmospheric composition observed in
   sediment and glacier cores, etc. The results of this process are hard
   coal, lignite and peat, which have all been formed under the same
   conditions. Feat growth and decay is believed to be responsible for the
   more or less regular shifts between glacials and interglacials during
   the late Cenozoic, offering an alternative to the Milankovitch theory.
   Glaciations are also believed to transform landscapes into types
   suitable for peatland initiation and, hence, form a system of feedback
   mechanisms. Our model shows that in a future perspective, under natural
   conditions without anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases, e.g.
   carbon dioxide, the initiation of a new ice age would have been expected
   in less than 1000 years; taking into account the regulating role of the
   oceans, With situations like the present, characterized by increasing
   concentrations of greenhouse gases, initiation would most probably be
   delayed in proportion to atmospheric concentrations. With the present
   levels of CO2 (c. 350 ppm) our model shows that the initiation of a new
   ice age could already have been delayed in the order of at least
   700-1000 years. In the worst scenario, with increasing CO2 emissions and
   no termination of anthropogenic CO2 release until 2500 A.D., for most
   cases in our model the initiation would be delayed in the order of at
   least 10 000 years.},

Abstract = {To be successful, conservation practitioners and resource managers must
   fully integrate the effects of climate change into all planning
   projects. Some conservation practitioners are beginning to develop,
   test, and implement new approaches that are designed to deal with
   climate change. We devised four basic tenets that are essential in
   climate-change adaptation for conservation: protect adequate and
   appropriate space, reduce nonclimate stresses, use adaptive management
   to implement and test climate-change adaptation strategies, and work to
   reduce the rate and extent of climate change to reduce overall risk. To
   illustrate how this approach applies in the real world, we explored case
   studies of coral reefs in the Florida Keys; mangrove forests in Fiji,
   Tanzania, and Cameroon; sea-level rise and sea turtles in the Caribbean;
   tigers in the Sundarbans of India; and national planning in Madagascar.
   Through implementation of these tenets conservation efforts in each of
   these regions can be made more robust in the face of climate change.
   Although these approaches require reconsidering some traditional
   approaches to conservation, this new paradigm is technologically,
   economically, and intellectually feasible.},

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {154},

Abstract = {Minimizing coastal wetland loss is a high priority in coastal areas
   worldwide. Typical shoreline protection consists of hard structures
   placed near areas affected by wave action. These commonly used
   protection methods are costly, and may have negative impacts on the
   surrounding areas. The Wave Suppression and Sediment Collection (WSSC)
   system, made of multiple Wave Robber units, is an alternative shoreline
   protection structure. The primary goal of this study is to determine the
   performance characteristics of the technology in terms of energy
   coefficients. Experiments were performed on three scaled units within a
   laboratory wave tank. Performance characterization showed that the units
   have wave energy reflections of 0.47-0.83, transmission ranging from
   0.10 to 0.42, and wave energy dissipation between 0.49 and 0.88,
   depending upon unit geometry and wave conditions. Performance data were
   also compared to other studies on shoreline protection structures. WSSC
   units reflect more wave energy and transmit less energy compared to
   other breakwater systems. These units could be utilized in coastal
   marshes with a large fetch, to reduce wave-induced erosion.},

   Services Across Tropical Seagrass and Temperate Tidal Marshes},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Total organic carbon (TOC) sediment stocks as a CO2 mitigation service
   require exclusion of allochthonous black (BC) and particulate inorganic
   carbon corrected for water-atmospheric equilibrium (PICeq). For the
   first time, we address this bias for a temperate salt marsh and a
   coastal tropical seagrass in BC hotspots that represent two different
   blue carbon ecosystems of Malaysia and Australia. Seagrass TOC stocks
   were similar to the salt marshes with soil depths < 1 m (59.3 +/- 11.3
   and 74.9 +/- 18.9 MgC ha(- 1), CI 95 \% respectively). Both ecosystems
   showed larger BC constraints than did their pristine counterparts.
   However, the seagrass meadows' mitigation services were largely
   constrained by both higher BC/TOC and PICeq/TOC fractions (38.0 \% +/-
   6.6 and 43.4 \% +/- 5.9 \%, CI 95 \%) and salt marshes around a third
   (22 \% +/- 10.2 and 6.0 \% +/- 3.1 \% CI 95 \%). The results provide
   useful data from underrepresented regions, and, reiterates the need to
   consider both BC and PIC for more reliable blue carbon mitigation
   assessments to ensure that greenhouse gas emitters do not exceed the
   ecosystems' capacity.},

Abstract = {As one of the main manifestations of global change, climate warming
   effect on global terrestrial carbon cycles, this effect has important
   guiding significance for the development of accurate understanding of
   the carbon cycle process and related policies, through a lot of research
   work, this paper based on the fuzzy evaluation method to illustrate the
   ecological impact of climate warming on land, in the next few years or
   even decades, the synergistic effect of other manifestations of climate
   warming and global change will be the next focus of the study, climate
   change and terrestrial ecosystem between the two-way feedback mechanism
   is the theoretical basis for more accurate study, the structure and
   function of ecosystem climate change is the premise to accurately
   understand and predict future climate scenarios.
   As one of the main manifestations of global change, climate warming has
   become an indisputable fact. It is current global average temperature is
   higher than the average temperature over the past few thousand years. At
   present, there is strong evidence that human activities lead to the
   continuous accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, so that
   the gradual rise in global temperatures. According to the forecast, the
   CO2 effect of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will cause the
   global average temperature to rise 0.2 degrees C every 10 years.
   According to the prediction, the global temperature will be a huge
   change hitherto unknown in the past 10000 years, resulting in the
   potential impact on the global environment such as climate warming, it
   can cause a series of environmental problems, such as flat and rising,
   precipitation distribution pattern change, and the direct and indirect
   impact on terrestrial ecosystems.
   The carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystem is the research focus of
   global change, which is closely related to global climate change.
   Climate warming will lead to changes in the global carbon cycle of
   terrestrial ecosystems, the original carbon balance has been destroyed,
   and causes a series of environmental problems, such as rising sea level,
   precipitation pattern changes, etc.. It should be said that the impact
   of climate warming on terrestrial ecosystems is the core issue in the
   study of global change.
   Climate warming has an impact on vegetation carbon pool and soil carbon
   pool by affecting NPP, it can change the yield and decomposition rate of
   litter.},

Abstract = {The Florida Tampa Electric Company's Manatee Viewing Center (MVC) and
   its fossil-fuelled Big Bend power plant are separated by a narrow ship
   channel that serves as state and federal sanctuary for threatened
   Florida Manatees. As humans have destroyed much of their warm spring
   habitat, many manatees are forced to rely on power plant hot water
   effluent to survive during cold winter months. Visitors' reactions to
   the MVC are every bit as incongruous as a massive greenhouse gas
   pollutant source enabling a wildlife reserve. Notwithstanding its
   inescapable presence, visitor reviews of the MVC nearly uniformly ignore
   the immense power plant. We offer this study of online reviews of the
   MVC to examine how and why everyday people's interactions are
   fundamental to making dominant practices of anthropogenic ecological
   destruction unremarkable and, therefore, unfixable. Specifically, we
   argue the collective blindness reflected in the findings of this study
   exemplifies a broader sociocultural tendency to articulate and reinforce
   spaces of ecological ``invisibility.{''} In such spaces, our quotidian
   practices and discourses play a central role in enabling collective
   environmental inattention and environmental inaction, especially when we
   are confronted with places in which the constructed binary between human
   and ``natural{''} realms spectacularly collapses.},

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, increasing awareness of the potential adverse
   impacts of traditional hardened coastal protection structures on coastal
   processes and nearshore habitats has prompted interest in the
   development of shoreline stabilization approaches that preserve
   intertidal habitats or at least minimize the destructive effects of
   traditional shoreline protection approaches. Although many terms are
   used to describe shoreline stabilization approaches that protect or
   enhance the natural shoreline habitat, these approaches are frequently
   referred to as living shorelines. A review of the literature on living
   shorelines is provided to determine which insights from locations where
   living shorelines have proved successful are applicable to the New
   England shorelines for mitigating shoreline erosion while maintaining
   coastal ecosystem services. The benefits of living shorelines in
   comparison with traditional hardened shoreline protection structures are
   discussed. Nonstructural and hybrid approaches (that is, approaches that
   include natural or manmade hard structures) to coastal protection are
   described, and the effectiveness of these approaches in response to
   waves, storms, and sea-level rise is evaluated.},

Title = {Using resilience assessments to inform the management and conservation
   of coral reef ecosystems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {277},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Climate change is causing the decline of coral reef ecosystems globally.
   Recent research highlights the importance of reducing CO2 emissions in
   combination with implementing local management actions to support reef
   health and recovery, particularly actions that protect sites which are
   more resilient to extreme events. Resilience assessments quantify the
   ecological, social, and environmental context of reefs through the lens
   of resilience, i.e., the capacity of a system to absorb or withstand
   stressors such that the system maintains its structure and functions and
   has the capacity to adapt to future disturbances and changes. Resilience
   assessments are an important tool to help marine managers and decision
   makers anticipate changes, identify areas with high survival prospects,
   and prioritize management actions to support resilience. While being
   widely implemented, however, there has not yet been an evaluation of
   whether resilience assessments have informed coral reef management.
   Here, we assess the primary and gray literature and input from coral
   reef managers to map where resilience assessments have been conducted.
   We explore if and how they have been used to inform management actions
   and provide recommendations for improving the likelihood that resilience
   assessments will result in management actions and positive conservation
   outcomes. These recommendations are applicable to other ecosystems in
   which resilience assessments are applied and will become increasingly
   important as climate impacts intensify and reduce the window of
   opportunity for protecting natural ecosystems.},

Title = {The Costs of Sea-Level Rise: Coastal Adaptation Investments vs. Inaction
   in Iberian Coastal Cities},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Iberian coastal cities are subject to significant risks in the next
   decades due to climate change-induced sea-level rise. These risks are
   quite uncertain depending on several factors. In this article, we
   estimate potential economic damage in 62 Iberian coastal cities from
   2020 to 2100 using regional relative sea-level rise data under three
   representative concentration pathways (RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6). We
   analyze the expected accumulated damage costs if no adaptation actions
   take place and compare this scenario to the investment cost of some
   adaptation strategies being implemented. The results show that some
   adaptation strategies are less costly than the potential damage under
   inaction. In other words, it is economically rational to invest in
   adaptation even in a context of high uncertainty. These calculations are
   very relevant to inform climate change adaptation decisions and to
   better manage the risk posed by sea-level rise. Moreover, our findings
   show the importance of a good understanding of the shape of the
   sea-level rise and damage cost distributions to calculate the expected
   damage. We show that using the 50th percentile for these calculations is
   not adequate as it leads to a serious underestimation of expected damage
   and coastal risk.},

Abstract = {Increasing of the greenhouse gases emission causes the climate changes.
   Therefore, usage of the marine renewable energy resources such as wind
   and wave energies has been increased during the last decades. Climate
   variability can change the wind and consequently wave patterns and the
   available energy amounts. Therefore, assessment of the potential effect
   of climate change on the wind regime is important. In this paper, wind
   characteristics obtained from a global climate model (CGCM 3.1) is used
   for assessing the effects of climate change on the wind regime in the
   Persian Gulf. CGCM 3.1 results were compared quantitatively with those
   of ECMWF in the Persian Gulf and the results showed that in comparison
   to ECMWF, CGCM 3.1 wind speeds are mostly underestimated for both
   average and maximum values. Dominant wind directions represented by two
   wind fields are nearly similar except for a point located in Strait of
   Hormuz. Variations of the annual wind speed in this area were also
   evaluated until 2100 and time series of annual averages of the wind
   speeds and statistical analysis indicate a decreasing trend in all
   points in the domain. Variation of wind speed frequency based on CGCM
   3.1 winds was also assessed for different intervals and the results
   showed that the variations of wind speed frequencies are marginal.
   Although there is a insignificant reduction in the average wind speed,
   this can lead to large variations in the wind and wave energies and also
   extreme values of wave characteristics.},

Abstract = {Ongoing coastal development and the prospect of severe climate change
   impacts present pressing estuary management and governance challenges.
   Robust approaches must recognise the intertwined social and ecological
   vulnerabilities of estuaries. Here, a new governance and management
   framework is proposed that recognises the integrated social-ecological
   systems of estuaries so as to permit transformative adaptation to
   climate change within these systems. The framework lists stakeholders
   and identifies estuarine uses and values. Goals are categorised that are
   specific to ecosystems, private property, public infrastructure, and
   human communities. Systematic adaptation management strategies are
   proposed with conceptual examples and associated governance approaches.
   Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate the practical
   application of these ideas. The framework will assist estuary managers
   worldwide to achieve their goals, minimise maladaptative responses,
   better identify competing interests, reduce stakeholder conflict and
   exploit opportunities for appropriate ecosystem restoration and
   sustainable development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Beaver ponds, a wetland type of increasing density in the northeastern
   United States, vary spatially and temporally, creating high uncertainty
   in their impact to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We used floating
   static gas chambers to assess diffusive fluxes of methane (CH4), carbon
   dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the air-water interface of
   three beaver ponds (0.05-8 ha) in Rhode Island from fall 2012 to summer
   2013. Gas flux was based on linear changes of gas concentrations in
   chambers over 1 h. Our results show that these beaver ponds generated
   considerable CH4 and CO2 emissions. Methane flux (18-556 mg m(-2) d(-1))
   showed no significant seasonal differences, but the shallowest pond
   generated significantly higher CH4 flux than the other ponds. Carbon
   dioxide flux (0.5-22.0 g m(-2) d(-1)) was not significantly different
   between sites, but it was significantly higher in the fall, possibly due
   to the degradation of fresh leaves. Nitrous oxide flux was low (0-2.4 mg
   m(-2) d(-1)). Overall, CH4 and CO2 comprised most of the global warming
   potential, 61 and 38\%, respectively. The shallowness of the beaver
   ponds may have limited the time needed for CH4 oxidation to CO2 before
   CH4 escaped to the atmosphere. Beaver dams also increase the aerial
   extent of hydric soils, which may transform riparian areas from upland
   GHG sinks to wetland GHG sources thereby changing the net global warming
   potential. Further studies tracking the pattern and conditions of beaver
   pond creation and abandonment will be essential to understanding their
   role as GHG sources.},

Title = {How would government subsidize the port on shore side electricity usage
   improvement?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Shore Side Electricity (SSE) is an effective means of energy that helps
   to reduce at-berth emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and atmospheric
   pollutants. However, due to the enormous initial investment and poor
   financial performance during daily operations, the usage of SSE faces
   certain dilemma. This paper focuses on the problem of government subsidy
   structure to ports. The aim of this research is to propose a framework
   of optimizing government subsidy structure to achieve the maximized
   subsidy efficiency of at-berth emission reduction per monetary unit. The
   problem is formulated as a mathematical model that 2 types of government
   subsidy to the port have been taken into consideration, that are the
   subsidy on SSE construction and subsidy on SSE operations. The port of
   Shanghai is selected for case study. Results show that the optimized
   government subsidy structure emerges when port's SSE supply capacity and
   ships' SSE demand meet an equilibrium, then the subsidy efficiency
   (g/USD) also could achieve the utmost level. It also indicates that in
   the beginning of SSE promotion, the government should subsidize more to
   the port on facility construction, then subsidize more on the SSE
   operations in later years for better usage of SSE and emission
   reduction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on identifying examples of first-order system
   interactions, which make important contributions to building coastal
   resilience for coastal zone management. This discussion is based on an
   application of the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework to a
   case-study analysis of coastal management in South Australia. The study
   suggests that cross-scale interactions and informal relationships within
   and between users and managers are key interactions defining resilience
   outcomes within the current system. A significant constraint on
   improving resilience was the lack of evaluative criteria for identifying
   sustainable forms of system behaviour. The paper argues that resilience
   is a function of a normative statement on the characteristics desirable
   in the functioning system. Analyses of coastal resilience, which
   facilitate greater understanding of the range of complexities in coastal
   behaviour, are therefore central to gaining the most useful insights
   into the options and pathways for building more sustainable coastal
   futures.},

   Global Warming Potential of Gases Emitted from a Small Shallow Lake},

Number = {12},

Abstract = {Increasing air temperatures may result in stronger lake stratification,
   potentially altering nutrient and biogenic gas cycling. We assessed the
   impact of climate forcing by comparing the influence of stratification
   on oxygen, nutrients, and global warming potential (GWP) of greenhouse
   gases (the sum of CH4, CO2, and N2O in CO2 equivalents) emitted from a
   shallow productive lake during an average versus a heat-wave year.
   Strong stratification during the heat wave was accompanied by an algal
   bloom and chemically enhanced carbon uptake. Solar energy trapped at the
   surface created a colder, isolated hypolimnion, resulting in lower
   ebullition and overall lower GWP during the hotter-than-average year.
   Furthermore, the dominant CH4 emission pathway shifted from ebullition
   to diffusion, with CH4 being produced at surprisingly high rates from
   sediments (1.2-4.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Accumulated gases trapped in the
   hypolimnion during the heat wave resulted in a peak efflux to the
   atmosphere during fall overturn when 70\% of total emissions were
   released, with littoral zones acting as a hot spot. The impact of
   climate warming on the GWP of shallow lakes is a more complex interplay
   of phytoplankton dynamics, emission pathways, thermal structure, and
   chemical conditions, as well as seasonal and spatial variability, than
   previously reported.},

Abstract = {Pakistan is home to a wide range of geographical landscapes, each of
   which faces different climate change impacts and challenges. This
   article presents findings from a National Geographic Society funded
   project, which employed a people-centered, narratives-based approach to
   study climate impacts and adaptation strategies of people in 19 rural
   study sites in four provinces of Pakistan (N = 108). The study looked at
   six climate-related stressors-changes in weather patterns, floods,
   Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, drought, heat waves, and sea-level rise-in
   the coastal areas of Sindh, the desert of Thar, the plains of Punjab,
   and the mountains of Hunza, Gilgit, and Chitral. Speaking to people at
   these frontlines of climate change revealed much about climate suffering
   and trauma. Not only is the suffering induced by losses and damages to
   property and livelihood, but climate impacts also take a heavy toll on
   people's psycho-social wellbeing, particularly when they are displaced
   from their homes. The findings further demonstrate that people try to
   adapt in various ways, for instance by altering their agricultural
   practices, but they face severe barriers to effective adaptation action.
   Understanding people's perceptions of climate change and incorporating
   their recommendations in adaptation planning can help policy-makers
   develop a more participatory, inclusive, and holistic climate resilience
   framework for the future.},

Title = {Tidal variation and litter decomposition co-affect carbon emissions in
   estuarine wetlands},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {839},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Estuarine wetlands play important roles in the regional and global
   carbon cycle as well as greenhouse gas emissions; however, the driving
   factors and potential carbon emissions mechanisms are unclear. Here, the
   carbon emission fluxes were investigated in situ from different
   vegetated areas in the Chongming wetlands. The results showed that the
   highest methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of 178.1 and
   21,482.5 mg.m(-2).min(-1) were in Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites
   australis dominated areas, respectively. A series of microcosms was
   strategically designed to simulate the influence of tidal variation on
   carbon emissions and the litter decomposition on daily- and
   monthlytimescales in estuarine wetlands. All added litter promoted CH4
   and CO2 emissions from the wetland soils. The CH4 and CO2 emission
   fluxes of the S. mariqueter treatment were higher (367.7 vs. 108.4;
   1607.9 vs. 1324.3 mg.m(-2).min(-1)) than those of the P. australis
   treatment without tidal variation on a monthly timescale, due to the
   higher total organic carbon (TOC) content of S. mariqueter. The
   decomposition of litter also released a large amount of nutrients, which
   enhanced the abundance of methane-producing archaea (MPA) and
   methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). However, the tidal water level was
   negatively correlated with CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes. The CH4 and CO2
   emission fluxes in the S. mariqueter treatment at the lowest tide were
   556.02 and 604.99 mg.m(-2).min(-1), respectively. However, the CH4 and
   CO2 emission fluxes did not change significantly on the daily timescale
   in the S. mariqueter treatment without tidal variations. Therefore, the
   prolonged timescales revealed increases in litter decomposition but a
   decrease in the contribution of tidal variations to carbon emissions in
   estuarine wetlands. These findings provide a theoretical basis for
   evaluating the carbon cycle in estuarine wetlands.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will disproportionately affect equatorial
   regions and closely adjacent areas, referred to here as the Fateful
   Ellipse. The vulnerability of these regions is exacerbated by a lack of
   capital for adaptive measures against the impacts of climate change. The
   increasing transference of capital from governmental control to private
   hands, and the increasing concentration of such capital into the hands
   of fewer individuals raises further concerns about capacity to mitigate
   or adapt to climate change. In addition, conflicts arise regarding the
   choice of climate change solutions. Ironically, the people of the
   Fateful Ellipse, who are most vulnerable to climate change, produce the
   lowest amount of carbon per capita. As a result of the colonial
   enterprise, including slavery, they also paid a heavy price toward the
   economic ascendency of Europe and North America and the Industrial
   Revolution that fueled the rise in greenhouse gas production. The
   discipline of geography itself owes some measure of its development and
   ascendency to colonialism and the exploitation of the Fateful Ellipse.
   As geographers we have the capacity, and a special responsibility, to
   contribute to the development of climate change solutions and global
   environmental justice.},

Title = {An adaptation of the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities
   (BRIC) for assessing resilience of Iranian provinces},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the recent decades, the frequency and intensity of natural disasters
   has increased. This trend is expected to continue in the future with
   climate change intensification. The main objectives of disaster risk
   management practices in all countries and communities are recognizing
   the mentioned patterns, building community resilience to reduce human
   and economic losses, and facilitating rapid recovery. Resilience
   assessment can inform these processes by, among other things,
   determining baseline performance and revealing priority intervention
   areas. This study aimed to assess the resilience of the provinces of
   Iran, as a country exposed to various types of disasters, based on the
   widely used Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities framework.
   The adapted framework included 35 indicators with five dimensions of
   social, economic, community capital, infrastructure and housing, and
   environment. For each of the 31 provinces, the overall and
   dimension-specific resilience scores were calculated. The results showed
   significant differences in community disaster resilience between the
   provinces. Overall, southern provinces that are close to the desert and
   characterized by hot and arid climates were relatively less resilient
   than other provinces. In contrast, northern provinces, especially those
   adjacent to the Caspian Sea had relatively higher resilience than
   others. Unexpectedly, we observed the low resilience of Tehran, the
   capital province, and its neighboring province, Alborz. Our results can
   inform planners and policymakers of the baseline performance of
   different provinces and facilitate evidence-based decision-making
   towards appropriate interventions and policies for enhancing resilience
   to climate change and other stressors. In addition to Iran, the results
   of this investigation provide useful insights for evolving resilience
   assessment frameworks in other developing countries.},

Abstract = {Emerging attention has been given to the use of biomass in local areas
   for its contribution to reducing fossil fuel dependence and mitigating

   method that quantitatively assesses the effects of local biomass
   projects on fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. A
   practical method based on a life cycle approach is proposed and applied
   to a case of bioethanol project in Miyako Islands of Japan. The project
   is aiming to produce bioethanol from molasses within the islands, and to
   replace the entire gasoline consumed in the islands to E3 fuel (i.e., a
   mixture of 3\% ethanol and 97\% gasoline by volume). The assessment
   using the developed method revealed that, first, the complete shift from
   gasoline to E3 fuel allows for decreases in fossil fuel consumption and
   GHG emission. Second, the performance of the project is improved by the
   integration of the ethanol plant and the sugar factory. Moreover, the
   assessment found that, in small-scale bioethanol projects, the
   contribution of capital goods to life cycle fuel consumption and GHG
   emission is not negligible.},

Title = {Equatorial refuge amid tropical warming},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Number = {7},
Pages = {530-534},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Upwelling across the tropical Pacific Ocean is projected to weaken in
   accordance with a reduction of the atmospheric overturning
   circulation(1), enhancing the increase in sea surface temperature
   relative to other regions in response to greenhouse-gas forcing. In the
   central Pacific, home to one of the largest marine protected areas and
   fishery regions in the global tropics, sea surface temperatures are
   projected to increase by 2.8 degrees C by the end of this century(2-4).
   Of critical concern is that marine protected areas may not provide
   refuge from the anticipated rate of large-scale warming, which could
   exceed the evolutionary capacity of coral and their symbionts to
   adapt(5). Combining high-resolution satellite measurements(6,7), an
   ensemble of global climate models(4) and an eddy-resolving regional
   ocean circulation model(8), we show that warming and productivity
   decline around select Pacific islands will be mitigated by enhanced
   upwelling associated with a strengthening of the equatorial
   undercurrent. Enhanced topographic upwelling will act as a negative
   feedback, locally mitigating the surface warming. At the Gilbert
   Islands, the rate of warming will be reduced by 0.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C or
   25 +/- 9\% per century, or an overall cooling effect comparable to the
   local anomaly for a typical El Nino, by the end of this century. As the
   equatorial undercurrent is dynamically constrained to the Equator, only
   a handful of coral reefs stand to benefit from this equatorial island
   effect. Nevertheless, those that do face a lower rate of warming,
   conferring a significant advantage over neighbouring reef systems. If
   realized, these predictions help to identify potential refuges for coral
   reef communities from anticipated climate changes of the twenty-first
   century.},

Title = {Climate Change Adaptation in a Mediterranean Semi-Arid Catchment:
   Testing Managed Aquifer Recharge and Increased Surface Reservoir
   Capacity},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Among different uses of freshwater, irrigation is the most impacting
   groundwater resource, leading to water table depletion and possible
   seawater intrusion. The unbalance between the availability of water
   resources and demand is currently exacerbated and could become worse in
   the near future in accordance with climate change observations and
   scenarios provided by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
   In this context, Increasing Maximum Capacity of the surface reservoir
   (IMC) and Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) are adaptation measures that
   have the potential to enhance water supply systems resiliency. In this
   paper, a multiple-users and multiple-resources-Water Supply System (WSS)
   model is implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of these two
   adaptation strategies in a context of overexploited groundwater under
   the RCP 4.5 and the RCP 8.5 IPCC scenarios. The presented a case study
   that is located in the Puglia, a semi-arid region of South Italy
   characterized by a conspicuous water demand for irrigation. We observed
   that, although no significant long-term trend affects the proposed
   precipitation scenarios, the expected temperature increase highly
   impacts the WSS resources due to the associated increase of water demand
   for irrigation purposes. Under the RCP 4.5 the MAR scenario results are
   more effective than the IMC during long term wet periods (typically 5
   years) and successfully compensates the impact on the groundwater
   resources. Differently, under RCP 8.5, due to more persistent dry
   periods, both adaptation scenarios fail and groundwater resource become
   exposed to massive sea water intrusion during the second half of the
   century. We conclude that the MAR scenario is a suitable adaptation
   strategy to face the expected future changes in climate, although
   mitigation actions to reduce green-house gases are strongly required.},

Title = {Determining Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Impacts of Hydrogen

Abstract = {Adoption of hydrogen infrastructure and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
   (HFCVs) to replace gasoline internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles
   has been proposed as a strategy to reduce criteria pollutant and
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector and
   transition to fuel independence. However, it is uncertain (1) to what
   degree the reduction in criteria pollutants will impact urban air
   quality, and (2) how the reductions in pollutant emissions and
   concomitant urban air quality impacts compare to ultralow emission
   gasoline-powered vehicles projected for a future year (e.g., 2060). To
   address these questions, the present study introduces a ``spatially and
   temporally resolved energy and environment tool{''} (STREET) to
   characterize the pollutant and GHG emissions associated with a
   comprehensive hydrogen supply infrastructure and HFCVs at a high level
   of geographic and temporal resolution. To demonstrate the utility of
   STREET, two spatially and temporally resolved scenarios for hydrogen
   infrastructure are evaluated in a prototypical urban airshed (the South
   Coast Air Basin of California) using geographic information systems
   (GIS) data. The well-to-wheels (WTW) GHG emissions are quantified and
   the air quality is established using a detailed atmospheric chemistry
   and transport model followed by a comparison to a future gasoline
   scenario comprised of advanced ICE vehicles. One hydrogen scenario
   includes more renewable primary energy sources for hydrogen generation
   and the other includes more fossil fuel sources. The two scenarios
   encompass a variety of hydrogen generation, distribution, and fueling
   strategies. GHG emissions reductions range from 61 to 68\% for both
   hydrogen scenarios in parallel with substantial improvements in urban
   air quality (e.g., reductions of 10 ppb in peak 8-h-averaged ozone and 6
   mu g/m(3) in 24-h-averaged particulate matter concentrations,
   particularly in regions of the airshed where concentrations are highest
   for the gasoline scenario).},

Abstract = {Global warming is confirmed to be the biggest issue over the course of
   this century. An increase of 1.4 degrees C to 5.8 degrees C in average
   global temperature has already led to some changes in atmospheric and
   oceanic circulation patterns, rising sea - level and bringing wide
   variations in precipitation. This greenhouse gas effect is predicted to
   he more enhanced in the 22nd century. It has been found that global
   warming has potentially shifted the weather depression centre to a more
   southeasterly position. Under the effect of Coriolis Force, this will
   produce more frequent occurrences of storm winds which will assist in
   the change of coastal morphology. The typical example is the coastal
   morphology change along the Moray Firth. The approximate annual
   transport rate of about 12, 124 m(3) in 1959 similar to 1966 to 12, 571
   m(3) in 1964 - 1971 shows an obviously increasing tendency. An assumed
   increase in storm event in the future by 30\% displays a corresponding
   increase in sediment transport as well to 16, 343 m(3). Therefore, to
   prevent future flooding and protect properly, coastal management and sea
   defences need to be carefully planned and put into practice. Natural
   coastal defences have been suggested that development of shingle beach
   itself would be a long - term and sustainable way for resisting coastal
   erosion and flooding.},

Title = {A Sequential Approach for Integrated Coal and Gas Mining of
   Closely-Spaced Outburst Coal Seams: Results from a Case Study Including
   Mine Safety Improvements and Greenhouse Gas Reductions},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Closely-spaced outburst coal seams (COCS) is the main condition of coal
   seams in southwest China, and gas disasters are one of the major
   problems affecting coal mine safety. Mining a protective seam and pre
   gas extraction are the most safety way to improve the efficiency of
   mining under these conditions. However, low pre-mining gas extraction
   efficiency coupled with the close proximity of adjacent working faces is
   a problem. When mining at an old working face has been completed but the
   new working face is not yet ready to be mined, coal-bed gasses can flow
   into the new working face from adjacent seams and this commonly causes
   methane monitoring instruments to sound an alarm. These gas extraction
   difficulties lead to a conflict between mine safety and profit. To solve
   these problems, a sequential approach for integrated coal and gas mining
   of closely-spaced outburst coal seams is introduced in this paper. Two
   fundamental principles are proposed: (1) Fully coordinating the
   spatiotemporal relationships between gas extraction, roadway
   development, and coal mining to maximize both mine safety and coal and
   gas production; (2) Defining a mining sequence for outburst coal seams
   and choosing the coal seam with the weakest outburst risk as the
   protective seam. A system for comprehensive gas extraction in
   underground coal mines is divided into four stages for gas extraction:
   gas extraction before coal roadway tunneling, gas extraction before coal
   mining, gas extraction during coal mining, and gas extraction from the
   goaf after coal mining. The Songzao mining area, China, is used as a
   case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this model, and it brings
   three major benefits: it improves underground coal mine safety with
   physical gas accidents decreased by 66.8\%, it makes underground
   coal-bed methane (CBM) extraction more efficient with the average gas
   extraction rate were respectively 45.13 m3/t and 62.4\%, the highest in
   China, and it reduces greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 3.5 million
   tonnes of carbon dioxide. This study could be used as a valuable example
   for other coal deposits being mined under similar geological conditions.},

Abstract = {All countries are addressing the drastic climate changes as high
   priority issues. The impact of climate change on coastal land use in
   Taiwan has been especially severe due to the country's long coastline.
   As such, developing strategies to promote the protection of coastal land
   is critical for the sustainable development of the land. At present,
   even though the central government has developed the relevant adaptation
   strategies and implementation plans in response to climate change. Due
   to the limited resources, determining which protection strategy should
   be implemented as a top priority will require a strategic evaluation for
   planning and reference purposes.
   While most of the existing literature on coastal land use has been
   focused on the establishment of a vulnerability index along with an
   analysis of adaptation strategies very little of the existing literature
   discusses research that has been conducted in relation to an in-depth
   analysis of climate change and coastal land use. Therefore, this study
   uses the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to conduct an exploration of
   coastal land use and protection strategy. The study compiled the
   literature and related data to establish five major assessment
   dimensions and 16 protection strategy evaluation indicators. After the
   empirical investigation and analysis, the findings demonstrated that the
   designation of coastal conservation areas is the most important aspect
   in terms of strategies to protect coastal land, followed by land
   subsidence control and the establishment of land disaster warning
   systems.},

   methods for ocean GHG observations, improving operational conformity as
   well as quality control and assurance of the data. This enables the
   network to focus on long term research into the marine carbon cycle and
   the anthropogenic carbon sink, while preparing the network to include
   other GHG fluxes. ICOS data are processed on a near real-time basis and
   will be published on the ICOS Carbon Portal (CP), allowing monthly
   estimates of CO2 air-sea exchange to be quantified for European waters.
   ICOS establishes transparent operational data management routines
   following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
   guiding principles allowing amongst others reproducibility,
   interoperability, and traceability. The ICOS-Oceans network is actively
   integrating with the atmospheric (e.g., improved atmospheric
   measurements onboard SOOP lines) and ecosystem (e.g., oceanic direct gas
   flux measurements) domains of ICOS, and utilizes techniques developed by
   the ICOS Central Facilities and the CP. There is a strong interaction
   with the international ocean carbon cycle community to enhance
   interoperability and harmonize data flow. The future vision of
   ICOS-Oceans includes ship-based ocean survey sections to obtain a
   three-dimensional understanding of marine carbon cycle processes and
   optimize the existing network design.},

Title = {Heatwaves in the Future Warmer Climate of South Africa},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Weather and climate extremes, such as heat waves (HWs), have become more
   frequent due to climate change, resulting in negative environmental and
   socioeconomic impacts in many regions of the world. The high
   vulnerability of South African society to the impacts of warm extreme
   temperatures makes the study of the effect of climate change on future
   HWs necessary across the country. We investigated the projected effect
   of climate change on future of South Africa with a focus on HWs using an
   ensemble of regional climate model downscalings obtained from the
   Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) for the periods 2010-2039,
   2040-2069, and 2070-2099, with 1983-2012 as the historical baseline.
   Simulations were performed under the Representative Concentration
   Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (moderate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration) and 8.5
   (high GHG concentration) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We found
   that the 30-year period average maximum temperatures may rise by up to 6
   degrees C across much of the interior of South Africa by 2070-2099 with
   respect to 1983-2012, under a high GHG concentration. Simulated HW
   thresholds for all ensemble members were similar and spatially
   consistent with observed HW thresholds. Under a high GHG concentration,
   short lasting HWs (average of 3-4 days) along the coastal areas are
   expected to increase in frequency in the future climate, however the
   coasts will continue to experience HWs of relatively shorter duration
   compared to the interior regions. HWs lasting for shorter duration are
   expected to be more frequent when compared to HWs of longer durations
   (over two weeks). The north-western part of South Africa is expected to
   have the most drastic increase in HWs occurrences across the country.
   Whilst the central interior is not projected to experience pronounced
   increases in HW frequency, HWs across this region are expected to last
   longer under future climate change. Consistent patterns of change are
   projected for HWs under moderate GHG concentrations, but the changes are
   smaller in amplitude. Increases in HW frequency and duration across
   South Africa may have significant impacts on human health, economic
   activities, and livelihoods in vulnerable communities.},

Title = {Beach-cast seagrass wrack contributes substantially to global greenhouse
   gas emissions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Pages = {329-335},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Seagrass ecosystems have received a great deal of attention recently for
   their ability to capture and store carbon, thereby helping to mitigate
   climate change. However, their carbon-sink capacity could be offset
   somewhat if exported plant material - which accounts for similar to 90\%
   of total leaf production - undergoes microbial breakdown and is emitted
   into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. Here we measured emissions (CO2
   and CH4) from the breakdown of exported seagrass plant material,
   focusing on beach-cast `wrack'. We tested two seagrass species; Zostera
   nigricaulis and Amphibolis antarctica, which have contrasting
   morphologies and chemistries. We found that both species of wrack were
   substantial sources of CO2, but not CH4, during the decomposition
   process. Biomass loss and the coinciding CO2 emissions occurred over the
   30-day experiment, and the pattern of CO2 emissions over this time
   followed a double exponential model (R-2 > 0.92). The initial flux rate
   was relatively high, most likely due to rapid leaching of labile
   compounds, then decreased substantially within the 2-9 days, and
   stabilizing at < 3 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) during the remaining decomposition
   period. Additionally, seagrass wrack cast high up on beaches that
   remained dry had 72\% lower emissions than wrack that was subjected to
   repeated wetting in the intertidal zone. This implies that relocation of
   seagrass wrack by coastal resource managers (e.g. from water's edge to
   drier dune areas) could help to reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions.
   Scaling up, we estimate the annual CO2-C flux from seagrass wrack
   globally is between 1.31 and 19.04 Tg C yr(-1), which is equivalent to
   annual emissions of 0.63-9.19 million Chinese citizens. With climate
   change and increasing coastal development expected to accelerate the
   rate of wrack accumulation on beaches, this study provides timely
   information for developing coastal carbon budgets.},

Title = {Understanding the Local Perception, Adaptation to Climate Change and
   Resilience Planning Among the Farmers of Semi-Arid Tracks of South India},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {291-308},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {People all around the world have come into a consensus on climate change
   that is a fact with an increasing number of unusual climate-related
   events and extremities. The present study is an attempt to explore the
   views of local farmers on climate change and uncertainty and evaluating
   their prevalent coping strategies in the Chengalpet district of Tamil
   Nadu, a semi-arid expanse of South India. In order to achieve this
   objective, Rapid Rural Appraisals (RRAs), Focal Group Discussions (FGDs)
   and In-Depth Surveys (IDS) were conducted. Through RRA, this research
   identifies farmers' perceptions of climate change and its impacts and
   highlights how farmers respond to it through adaptations and brings to
   light the adaptation needs and obstacles faced by the vulnerable coastal
   agro ecosystems of the state. The study indicated that majority of the
   farmers have observed climatic variability and change through rises in
   temperature, extended dry spells, rise in heat stress on crops, etc. The
   study explored that the farmers are practicing autonomous adaptation
   strategies like varying planting dates, adoption of heat resistant crops
   and varieties, switch from conventional paddy cultivation to other cash
   crops, agroforestry, etc. Farmers are cultivating tree species such as
   eucalyptus, teak wood, Casuarinafor multipurpose use planted along with
   various annual crops like cereals, banana, jasmine, cluster beans,
   maize, etc. This supports them to abate short term risks, sustain their
   livelihood and works as a long-term investment. The farmers are facing
   various social hurdles to adaptation options like lack of timely
   information regarding effective adaptation options from extension
   officers, lack of crop-weather insurances and micro-financing
   facilities, etc., apart from climate change risks. With regards to the
   sources of information regarding adaptation options, there is a strong
   need to enhance agriculture extension services in the remote areas. SWOT
   analysis revealed dwindling crop area for cultivation/natural resources,
   poor dissemination of weather/climate forecasts, reluctance of the young
   generation to take up farming as their living, etc., as some of the
   major threats. In order to prioritize the best and viable adaptation
   that suits, the research zone pairwise ranking method was used. This
   study recommends modification of farming practices, switching over to
   different crops and efficient water management as site-specific
   adaptation interventions as per pair-wise ranking of adaptations. These
   site specific strategies have to be implemented in the region to meet
   the challenges that lie ahead due to future climatic change and
   livelihood insecurity.},

   destinations to face climate risks. To this aim, 258 questionnaires were
   completed by tourists visiting Cyprus in the summer of 2019. Tourists
   were posed with hypothetical situations where several climate risks
   occur at the destination, and were asked to choose between alternative
   combinations of policies to counteract these impacts. Results indicate
   that the programs related to beach protection, heat waves amelioration,
   water supply and infectious diseases prevention are the most valued by
   tourists. The study provides recommendations aimed at being useful for
   all coastal destinations, highlighting the importance of climate-related
   preparedness and adaptive capacities to enhance the tourist experience
   value and promote economic impact.},

Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries' management is complex given its multigear,
   multispecies nature; despite this, fishing effort has usually been
   controlled by nominal units, ignoring changes in effective fishing
   effort. This study aimed to understand the adaptive strategies of
   small-scale fishers in San Felipe, Yucatan, Mexico through an analysis
   of their fishing operations. Minor changes in trip numbers among three
   seasons were observed, but increases in fishing time, depth and travel
   costs from one season to another at the operational level were found. It
   was also evident that high value species at the beginning of the season
   were gradually replaced by low-value finfish as the season progresses.
   The results provide insights for new adaptive management strategies
   according to fisher's adaptive responses. For instance, using boats or
   fishing trips as fishing effort units in Yucatan may not be the most
   appropriated unit for management, as fishers adapt their strategies at
   different levels.},

Title = {Can BECCS deliver sustainable and resource efficient negative emissions?},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {1389-1426},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Negative emissions technologies (NETs) in general and bioenergy with CO2
   capture and storage (BECCS) in particular are commonly regarded as vital
   yet controversial to meeting our climate goals. In this contribution we
   present a whole-systems analysis of the BECCS value chain associated
   with cultivation, harvesting, transport and conversion in dedicated
   biomass power stations in conjunction with CCS, of a range of biomass
   resources - both dedicated energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, short
   rotation coppice willow), and agricultural residues (wheat straw). We
   explicitly consider the implications of sourcing the biomass from
   different regions, climates and land types. The water, carbon and energy
   footprints of each value chain were calculated, and their impact on the
   overall system water, carbon and power efficiencies was evaluated. An
   extensive literature review was performed and a statistical analysis of
   the available data is presented. In order to describe the dynamic
   greenhouse gas balance of such a system, a yearly accounting of the
   emissions was performed over the lifetime of a BECCS facility, and the
   carbon ``breakeven time'' and lifetime net CO2 removal from the
   atmosphere were determined. The effects of direct and indirect land use
   change were included, and were found to be a key determinant of the
   viability of a BECCS project. Overall we conclude that, depending on the
   conditions of its deployment, BECCS could lead to both carbon positive
   and negative results. The total quantity of CO2 removed from the
   atmosphere over the project lifetime and the carbon breakeven time were
   observed to be highly case specific. This has profound implications for
   the policy frameworks required to incentivise and regulate the
   widespread deployment of BECCS technology. The results of a sensitivity
   analysis on the model combined with the investigation of alternate
   supply chain scenarios elucidated key levers to improve the
   sustainability of BECCS: (1) measuring and limiting the impacts of
   direct and indirect land use change, (2) using carbon neutral power and
   organic fertilizer, (3) minimising biomass transport, and prioritising
   sea over road transport, (4) maximising the use of carbon negative
   fuels, and (5) exploiting alternative biomass processing options, e.g.,
   natural drying or torrefaction. A key conclusion is that, regardless of
   the biomass and region studied, the sustainability of BECCS relies
   heavily on intelligent management of the supply chain.},

Abstract = {Power stations in marine locations cause multi-faceted impact on the
   environment, man and the economy. There are not many studies devoted to
   modeling energy benefits for CO2 emissions. The paper presents the
   issues of assessing the efficiency of offshore wind farms, defined as
   the ratio of benefits to life cycle inputs. The scientific goal was to
   develop a mathematical model for efficiency in the design, manufacture,
   use and management of offshore wind power. The papers practical purpose
   is the experimental designation of the impact of selected post-use
   management methods, time of use and maritime location, i.e. average
   annual productivity of wind power plants on the efficiency of energy
   benefits from greenhouse gas emissions. The mathematical model of the
   integrated cost-benefit ratio has been developed for energy use
   assessment, taking into account the benefits generated by electricity
   production and the life-cycle CO2 emissions based on the LCA analysis
   using the CML method. Mathematical model validation was performed by
   determining the value of the indicator for an existing 2 MW offshore
   wind farm and comparatively for fossil fuel production: lignite, stone,
   fuel oil and natural gas. Analytical and research work carried out
   showed that the higher the efficiency index, the higher the value of the
   indicator. It has been shown that the location of the power station at
   sea produces more favorable CO2 elimination rates, due to higher
   productivity compared to in-land wind power plants. A more favorable
   form of post-consumer management for CO2 has been determined as
   recycling. It was found that for electricity generated from offshore
   wind farms, the value of the energy efficiency benefit from CO2
   emissions is higher than for fossil fuel energy production.},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {50},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1586-1594},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide sequestration in a coal-bed is a profitable method to
   reduce the concentration of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and to
   recover by product methane from the coal seam. The important factor to
   be considered is the stability of the coal-bed with the increased carbon
   dioxide injection. It is crucial to avoid carbon dioxide escaping from
   the coal seam caused by structural deformation. Meanwhile, structural
   deformation also depends on such properties of the geological coal basin
   as fracture state and phase equilibrium, especially the porosity,
   permeability and saturation of the coal seam. In this study, a
   structural deformation effect was simulated with the purpose of
   predicting carbon dioxide storage in the environment of a typical
   unmineable coal seam. As an example, Appalachian Basin is considered in
   the deformation analysis of carbon dioxide sequestration based on the
   variable saturation model. Moreover, the comparison between simulations
   with and without the account of structural deformation is given. The
   results indicate that modeling of structural deformation in carbon
   sequestration is feasible by directly coupling structure terms to a
   variable saturated model. Moreover, introducing structural deformation
   effects into carbon sequestration modeling is important because it
   affects the fluid flow and leads to a faster drop of the resulting
   capillary pressure and relative permeability of the gas phase. This
   faster drop directly results in the diminished carbon dioxide storage
   capacity in a coal-bed basin. In addition, structural deformation
   modeling in carbon sequestration simulations can provide important
   insights into how to avoid carbon leakage and seepage by monitoring the
   effective stress and displacement of coal-bed basin during carbon
   dioxide injection. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   emissions in the European Union (EU) but bioenergy in the United States
   (US) is currently limited. As a result, biomass is increasingly exported
   from the US to the EU, but changes to the policy landscape are poised to
   alter this. This study utilizes Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess
   impacts of biomass transportation on bioenergy life cycle GHG emissions.
   Transportation modes considered include truck, train and sea freight and
   each are assessed at realistic distances expected in bioenergy supply
   chains. Emissions for biomass firing alone and co-firing with coal using
   wood chips and pellets are compared to a baseline coal-fired power
   plant. Results include life cycle emissions for each case, and
   sensitivity analysis is presented for variation in power plant
   efficiency and biomass heating value. A generalized model for estimation
   of bioenergy emissions is presented. In nearly all cases, biomass
   utilization for electricity production produces lower life cycle GHG
   emissions compared to the coal baseline, with emission reductions as
   high as 76\%. Utilization in the US and EU have similar overall
   emissions at long US distances. Policy implications are discussed in the
   context of current US and EU policies.},

Abstract = {In recent years, global concerns about greenhouse gas emissions have
   stimulated considerable interest in CO2 storage as a potential
   ``bridging technology{''}, which could reduce significantly CO2
   emissions, while allowing fossil fuels to be used until alternative
   energy sources are more widely deployed. Flow modeling is a relevant
   step in the characterization of a CO2 storage site, to provide
   quantitative predictions of reservoir behavior and assessing the
   uncertainty {[}1].
   The scope of this work is to analyze the impact of CO2 injection in
   Pliocene offshore water-bearing sands potentially suitable for CO2
   storage, through the implementation of an integrated reservoir study.
   The approach undertaken was first to build several geological models
   (local and regional), stochastically populate them with petrophysical
   properties and, through the gathering and generation of representative
   dynamic data, develop a dynamic model to simulate a set of possible CO2
   injection scenarios. Furthermore a base case scenario was identified to
   perform a comparison between two different simulators: COORES (TM), a
   code designed by IFPEN, and ECLIPSE300 - CO2STORE (TM), the Schlumberger
   compositional tool designed specifically for CO2 storage in saline
   aquifers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under

Title = {Effects of the surface albedo on short-wave infrared detection of
   atmospheric CO2},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {The greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, for which short-wave infrared remote
   sensing detection is carried out by using satellite sensors to measure
   the Earth's atmosphere scattering solar radiation, and makes use of the
   inversion algorithm to achieve measurements. Most of the solar radiation
   enter the satellite sensors after surface reflection, so the surface
   albedo which reflects the surface features is one of the important
   parameters which affect the accuracy of the detection. Aiming at the
   great demands of high precision carbon dioxide for greenhouse gas, this
   study first investigate the effects of the Earth's surface albedo on the
   observed spectra. Simulation results show that the increase in the
   surface albedo will enhance the observed spectral intensity, especially
   larger in the O-2-A band than in the 1.6 mu m band. In other words, the
   surface albedo has a greater impact on O-2-A ban. In the actual
   satellite inversio, the surface types of actual observation pointare
   uncertain, which will result in the error of surface albedo. Effect of
   surface albedo on the inverted XCO2 is analyzed when the surface albedo
   is changed by changing the type of surfac. Two observation cases are
   analyzed in detail. One is on April 23, 2009 for the desert surface, and
   another on May 21, 2013 for the grass surfac. Results show that when the
   O-2-A band surface albedo approximates to the real surface albedo valu,
   the relative error of the inverted XCO2 is the smaller. If the relative
   changes of the O-2-A band surface albedo exceed 0.25 in the grass surfac
   or 0.35 in the desert surface, the relative error of the inverted XCO2
   will be greater than 1\%, not satisfying the design requirement of the
   inversion system. In contrast, the changesin 1.6 mu m band surface
   albedo have negligible effect on the inverted XCO2. This study shows the
   importance of surface albedo in the process of satellite remote sensin,
   and provides an important theoretical basis and guidance for improving
   the accuracy of remote sensing detectio. All these are significantly
   contributed to the hyperspectral satellite observation of the greenhouse
   gas, the investigation of global CO2 distributions, and the prediction
   and monitoring of the climate change.},

Abstract = {Small boreal lakes emit large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
   methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Yet emissions of these greenhouse gases
   are variable in space and time, in part due to variable within-lake CO2
   and CH4 concentrations. To determine the extent and the underlying
   drivers of this variation, we measured lake water CO2 and CH4
   concentrations and estimated associated emissions using spatially
   discrete water samples collected every 2 weeks from a small boreal lake.
   On select dates, we also collected groundwater samples from the
   surrounding catchment. On average, groundwater draining a connected peat
   mire complex had significantly higher CO2 and CH4 concentrations
   compared to waters draining forest on mineral soils. However, within the
   lake, only CH4 concentrations nearshore from the mire complex were
   significantly elevated. We observed little spatial variability in
   surface water CO2; however, bottom water CO2 in the pelagic zone was
   significantly higher than bottom waters at nearshore locations. Overall,
   temperature, precipitation, and thermal stratification explained
   temporal patterns of CO2 concentration, whereas hydrology (discharge and
   precipitation) best predicted the variation in CH4 concentration.
   Consistent with these different controls, the highest CO2 emission was
   related to lake turnover at the end of August while the highest CH4
   emission was associated with precipitation events at the end of June.
   These results suggest that annual carbon emissions from small boreal
   lakes are influenced by temporal variation in weather conditions that
   regulate thermal stratification and trigger hydrologic land-water
   connections that supply gases from catchment soils to the lake.},

Abstract = {Climate change is impacting upon global marine ecosystems and ocean wide
   changes in ecosystem properties are expected to continue. Marine
   Protected Areas (MPAs) have been implemented as a conservation tool
   throughout the world, primarily as a measure to reduce local impacts,
   but their usefulness and effectiveness is strongly related to climate
   change. MPAs may have a role in mitigation through effects on carbon
   sequestration, affect interactions between climatic effects and other
   drivers and be affected themselves as the distributions of protected
   species change over time. However, to date, few MPA programmes have
   directly considered climate change in the design, management or
   monitoring of an MPA network. This paper presents a series of
   international case studies from four locations: British Columbia,
   Canada; central California, USA; the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and
   the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand; to review perceptions of how climate
   change has been considered in the design, implementation, management and
   monitoring of MPAs. The results indicate that some MPA processes have
   already incorporated design criteria or principles for adaptive
   management, which address some of the potential impacts of climate
   change on MPAs. Key lessons include: i) Strictly protected marine
   reserves are considered essential for climate change resilience and will
   be necessary as scientific reference sites to understand climate change
   effects ii) Adaptive management of MPA networks is important but hard to
   implement iii) Strictly protected reserves managed as ecosystems are the
   best option for an uncertain future. Although the case studies addressed
   aspects of considering climate change within MPA networks and provided
   key lessons for the practical inclusion of these considerations, there
   are some significant challenges remaining. This paper provides new
   insights into the policy and practical challenges MPA managers face
   under climate change scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Tropical forest soils are an important source and sink of greenhouse
   gases (GHGs), with tropical montane forests, in particular, having been
   poorly studied. The understanding of this ecosystem function is of vital
   importance for future climate change research. In this study, we
   explored soil fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) in four tropical forest sites located on the western flanks
   of the Andes in northern Ecuador. The measurements were carried out
   during the dry season from August to September 2018 and along an
   altitudinal gradient from 400 to 3010 m a.s.l. (above sea level). During
   this short-term campaign, our measurements showed (1) an unusual but
   marked increase in CO2 emissions at high altitude, possibly linked to
   changes in soil pH and/or root biomass, (2) a consistent atmospheric CH4
   sink over all altitudes with high temporal and spatial variability, and
   (3) a transition from a net N2O source to sink along the altitudinal
   gradient. Our results provide arguments and insights for future and more
   detailed studies on tropical montane forests. Furthermore, they stress
   the relevance of using altitudinal transects as a biogeochemical
   open-air laboratory with a steep in situ environmental gradient over a
   limited spatial distance. Although short-term studies of temporal
   variations can improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind the
   production and consumption of soil GHGs, the inclusion of more rigorous
   sampling for forest management events, forest rotation cycles, soil
   type, hydrological conditions and drainage status, ground vegetation
   composition and cover, soil microclimate, and temporal (seasonality) and
   spatial (topographic positions) variability is needed in order to obtain
   more reliable estimates of the CO2, CH4, and N2O source/sink strength of
   tropical montane forests.},

Abstract = {Drained peatlands are significant sources of the greenhouse gas (GHG)
   carbon dioxide. Rewetting is a proven strategy used to protect carbon
   stocks; however, it can lead to increased emissions of the potent GHG
   methane. The response to rewetting of soil microbiomes as drivers of
   these processes is poorly understood, as are the biotic and abiotic
   factors that control community composition. We analyzed the pro- and
   eukaryotic microbiomes of three contrasting pairs of minerotrophic fens
   subject to decade-long drainage and subsequent long-term rewetting.
   Abiotic soil properties including moisture, dissolved organic matter,
   methane fluxes, and ecosystem respiration rates were also determined.
   The composition of the microbiomes was fen-type-specific, but all
   rewetted sites showed higher abundances of anaerobic taxa compared to
   drained sites. Based on multi-variate statistics and network analyses,
   we identified soil moisture as a major driver of community composition.
   Furthermore, salinity drove the separation between coastal and
   freshwater fen communities. Methanogens were more than 10-fold more
   abundant in rewetted than in drained sites, while their abundance was
   lowest in the coastal fen, likely due to competition with sulfate
   reducers. The microbiome compositions were reflected in methane fluxes
   from the sites. Our results shed light on the factors that structure fen
   microbiomes via environmental filtering.},

Abstract = {As the repercussions of climate change materialize, coastal cities are
   often at the forefront of experiencing environmental impacts like
   flooding and storm events. In addition, anthropogenic vulnerability
   drivers, like industrial activity in the near-shore environment, may
   accelerate shoreline erosion or nuisance flooding through the loss of
   natural shoreline buffers and increased ship traffic. This
   interdisciplinary study applied a participatory mixed-methods approach,
   co-creating climate change adaptation pathways with community and
   stakeholder input as a bottom-up task. The aims were to engage in a
   community dialogue (1) identifying assets and challenges within the
   natural and built environment based on community input, (2) utilizing a
   participatory mixed-methods approach to model and quantify selected
   hazards, and (3) transforming them into adaptation pathways visualized
   in a comprehensive master plan. The small-town of Ingleside on the Bay,
   Texas, served as a case study for this project, highlighting how
   sea-level rise and industrial activity challenge the community, its
   natural and cultural environment, and the infrastructure within. The
   outcomes identify anthropogenic vulnerability drivers and propose a
   concrete list of seven adaptation pathways based on community input.
   This study helps engaged scholars and decision-makers to activate
   community members and their knowledge as an integral component of their
   work, from identifying a problem to developing tangible solutions.},

Abstract = {Many coastal areas throughout the world are at risk from sea level rise
   and the increased intensity of extreme events such as storm surge and
   flooding. Simultaneously, many areas are also experiencing significant
   socio-economic challenges associated with rural-urban transitions,
   population growth, and increased consumption resulting from improving
   gross regional product. Within this context we explore the viability of
   proposed adaptation pathways in Soc Trang province, Vietnam-an area of
   the Mekong Delta experiencing cumulative pressures on coastal
   livelihoods. A participatory workshop and interviews, using a
   combination of systems thinking and futures techniques, revealed a
   shared goal of sustainable livelihoods, which provides an integrated and
   systemic focus for coastal adaptation strategies. Emphasizing
   sustainable livelihoods is less likely to lead to maladaptation because
   stakeholders consciously seek to avoid optimizing particular system
   elements at the expense of others-and thus engage in broader
   decision-making frameworks supportive of social-ecological resilience.
   However, the broad ambit required for sustainable livelihoods is not
   supported by governance frameworks that have focused on protective
   strategies (e.g., dyke building, strengthening and raising, to continue
   and expand agriculture and aquaculture production) at the expense of
   developing a diverse suite of adaptation strategies, which may lead to
   path dependencies and an ultimate reduction in adaptive capacity for
   system transformation.},

Abstract = {Lakes are an important component of the climate system. They provide
   moisture for precipitation, buffer temperature variations, and
   contribute to regional atmospheric carbon budgets. This article
   describes an eddy covariance (EC) mesonet on Lake Taihu, a large (area
   2400 km(2)) and shallow (depth 2 m) lake situated in the heavily
   populated Yangtze River Delta, China. The mesonet consists of five lake
   sites, representing different biological attributes and wind-wave
   patterns, and a land site near the lake shore. Common to all the sites
   are standard EC instruments for measurement of the momentum, sensible
   heat, water vapor, and CO2 flux. One site is also equipped with
   laser-based analyzers for precise measurement of the CO2, CH4, and H2O
   mixing ratios and their isotopic compositions. To the authors' best
   knowledge, this is the first lake eddy flux mesonet. Early results
   reveal evidence of biological and pollution controls on the surface-air
   fluxes of energy, momentum, and greenhouse gases across the lake. The
   data will be used to address five science questions: 1) Are lake-air
   parameterizations established for deep lakes applicable to shallow
   lakes? 2) Why are lake-land breeze circulations less prevalent in the
   Taihu lake basin than in lake basins in northern latitudes? 3) How do
   algal blooms alter the lake-atmosphere interactions? 4) Is this
   eutrophic lake a source or sink of atmospheric CO2? 5) Does the decay of
   algal and macrophyte biomass contribute significant amounts of CH4 to
   the atmosphere?},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols play an important role in the atmospheric energy
   balance. Anthropogenic aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its accompanying
   shortwave radiative forcing (RF) are usually simulated by numerical
   models. Recently, with the development of space-borne instruments and
   sophisticated retrieval algorithms, it has become possible to estimate
   aerosol radiative forcing based on satellite observations. In this
   study, we have estimated shortwave direct radiative forcing due to
   anthropogenic aerosols over oceans in all-sky conditions by combining
   clouds and the Single Scanner Footprint data of the Clouds and Earth's
   Radiant Energy System (CERES/SSF) experiment, which provide measurements
   of upward shortwave fluxes at the top of atmosphere, with Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol and cloud products.
   We found that globally averaged aerosol radiative forcing over oceans in
   the clear-sky conditions and all-sky conditions were -1.03 +/- 0.48 W
   m(-2) and -0.34 +/- 0.16 W m(-2), respectively. Direct radiative forcing
   by anthropogenic aerosols shows large regional and seasonal variations.
   In some regions and in particular seasons, the magnitude of direct
   forcing by anthropogenic aerosols can be comparable to the forcing of
   greenhouse gases. However, it shows that aerosols caused the cooling
   effect, rather than warming effect from global scale, which is different
   from greenhouse gases.},

Title = {The international logistics of wood pellets for heating and power

Abstract = {The European wood pellet market is booming: concerns about climate
   change and renewable energy targets are predominant drivers. The aim of
   this analysis is to compare typical wood pellet chains from the purchase
   of the feedstock from sawmills to the conversion into heat or
   electricity. Cost structures, primary energy inputs and avoided
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reviewed. Three cases are defined:
   pellets for district heating (DH) in Sweden (replacing heavy fuel oil);
   bagged pellets for residential heating in Italy (natural gas); and
   Canadian pellets for electricity production in the Netherlands (coal).
   Supply may cost (sic)110-(sic)170 per tonne of delivered pellets, with
   the main cost factors being feedstock collection, drying and
   long-distance ocean transportation (for Canadian pellets only). Largest
   avoided emissions are for power production (1937 kg CO(2)eq/tonne of
   pellets), followed by district heating (1483 kg). In relative terms, the
   GHG reduction varies from 81\% for residential heating (with pre-dried
   feedstock) to 97\% for DH. Based on a wood-pellet consumption of 8.2
   million tonnes, the EU27 plus Norway and Switzerland avoided about 12.6
   million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2008. Concluding, wood pellets can
   achieve substantial GHG savings, especially when substituting coal for
   power production. However, wood pellets are relatively expensive,
   especially compared to coal. Only in the case of high oil prices, can
   the substitution of heating oil for DH be commercially viable. In most
   other cases, substitution is only possible with financial support from
   national governments, for example, feed-in tariffs or carbon taxes. The
   commercial markets for CO2 emission rights may cover some costs, but
   their impact is still limited. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry and

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on tourism has been examined in terms of
   changes in a destination's climate; the impact of ancillary effects such
   as sea-level rise has been neglected. In this study the role that
   coastal and other landscape features have on the attractiveness of
   tourist destinations is examined using the hedonic price technique. The
   average price of accommodation in the coastal districts of
   Schleswig-Holstein, Germany is explained using landscape and other
   characteristics of these districts. As parts of the coastline of
   Schleswig-Holstein are protected by dikes, adaptation measures as well
   as natural coastal features are represented in the dataset. The analysis
   shows that an increase in the length of dikes in a given district would
   result in a reduction in the average price of accommodation. An increase
   in the length of open coast results in an increase in the average price
   of accommodation. For two districts, the impact of sea-level rise is
   examined through a comparison of the costs of different coastal
   protection measures compared to the resulting changes in revenue from
   accommodation. The costs of dike construction along with the effect of
   reduced accommodation prices favour the use of beach nourishment to
   protect the coast. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   support for flood adaptation policy},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},

Volume = {122},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The economic damage from coastal flooding has dramatically increased
   over the past several decades, owing to rapid development in shoreline
   areas and possible effects of climate change. To respond to these
   trends, it is imperative for policy makers to understand individuals'
   support for flood adaptation policy. Using original survey data for all
   coastal counties of the United States Gulf Coast merged with contextual
   data on flood risk, this study investigates coastal residents' support
   for two adaptation policy measures: incentives for relocation and
   funding for educational programs on emergency planning and evacuation.
   Specifically, this study explores the interactive relationships among
   contextual flood risks, perceived flood risks and policy support for
   flood adaptation, with the effects of social-demographic variables being
   controlled. Age, gender, race and partisanship are found to
   significantly affect individuals' policy support for both adaptation
   measures. The contextual flooding risks, indicated by distance from the
   coast, maximum wind speed and peak height of storm surge associated with
   the last hurricane landfall, and percentage of high-risk flood zone per
   county, are shown to impact one's perceptions of risk, which in turn
   influence one's support for both policy measures. The key finding risk
   perception mediates the impact of contextual risk conditions on public
   support for flood management policies highlights the need to ensure that
   the public is well informed by the latest scientific, engineering and
   economic knowledge. To achieve this, more information on current and
   future flood risks and options available for mitigation as well as risk
   communication tools are needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Addressing Diffuse Threats and Developing Rigorous Adaptive Management
   Plans},
Journal = {FISHERIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We discuss the importance of addressing diffuse threats to long-term
   species and habitat viability in fish conservation and recovery
   planning. In the Pacific Northwest, USA, salmonid management plans have
   typically focused on degraded freshwater habitat, dams, fish passage,
   harvest rates, and hatchery releases. However, such plans inadequately
   address threats related to human population and economic growth,
   intra-and interspecific competition, and changes in climate, ocean, and
   estuarine conditions. Based on reviews conducted on eight conservation
   and/or recovery plans, we found that though threats resulting from such
   changes are difficult to model and/or predict, they are especially
   important for wide-ranging diadromous species. Adaptive management is
   also a critical but often inadequately constructed component of those
   plans. Adaptive management should be designed to respond to evolving
   knowledge about the fish and their supporting ecosystems; if done
   properly, it should help improve conservation efforts by decreasing
   uncertainty regarding known and diffuse threats. We conclude with a
   general call for environmental managers and planners to reinvigorate the
   adaptive management process in future management plans, including more
   explicitly identifying critical uncertainties, implementing monitoring
   programs to reduce those uncertainties, and explicitly stating what
   management actions will occur when pre-identified trigger points are
   reached.},

Title = {Water level changes in Lake Erie drive 21st century CO2 and CH4 fluxes
   from a coastal temperate wetland},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {821},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Wetland water depth influences microbial and plant communities, which
   can alter the above- and below-ground carbon cycling of a wetland.
   Wetland water depths are likely to change due to shifting precipitation
   patterns, which will affect projections of greenhouse gas emissions;
   however, these effects are rarely incorporated into wetland greenhouse
   gas models. Seeking to address this gap, we used a mechanistic model,
   ecosys, to simulate a range of water depth scenarios in a temperate
   wetland, and analyzed simulated predictions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
   methane (CH4) fluxes over the 21st century. We tested our model using
   eddy covariance measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes collected at the Old
   Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve (OWC) during 2015 and
   2016. OWC is a lacustrine, estuarine, freshwater, mineral-soil marsh. An
   empirical model found that the wetland water depth is highly dependent
   on the water depth of the nearby lake Eric. Future wetland surface water
   depths were modeled based on projection of lake Eries water depth using
   four separate NOAA projections, resulting in four wetland water-depth
   scenarios. Two of the four 21st century projections for lake Eric water
   depths used in this study indicated that the water depth of the wetland
   would remain nearly steady; however, the other two indicated decreases
   in the wetland water depth. In our scenario where the wetland dries out,
   we pmject the wetland's climatological warming effect will decrease due
   to smaller CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere and larger CO2 uptake by the
   wetland. We also found that increased water level can lower emissions by
   shifting the site towards more open water areas, which have lower CH4
   emissions. We found that decreased water depths would cause more
   widespread colonization of the wetland by macrophytc vegetation. Using
   an empirical relationship, we also found that further drying could
   result in other, non-wetland vegetation to emerge, dramatically altering
   soil carbon cycling. In three of our four projections, we found that in
   general the magnitude of CO2 and 014 fluxes steadily increase over the
   next 100 years in response to higher temperatures. I lowever, in our
   driest simulations, we projected a different response due to increased
   oxidation of soil carbon, with CA-14 emissions decreasing substantially
   from an annual cumulative peak of 224.6 to a minimum of 104.7 gC m(-2)
   year(-1).In that same simulation, net cumulative flux of CO2 changed
   from being a sink of 56.5 gC m(-2) year(-1) to a source of 369.6 gC
   m(-2)year(-1) over the same period, despite a temperature increase from
   13.7 degrees C to 14.2 degrees C. This temperature shift in our other
   three cases with greater water depths increased the source strength of
   CH4 and the sink strength of CO2.
   We conclude that the magnitude of wetland greenhouse-gas fluxes depended
   on the water depth primarily as it affected the areal percentage of the
   wetland available for plant colonization, but dramatic decreases in
   water depths could cause significant reductions in the wetland CH4
   fluxes, while simultaneously altering the wetland vegetation.},

Abstract = {Maritime transport is responsible for an annual emission of around 1000
   million tonnes of CO2, which is around 2.5\% of the global greenhouse
   gas emissions. Nowadays, ships are designed using simplified operational
   profiles representing the expected operational profile during the
   lifetime of the ship. However, there is a discrepancy between these
   simplified profiles used for design and the actual full operational
   profile of a ship during its lifetime. This discrepancy leads to
   inefficient hydrodynamic ship design resulting in a waste of fuel and an
   increase of greenhouse gas emissions.
   The amount of available data on actual operational conditions of ships
   is rapidly increasing. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) and
   onboard monitoring systems produce a huge amount of historical data on
   ship operations. These developments call for efficient data-driven
   methods that account for this data. Knowledge of operational conditions
   can be used for Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD)-based probabilistic
   uncertainty quantification leading to robust design: A hull shape that
   is optimal with respect to uncertain operational conditions. Robust
   design is a promising approach since it makes ships energy efficient for
   the real usage situation.
   Three UQ-methods are discussed: The perturbation method, the Polynomial
   Chaos Expansion (PCE) method and the multi-fidelity PCE method. The
   methods are applied to a simple one-dimensional test case to compute the
   stochastic moments of the effective power. The multi-fidelity Polynomial
   Chaos Method is found to be the most efficient UQ method. Moreover, the
   multi-fidelity PCE can be used as a surrogate for efficient Monte Carlo
   integration. This makes the method suitable for an Optimisation Under
   Uncertainty (OUU) algorithm leading to robust design.},

Title = {CO2 capture and storage - Closing the knowing-doing gap},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN},

Abstract = {The capture and storage Of CO2 is gaining attention as an option for
   limiting CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels. CO2 capture is
   premised on the safe long-term storage Of CO2 in geological formations.
   Naturally occurring CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery in the USA,
   Trinidad, Turkey, Hungary, Brazil and Croatia. Industrially produced CO2
   has been used for enhanced oil recovery at the Rangely field in
   Colorado, USA since 1986 and at the Weyburn field in Saskatchewan,
   Canada since 2000. Large-scale CO2 storage in geological formations to
   avoid CO2 emissions was first undertaken offshore in Norway in 1996 and
   onshore in Algeria in 2004. CO2 delivered for EOR in the USA averaged
   around USD 11/tonne CO2 during the 1990s. The Cost Of CO2 capture from
   low concentration industrial sources varies with a number of factors,
   but will certainly be very much higher than the recovery of
   naturally-occurring CO2. Adequate knowledge exists in the oil and gas
   industry for the application Of CO2 capture and storage. Widespread
   implementation of fully-integrated CO2 value chains will nonetheless
   depend on achieving public acceptance and regulatory approval for CO2
   storage, cost reduction for CO2 capture and sufficient economic
   incentives for the key actors involved. This article discusses the most
   important research directions for CO2 capture and storage projects that
   have been initiated around the world. The adequacy of economic
   incentives will strongly influence how quickly producers and users of
   fossil fuels are able to close the knowing-doing gap for CO2 capture and
   storage.},

Title = {Tidal variability of CO2 and CH4 emissions from the water column within

Abstract = {We performed a preliminary study to quantify CO2 and CH4 emissions from
   the water column within a Rhizophora spp. mangrove forest. Mean CO2 and
   CH4 emissions during the studied period were 3.35 +/- 3.62 mmolC m(-2)
   h(-1) and 18.30 +/- 27.72 mu molC m(-2) h(-1) , respectively. CO2 and
   CH4 emissions were highly variable and mainly driven by tides (flow/ebb,
   water column thickness, neap/spring). Indeed, an inverse relationship
   between the magnitude of the emissions and the thickness of the water
   column above the mangrove soil was observed. delta(CO2)-C-13 values
   ranged from -26.88 parts per thousand to -8.6 parts per thousand,
   suggesting a mixing between CO2-enriched pore waters and lagoon incoming
   waters. In addition, CO2 and CH4 emissions were significantly higher
   during ebb tides, mainly due to the progressive enrichment of the water
   column by diffusive fluxes as its residence time over the forest floor
   increased. Eventually, we observed higher CO2 and CH4 emissions during
   spring tides than during neap tides, combined to depleted
   delta(CO2)-C-13 values, suggesting a higher contribution of
   soil-produced gases to the emissions. These higher emissions may result
   from higher renewable of the electron acceptor and enhanced exchange
   surface between the soil and the water column. This study shows that CO2
   and CH4 emissions from the water column were not negligible and must be
   considered in future carbon budgets in mangroves. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {83},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1257-1278},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Deltas are the promising places with multifarious ecosystems and arable
   soils along with the ease of water transportation system; hence, a
   number of important cities are established in or near coastal delta
   regions. However, due to the geomorphic characteristics, those cities
   are extremely exposed to hydro-meteorological hazards, especially to
   riverine and coastal flood. Additionally, climate change, rapid
   urbanization and subsidence are exacerbating the existing situation and
   causing monumental loss. Researchers as well as various international
   organizations like United Nations Inter-Agency Secretariat of the
   International Strategy for Disaster Reduction have recognized the
   implications of formulating disaster risk reduction (DRR) plans for
   coastal delta cities. This demands for the excogitation of adaptation
   policies and measures in addition to the mitigation efforts to reduce
   flood risks. In this regard, to support the comprehensive concept
   development, this study elicits different components of flood risk
   reduction policies and measures, congenial for coastal delta cities in
   respect of physical and environmental perspectives. Eleven precedent
   (model) cities are selected to study their various initiatives for
   reducing coastal flood risks. Findings show that protecting cities from
   flooding and reducing exposure to floods are two different but
   interrelated approaches of DRR. Combinations of structural and
   non-structural measures are the prerequisites to achieve the goal of
   effective DRR.},

Abstract = {The Arctic is both a place disproportionately affected by climate change

   on climate change are centred on greenhouse gas emissions from

   of universal and strict emission-reduction targets, petroleum exports
   and carbon leakage jeopardize the effectiveness of the climate change
   regime. Through the examination of treaties and national practice, this
   paper argues for the establishment of accountability for the production

Abstract = {We develop methods for assessing offshore wind resources, using a model
   of the vertical structure of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) over

   energy demand in the adjacent states ( Massachusetts through North
   Carolina, U. S. A.). We find that the MAB wind resource can produce 330
   GW average electrical power, a resource exceeding the region's current
   summed demand for 73 GW of electricity, 29 GW of light vehicle fuels (
   now gasoline), and 83 GW of building fuels ( now distillate fuel oil and
   natural gas). Supplying these end-uses with MAB wind power would reduce
   by 68\% the region's CO2 emissions, and reduce by 57\% its greenhouse
   gas forcing. These percentages are in the range of the global reductions
   needed to stabilize climate.},

Title = {To sink or burn? A discussion of the potential contributions of forests
   to greenhouse gas balances through storing carbon or providing biofuels},
Journal = {BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY},

Volume = {24},

Note = {Workshop on Principles and Practice of Forestry and Bioenergy in
   Densely-Populated Regions, NETHERLANDS, SEP 16-21, 2001},
Abstract = {Forests can affect net CO2 emissions by increasing or decreasing the
   amount of stored carbon, or by supplying biofuels for power generation
   to substitute for fossil fuels. However, forests store the most carbon
   when they remain undisturbed and are allowed to grow to maturity,
   whereas using wood for bioenergy requires wood removal from forests,
   which reduces on-site carbon storage. Hence, it is difficult to manage a
   forest simultaneously for maximum carbon storage and supplying fuelwood.
   For developing optimal strategies for the use of vegetation sinks, it is
   necessary to consider the feedbacks via the inherent natural adjustments
   in the global carbon cycle. Increased atmospheric CO2 currently provides
   a driving force for carbon uptake by natural carbon reservoirs, such as
   the world's oceans. When carbon is removed from the atmosphere and
   stored in biomass, it lowers the concentration gradient between the
   atmosphere and these other reservoirs. This reduces the subsequent
   inherent rate Of CO2 removal from the atmosphere. This means that
   transferring a quantity Of CO2 from the atmosphere to a biomass pool
   lowers the atmospheric concentration the most immediately after the
   initial removal, but subsequently, the atmospheric concentration trends
   back towards the values without biospheric removal.
   The optimal timing for the use of vegetation sinks therefore depends on
   a number of factors: the length of time over which forest growth can be
   maintained, whether biomass is used for energy generation and on the
   nature of the most detrimental aspects of climate-change impacts.
   Climate-change impacts related to-the instantaneous effect of
   temperature are mitigated less by vegetation sinks than impacts that act
   via the cumulative effect of increased temperature. It also means that
   short-term carbon storage in temporary sinks is not generally beneficial
   in mitigating climate change. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {CH4 (methane) is an important greenhouse gas that has a significant
   impact on the formation of, and change in, the global climate. Through
   the development of remote sensing technology, a series of remote sensing
   detectors to monitor CH4 sources and sinks have been launched into
   space. Although a series of studies have been conducted around the CH4
   concentration retrieved by AIRS (The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder
   instrument), SCIAMACHY (The Scanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for
   Atmospheric Chartography instrument), and GOSAT (The Greenhouse Gases
   Observing Satellite), there have been few comprehensive comparative
   studies between these three satellite results and ground-based data. In
   this article, the correlation coefficient, root-mean-square deviation
   (RMSD), and bias are used to evaluate the CH4 retrieved from satellite
   data. The results reveal that: AIRS can reflect the distribution and
   changes of CH4 all over the world. The space coverage of GOSAT is
   focused between 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N, and the correlation of
   GOSAT with land surface stations is generally better than that with
   ocean surface stations. The space coverage of SCIAMACHY is between GOSAT
   and AIRS. Though SCIAMACHY data show a poor consistency with surface
   measurements, SCIAMACHY can also reflect the spatial and temporal
   dynamic distribution of CH4 around the world to a certain extent.},

Abstract = {Transition of Iran's power system from 2015 to 2050 through three
   scenarios was modelled. Two scenarios present a transition pathway
   towards a fully renewable run power system with different involved
   sectors (power only, power sector coupled with desalination and
   non-energetic gas sectors). The third scenario is based on the country's
   current policies. The energy model performs an hourly resolution to
   guarantee meeting energy demand for every hour of the whole year. It is
   found that renewable energy resources in Iran can satisfy 625 TWh of
   power sector demand in 2050. Further, it is technically and economically
   feasible that electricity demand for supplying 101 million m(3)
   desalinated water and 249 TWhilly synthetic natural gas for
   non-energetic industrial gas demand can be supplied via renewable
   resources. A 100\% renewable power system with 54 (sic)/MWh(el)
   levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is more cost-effective than the
   current power system in Iran with 88.3 (sic)/MWh(el) LCOE in 2015. LCOE
   of the system can decrease further and reach to 41.3 (sic)/MWh(el) in
   2050 via sector coupling. On the other hand, the current policies of the
   country lead to an inefficient power system with a LCOE of 128
   (sic)/MWh(el) and 188 Mt/a emitted CO2 in 2050. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {While there is little dissent in the scientific community that climate
   change directly correlates to human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions,
   action to reduce those emissions has not followed from the United States
   and many other governments around the world. Meanwhile, climate changes
   are already underway, and will continue to some degree even if emissions
   are drastically curtailed, thanks to emissions already in the
   atmosphere. Some countries and states are making their own plans to
   adapt to expected impacts including higher sea levels, more intense
   rainfall, droughts, heat waves, and loss of water supplies-and to reduce
   their local emissions. In this Global Forum, three experts highlight
   efforts by national and local governments in planning for 2100 and
   beyond. From the Netherlands, Arthur Mynett; from Bangladesh, Saleemul

Abstract = {The detrimental effects of increasing atmospheric levels of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution
   has led to a concerted international effort to control their release and
   abate the environmental and human health impacts. CO2 is removed from
   the atmosphere by photosynthesis of plants in the terrestrial
   environment and by aquatic sequestration. In the Middle East and other
   arid countries, terrestrial removal is minimal. The most likely removal
   pathway for CO2 in arid regions around the world is by aquatic
   sequestration. In the Middle East the major sink is the Arabian Gulf
   which leads to acidification of the marine environment. Biweekly pH
   concentration measurements in surface waters of the northern Arabian
   Gulf over a four year period in this study suggest that the Arabian Gulf
   waters are becoming increasingly acidic with time. Supporting evidence
   for increased CO2 sequestration comes from increased marine primary
   productivity over the past decade. Biological effects, such as coral
   bleaching, observed during this period suggest that urgent action is
   required to reverse the trend and protect marine life. The data
   highlight the fact that this semi-enclosed sea is undergoing a rapid
   degradation which may affect the oceanic chemistry and biogeochemical
   cycle much earlier than predicted for most oceanic waters.},

Title = {Delaying future sea-level rise by storing water in Antarctica},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {203-210},
Abstract = {Even if greenhouse gas emissions were stopped today, sea level would
   continue to rise for centuries, with the long-term sea-level commitment
   of a 2 degrees C warmer world significantly exceeding 2 m. In view of
   the potential implications for coastal populations and ecosystems
   worldwide, we investigate, from an ice-dynamic perspective, the
   possibility of delaying sea-level rise by pumping ocean water onto the
   surface of the Antarctic ice sheet. We find that due to wave propagation
   ice is discharged much faster back into the ocean than would be expected
   from a pure advection with surface velocities. The delay time depends
   strongly on the distance from the coastline at which the additional mass
   is placed and less strongly on the rate of sea-level rise that is
   mitigated. A millennium-scale storage of at least 80\% of the additional
   ice requires placing it at a distance of at least 700 km from the
   coastline. The pumping energy required to elevate the potential energy
   of ocean water to mitigate the currently observed 3 mmyr(-1) will exceed
   7\% of the current global primary energy supply. At the same time, the
   approach offers a comprehensive protection for entire coastlines
   particularly including regions that cannot be protected by dikes.},

Title = {Use of ecosystems in coastal erosion management},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {156},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {277-289},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {With a global increase in coastal development, together with increasing
   storminess and continuing sea level rise, coastal erosion has become a
   serious problem along a significant percentage of coastlines of many
   countries. Coastal erosion and shoreline management plans are often
   implemented on an action reaction and post-disaster basis, resulting in
   installation of hard engineering structures, such as, groins, seawalls,
   revetments, gabions and breakwaters. These hard stabilization structures
   usually alter the natural environment of the coast, producing negative
   impacts. They do little to work with nature, and sustainability is a
   currently a critical issue. Under present and future environmental
   conditions, the world requires smarter coastal protection strategies
   that are adaptable, sustainable, multi-functional and economically
   viable to help solve immediate and predicted coastal erosion problems.
   An ecosystem based approach based on the creation and restoration of
   coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands (e.g. mangroves), biogenic reef
   structures (e.g. corals, oysters, and mussels), seagrass beds and dune
   vegetation can offer optimal natural alternatives to help solve coastal
   erosion. Coastal ecosystems have some capacity for self-repair and
   recovery, and can provide significant advantages over traditional hard
   engineering approaches against coastal erosion. Also, they play a vital
   role in reducing the susceptibility of coastal communities to hazards
   through their multiple roles in processes, including sediment capture,
   system roughness and thus attenuation of wave energy. This paper seeks
   to undertake a general review of adaptation and protection measures
   against coastal erosion issues, based on incorporation of ecology and
   ecosystem services into coastal erosion management strategies. (C) 2017

Title = {On the complexity of anthropogenic and geological sources of carbon
   dioxide: Onsite differentiation using isotope surveying},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {256},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) co-occur with
   emissions of these gases from volcanic and urban environments.
   Therefore, it remains a challenge for the scientific community to
   identify the contamination sources and quantify the specific
   contributions. Stable isotopes have many applications in different
   fields under geosciences, including volcanology, environmental
   surveying, and climatology. Isotopic surveys allow identification of
   photosynthetic fractionation in tree forests and gas sources in urban
   zones, and tracking of volcanic degassing. Thus, the stable isotopic
   composition of the local GHGs allows the evaluation of the environmental
   impacts and assists in mitigating the emissions.
   The present study aimed to distinguish the tropospheric sources of CO2
   in the different ecosystems based on the stable isotopic composition of
   CO2. The study relies on field experiments performed in both volcanic
   and urban zones of the Mediterranean region. Experiments to identify the
   CO2 origins were designed and conducted in the field. The CO2 in the air
   in Palermo, the soil CO2 released at Vulcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy),
   and the CO2 emitted at Cava dei Selci (Rome, Italy) were selected for
   conducting case studies.
   Isotope surveying of the CO2-containing air in Palermo revealed that the
   CO2 content was correlated to human activity. Mobile-based measurements
   of carbon isotope were conducted to distinguish the different sources of
   CO2 at the district scale. In particular, the isotopic surveying process
   distinguished landfill-related CO2 emissions from the fossil fuel
   burning ones. The underlying geological reservoir was identified as the
   main source of air CO2 at Cava dei Selci. Finally, partitioning of soil
   CO2 enabled estimation of the geological CO2 estimation in the Vulcano
   Porto settled zones.
   The results of the present study revealed that detailed investigations
   on stable isotopes assist in tracking the CO2 sources and the fate of
   gas emissions. The fine-tuned experimental solutions assisted in
   broadening the research perspectives. In addition, deeper insights into
   the carbon cycle were obtained.},

Abstract = {Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing poses a significant
   threat to marine fisheries and biodiversity only outpaced by the
   projected impacts of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean

   Ocean acidification and de-oxygenation are another two phenomena that
   might affect certain marine species as well as entire marine ecosystems.
   Rebuilding of overexploited and depleted fisheries and managing
   fisheries sustainably will require comprehensive governance structures
   for port, flag, coastal and market states, which also address the causes
   and impacts of climate change. Addressing those concerns could open for
   opportunities for comprehensive and synergetic regulation. This article
   addresses potential synergies between oceans and climate governance;
   focusing on the role of oceans in addressing climate change and its
   adverse impacts. Suggestions to this end include (i) increasing
   ocean-based renewable energy, (ii) de-carbonizing ocean-based transport,
   and (iii) pursuing integrated management of fisheries and aquaculture.},

Title = {Coastal defence through wave farms},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {299-307},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The possibility of using wave farms for coastal defence warrants
   investigation because wave energy is poised to become a major renewable
   in many countries over the next decades. The fundamental question in
   this regard is whether a wave farm can be used to reduce beach erosion
   under storm conditions. If the answer to this question is positive, then
   a wave farm can have coastal defence as a subsidiary function, in
   addition to its primary role of producing carbon-free energy. The
   objective of this work is to address this question by comparing the
   response of a beach in the face of a storm in two scenarios: with and
   without the wave farm. For this comparison a set of ad hoc impact
   indicators is developed: the bed level impact (BLI), beach face eroded
   area (PEA), non-dimensional erosion reduction (NER), and mean cumulative
   eroded area (CEA); and their values are determined by means of two
   coupled models: a high-resolution wave propagation model (SWAN) and a
   coastal processes model (XBeach). The study is conducted through a case
   study: Perranporth Beach (UK). Backed by a well-developed dune system,
   Perranporth has a bar between -5 m and -10 m. The results show that the
   wave farm reduces the eroded volume by as much as 50\% and thus
   contributes effectively to coastal protection. This synergy between
   marine renewable energy and coastal defence may well contribute to
   improving the viability of wave farms through savings in conventional
   coastal protection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {35-48},

Abstract = {Renewable technologies have been advocated in Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS) as a risk mitigation measure against oil price volatility.
   This paper applies empirical data in a custom-built stochastic
   simulation model in order to assess the economic impacts of renewable
   technology investments in Fiji's electricity grid. The model extends
   previous applications of portfolio theory to the electricity sector by
   incorporating variability of output from different technologies. The
   results demonstrate that investments in low-cost, low-risk renewable
   technologies, such as geothermal, energy efficiency, biomass and bagasse
   technologies, can be expected to lower both generation costs and
   financial risk for the electricity grid in Fiji. These results are
   driven by the reduction in oil-fired generation that these investments
   entail. The benefits of hydropower and several other ``intermittent{''}
   renewable technologies are more limited in the model, given that they
   require costly investment in backup oil based generating capacity. (C)

Title = {Institutional capacity-building for targeting sea-level rise in the
   climate adaptation of Swedish coastal zone management. Lessons from
   Coastby},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {54},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For coastal areas across the world, sea-level rise and problems of
   coastal erosion and coastal flooding are expected to increase over the
   next hundred years. At the same time political pressure for continued
   waterfront planning and development of coastal areas threatens to
   increase our societal vulnerability, and necessitating climate
   adaptation in coastal zone management. The institutional dimension has
   been identified as important for ensuring a more robust adaptation to
   both current climate variability and future climate change. In this
   paper, lessons regarding institutional constraints for climate
   adaptation are drawn from a Swedish case-study on local coastal zone
   management, illustrating the diverse and complex nature of institutional
   capacity-building. The aim of the paper is to illustrate critical
   factors that from an institutional perspective condition the capacity to
   achieve a more integrated, strategic and proactive climate adaptation
   and for turning ``rules on paper{''} to working practice, based on
   case-study experiences from Coastby. Following and expanding a framework
   for analysing institutional capacity-building we learnt that a selective
   few key actors had played a critical role in building a strong external
   networking capacity with a flip-side in terms of a weak internal
   coordinating capacity and lack of mutual ownership of coastal erosion
   between sectoral units e.g. risk-management, planning and environment.
   We also found a weak vertical administrative interplay and lack of
   formal coherent policy, procedures and regulations for managing coastal
   erosion between local, regional and national administrations. Further,
   tensions and trade-offs between policy-agendas, values and political
   priorities posed a barrier for capacity-building in coastal zone
   management which calls for processes to mediate conflicting priorities
   in policy-making, planning and decision-making. The case-study suggests
   that the ability of the political administrative system to acknowledge
   and deal with institutional conflicts is a critical condition for
   ensuring an integrated and proactive climate adaptation in coastal zone
   management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Utilizing high-purity carbon dioxide sources for algae cultivation and
   biofuel production in the United States: Opportunities and challenges},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {321},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) supply is an important consideration for algae
   production systems, and using high-purity CO2 eliminates the need for
   purification processes. This study assessed the challenges and
   opportunities inherent in using waste high-purity CO2 to produce algae
   in the United States. The United States' upper Midwest region is rich in
   high-purity CO2 from corn ethanol production. However, its climate is
   not as favorable for algae production as that on the Gulf Coast. This
   study assessed the tradeoffs between these factors by comparing algae
   biofuel production with and without high-purity CO2 across these two
   regions. Monthly algae cultivation was modeled in open ponds co-located
   with high-purity CO2 sources in the Midwest and along the Gulf Coast,
   where many steam methane reforming and ammonia production facilities are
   located. This revealed that, by avoiding the energy-intensive
   carbon-capture process, an algae site that sources carbon from a
   high-purity CO2 source would achieve a 9-39\% reduction in life-cycle
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a 9-37\% reduction in life cycle
   fossil energy use compared to a similar site using dilute CO2 for algae
   cultivation. The results also suggest that during warm months an algae
   pond in the Midwest would achieve results that are comparable to GHG
   emissions from a pond on the Gulf Coast. Furthermore, several Midwest
   algae ponds investigated in this study create less local water stress
   than those located along the Gulf Coast. The abundant high-purity CO2
   from corn ethanol plants thus creates a potential opportunity for algae
   cultivation in the Midwest. This study illustrated the interplay between
   algae productivity, CO2 delivery, GHG emissions, and water stress in
   siting algae ponds.},

Abstract = {Since the late 1990s, the meteorological observatory established in
   Anmyeondo (36.5382 degrees N, 126.3311 degrees E, and 30m above mean sea
   level) has been monitoring several greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4,
   N2O, CFCs, and SF6 as a part of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW)
   Program. A high resolution ground-based (g-b) Fourier transform
   spectrometer (FTS) was installed at this observation site in 2013 and
   has been operated within the frame work of the Total Carbon Column
   Observing Network (TCCON) since August 2014. The solar spectra recorded
   by the g-b FTS cover the spectral range 3800 to 16 000 cm 1 at a
   resolution of 0.02 cm(-1). In this work, the GGG2014 version of the
   TCCON standard retrieval algorithm was used to retrieve total column
   average CO2 and CH4 dry mole fractions (XCO2, XCH4) and from the FTS
   spectra. Spectral bands of CO2 (at 6220.0 and 6339.5 cm(-1) center
   wavenumbers, CH4 at 6002 cm(-1) wavenumber, and O-2 near 7880 cm(-1))
   were used to derive the XCO2 and XCH4. In this paper, we provide
   comparisons of XCO2 and XCH4 between the aircraft observations and g-b
   FTS over Anmyeondo station. A comparison of 13 coincident observations
   of XCO2 between g-b FTS and OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory)
   satellite measurements are also presented for the measurement period
   between February 2014 and November 2017. OCO-2 observations are highly
   correlated with the g-b FTS measurements (r(2) = 0.884) and exhibited a
   small positive bias (0.189 ppm). Both data set capture seasonal
   variations of the target species with maximum and minimum values in
   spring and late summer, respectively. In the future, it is planned to
   further utilize the FTS measurements for the evaluation of satellite
   observations such as Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT,
   GOSAT-2). This is the first report of the g-b FTS observations of XCO2
   species over the Anmyeondo station.},

Title = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) mitigating strategies: A case-based comparative
   analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {222-235},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanisation may have been shown to have no effect on climate change,
   but some researchers suggest that cities are fully capable of responding
   to it. Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) represent dense urban areas within
   cities where the temperature is recorded to be higher than the
   neighbouring areas or those located in suburbia. Mitigation of UHI
   effects can help diminish detriments of climate change. This paper sets
   out to establish UHI mitigation strategies, their effectiveness and
   resilience to help provide recommendations for application of such
   strategies in future. Existing literature suggest that UK is facing with
   growing problem of UHI effects and sustainable development at urban
   scale can be improved if proportionate measures are taken to mitigate
   those effects. The lack of guidance for designers and planners with
   regards to UHI mitigation is also indicated in the literature where
   trees, shrubs and grass (TSG), use of high albedo materials (HAM) in
   external building surfaces and urban inland water bodies (UIWB) are
   identified as effective measures to mitigate UHI. This research
   identifies and tests resilience and effectiveness of UHI mitigation
   strategies, using ENVI-met simulations and through Urban Futures
   Assessment Method (UFAM). Assessed mitigation strategies (TSG, HAM,
   UIWB) are shown to have a similar level of resilience which could be
   improved if proper future-proof measures are taken in place. As a
   result, some practical suggestions are provided to help improve the
   resilience of tested UHI mitigation strategies in this study. (C) 2015

Title = {Determination of a lower bound on Earth's climate sensitivity},
Journal = {TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {65},
Abstract = {Transient and equilibrium sensitivity of Earth's climate has been
   calculated using global temperature, forcing and heating rate data for
   the period 1970-2010. We have assumed increased long-wave radiative
   forcing in the period due to the increase of the long-lived greenhouse
   gases. By assuming the change in aerosol forcing in the period to be
   zero, we calculate what we consider to be lower bounds to these
   sensitivities, as the magnitude of the negative aerosol forcing is
   unlikely to have diminished in this period. The radiation imbalance
   necessary to calculate equilibrium sensitivity is estimated from the
   rate of ocean heat accumulation as 0.37 +/- 0.03W m(-2) (all uncertainty
   estimates are 1 - sigma). With these data, we obtain best estimates for
   transient climate sensitivity 0.39 +/- 0.07K (W m(-2))(-1) and
   equilibrium climate sensitivity 0.54 +/- 0.14K (W m(-2))(-1), equivalent
   to 1.5 +/- 0.3 and 2.0 +/- 0.5K (3.7W m(-2))(-1), respectively. The
   latter quantity is equal to the lower bound of the `likely' range for
   this quantity given by the 2007 IPCC Assessment Report. The uncertainty
   attached to the lower-bound equilibrium sensitivity permits us to state,
   within the assumptions of this analysis, that the equilibrium
   sensitivity is greater than 0.31K (Wm(-2))(-1), equivalent to
   1.16K(3.7Wm(-2))(-1), at the 95\% confidence level.},

Abstract = {This paper presents CO2 mitigation potential in the power sector of
   Thailand regarding to the Power Development Plan (PDP 2015) and
   Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2015). Renewable energy and
   advanced technology have the potential to play an important role in
   providing clean energy. The Long-range Energy Alternative Planning
   (LEAP) model is used to analyze future electricity demand, fuel
   consumption and CO2 emissions reduction in the long term planning during
   2010-2050. Regarding to those plans, implementations of renewable energy
   and advanced technology are proposed for mitigation options. The
   mitigation scenarios offer sustainable potential of renewable
   technologies and advanced technologies such as solar, wind, biomass,
   nuclear, hydropower, hydrogen fuel cell, tidal, geothermal and
   fossil-fuel power plants with carbon capture storage (CCS). Four
   mitigation scenarios are modeled along with the BAU scenario. The
   Mitigation 1 (MIT01) scenario is the base-case mitigation scenario based
   on the target of PDP2015, which target of renewable energy is 19,634 MW
   in 2036. In the Mitigation 2 (MIT02) scenario, the technologies in the
   MIT01 plus new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cell, tidal and
   geothermal are implemented. Clean fossil fuel technologies with CCS, for
   example natural gas and coal technologies; arc applied in the Mitigation
   3 (MIT03) scenario. In the Mitigation 4 (MIT04) scenario as the peak CO2
   scenario. Results show that, in the BAU scenario, electricity demand and
   CO2 emissions from the power sector will increase to 52,770 ktoe and
   345,959 kt-CO2eq, respectively in 2050. By adopting mitigation options,
   total CO2 emissions in 2050 can be mitigated by 69.66\% in MIT04,
   following by 50.83\% in MIT02, 47.22\% in MIT03, and 41.71\% in MHIT01
   when compared to the BAU scenario. Moreover, regarding to the MIT04,
   Thailand can meet its peak CO2 emission by 2036. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {We conducted a global systematic literature review of climate change
   adaptation in fisheries. We addressed three specific questions: (i) What
   are fisheries adapting to? (ii) How are fisheries adapting? and (iii)
   What research gaps need to be addressed? We identified, characterized
   and examined case studies published between 1990 and 2019 that lie at
   the intersection of the domains of climate change, adaptation and
   fisheries. We characterized the documented climate change effects in
   fisheries that are being adapted to multiple stressors, general climate
   impacts, extreme events, ocean conditions, marine system shifts, climate
   variability, fishery dynamics, species distribution and atmospheric
   warming. Three categories of adaptive responses came to light: coping
   mechanisms (e.g. changing fishing location, use of traditional
   knowledge); adaptive strategies (e.g. livelihood diversification,
   incorporation of technology); and management responses (e.g. adaptive
   management, adaptation planning). We identified key potential areas for
   future research, including studies on the limits and barriers for
   adaptation, studies using specific conceptual and methodological
   approaches, and studies focussing on the top-producing countries such as
   China, Indonesia, Peru and Russia. This analysis gives broader insights
   to the fisheries industry and to climate change adaptation research to
   proceed in the face of new global challenges.},

Abstract = {Generating electricity from renewable energy rather than fossil fuels
   offers significant benefits for the environment and the sustainable
   development. Solar energy is tremendously more abundant than any other
   renewable energy source on the planet and locally available. The present
   paper provides an extensive literature review of grid-connected PV
   systems supplying agricultural family farms and assesses their energy
   performance. The case study was cattle farms in the Chlef district
   (North-West of Algeria). A typical farm was chosen for this region in
   order to establish load profile according to monthly electrical bills.
   The results showed that 49\% of the total on-farm electricity
   consumption was from renewable energy. Furthermore, an economic and
   environmental analysis was performed in order to investigate the
   performance of the on-farm PV system introduction. A sensitivity
   analysis was realized by changing some economic parameters such as the
   electricity sellback price and the project lifetime. The study
   demonstrates the economic viability and the environmental sustainability
   of the proposed system. The generalization of the proposed systems to
   all the Algerian farms will play an important role in the national
   electricity generation and greenhouse gas mitigation.},

Abstract = {The growth of phytoplankton over much of the ocean is limited by the
   availability of nitrogen in the upper sunlit region of the ocean. It is
   through photosynthesis that upper ocean carbon is exported to the deep
   ocean and replaced with carbon dioxide fluxed by physical processes from
   the atmosphere. The addition of nitrogen to the ocean surface waters has
   the potential to recycle the carbon released by burning fossil fuels. It
   is possible to predict the nitrogen needed by phytoplankton to absorb
   the carbon dioxide for, say, the IPCC emission scenario B. We have used
   a Redfield ratio of C:N:P of 130:16:1 and an efficiency of 70\%.
   It is of interest to compare the increase of carbon uptake due to the
   nitrogen nourishment required for greenhouse gas mitigation with the new
   primary production of the world's oceans. Not until the year 2100 would
   the primary production need to be doubled under such a carbon dioxide
   stabilisation scheme. This is in contrast with terrestrial regions where
   some modellers estimate that, in order to feed the population increases
   predicted by the United Nations, the new primary production on land will
   need to double by 2020.
   The addition of nitrogen to the upper ocean, as well as sequestering CO2
   can be expected to increase the fish landings. If one assumes that the
   fisheries production rises in proportion to new primary production of
   the oceans, then each tonne of nitrogen taken up in the upper ocean
   would increase the fish landings by order 260 Kg.},

Abstract = {Flood and coastal erosion risk management has always faced the challenge
   of decision making in the face of multiple uncertainties relating to the
   climate, the economy and society. Traditionally, this has been addressed
   by adopting a precautionary approach that seeks to protect against a
   reasonable worst case. However, a managed adaptive approach can offer
   advantages. The benefits include improved resilience to negative
   changes, enabling opportunities from positive changes and greater cost
   effectiveness. The absence of clear methods and tools to value adaptive
   approaches has been recognised as an obstacle to wider adoption. This
   paper proposes a staged approach to building in adaptive capacity, which
   systematically analyses uncertainties, identifies opportunities to
   incorporate adaptability and appraises benefits through the analysis of
   decision trees. A case study is presented. The methodology is set in the
   context of appraisal processes used in England by the Environment
   Agency, based on cost-benefit analysis guidance issued by HM Treasury.
   The approach is transferable to other situations worldwide, where
   decision making is based on quantified assessment of costs and benefits.
   The work should help decision makers fully appraise the benefits of
   building in adaptive capacity and make the economic and technical case
   for adaptive flood risk management in an uncertain environment.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies for minimizing heat wave induced morbidity and its
   determinants},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {95-103},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Heat waves pose serious health threats to human mortality and morbidity
   in many countries, including Pakistan. There are various factors that
   contribute towards heat wave induced morbidity and several adaptation
   measures are at disposal to avoid adverse effects on human health. This
   research was designed to examine different adaptation measures taken by
   the respondents and to estimate the determinants of heat wave induced
   morbidity. The sampling design consisted of primary data collection from
   251 respondents in urban and peri-urban areas of Faisalabad, being one
   of the big cities in Pakistan, using a pre-tested questionnaire. The
   most common adaptation strategies were identified and an index of
   adaptation strategies was generated. The determinants of the number of
   patients in a family suffering from heat waves were estimated using
   Poisson regression model. The research findings revealed approximately
   the same adaptation scores of both urban and peri-urban respondents
   indicating no differences in adaptation level of both groups. The most
   commonly used adaptation strategies during heat waves included using
   plenty of water, and juices, increasing the number of baths, using an
   umbrella, cloth/cap, wearing sunglasses, and using green sheets/chicks
   in the house. The most important and statistically significant
   determinants of heat wave induced morbidity were the adaptation to heat
   waves (captured by adaptation score), urban/peri-urban background,
   family size, the number of males, and high income. Thus, it was
   concluded that the adaptation practices have strong health implications
   in the face of health challenges posed by heat waves. Based on the
   research findings, it is suggested that the health policies aimed at
   reducing the health impacts of heat waves may focus on awareness
   campaigns on available adaptation strategies through different media
   sources, widening access to health facilities, and extending swimming
   facilities particularly in urban areas. These strategies are important
   policy interventions to reduce vulnerability of population to heat
   waves.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite-2 (GOSAT-2) will be launched in
   fiscal year 2017. GOSAT-2 will be equipped with two Earth-observing
   instruments: the thermal and near-infrared sensor for carbon observation
   Fourier transform spectrometer 2 (TANSO-FTS-2) and TANSO-cloud and
   aerosol imager 2 (CAI-2). The FTS-2 data will be used to determine
   atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as CO2 (carbon
   dioxide), CH4 (methane) and CO (carbon monoxide). CAI-2 is a push-broom
   imaging sensor that has forward-and backward-looking bands for observing
   the optical properties of aerosols and clouds, and for monitoring the
   status of urban air pollution and transboundary air pollution over
   oceans. An important role of CAI-2 is to perform cloud discrimination in
   each direction. The Cloud and Aerosol Unbiased Decision Intellectual
   Algorithm (CLAUDIA) will be used for cloud discrimination with CAI-2.
   The Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard the Terra
   spacecraft provides radiometrically and geometrically calibrated images
   for spectral bands at nine widely spaced angles. In this study, we
   examined the difference between forward and backward cloud
   discrimination by using CLAUDIA with Terra MISR data. The results were
   as follows: (1) in land areas and polar regions, cloud discrimination
   results obtained with either band could be used; and (2) in sea areas,
   cloud discrimination results that include no-sun-glint regions should be
   used.},

Abstract = {A fuel levy is one of the market-based measures (MBMs) currently under
   consideration at the International Maritime Organization. MBMs have been
   proposed to improve the energy efficiency of the shipping sector and
   reduce its emissions. This paper analyses the economic and environmental
   implications of two types of levy on shipping bunker fuels by means of
   an analytical model built on the cobweb theorem. A unit-tax per ton of
   fuel and an ad-valorem tax, enforced as a percentage of fuel prices, are
   examined. In both cases, a speed and fuel-consumption reduction
   equivalent to an improvement in the energy efficiency of the sector
   would be expected as a result of the regulation enforcement. The speed
   reduction in the unit-tax case depends on fuel prices and the tax
   amount, whereas in the ad-valorem case it relies upon the enforced tax
   percentage.
   Both schemes lead to industry profit decline, the extent of which depend
   on the structure of the levy and market conditions. Since there is
   concern that the costs resulting from the policy will be passed from
   shipping companies to their customers along the supply chain, the paper
   dwells on how the costs arising from the enforcement of the levy will be
   actually allocated between shipowners and operators, and cargo-owners.
   In a market characterised by high freight rates and with no or limited
   excess capacity, a higher percentage of the total tax amount is
   transferred from ship-owners to shippers. In case of a recession the
   opposite happens.},

   Capacity: A Structured Learning Approach},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {346-364},
Abstract = {Climate adaptation planning provides an opportunity to enhance the
   adaptive capacity of stakeholders across multiple levels. However,
   reviews of standard top-down and bottom-up approaches indicate that the
   value of multistakeholder involvement is not fully recognized or
   incorporated into guidelines. Focusing on provinces in Indonesia and
   Papua New Guinea within the Coral Triangle region, we present a novel
   integrated top-down and bottom-up planning approach. Based on
   Participatory Systemic Inquiry the process involves three stages of
   workshops intentionally designed to promote social learning, knowledge
   exchange, empowerment and social networks among multilevel stakeholders.
   Stage 1 workshops engage government, nongovernment and science
   stakeholders at the provincial level to analyze sub-districts'
   vulnerability and design appropriate adaptation strategies. Stage 2
   engages local government, non-government and community stakeholders
   within vulnerable sub-districts identified in Stage 1. Stage 3 combines
   Stage 1 and 2 stakeholders to refine adaptation strategies and design
   action plans for sub-districts. Evaluation demonstrated that different
   stakeholder groups' perceptions of community adaptation needs varied
   significantly, justifying the approach. In terms of adaptive capacity,
   the primary outcome for all stakeholder groups was innovative ideas,
   suggesting that social learning and knowledge exchange had occurred.
   Empowerment was a secondary outcome. We discuss how the approach could
   be further refined.},

Title = {Comparison of Salinity Dependent Mechanical Behaviours of Geopolymer and

Journal = {ENGINEER-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS SRI LANKA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Global warming is a severe issue in which the emission of greenhouse
   gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), plays a vital role. Methods that
   are proposed to mitigate CO2 emissions include improving the energy
   conversion efficiency of fossil fuels, shifting energy production to low
   carbon sources, enhancing CO2 uptake by terrestrial and marine biomass
   and capturing CO2 and storing it deep underground. Of all the methods,
   carbon capture and storage (CCS) deep underground is the best way to
   reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases which is often responsible for
   global warming. One of the major issues faced when storing CO2 in
   depleted oil or gas reservoirs is its leakage through the injection
   wells. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) based well-cement has been used in
   these oil and gas wells. OPC, however, has issues such as cement
   degradation, leakage, strength reduction, and durability reduction when
   used in down-hole environments. Geopolymer can be a good alternative to
   OPC because of its excellent acid resistance characteristics, high
   strength and low shrinkage. In a typical wellbore, wellcement will be
   exposed to saline water that can have different salinity levels. Hence,
   the main aim of this study was to compare the mechanical behaviours of
   OPC and geopolymer cement cured in saline water for 7, 28 and 45 days at
   different salinity levels (0 \%, 10 \%, 20 \%, 30 \% and 40 \% of NaCl).
   A series of experiments were conducted to compare the compressive
   strength and Young's modulus of OPC and geopolymer. It was observed that
   the compressive strength of OPC based well-cement increases as the
   salinity level of the brine water is increased up to 10 \% NaCl and that
   it thereafter decreases as the NaCl percentage is further increased. On
   the other hand, the compressive strength of geopolymer well-cement
   generally increases as the brine concentration is increased. Based on
   the findings of this research, it can be concluded that geopolymer as a
   well-cement can perform better in saline water than OPC based
   well-cement, and that therefore geopolymer is suitable as a primary
   well-cement material.},

Title = {Hydrological Conditions Influence Soil and Methane-Cycling Microbial
   Populations in Seasonally Saturated Wetlands},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Seasonally saturated wetlands are hydrologically dynamic ecosystems that
   provide various ecosystem services; however, their variable hydrologic
   conditions may promote greenhouse gas emissions. The extent to which
   wetlands produce and emit greenhouse gases is intimately tied to the
   underlying microbial community. We established a linear transect
   spanning a hydrologic gradient on the margins adjacent to five
   seasonally saturated wetlands to characterize how water level,
   saturation duration, and frequency of wet-dry cycles influenced the soil
   and methane-cycling microbial community composition. We found that the
   soil and methane-cycling microbial community diversity and structure
   were strongly related to water level changes and saturation duration but
   not saturation frequency. Soils that experienced inundation or
   saturation for more than 50\% of the year harbored a soil microbial
   composition distinct from soils that were rarely saturated or inundated.
   While soils closer to the wetland basin supported a higher relative
   abundance of methanogens, methane-oxidizing microbes were present across
   the entire topographic gradient; however, the composition shifted from a
   primarily anaerobic to aerobic methanotroph community. Findings suggest
   that soil and methane cycling microorganisms are influenced by the
   soil's hydrologic conditions, with methane producers being restricted to
   specific ranges and methane oxidizers able to occur under a variety of
   hydrologic conditions. The mechanisms driving methane oxidation by the
   latter, however, may depend on the hydrologic conditions.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Community resilience is increasingly required to adapt to the effects of
   the frequency and severity of the ever-increasing number of coastal
   hazards. This paper uses the case study of the city of Banda Aceh,
   Indonesia, which was devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, with
   the aim of investigating the city's level of resilience towards coastal
   hazards. This paper aims to: (i) assess the preparedness of coastal
   communities; (ii) evaluate the level of resilience of the city to
   coastal hazards; and (iii) formulate strategic steps in an effort to
   mitigate coastal hazards in Banda Aceh. The evaluation was conducted
   using mixed methods (both quantitative and qualitative) through data
   triangulation. Data collection involved 311 household surveys, two focus
   group discussions with 30 participants, and interviews with seven
   representatives from government and non-government organisations.
   Regarding the survey, the preparedness level of Banda Aceh's residents
   is categorised as ``low{''}. The results of overall city resilience
   assessments are also classified as ``low{''}. This finding indicates
   that more planned, systematic, and sustainable efforts are needed.
   Hence, this study also recommends strategies to enhance resilience in
   dealing with coastal hazards.},

Title = {Climate change mitigation: resilience indicators for roof solutions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {4-17},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to increase the resilience of building
   systems, especially roofs, in relation to climate changes. The focus is
   on Mediterranean cities, where, often, there is no regulation about
   these issues. Therefore, it is necessary to define resilience indicators
   through comparative studies of adaptive roof solutions to mitigate
   overheating in summer.\& para;\& para;Design/methodology/approach -
   Through software simulations and data comparison, a specific
   methodological approach is used to analyze the resilience levels of
   different roof solutions (phase change materials, aerogel, green and
   cool roof), starting from energy efficiency as a prerequisite of
   resilience. Moreover, a case study of a historic existing building in a
   southern Italian town is examined.\& para;\& para;Findings - The
   findings show the best strategies for building systems, especially for
   roofs, to dean urban heat island effects according to the defined
   resilience indicators against overheating mitigation.\& para;\&
   para;Research limitations/implications - Other building systems, such as
   facades, also have to be investigated in relation to climate change
   mitigation.\& para;\& para;Practical implications - The implementation
   of resilient solutions that can also affect neighborhood for urban heat
   island mitigation.\& para;\& para;Social implications - Because of
   resilience indicators definition, it is easier to introduce economic
   incentives according to reference thresholds and to increase community
   involvement.\& para;\& para;Originality/value - The paper provides a new
   approach for the evaluation of technological solutions for a building
   from a resilience point of view, which has energy efficiency as
   pre-condition.},

Abstract = {The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) is an endangered, island-endemic
   species with a naturally restricted distribution. Despite this, no
   previous studies have attempted to predict the effects of climate change
   on this iconic species. We used extensive Komodo dragon monitoring data,
   climate, and sea-level change projections to build spatially explicit
   demographic models for the Komodo dragon. These models project the
   species' future range and abundance under multiple climate change
   scenarios. We ran over one million model simulations with varying model
   parameters, enabling us to incorporate uncertainty introduced from three
   main sources: (a) structure of global climate models, (b) choice of
   greenhouse gas emission trajectories, and (c) estimates of Komodo dragon
   demographic parameters. Our models predict a reduction in range-wide
   Komodo dragon habitat of 8\%-87\% by 2050, leading to a decrease in
   habitat patch occupancy of 25\%-97\% and declines of 27\%-99\% in
   abundance across the species' range. We show that the risk of
   extirpation on the two largest protected islands in Komodo National Park
   (Rinca and Komodo) was lower than other island populations, providing
   important safe havens for Komodo dragons under global warming. Given the
   severity and rate of the predicted changes to Komodo dragon habitat
   patch occupancy (a proxy for area of occupancy) and abundance, urgent
   conservation actions are required to avoid risk of extinction. These
   should, as a priority, be focused on managing habitat on the islands of
   Komodo and Rinca, reflecting these islands' status as important refuges
   for the species in a warming world. Variability in our model projections
   highlights the importance of accounting for uncertainties in demographic
   and environmental parameters, structural assumptions of global climate
   models, and greenhouse gas emission scenarios when simulating species
   metapopulation dynamics under climate change.},

Abstract = {In recent years, trees have been one of the well studied organic carbon
   (C) pools in urban areas. As they are recognized as important storage
   sites for carbon dioxide (CO2), which constitutes the primary greenhouse
   gas, biological C sequestration in woody plants is suggested as a
   potential mitigation tool for C emission reduction in cities. Despite
   this significant contribution of trees, they are not benefited
   sufficiently in developing countries due mainly to the lack of tree
   inventory data in urban ecosystems (streets, parks etc.) and inadequate
   knowledge about their potential in C mitigation. The aim of this paper
   is to put forward quantitatively the C sequestration and storage of a
   campus area, which is an important semi-public green area in Ankara's
   city center.
   Results of the study showed that in 2015 total sequestered CO2 in Ankara
   University's campus trees was 179,353.04 kg According to our
   calculations, the trees stored 1,608,132.39 kg CO2 since the
   establishment of the campus in 1942.},

Title = {Living Shorelines: Coastal Resilience with a Blue Carbon Benefit},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Living shorelines are a type of estuarine shoreline erosion control that
   incorporates native vegetation and preserves native habitats. Because
   they provide the ecosystem services associated with natural coastal
   wetlands while also increasing shoreline resilience, living shorelines
   are part of the natural and hybrid infrastructure approach to coastal
   resiliency. Marshes created as living shorelines are typically narrow (<
   30 m) fringing marshes with sandy substrates that are well flushed by
   tides. These characteristics distinguish living shorelines from the
   larger meadow marshes in which most of the current knowledge about
   created marshes was developed. The value of living shorelines for
   providing both erosion control and habitat for estuarine organisms has
   been documented but their capacity for carbon sequestration has not. We
   measured carbon sequestration rates in living shorelines and sandy
   transplanted Spartina alterniflora marshes in the Newport River Estuary,
   North Carolina. The marshes sampled here range in age from 12 to 38
   years and represent a continuum of soil development. Carbon
   sequestration rates ranged from 58 to 283 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and decreased
   with marsh age. The pattern of lower sequestration rates in older
   marshes is hypothesized to be the result of a relative enrichment of
   labile organic matter in younger sites and illustrates the importance of
   choosing mature marshes for determination of long-term carbon
   sequestration potential. The data presented here are within the range of
   published carbon sequestration rates for S. alterniflora marshes and
   suggest that wide-scale use of the living shoreline approach to
   shoreline management may come with a substantial carbon benefit.},

Title = {Microbial and Environmental Controls of Methane Fluxes Along a Soil
   Moisture Gradient in a Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1255-1270},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Most studies of greenhouse gas fluxes from forest soils in the coastal
   rainforest have considered carbon dioxide (CO2), whereas methane (CH4)
   has not received the same attention. Soil hydrology is a key driver of
   CH4 dynamics in ecosystems, but the impact on the function and
   distribution of the underlying microbial communities involved in CH4
   cycling and the resultant net CH4 exchange is not well understood at
   this scale. We studied the growing season variations of in situ CH4
   fluxes, microbial gene abundances of methanotrophs (CH4 oxidizers) and
   methanogens (CH4 producers), soil hydrology, and nutrient availability
   in three typical forest types across a soil moisture gradient. CH4
   displayed a spatial variability changing from a net uptake in the upland
   soils (3.9-46 A mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) to a net emission in the wetter
   soils (0-90 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Seasonal variations of CH4 fluxes
   were related to soil hydrology in both upland and wet soils. Thus, in
   the upland soils, uptake rates increased with the decreasing soil
   moisture, whereas CH4 emission was inversely related to the water table
   depth in the wet soils. Spatial variability of CH4 exchange was related
   to the abundance of genes involved in CH4 oxidation and production, but
   there was no indication of a temporal link between microbial groups and
   CH4 exchange. Our data show that the abundances of genes involved in CH4
   oxidation and production are strongly influenced by soil moisture and
   each other and grouped by the upland-wetland classification but not
   forest type.},

Abstract = {Social pressure exerted by urban development, the increase in erosion on
   many coastal stretches, and the rise in sea level due to climate change
   over the last few decades have led governments to increase investment in
   coastal protection. In turn, a reduction in costs and increases in ease
   of construction and rate of implementation have led to sand-filled
   geotextile elements, such as bags, tubes, and containers, becoming an
   alternative or supplement to traditional coastal defence materials, such
   as rubble mounds, concrete, and so on. Not all coastal zones are
   appropriate for sand-filled geotextile structures as coastal defences.
   This article analyses suitable zones for locating geotextile bag
   revetments to protect coasts from storm erosion and concludes that the
   least suitable zones are the surf zone (on an open coast and on a
   slightly protected coast) and deep water (on an open coast), except if a
   suitable reinforcement is carried out when the demand makes it necessary
   this build this kind of defence.},

   mass loss},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {305+},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Glacier mass loss is a key contributor to sea-level change(1,2), slope
   instability in high-mountain regions(3,4) and the changing seasonality
   and volume of river flow(5-7). Understanding the causes, mechanisms and
   time scales of glacier change is therefore paramount to identifying
   successful strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Here, we use
   temperature and precipitation fields from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 output to force a glacier evolution
   model, quantifying mass responses to future climatic change. We find
   that contemporary glacier mass is in disequilibrium with the current
   climate, and 36 +/- 8\% mass loss is already committed in response to
   past greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, mitigating future emissions
   will have only very limited influence on glacier mass change in the
   twenty-first century. No significant differences between 1.5 and 2 K
   warming scenarios are detectable in the sea-level contribution of
   glaciers accumulated within the twenty-first century. In the long-term,
   however, mitigation will exert strong control, suggesting that ambitious
   measures are necessary for the long-term preservation of glaciers.},

Title = {Restoring tides to reduce methane emissions in impounded wetlands: A new
   and potent Blue Carbon climate change intervention},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are sites of rapid carbon (C) sequestration and contain
   large soil C stocks. Thus, there is increasing interest in those
   ecosystems as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset
   projects (sometimes referred to as ``Blue Carbon{''}), through
   preservation of existing C stocks or creation of new wetlands to
   increase future sequestration. Here we show that in the
   globally-widespread occurrence of diked, impounded, drained and
   tidally-restricted salt marshes, substantial methane (CH4) and CO2
   emission reductions can be achieved through restoration of disconnected
   saline tidal flows. Modeled climatic forcing indicates that tidal
   restoration to reduce emissions has a much greater impact per unit area
   than wetland creation or conservation to enhance sequestration. Given
   that GHG emissions in tidally-restricted, degraded wetlands are caused
   by human activity, they are anthropogenic emissions, and reducing them
   will have an effect on climate that is equivalent to reduced emission of
   an equal quantity of fossil fuel GHG. Thus, as a landuse-based climate
   change intervention, reducing CH4 emissions is an entirely distinct
   concept from biological C sequestration projects to enhance C storage in
   forest or wetland biomass or soil, and will not suffer from the
   non-permanence risk that stored C will be returned to the atmosphere.},

Title = {Rapid 20th century warming reverses 900-year cooling in the Gulf of
   Maine},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {The Gulf of Maine, located in the western North Atlantic, has undergone
   recent, rapid ocean warming but the lack of long-term, instrumental
   records hampers the ability to put these significant hydrographic
   changes into context. Here we present multiple 300-year long geochemical
   records (oxygen, nitrogen, and previously published radiocarbon
   isotopes) measured in absolutely-dated Arctica islandica shells from the
   western Gulf of Maine. These records, in combination with climate model
   simulations, suggest that the Gulf of Maine underwent a long-term
   cooling over most of the last 1000 years, driven primarily by volcanic
   forcing and North Atlantic ocean dynamics. This cooling trend was
   reversed by warming beginning in the late 1800s, likely due to increased
   atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and changes in western North
   Atlantic circulation. The climate model simulations suggest that the
   warming over the last century was more rapid than almost any other
   100-year period in the last 1000 years in the region.
   Warming in the Gulf of Maine, western North Atlantic, since the late
   1800s reversed a 900-year cooling trend, likely as a result of
   increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases, according to ocean temperature
   and water mass reconstructions from bivalves and climate model
   simulations.},

Title = {Emissions tradeoffs among alternative marine fuels: Total fuel cycle
   analysis of residual oil, marine gas oil, and marine diesel oil},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Worldwide concerns about sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships are
   motivating the replacement of marine residual oil (RO) with cleaner,
   lower-sulfur fuels, such as marine gas oil (MGO) and marine diesel oil
   (MDO). Vessel operators can use MGO and MDO directly or blended with RO
   to achieve environmental and economic objectives. Although expected to
   be much cleaner in terms of criteria pollutants, these fuels require
   additional energy in the upstream stages of the fuel cycle (i.e., fuel
   processing and refining), and thus raise questions about the net impacts
   on greenhouse gas emissions (primarily carbon dioxide {[}CO2]) because
   of production and use. This paper applies the Total Energy and
   Environmental Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model to conduct a
   total fuel cycle analysis of RO, MGO, MDO, and associated blends for a
   typical container ship. MGO and MDO blends achieve significant (70-85\%)
   SOx emissions reductions compared with RO across a range of fuel quality
   and refining efficiency assumptions. We estimate CO2 increases of less
   than 1\% using best estimates of fuel quality and refinery efficiency
   parameters and demonstrate how these results vary based on parameter
   assumptions. Our analysis suggests that product refining efficiency
   influences the CO2 tradeoff more than differences in the physical and
   energy parameters of the alternative fuels, suggesting that modest
   increases in CO2 could be offset by efficiency improvements at some
   refineries. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of greenhouse
   gas tradeoffs associated with fuel switching and other emissions control
   policies.},

   observation network},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {429-442},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Research on carbon gas flux to and from inland waters has increased over
   the past two decades, driven mainly by the need to understand (1) the
   global carbon budget in regard to stabilizing earth's climate, and (2)
   how aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide change in response
   to anthropogenic pressures like climate and land use change. This paper
   reviews carbon flux research in support of a proposed global carbon
   monitoring network to inform public policy. It begins with an overview
   of the physical-chemical processes and quantification tools for carbon
   gas flux, and then highlights their application to streams, rivers,
   lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. Research outcomes to date point to
   spatiotemporal coverage gaps owing to the complexity of the aquatic
   ecosystems and land-water interactions, suggesting that long-term
   monitoring is needed to better understand their signals in response to
   changes in climate and land management. While better monitoring of gas
   flux is an important piece of the global carbon budget resolution
   problem, new information will need to be developed and integrated to
   adequately inform carbon policymaking. This information can stem from
   developments in large-scale carbon status and flux assessment tools,
   such as via remote sensing platforms, and from improved integrated
   watershed-to-water body modeling efforts.},

Pages = {194-218},
Abstract = {This paper examines our understanding of climate change, as well as the
   reluctance of industrial societies to deal with the drivers, especially
   the burning of the fossil fuels, before the future consequences become
   catastrophic. We describe how the energy balance of the Earth, oceans,
   land and Arctic sea ice are maintained, and how climate is warming and
   changing with increases in the three most important greenhouse gases:
   carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, water vapor from evaporation
   off a warmer ocean, and methane from several sources. We discuss the
   Earth's water cycle and the role of evaporation, latent heat and
   condensation in driving storms, transporting energy poleward and giving
   increasing precipitation extremes, floods, droughts and fires. We review
   the increasing challenge of meeting human demand for water as water
   tables are falling globally from increased pumping, and winter snowpack
   storage is shrinking. We discuss rising sea level, the challenges of
   long-term carbon storage and the lessons from the past four ice age
   cycles. The text is written for scientific and public audiences, both
   global and in the US, so metric and US units are given. The social,
   moral and ethical choices are mapped by contrasting the Earth-centered
   indigenous worldview needed for our survival with the industrial mindset
   that is willing to destroy a stable climate to keep the profits of the
   current economy growing. We review the long history of the misuse of
   human power, the rise of science and technology without a guiding moral
   framework, and how neoliberal capitalism by default makes choices that
   are driving rapid climate change. We outline how deceit by the matrix of
   corporations and fossil fuel interests that we call the Fossil Empire
   has prevented government regulation for decades and accelerated the
   climate crisis.},

Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to have a range of impacts on Pacific Island
   ecosystems and the services they provide for current and future
   development. There are a number of characteristics that can make
   adaptation approaches that utilise the benefits of ecosystems a
   compelling and viable alternative to other adaptation approaches. The
   objective of this paper is to determine what level of relative influence
   technical and planning considerations currently have in guiding the
   recognition and application of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)
   approaches in the Pacific Islands context. The technical feasibility of
   EbA in relation to the expected impacts of climate change and the
   compatibility of adaptation planning processes of the Pacific Islands
   with EbA requirements was considered. The main barrier to fully
   implementing EbA in the Pacific Islands is not likely to be financial
   capital, but a combination of stable technical capacity within
   government departments to advise communities on EbA opportunities and
   the compatibility of planning frameworks.},

Title = {Analyzing community resilience as an emergent property of dynamic
   social-ecological systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Community resilience is widely promoted so that communities can respond
   positively to a range of risks, including shocks, extreme events, and
   other changes. Although much research has identified characteristics or
   capacities that confer resilience, resilience is more than simply the
   sum of these. Resilience is an emergent property-the capacities are
   linked and act together. We present an empirical analysis of five
   different capacities and assess how interactions between them confer
   resilience in two coastal communities in Cornwall, UK. These capacities
   are place attachment, leadership, community cohesion and efficacy,
   community networks, and knowledge and learning. Based on a survey and
   focus group discussions, our results show that residents draw on these
   capacities in different combinations, enabling resilience in diverse
   ways. This provides a dynamic and socially nuanced perspective on
   community resilience as process, potentially informing theory and
   practice of conservation, disaster risk reduction, climate change
   adaptation, and community development.},

Title = {Plant litter amendments in restored wetland soils altered microbial
   communities more than clay additions},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {147},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wetland restoration efforts aim to enhance the structure and function of
   degraded and damaged wetlands. Unfortunately, restoration techniques
   often alter a site's soil habitat and plant community structure, which
   affect the activity and composition of microbial communities. Microbial
   community structure and activity, as a function of soil texture and
   plant inputs, were studied in soils collected from a restored and a
   natural tidal freshwater wetland for a period of nine weeks. We expected
   that increasing the clay content of restored soils from 13\% to 20\% and
   30\% would increase soil C retention via sorption and reduce the carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions. To elucidate the role of
   plant inputs in shaping the microbial community and function, plant
   litter with contrasting C-to-nitrogen (N) ratios were added to test the
   hypothesis that a greater portion of plant leaf-C from the nutrient-poor
   plant, Phragmites australis, would be mineralized to CO2 and CH4 than
   the nutrient-rich plant, Peltandra virginica. We also expected P.
   virginica would support a more abundant and diverse microbial community
   than P. australis. Unexpectedly, we found that increasing the clay
   content of restored soils caused a marginal reduction in the total
   amount of C partitioned as CO2 and CH4, while the nutrient-rich plant,
   P. virginica, emitted more CO2 and CH4 than the nutrient-poor plant, P.
   australis. Furthermore, clay and plant leaf litter amendments had a
   greater impact on the size, diversity, and composition of the microbial
   population in restored than natural wetland soils. Overall, we found
   that increasing clay content in a restored wetland had a limited effect
   on soil C retention. We also discovered that plant litter significantly
   altered the underlying structure of the microbial community in restored
   wetland soils, suggesting greater plant diversity may lead to a more
   stable, resilient microbial community.},

Abstract = {Geologic carbon from seafloor volcanism may influence late Pleistocene
   glacial terminations by increasing the global inventory of the
   greenhouse gas CO2. However, the evidence for geologic carbon flux
   associated with deep sea volcanism has been, so far, equivocal. Here, we
   construct a regional, glacial-deglacial carbon budget of the
   volcanically active Gulf of California using microfossil C-14
   measurements and find results consistent with an increased addition of
   geologic carbon related to local seafloor volcanism during the
   deglaciation. Our estimates point to enhanced geologic carbon flux both
   before and during the last deglaciation that generally occur alongside
   carbonate preservation. This leads us to suggest that the carbon was
   added in the form of partially neutralized, C-14-free bicarbonate
   associated with known Gulf sedimentary processes-a carbon source that
   would have a minimal effect on atmospheric CO2.},

Abstract = {The greenhouse effect has brought about a series of ecological and
   environmental problems such as wind intensification, species extinction,
   acid rain, awful weather, sea-level rise, which are mainly caused by CO2
   among all greenhouse gases. It is an effective way to alleviate the
   problem by injecting CO2 into shale reservoir. Such technology is the
   focus of attention of government and the public, and has been provided
   with well-established mathematical models and simulation software.
   While, compared to the mature development of this technology abroad,
   China is still on emerging state and studies on CO2 storage under shale
   reservoir was just launched. Given the current situation of domestic
   studies, this paper mainly probes into the mechanism of CO2 storage
   under shale reservoir, influencing factors, and provides the
   mathematical model for enhancing recovery of CO2 storage under shale
   reservoir based on dual medium hypothesis, in which, are viscous flow,
   molecular diffusion, coupling effect of Knudsen diffusion mechanism are
   taken into consideration. And then this paper develops the channeling
   equation with an eye to the coupling migration mechanism, provides
   source sink term model for production well and injection well, and gives
   research on numerical simulation. Finally, this paper discusses
   feasibility of enhancing recovery of CO2 storage under shale gas
   reservoir and analyzes the dynamic changes of CO2 storage volume and CH4
   production volume during injection of CO2.},

Title = {Impacts of Enhanced-Efficiency Nitrogen Fertilizers on Greenhouse Gas
   Emissions in a Coastal Plain Soil under Cotton},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1699-1710},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers (EENFs) have the potential to increase
   crop yield while decreasing soil N loss. However, the effect of EENFs on
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different agricultural systems is
   not well understood. Thus, studies from a variety of locations and
   cropping systems are needed to evaluate their impact. An experiment was
   initiated on a Coastal Plain soil under cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
   production for comparing EENFs to traditional sources. Nitrogen sources
   included urea, ammonia sulfate (AS), urea-ammonia sulfate (UAS),
   controlled-release, polymer-coated urea (Environmental Smart Nitrogen
   {[}ESN]), stabilized granular urea (SuperU), poultry litter (PL),
   poultry litter plus AgrotainPlus (PLA), and an unfertilized control.
   Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) fluxes were
   monitored regularly after fertilization through harvest from 2009 to
   2011 using a closed-chamber method. Poultry litter and PLA had higher
   CO2 flux than other N treatments, while ESN and SU were generally lowest
   following fertilization. Nitrous oxide fluxes were highly variable and
   rarely affected by N treatments; PL and PLA were higher but only during
   the few samplings in 2010 and 2011. Methane fluxes were higher in 2009
   (wet year) than 2010 or 2011, and N treatments had minimal impact.
   Global warming potential (GWP), calculated from cumulative GHG fluxes,
   was highest with PL and PLA and lowest for control, UAS, ESN, and SU.
   Results suggest that PL application to cotton increases GHG flux, but
   GHG flux reductions from EENFs were infrequently different from standard
   inorganic fertilizers, suggesting their higher cost may render them
   presently impractical.},

Title = {An assessment of the physical impacts of sea-level rise and coastal
   adaptation: a case study of the eastern coast of Ghana},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {114},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise is a major coastal issue in the 21st century because many
   of the world's built assets are located in the coastal zone. Coastal
   erosion and flooding are serious threats along the coast of Ghana,
   particularly, the eastern coast where the Volta delta is located. Past
   human interventions, climate change and the resultant rise in
   sea-levels, increased storm intensity and torrential rainfall have been
   blamed for these problems. Accelerated sea-level rise and storm surge
   pose serious threat to coastal habitat, bio-diversity and socio-economic
   activities in the coastal zone of Ghana and elsewhere. There is the need
   for an holistic assessment of the impacts of sea-level rise on the coast
   zone in order to formulate appropriate adaptation policies and
   strategies to mitigate the possible effects. Using the eastern coast of
   Ghana as a case study, this paper assesses the physical impacts of
   accelerated sea level rise and storm surge on the coastal environment.
   It evaluates adaptation policies and plans that could be implemented to
   accommodate the present and any future impacts. Field investigation and
   Geographic Information System (GIS) are among the methods used for the
   assessment. The outcome of the assessment has provided comprehensive
   knowledge of the potential impacts of accelerated sea-level rise and
   storm surge on the eastern coast. It has facilitated identification of
   management units, the appraisal of alternate adaptation policies and the
   selection of the best policy options based upon the local conditions and
   environmental sustainability. Among other things, this paper reveals
   that the eastern coast of Ghana is highly vulnerable to accelerated
   sea-level rise and therefore, requires sustainable adaptation policies
   and plans to manage the potential impacts. It recommends that various
   accommodation policies, which enable areas to be occupied for longer
   before eventual retreat, could be adapted to accommodate vulnerable
   settlements in the eastern coast of Ghana.},

   of human energy needs. However, from a ``green environment{''}
   perspective, can carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere be reduced
   and eliminated? The carbon economic circle is an ideal solution to this
   problem, as it enables us to store, use, and remove carbon dioxide. This
   research introduces the circular carbon economy (CCE) and addresses its
   economic importance. Additionally, the paper discusses carbon capture
   and storage (CCS), and the utilisation of CO2. Furthermore, it explains
   current technologies and their future applications on environmental
   impact, CO2 capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS). Various opinions
   on the best way to achieve zero carbon emissions and on CO2 applications
   and their economic impact are also discussed. The circular carbon
   economy can be achieved through a highly transparent global
   administration that is supportive of advanced technologies that
   contribute to the efficient utilisation of energy sources. This global
   administration must also provide facilities to modernise and develop
   factories and power stations, based on emission-reducing technologies.
   Monitoring emissions in countries through a global monitoring network
   system, based on actual field measurements, linked to a worldwide
   database allows all stakeholders to track the change in greenhouse gas
   emissions. The process of sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean is
   affected by the support for technologies and industries that adopt the
   principle of carbon recycling in order to maintain the balance. This
   includes supporting initiatives that contribute to increasing vegetation
   cover and preserving oceans from pollutants, especially chemicals and
   radioactive pollutants, which will undoubtedly affect the process of
   sequestering carbon dioxide in the oceans, and this will contribute
   significantly to maintaining carbon dioxide at acceptable levels.},

Abstract = {Global warming and the urban heat island effect in large towns and
   cities demand new approaches to cooling buildings in an efficient and
   sustainable way. Modern refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump
   (RACHP) systems can achieve a high coefficient of performance and low
   emissions, but refrigeration technology already accounts for around 15\%
   of worldwide electricity use and up to 10\% of all greenhouse gas
   emissions, so in the context of international agreements to reduce
   global greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80\% RACHP systems alone cannot
   provide a sustainable cooling solution for cities.
   The purpose of the model described in this paper is to provide a simple
   and easy to use tool to estimate the impact of different heating and
   cooling technologies, alternative building design and operating
   parameters and future global warming, on the energy demands and carbon
   emissions of buildings. Existing software tools for analysis of
   buildings can provide high quality results for a given scenario, but the
   determination of an optimal solution demands multiple simulations, which
   can be time consuming and require post processing to interpret the
   results. The Excel based tool uses a quasi-dynamic energy balance model
   and reduced weather data set to generate rapid results, allowing the
   user to view the building's temperature profile, energy demands and
   carbon emissions in near real time and to develop an optimum cooling
   strategy. Results are presented for a single building version of the
   tool. When fully developed, it will allow the user to model clusters of
   buildings in an urban environment.},

Title = {The role of interactions in a world implementing adaptation and
   mitigation solutions to climate change},
Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {369},

Abstract = {The papers in this volume discuss projections of climate change impacts
   upon humans and ecosystems under a global mean temperature rise of 4
   degrees C above preindustrial levels. Like most studies, they are mainly
   single-sector or single-region-based assessments. Even the multi-sector
   or multi-region approaches generally consider impacts in sectors and
   regions independently, ignoring interactions. Extreme weather and
   adaptation processes are often poorly represented and losses of
   ecosystem services induced by climate change or human adaptation are
   generally omitted. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing some
   potential interactions in a 4 degrees C world, and also makes a
   comparison with a 2 degrees C world. In a 4 degrees C world, major
   shifts in agricultural land use and increased drought are projected, and
   an increased human population might increasingly be concentrated in
   areas remaining wet enough for economic prosperity. Ecosystem services
   that enable prosperity would be declining, with carbon cycle feedbacks
   and fire causing forest losses. There is an urgent need for integrated
   assessments considering the synergy of impacts and limits to adaptation
   in multiple sectors and regions in a 4 degrees C world. By contrast, a 2
   degrees C world is projected to experience about one-half of the climate
   change impacts, with concomitantly smaller challenges for adaptation.
   Ecosystem services, including the carbon sink provided by the Earth's
   forests, would be expected to be largely preserved, with much less
   potential for interaction processes to increase challenges to
   adaptation. However, demands for land and water for biofuel cropping
   could reduce the availability of these resources for agricultural and
   natural systems. Hence, a whole system approach to mitigation and
   adaptation, considering interactions, potential human and species
   migration, allocation of land and water resources and ecosystem
   services, will be important in either a 2 degrees C or a 4 degrees C
   world.},

Abstract = {Measurements of aboveground and belowground biomass allocations are
   important for characterization of structure and function in marsh
   ecosystems as various processes such as carbon sequestration, gas
   transport, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem resilience are affected by
   these allocations. We measured aboveground and belowground biomass, root
   and rhizome characteristics, leaf area index (LAI), and carbon to
   nitrogen (C/N) ratio of various tissues of four tidal marsh species in
   New Jersey by harvesting biomass during peak growing season. The
   aboveground biomasses for Spartina patens, S. alterniflora, Phragmites
   australis, and Distichlis spicata were 2.3, 2.2, 1.7 and 1.2 kg m(-2),
   respectively. The ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass for S.
   alterniflora and D. spicata, harvested from a recently restored wetland
   were lower than in previous studies. LAI for S. alterniflora, D.
   spicata, P. australis, and S. patens were 8.4, 6.8, 4.8 and 3.7 m(2)
   m(-2), respectively. Diameter of rhizome and root, number of primary
   roots per node, root surface area to volume ratio, and C/N of various
   tissues varied with species. The measured above- and belowground
   biometric traits are crucial for a better understanding of carbon
   dynamics, and modeling greenhouse gas transport in marsh ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The growth of marine cyanobacteria at elevated CO2 levels is one of the
   feasible means to bioremediate the greenhouse gases. The present paper
   describes a marine filamentous cyanobacterium Phormidium valderianum BDU
   20041 that can grow at elevated CO2 levels (15\%), simulated and actual
   flue gas. Compared to ambient air and other tested CO2 concentrations,
   3\% CO2 showed higher biomass productivity, growth rate and carbon
   fixation rate. The organism was able to tolerate 15\% CO2 and the
   simulated flue gas conditions making it a strong candidate for
   microalgal carbon capture. The lipid content of P. valderianum BDU 20041
   at 15\% CO2, simulated and actual flue gas conditions was higher than
   the ambient air. The conditions tested, i.e. 15\% CO2, simulated and
   real flue gas show that this organism could be a potential entity in
   curbing carbon emission and a plausible biodiesel feedstock through
   hydrothermal liquefaction.},

Title = {Determining our climate policy future: expert opinions about negative
   emissions and solar radiation management pathways},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Negative emissions technologies and solar radiation management
   techniques could contribute towards climate stability, either by
   removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it permanently
   or reflecting sunlight away from the atmosphere. Despite concerns about
   them, such options are increasingly being discussed as crucial
   complements to traditional climate change mitigation and adaptation.
   Expectations around negative emissions and solar radiation management
   and their associated risks and costs shape public and private
   discussions of how society deals with the climate crisis. In this study,
   we rely on a large expert survey (N = 74) to critically examine the
   future potential of both negative emission options (e.g., carbon dioxide
   removal) and solar radiation management techniques. We designed a survey
   process that asked a pool of prominent experts questions about (i) the
   necessity of adopting negative emissions or solar radiation management
   options, (ii) the desirability of such options when ranked against each
   other, (iii) estimations of future efficacy in terms of temperature
   reductions achieved or gigatons of carbon removed, (iv) expectations
   about future scaling, commercialization, and deployment targets, and (v)
   potential risks and barriers. Unlike other elicitation processes where
   experts are more positive or have high expectations about novel options,
   our results are more critical and cautionary. We find that some options
   (notably afforestation and reforestation, ecosystem restoration, and
   soil carbon sequestration) are envisioned frequently as necessary,
   desirable, feasible, and affordable, with minimal risks and barriers
   (compared to other options). This contrasts with other options envisaged
   as unnecessary risky or costly, notably ocean alkalization or
   fertilization, space-based reflectors, high-altitude sunshades, and
   albedo management via clouds. Moreover, only the options of
   afforestation and reforestation and soil carbon sequestration are
   expected to be widely deployed before 2035, which raise very real
   concerns about climate and energy policy in the near- to mid-term.},

Abstract = {With growing concern about greenhouse gas emission, previous carbon
   capture and storage (CCS) research has mainly focused on efficient
   capture methods. However, there is a relative lack of studies on ship
   transport and offshore unloading. The available guidelines, if any, are
   simply suggested without a systematic analysis from the viewpoint of the
   optimal transport chain system. Thus, this study addresses the issue by
   modeling the ship-based transport network of CO2. In particular,
   liquefaction, boil off gas (BOG) reliquefaction and offshore unloading
   processes are investigated to provide essential guidelines in terms of
   an optimal thermodynamic state (pressure-temperature: P-T). Optimal
   compression ratio and pressure-enthalpy flash are implemented on each
   compression-intercooling-separation stage, and a conceptual model for
   BOG reliquefaction process is also proposed.},

Abstract = {Mass coral bleaching, resulting from the breakdown of coral-algal
   symbiosis has been identified as the most severe threat to coral reef
   survival on a global scale(1). Regionally, nutrient enrichment of reef
   waters is often associated with a significant loss of coral cover and
   diversity(2). Recently, increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   concentrations have been linked to a reduction of the temperature
   threshold of coral bleaching(3), a phenomenon for which no mechanistic
   explanation is available. Here we show that increased levels of
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen in combination with limited phosphate
   concentrations result in an increased susceptibility of corals to
   temperature- and light-induced bleaching. Mass spectrometric analyses of
   the algal lipidome revealed a marked accumulation of sulpholipids under
   these conditions. Together with increased phosphatase activities, this
   change indicates that the imbalanced supply of dissolved inorganic
   nitrogen results in phosphate starvation of the symbiotic algae. Based
   on these findings we introduce a conceptual model that links
   unfavourable ratios of dissolved inorganic nutrients in the water column
   with established mechanisms of coral bleaching. Notably, this model
   improves the understanding of the detrimental effects of coastal
   nutrient enrichment on coral reefs, which is urgently required to
   support knowledge-based management strategies to mitigate the effects of
   climate change.},

Abstract = {A coupled climate model with poleward-intensified westerly winds
   simulates significantly higher storage of heat and anthropogenic carbon
   dioxide by the Southern Ocean in the future when compared with the
   storage in a model with initially weaker, equatorward-biased westerlies.
   This difference results from the larger outcrop area of the dense waters
   around Antarctica and more vigorous divergence, which remains robust
   even as rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels induce warming that
   reduces the density of surface waters in the Southern Ocean. These
   results imply that the impact of warming on the stratification of the
   global ocean may be reduced by the poleward intensification of the
   westerlies, allowing the ocean to remove additional heat and
   anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.},

Title = {A review on integration of renewable energy processes in vapor
   absorption chiller for sustainable cooling},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The building industry consumes a substantial amount of energy,
   particularly for heating and cooling, and so contributes significantly
   to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The vapor absorption chiller (VAC) is
   one of the most often used cold generating systems for medium and
   large-scale cooling supplies. Buildings have tended to more commonly use
   VACs to meet their cooling comfort demands in recent years due to their
   cost-effectiveness and flexibility of the driving source. Because of the
   worldwide desire to reduce emissions, the potential of VAC systems with
   renewable thermal energy systems has made it more appealing. The goal of
   this analysis is to emphasize the potential integration of VAC with
   renewable energy technologies including geothermal, biomass, waste heat,
   surface water, and solar (thermal and PV). This study focuses on the
   existing and future state of VAC cooling technologies, their technical,
   economic, and environmental aspects, as well as the framework's analysis
   and optimization techniques. The paper places a particular emphasis on
   the cooling-dominated areas of India and Europe. The study finds that,
   local heat energy availability fosters small-scale circular economies in
   hot and humid climates, while the high capital costs of transmitting
   thermal energies across long distances, as well as transmission losses,
   deter centralized activities. Since there are no HCF emissions, VACs
   have a major advantage over compression chillers. The findings show that
   combining VAC with at least four of the six renewable energy sources
   investigated has enormous potential for the future of clean and
   sustainable cooling energy alternatives. Small and medium-scale
   renewable cooling systems, particularly those powered by solar thermal
   energy, as well as bio-energy, can be cost-effective and installed in a
   wide range of sites. Solar thermal energy can meet both urban and rural
   needs, whereas bioenergy is more suited to rural needs. Waste heat
   recovery systems are mostly utilized to meet industrial cooling needs,
   and geothermal energy offers a wide range of possible applications but
   is limited by availability. Bioenergy-based VAC, in particular, has the
   special advantage of being a carbon-negative solution if the generated
   bio-char is collected and sequestered.},

Abstract = {Global trade in liquefied natural gas (LNG) is growing significantly, as
   is interest in the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
   with LNG. Most assessments of life-cycle GHG emissions from LNG have
   employed national or regional average emission estimates; however, there
   is significant variability in emissions across different suppliers and
   across the natural gas supply chain. This work describes a framework for
   compiling supplier-specific GHG emission data for LNG, from the
   producing well to regasification at the destination port. A case study
   is presented for Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass Liquefaction (SPL) LNG
   supply chain from production in the United States and delivered to
   China. GHG emission intensities are estimated to be 30-43\% lower than
   other analyses employing national or regional average emission profiles.
   The segments driving these differences are gas production and gathering,
   transmission, and ocean transport. Extending the boundaries of this
   analysis to the power plant illustrates the effect of fuel switching
   from coal to natural gas; the effect of fuel switching in China is a
   47-57\% reduction in GHG emission intensity, cradle through power
   generation. This work highlights the important role customized
   life-cycle assessments can play to improve GHG emission estimates and
   differentiate supply chains to inform business and policy decisions
   related to the transition to a low carbon future.},

Title = {Natural resource management in mitigating climate impacts: the example

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-61},

Abstract = {The risk that tropical storm occurrence may alter as a result of global
   warming presents coastal managers, particularly in vulnerable areas,
   with a serious challenge. Many countries are hard-pressed to protect
   their coastal resources against present-day hazards, let alone any
   increased threat in the future. Moreover, the threat posed by climate
   change is uncertain making the increased costs of protection difficult
   to justify. Here, we examine one management strategy, based on the
   rehabilitation of the mangrove ecosystem, which may provide a dual,
   ``win-win{''} benefit in improving the livelihood of local resource
   users as well as enhancing sea defences. The
   strategy,therefore,represent a precautionary approach to climate impact
   mitigation. This paper quantifies the economic benefits of mangrove
   rehabilitation undertaken, inter alia, to enhance sea defence systems in
   three coastal Districts of northern Vietnam. The results of the analysis
   show that mangrove rehabilitation can be desirable from an economic
   perspective based solely on the direct use benefits by local
   communities. Such activities have even higher benefit cost ratios with
   the inclusion of the indirect benefits resulting from the avoided
   maintenance cost for the sea dike system which the mangrove stands
   protect from coastal storm surges. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {One of the most environmental concerns is the climate change because of
   the greenhouse gasses, such as CO2, N2O, CH4, and fluorinated gases. The
   big majority of CO2 is coming from burning of fossil fuels to generate
   steam, heat and power. In order to address some of the major
   environmental concerns of fossil fuels, a number of different
   alternatives for renewable energy sources have been considered,
   including sunlight, wind, rain, tides and geothermal heat and biomass.
   In the present study, two different biomass products (three leaves and
   grasses) were collected from the local sources, cleaned, chopped, and
   mixed with corn starch as a binder prior to the briquetting process at
   different external loads in a metallic mold. A number of tests,
   including drop, ignition and mechanical compression were conducted on
   the prepared briquettes before and after stabilizations and
   carbonization processes at different conditions. The test results
   indicated that briquetting pressure and carbonizations are the primary
   factors to produce stable and durable briquettes for various industrial
   applications. Undergraduate students have been involved in every step of
   the project and observed all the details of the process during the
   laboratory studies, as well as data collection, analysis and
   presentation. This study will be useful for the future trainings of the
   undergraduate engineering students on the renewable energy and related
   technologies.},

   the estuary mostly sandy respond positively to carbon and inversely in
   organic rich sediments from the lower estuary the denitrification
   potential was limited by nitrate availability The obtained results
   confirmed denitrification as an important process for the removal of
   nitrate in estuaries The presence of wastewater discharges appears to
   stimulate nitrogen removal but also the production of N(2)O a powerful
   greenhouse gas exacerbating the N(2)O N(2) ratio and thus should be

Abstract = {With the surge in the fossil fuel prices and increasing environmental
   concerns, significant efforts have been made to propel and develop
   alternative energy technologies to cope with the energy shortage for
   island power grids. Recent advancements and developments on power
   electronic technologies have enabled the renewable energy sources to be
   grid-connected with gradually higher penetration in island electricity
   supply. Consequently, the utilization and efficiency of renewable energy
   resources in islands has received remarkable attention from both the
   academia and industry. In this paper, a brief overview on the current
   status of island energy resources is described. Then, the existing
   utilization status and development potential of various renewable
   generations for island power grids, including solar, wind, hydropower,
   biomass, ocean and geothermal energy, are investigated. Furthermore, the
   advanced technologies to improve the penetration level of island
   renewables, including energy storage techniques, hybrid renewable energy
   system, microgrid, demand side management, distributed generation and
   smart grid, are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Methanotrophs, cells that consume methane (CH4) as their sole source of
   carbon and energy, play key roles in the global carbon cycle, including
   controlling anthropogenic and natural emissions of CH4, the second-most
   important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. These cells have also
   been widely used for bioremediation of chlorinated solvents, and help
   sustain diverse microbial communities as well as higher organisms
   through the conversion of CH4 to complex organic compounds (e.g. in deep
   ocean and subterranean environments with substantial CH4 fluxes). It has
   been well-known for over 30 years that copper (Cu) plays a key role in
   the physiology and activity of methanotrophs, but it is only recently
   that we have begun to understand how these cells collect Cu, the role Cu
   plays in CH4 oxidation by the particulate CH4 monooxygenase, the effect
   of Cu on the proteome, and how Cu affects the ability of methanotrophs
   to oxidize different substrates. Here we summarize the current state of
   knowledge of the phylogeny, environmental distribution, and potential
   applications of methanotrophs for regional and global issues, as well as
   the role of Cu in regulating gene expression and proteome in these
   cells, its effects on enzymatic and whole-cell activity, and the novel
   Cu uptake system used by methanotrophs.},

Abstract = {This paper examines barriers and opportunities for climate change
   adaptation in an urban coastal setting where adaptation is in its
   infancy. It draws on a diagnostic framework as a foundation for
   identifying and organising barriers and opportunities in terms of three
   broad phases of the adaptation process, i.e. (1) understanding the
   problem, (2) planning adaptation options and (3) managing implementation
   of such options. Data come from the analysis of documents (e.g. policy,
   plans and reports) and a survey of 49 representatives from 42
   organisations (e.g. government, environmental non-governmental
   organisations, businesses and local industry and professional
   associations). Nineteen barriers and/or opportunities pertaining to the
   different phases of the adaptation process were identified. Three of
   those barriers (i.e. competing priorities, existing management context
   and existing ecological context) are our additions to the initial list
   of common barriers proposed in the diagnostic framework. Barriers
   pertaining to the understanding phase were the most frequently noted by
   respondents. The understanding phase was also one which most of the
   barriers were nevertheless considered as opportunities. Emerging
   critical barriers and/or opportunities for climate change adaptation
   included perception of signal, availability and accessibility of
   information, existing management context and leadership. We propose that
   addressing these barriers and opportunities would involve improving
   perception about climate change and availability and accessibility of
   information, fostering anticipatory planned adaptation through the
   existing management context and developing leadership for adaptation.
   Findings from this study may prove useful to other jurisdictions,
   particularly those where climate adaptation is at its early stages of
   development.},

Title = {Synergies and trade-offs between climate change adaptation options and
   gender equality: a review of the global literature},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts are being felt across sectors in all regions of
   the world, and adaptation projects are being implemented to reduce
   climate risks and existing vulnerabilities. Climate adaptation actions
   also have significant synergies and tradeoffs with the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 5 on gender equality. Questions
   are increasingly being raised about the gendered and climate justice
   implications of different adaptation options. This paper investigates if
   reported climate change adaptation actions are contributing to advancing
   the goal of gender equality (SDG 5) or not. It focuses on linkages
   between individual targets of SDG 5 and climate change adaptation
   actions for nine major sectors where transformative climate actions are
   envisaged. The assessment is based on evidence of adaptation actions
   documented in 319 relevant research publications published during
   2014-2020. Positive links to nine targets under SDG 5 are found in
   adaptation actions that are consciously designed to advance gender
   equality. However, in four sectors-ocean and coastal ecosystems;
   mountain ecosystems; poverty, livelihood, sustainable development; and
   industrial system transitions, we find more negative links than positive
   links. For adaptation actions to have positive impacts on gender
   equality, gender-focused targets must be intentionally brought in at the
   prioritisation, designing, planning, and implementation stages. An SDG
   5+ approach, which takes into consideration intersectionality and gender
   aspects beyond women alone, can help adaptation actions move towards
   meeting gender equality and other climate justice goals. This reflexive
   approach is especially critical now, as we approach the mid-point in the
   timeline for achieving the SDGs.},

Abstract = {Scholars, practitioners, and decision-makers are increasingly
   recognising that Indigenous knowledge can play a significant role in
   facilitating adaptation to climate change. Yet, adaptation theorising
   and practises remain overwhelmingly situated within Euromodern
   ontologies, and there remains limited space, at present, for plural
   ontologies or alternative ways of being and knowing. In this paper, and
   using the Pacific as our case study, we present an argument for the
   inclusion of multiple ontologies within adaptation policymaking. Pacific
   adaptation policies and interventions frequently privilege Western
   scientific knowledge and focus on addressing individual climate risks
   through technical fixes directed by foreign experts and funding
   agencies. They are also rooted in a policy architecture that is an
   artefact of colonisation in the region. Despite these obstacles, Pacific
   Islander responses to climate change are dynamic, and inclusive of the
   multiple and competing ontologies they work within, offering insights
   into how Euromodern and Pacific islander world views could coalesce to
   builds adaptive capacity and consolidate community resilience into the
   future. Highlights center dot Indigenous Knowledge plays a critical role
   in enabling resilience and facilitating climate change adaptation in
   some parts of Vanuatu center dot Ni-Vanuatu people employ dynamic
   responses to climate risks incorporating multiple knowledge systems and
   practises center dot Co-existence of different knowledge systems provide
   insights into factors that enable adaptive capacity and consolidate
   community resilience center dot Diverse worldviews, knowledge systems
   and practises with Pacific Island cultures highlights the importance of
   thinking about ontological pluralism within adaptation center dot
   Climate adaptation is principally founded on Western ontologies, but

Title = {Glacial cooling and climate sensitivity revisited},
Journal = {NATURE},

Abstract = {The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), one of the best studied palaeoclimatic
   intervals, offers an excellent opportunity to investigate how the
   climate system responds to changes in greenhouse gases and the
   cryosphere. Previous work has sought to constrain the magnitude and
   pattern of glacial cooling from palaeothermometers(1,2), but the uneven
   distribution of the proxies, as well as their uncertainties, has
   challenged the construction of a full-field view of the LGM climate
   state. Here we combine a large collection of geochemical proxies for sea
   surface temperature with an isotope-enabled climate model ensemble to
   produce a field reconstruction of LGM temperatures using data
   assimilation. The reconstruction is validated with withheld proxies as
   well as independent ice core and speleothem delta O-18 measurements. Our
   assimilated product provides a constraint on global mean LGM cooling of
   -6.1 degrees Celsius (95 per cent confidence interval: -6.5 to -5.7
   degrees Celsius). Given assumptions concerning the radiative forcing of
   greenhouse gases, ice sheets and mineral dust aerosols, this cooling
   translates to an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.4 degrees Celsius
   (2.4-4.5 degrees Celsius), a value that is higher than previous
   LGM-based estimates but consistent with the traditional consensus range
   of 2-4.5 degrees Celsius(3,4).
   A compilation of proxy data are used with an isotope-enabled climate
   model ensemble to constrain cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum,
   producing estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity that agree well
   with the current consensus range.},

Title = {Implementing Onshore Power Supply from renewable energy sources for
   requirements of ships at berth},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {255},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {An investigation on the power requirements of ships at berth for
   implementing Offshore Power Supply (OPS) is presented. It is highlighted
   that this technology acts as a suitable measure for reducing air
   pollution in port areas. The study is conducted for Cartagena Port
   (Spain), analyzing the data port traffic in the period 2010-2016.
   Accurate predictions of energy consumption of auxiliary engines based on
   experimental data provided by Port Authority lead to obtain the hourly
   energy consumption for each kind of vessel. A Monte Carlo procedure is
   applied to the variability assessment of both the power and the energy
   demand. The renewable energy resources available at Cartagena area are
   considered. Solar, onshore and offshore wind resources are assessed for
   supplying the energy demand. The solar resource reveals as important,
   but not sufficient; therefore, wind resource deserves a special
   attention. In particular, FAST/Aerodyn/Hydrodyn codes are used for
   determining the wind power capacity. The benefits of OPS technology are
   demonstrated, following the trends observed in the literature. The
   impact on reduction of Green House Gases (GHG) and other pollutant gases
   is estimated and the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) is
   calculated. As a relevant result, more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year
   could be reduced. The related policy implications of the presented
   purpose have been discussed.},

Title = {Global inequities between polluters and the polluted: climate change
   impacts on coral reefs},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3982-3994},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For many ecosystem services, it remains uncertain whether the impacts of
   climate change will be mostly negative or positive and how these changes
   will be geographically distributed. These unknowns hamper the
   identification of regional winners and losers, which can influence
   debate over climate policy. Here, we use coral reefs to explore the
   spatial variability of climate stress by modelling the ecological
   impacts of rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification, two
   important coral stressors associated with increasing greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. We then combine these results with national per capita
   emissions to quantify inequities arising from the distribution of cause
   (CO2 emissions) and effect (stress upon reefs) among coral reef
   countries. We find pollution and coral stress are spatially decoupled,
   creating substantial inequity of impacts as a function of emissions. We
   then consider the implications of such inequity for international
   climate policy. Targets for GHG reductions are likely to be tied to a
   country's emissions. Yet within a given level of GHG emissions, our
   analysis reveals that some countries experience relatively high levels
   of impact and will likely experience greater financial cost in terms of
   lost ecosystem productivity and more extensive adaptation measures. We
   suggest countries so disadvantaged be given access to international
   adaptation funds proportionate with impacts to their ecosystem. We raise
   the idea that funds could be more equitably allocated by formally
   including a metric of equity within a vulnerability framework.},

Title = {Energy consumption profile estimation and benefits of hybrid solar
   energy system adoption for rural health units in the Philippines},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {178},
Pages = {651-668},

Abstract = {Access to sustainable energy source is crucial for healthcare facilities
   to deliver their services. Hybrid solar energy systems (HSES) are seen
   as a strong solution given the proximity of the Philippines to the
   equator. This study addresses the knowledge gap in the estimated energy
   consumption profile of Philippine rural health units (RHU) using easily
   replicable questionnaire and work sampling technique. The estimated
   energy consumption profile was used to determine the optimal HSES design
   and benefits. The RHU of Los Banos, Laguna was considered, and
   simulation of different energy system configurations was performed in
   the HOMER Pro software. Two scenarios were considered: a grid-connected
   and an off-grid RHU. The estimated average scaled load of the facility
   is similar to 92 kWh per day. Estimates were validated against actual
   consumption, with 15-21\% error. Results of the simulations show that a
   solar photovoltaic panel-grid system is optimal for the grid-connected
   scenario and can reduce cost of electricity by similar to 35\%.
   Meanwhile, a solar photovoltaic panel-generator-battery system is
   optimal for the off-grid scenario and can reduce cost of electricity by
   similar to 61\%. In both scenarios, the solar component is estimated to
   contribute similar to 71-85\% of the total annual energy production and
   can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A Resilience Approach Can Improve Anadromous Fish Restoration},
Journal = {FISHERIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {116-126},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Most anadromous fish populations remain at low levels or are in decline
   despite substantial investments in restoration. We explore whether a
   resilience perspective (i.e., a different paradigm for understanding
   populations, communities, and ecosystems) is a viable alternative
   framework for anadromous fish restoration. Many life history traits have
   allowed anadromous fish to thrive in unimpacted ecosystems but have
   become contemporary curses as anthropogenic effects increase. This
   contradiction creates a significant conservation challenge but also
   makes these fish excellent candidates for a resilience approach. A
   resilience approach recognizes the need to maintain life history,
   population, and habitat characteristics that increase the ability of a
   population to withstand and recover from multiple disturbances. To
   evaluate whether a resilience approach represents a viable strategy for
   anadromous fish restoration, we review four issues: (1) how resilience
   theory can inform anadromous fish restoration, (2) how a
   resilience-based approach is fundamentally different than extant
   anadromous fish restoration strategies, (3) ecological characteristics
   that historically benefited anadromous fish persistence, and (4)
   examples of how human impacts harm anadromous fish and how a resilience
   approach might produce more successful outcomes. We close by suggesting
   new research and restoration directions for implementation of a
   resilience-based approach.},

Title = {Adaptive and risk-based approaches to climate change and the management
   of uncertainty and institutional risk: The case of future flooding in
   England},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on how scientific uncertainties about future peak
   flood flows and sea level rises are accounted for in long term strategic
   planning processes to adapt inland and coastal flood risk management in
   England to climate change. Combining key informant interviews (n = 18)
   with documentary analysis, it explores the institutional tensions
   between adaptive management approaches emphasising openness to
   uncertainty and to alternative policy options on the one hand and
   risk-based ones that close them down by transforming uncertainties into
   calculable risks whose management can be rationalized through
   cost-benefit analysis and nationally consistent, risk-based priority
   setting on the other hand. These alternative approaches to managing
   uncertainty about the first-order risks to society from future flooding
   are shaped by institutional concerns with managing the second-order,
   `institutional' risks of criticism and blame arising from accountability
   for discharging those first-order risk management responsibilities. In
   the case of river flooding the poorly understood impacts of future
   climate change were represented with a simplistic adjustment to peak
   flow estimates, which proved robust in overcoming institutional
   resistance to making precautionary allowances for climate change in
   risk-based flood management, at least in part because its scientific
   limitations were acknowledged only partially. By contrast in the case of
   coastal flood risk management, greater scientific confidence led to
   successively more elaborate guidance on how to represent the science,
   which in turn led to inconsistency in implementation and increased the
   institutional risks involved in taking the uncertain effects of future
   sea level rise into account in adaptation planning and flood risk
   management. Comparative analysis of these two cases then informs some
   wider reflections about the tensions between adaptive and risk-based
   approaches, the role of institutional risk in climate change adaptation,
   and the importance of such institutional dynamics in shaping the framing
   uncertainties and policy responses to scientific knowledge about them.

Title = {Climate Warming in Response to Emission Reductions Consistent with the
   Paris Agreement},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {To limit global warming to well below 2 degrees C in accord with the
   Paris Agreement, countries throughout the world have submitted their
   Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their
   greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation actions in the next few decades.
   However, it remains unclear what the resulting climate change is in
   response to the proposed INDCs and subsequent emission reductions. In
   this study, the global and regional warming under the updated INDC
   scenarios was estimated from a range of comprehensive Earth system
   models (CMIP5) and a simpler carbon-climate model (MAGICC), based on the
   relationship of climate response to cumulative emissions.) The global
   GHG emissions under the updated INDC pledges are estimated to reach 14.2
   similar to 15.0 GtC/year in 2030, resulting in a global mean temperature
   increase of 1.29 similar to 1.55 degrees C (median of 1.41 degrees
   C)above the preindustrial level. By extending the INDC scenarios to
   2100, global GHG emissions are estimated to be around 6.4 similar to 9.0
   GtC/year in 2100, resulting in a global mean temperature increase by
   2.67 similar to 3.74 degrees C (median of 3.17 degrees C). The Arctic
   warming is projected to be most profound, exceeding the global average
   by a factor of three by the end of this century.) us, climate warming
   under INDC scenarios is projected to greatly exceed the long-term Paris
   Agreement goal of stabilizing the global mean temperature at to a low
   level of 1.5-2.0 degrees C above the pre-industrial. Our study suggests
   that the INDC emission commitments need to be adjusted and strengthened
   to bridge this warming gap.},

Abstract = {In order to minimize the social and environmental concerns arising from
   the use of traditional energy resources such as fossil fuels and nuclear
   energy, the South Korean government has attempted to develop alternative
   energy resources. In particular, the large educational institutes and
   islands in South Koreawhich have the motivation and potential to provide
   electrical servicesare required to install renewable electricity
   generation facilities to reduce the burden on the local grid systems.
   With this trend, the current study investigates potential configurations
   of renewable electricity generation systems to supply the electrical
   demand of Jeju National University, located on the largest island in
   South Korea. The potential configurations suggested by the simulation
   results are evaluated by renewable fraction, cost of energy (COE), and
   total net present cost (NPC). The suggested configurations show a
   renewable fraction of 1.00 with COE of \$0.356-\$0.402 per kWh and NPC
   of \$54,620,352-\$51,795,040. Based on the results, both implications
   and limitations are examined.},

Abstract = {Molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide may be limited for aquatic plants,
   but they have various mechanisms for acquiring these gases from the
   atmosphere, soil, or metabolic processes. The most common adaptations of
   aquatic plants involve various aerenchymatic structures, which occur in
   various organs, and enable the throughflow of gases. These gases can be
   transferred in emergent plants by molecular diffusion, pressurized gas
   flow, and Venturi-induced convection. In submerged species, the direct
   exchange of gases between submerged above-ground tissues and water
   occurs, as well as the transfer of gases via aerenchyma. Photosynthetic
   O-2 streams to the rhizosphere, while soil CO2 streams towards leaves
   where it may be used for photosynthesis. In floating-leaved plants
   anchored in the anoxic sediment, two strategies have developed. In water
   lilies, air enters through the stomata of young leaves, and streams
   through channels towards rhizomes and roots, and back through older
   leaves, while in lotus, two-way flow in separate air canals in the
   petioles occurs. In Nypa Steck palm, aeration takes place via leaf bases
   with lenticels. Mangroves solve the problem of oxygen shortage with root
   structures such as pneumatophores, knee roots, and stilt roots. Some
   grasses have layers of air on hydrophobic leaf surfaces, which can
   improve the exchange of gases during submergence. Air spaces in wetland
   species also facilitate the release of greenhouse gases, with CH4 and
   N2O released from anoxic soil, which has important implications for
   global warming.},

Abstract = {This paper examines thermal efficiency penalties and greenhouse gas as
   well as other pollutant emissions associated with pulverized coal (PC)
   power plants equipped with postcombustion CO2 capture for carbon
   sequestration. We find that, depending on the source of heat used to
   meet the steam requirements in the capture unit, retrofitting a PC power
   plant that maintains its gross power output (compared to a PC power
   plant without a capture unit) can cause a drop in plant thermal
   efficiency of 11.3-22.9\%-points. This estimate for efficiency penalty
   is significantly higher than literature values and corresponds to an
   increase of about 5.3-7.7 US cent/kWh in the levelized cost of
   electricity (COE) over the 8.4 US cent/kWh COE value for PC plants
   without CO2 capture. The results follow from the inclusion of mass and
   energy feedbacks in PC power plants with CO2 capture into previous
   analyses, as well as including potential quality considerations for safe
   and reliable transportation and sequestration of CO2. We conclude that
   PC power plants with CO2 capture are likely to remain less competitive
   than natural gas combined cycle (without CO2 capture) and on-shore wind
   power plants, both from a levelized and marginal COE point of view.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are diverse ecosystems that support millions of people
   worldwide by providing coastal protection from waves. Climate change and
   human impacts are leading to degraded coral reefs and to rising sea
   levels, posing concerns for the protection of tropical coastal regions
   in the near future. We use a wave dissipation model calibrated with
   empirical wave data to calculate the future increase of back-reef wave
   height. We show that, in the near future, the structural complexity of
   coral reefs is more important than sea-level rise in determining the
   coastal protection provided by coral reefs from average waves. We also
   show that a significant increase in average wave heights could occur at
   present sea level if there is sustained degradation of benthic
   structural complexity. Our results highlight thatmaintaining the
   structural complexity of coral reefs is key to ensure coastal protection
   on tropical coastlines in the future.},

Abstract = {A key objective of stage 2 of the Cooperative Research Centre for
   Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) Otway Project is to explore the
   ability of the seismic reflection method to detect and monitor injection
   of a small amount of greenhouse gas into a saline formation. Development
   of a seismic monitoring program requires an understanding of expected
   time-lapse (TL) seismic signals. Hence, before such an injection
   experiment is undertaken, we assessed the feasibility of seismic
   monitoring in a modeling study. Considering realistic gas distributions
   inferred from reservoir simulations, we analyzed the influence of
   various factors (injection volume, time after injection, and
   realizations of the reservoir flow model) on the TL seismic signal.
   However, the applicability of seismic monitoring depends not only on the
   strength of the TL seismic signal but also on the noise level of the
   seismic data. Hence, to estimate the detectability of gas in the
   subsurface, we have developed a workflow that integrated actual data
   repeatability observed at the Otway test site into the seismic
   feasibility study. Although we observed differences between the
   considered scenarios, all of the scenarios indicated a high likelihood
   of successful plume detection with the observed noise level and surface
   4D seismic acquisition geometry used in stage 1 of the CO2CRC Otway
   Project at the same site. However, a thin layer of gas spreading out
   from the edges of the main plume below the seal in all scenarios would
   be a challenge for surface seismic monitoring.},

Abstract = {Convincing people that climate change is potentially as important as
   other problems in the region such as poverty, conflict, and corruption,
   is a significant challenge for climate change adaptation strategies.
   Many experts attribute the receding shorelines and apparent rise in sea
   levels around Pacific island countries to climate change. It is
   questionable whether ordinary people are making similar connections.
   Raising the level of concern about climate change is essential if this
   is to change. This paper argues that civil society, in the form of
   non-government organisations (NGOs), offers a very effective means for
   creating this change. Non-government organisations work closely with
   local communities, and can use this relationship to communicate the need
   to give urgent attention to climate change issues. NGOs also have access
   to policy makers, including government, which they can use to help align
   policies with community priorities.},

Title = {Forecasting the relative influence of environmental and anthropogenic
   stressors on polar bears},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Effective conservation planning requires understanding and ranking
   threats to wildlife populations. We developed a Bayesian network model
   to evaluate the relative influence of environmental and anthropogenic
   stressors, and their mitigation, on the persistence of polar bears
   (Ursus maritimus). Overall sea ice conditions, affected by rising global
   temperatures, were the most influential determinant of population
   outcomes. Accordingly, unabated rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG)
   concentrations was the dominant influence leading to worsened population
   outcomes, with polar bears in three of four ecoregions reaching a
   dominant probability of decreased or greatly decreased by the latter
   part of this century. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations by
   mid-century delayed the greatly reduced state by approximate to 25 yr in
   two ecoregions. Prompt and aggressive mitigation of emissions reduced
   the probability of any regional population becoming greatly reduced by
   up to 25\%. Marine prey availability, linked closely to sea ice trend,
   had slightly less influence on outcome state than sea ice availability
   itself. Reduced mortality from hunting and defense of life and property
   interactions resulted in modest declines in the probability of a
   decreased or greatly decreased population outcome. Minimizing other
   stressors such as trans-Arctic shipping, oil and gas exploration, and
   contaminants had a negligible effect on polar bear outcomes, although
   the model was not well-informed with respect to the potential influence
   of these stressors. Adverse consequences of loss of sea ice habitat
   became more pronounced as the summer ice-free period lengthened beyond
   four months, which could occur in most of the Arctic basin after
   mid-century if GHG emissions are not promptly reduced. Long-term
   conservation of polar bears would be best supported by holding global
   mean temperature to <= 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels. Until
   further sea ice loss is stopped, management of other stressors may serve
   to slow the transition of populations to progressively worsened
   outcomes, and improve the prospects for their long-term persistence.},

Abstract = {Global warming will cause significant harm to the health of persons and
   their communities by compromising food and water supplies; increasing
   risks of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases and heat
   stress; changing social determinants of health resulting from extreme
   weather events, rising sea levels, and expanding flood plains; and
   worsening air quality, resulting in additional morbidity and mortality
   from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Vulnerable populations
   such as children, older persons, persons living at or below the poverty
   level, and minorities will be affected earliest and greatest, but
   everyone likely will be affected at some point. Family physicians can
   help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, stabilize the climate, and reduce
   the risks of climate change while also directly improving the health of
   their patients. Health interventions that have a beneficial effect on
   climate change include encouraging patients to reduce the amount of red
   meat in their diets and to replace some vehicular transportation with
   walking or bicycling. Patients are more likely to make such lifestyle
   changes if their physician asks them to and leads by example. Medical
   offices and hospitals can become more energy efficient by recycling,
   purchasing wind-generated electricity, and turning off appliances,
   computers, and lights when not in use. Moreover, physicians can play an
   important role in improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions by advocating for enforcement of existing air quality
   regulations and working with local and national policy makers to further
   improve air quality standards, thereby improving the health of their
   patients and slowing global climate change. (Am Fam Physician.

   Global Value Chain Perspective Applied to Tanker Shipping},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Exploring how transnational environmental governance and the operation
   of global value chains (GVCs) intersect is key in explaining the
   circumstances under which mandatory disclosure can improve the
   environmental footprint of business operations. We investigate how the
   governance dynamics of the tanker shipping value chain (a major emitter
   of greenhouse gases) limits the effectiveness of the European Union (EU)
   monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) regulation, which mandates
   the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions for ships calling at EU
   ports. Although MRV seeks to help shipowners and ship managers save fuel
   and reduce emissions, it does not address the complexity of power
   relations along the tanker shipping value chain and currently cannot
   disentangle how different actors influence the design, operational,
   commercial, and ocean/weather factors that together determine fuel
   consumption. In particular, the EU MRV neglects to reflect on how oil
   majors exert their power and impose their commercial priorities on other
   actors, and thus co-determine fuel use levels. We conclude that, in its
   current form, the EU MRV is unlikely to lead to significant
   environmental upgrading in tanker shipping. More generally, we argue
   that regulators seeking to facilitate environmental upgrading need to
   expand their focus beyond the unwanted behaviors of producers of goods
   and providers of services to also address the incentive structures and
   demands placed on them by global buyers.},

Title = {Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change on the South Australian
   coast: a coastal community perspective},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {139},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-56},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Over the last 20years the intergovernmental panel on climate change has
   produced a number of assessments on global climate change impacts,
   adaptation and vulnerability. In 2009, the Australian government
   conducted its own assessment of climate change risks to the Australian
   coast. In South Australia, there has been progress in actions to address
   issues for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Of particular note
   are the South Australian policies on coast protection and new coastal
   development (1991), and coastal erosion, flooding and sea-level rise
   (1992). These state policies remain in place despite recent debate in
   the literature over global and regional rates and potential impacts of
   sea-level rise, which show sea-level rise is tracking at the upper end
   of projections. An increasing coastal population and a growing amount of
   coastal property and related infrastructure deemed at risk', is also
   creating pressure to review coastal policies nationwide. This paper
   presents an assessment of the vulnerability of the South Australian
   coast to the impacts of climate change from a biophysical perspective
   and incorporates primary research conducted into the public perceptions
   of risk, using data from sea change communities in regional South
   Australia. It investigates the social implications of, and potential
   for, adaptation beyond the existing policy framework. This paper argues
   that research into climate change-risk perceptions can offer insight
   into the development of more suitable adaptation policy at local and
   regional scales by considering the attitudes and perceptions of multiple
   and varied groups of coastal stakeholders. The paper concludes that
   perceptions of risk and opportunities for adaptation play an important
   role in the assessment of vulnerability, and are an important tool for
   informing policy decisions.},

Abstract = {The combined effects of climate change, extreme weather and human
   alterations of the environment are especially pronounced in the coastal
   zone where people and ecosystem goods and services are most concentrated
   and inputs of energy and matter from land, sea and air converge. These
   realities call for a more integrated and adaptive approach to resource
   management, environmental protection, coastal zone management, coastal
   engineering, an approach that considers the effects of both human
   activities and natural variability change in an ecosystem context.
   Implementing such an approach requires the capability to routinely and

Title = {Salt marshes to adapt the flood defences along the Dutch Wadden Sea

Abstract = {Concern about the effects of climate change have set in motion a search
   for flood protection measures to adapt coastlines to the foreseen
   accelerated sea level rise. In this context, the potential role of salt
   marshes to adapt the Wadden Sea's flood defences was explored in the
   Netherlands Wadden Region Delta Programme. This paper provides an
   overview of the steps taken by the programme in developing a climate
   change adaptation strategy so that others might learn from its
   experiences. The second aim is to summarize the knowledge generated by
   the programme on the potential role of salt marshes as part of a climate
   change adaption strategy. Explorative modelling results indicate that
   Wadden Sea salt marshes affect wave heights, even under extreme
   conditions. Therefore, a salt-marsh zone in front of the Wadden Sea
   dikes that could keep pace with sea level rise may result in a reduced
   dike reinforcement task. A salt marsh potential map gives a rough
   impression of locations that are potentially interesting for salt marsh
   conservation and development, based on the current situation, on
   available information about abiotic conditions for salt marsh formation
   and the habitats present in the coastal zone. Besides elongated
   stretches were seminatural salt marshes are already present or
   developing, several stretches along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast have
   favourable abiotic conditions for salt marsh development. However, the
   prospects for integrating salt marshes into flood defences depend also
   on other aspects. Various nature conservation agreements are in effect
   with their associated obligations. Furthermore, the foreseen value of
   salt marsh development compared to traditional reinforcements, in terms
   of both costs and benefits, must be considered.},

Pages = {491-499},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Tropical wetland ecosystems, especially mangroves and peatlands, are
   carbon-rich ecosystems that should be considered to be part of climate
   change mitigation strategies. Globally, tropical mangroves store 20 PgC
   and tropical peatlands store 89 PgC. Most of these potentials reside in
   southeast Asia. Emission factors and activity data are among the most
   important components to carry out credible assessment. In this article,
   we explore and discuss emission factors and activity data in light of
   project development and national reporting using the upcoming IPCC
   methodologies for wetlands. Country-specific data are needed to reduce
   uncertainties and hence enhance the projects competitiveness. There are
   opportunities to improve local livelihoods through mitigation strategies
   in wetlands. Potential bundling with adaptation measures is also
   discussed.},

Title = {Invited review: Resource inputs and land, water and carbon footprints
   from the production of edible protein of animal origin},
Journal = {ARCHIVES ANIMAL BREEDING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 18},
Abstract = {The objective of this review is to analyze crucial factors in the output
   from the production of proteins in food of animal origin, such as milk,
   meat and eggs. We then consider inputs such as land, water, fuel,
   minerals and feed, as well as characterize emissions. Finally, we
   estimate footprints for land (land footprint, LF), water (water
   footprint, WF) and greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., carbon footprint, CF)
   during the production process. The wide range of different land and
   water inputs per unit feed between various studies largely influences
   the results. Further influencing factors are species and categories of
   animals that produce edible protein, their yields and the feeding of
   animals. Coproducts with no or low humanly edible fractions and
   grassland as feed contribute to a lower need for arable land and lower
   LF, WF and CF. The most efficient land use or the lowest LF per kilogram
   of edible protein was estimated for higher milk and egg yields; the
   highest LF values were calculated for beef, followed by pork. The lowest
   WF and CF were calculated for edible protein of chicken meat and eggs.
   Edible protein from ruminants is mostly characterized by a higher CF
   because of the high greenhouse gas potential of methane produced in the
   rumen. A key prerequisite for further progress in this field is the
   harmonization of data collection and calculation methods. Alternatives
   to partial or complete replacement of protein of terrestrial animals,
   such as marine animals, insects, cell cultures, single-cell proteins or
   ``simulated animal products{''} from plants, as well as changing eating
   patterns and reducing food losses are mentioned as further potential
   ways for more efficient feed production. For all those dealing with
   plant or animal breeding and cultivation and all those who are working
   along the whole food production chain, it is a major challenge to
   enhance the production of more food for more people with, at the same
   time, less, limited resources and lower emissions.},

Abstract = {CO2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology has yet to be
   widely deployed at a commercial scale despite multiple high-profile
   demonstration projects. We suggest that developing a large-scale,
   visible, and financially viable CCUS network could potentially overcome
   many barriers to deployment and jumpstart commercial-scale CCUS. To
   date, substantial effort has focused on technology development to reduce
   the costs of CO2 capture from coal-fired power plants. Here, we propose
   that near-term investment could focus on implementing CO2 capture on
   facilities that produce high-value chemicals/products. These facilities
   can absorb the expected impact of the marginal increase in the cost of
   production on the price of their product, due to the addition of CO2
   capture, more than coal-fired power plants. A financially viable
   demonstration of a large-scale CCUS network requires offsetting the
   costs of CO2 capture by using the CO2 as an input to the production of
   market-viable products. We demonstrate this alternative development path
   with the example of an integrated CCUS system where CO2 is captured from
   ethylene producers and used for enhanced oil recovery in the US Gulf
   Coast region. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \&

Abstract = {In accordance with the significance of international agreements to
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Thailand has undertaken to reduce CO2
   emissions by approximately 20 - 25\% of the current annual average by
   2030. Available data in Thailand indicates a baseline rate of average
   CO2 emissions of about 300 Mton/year. In this study, we make a
   quantitative estimation of CO2 emissions in Thailand from a 2015
   updating of secondary data collected from biomass and fossil fuel power
   plants. In addition, this study proposes the creation of CO2 sinks
   through the geological storage of CO2, known as carbon capture and
   storage (CCS) technology. The results show that the total CO2 emissions
   from biomass and fossil fuel power plants are about 1.134 Mton and 105
   Mton, respectively. The figures for total amounts of CO2 in onshore and
   offshore sinks were converted from data in the Department of Mineral
   Fuel's (DMF) annual report of 2015. These figures are about 165.12 Mton
   and 2,120 Mton, respectively. Available sedimentation basins both
   onshore and offshore are selected and suggested as suitable areas for
   CO2 storage based on the matching of suitable CO2 sources and CO2 sinks.
   Following COP21, CO2 disposal management and the rapid reduction of CO2
   emissions are recognized as having significant impacts on climate
   change, especially for ensuring that the average global temperature does
   not increase by more than 2 degrees C. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published

Title = {Towards carbon Neutrality: Prediction of wave energy based on improved
   GRU in Maritime transportation},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {331},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Efficient use of renewable energy is one of the critical measures to
   achieve carbon neutrality. Countries have introduced policies to put
   carbon neutrality on the agenda to achieve relatively zero emissions of
   greenhouse gases and to cope with the crisis brought about by global
   warming. This work analyzes the wave energy with high energy density and
   wide distribution based on understanding of various renewable energy
   sources. This study provides a wave energy prediction model for energy
   harvesting. At the same time, the Gated Recurrent Unit network (GRU),
   Bayesian optimization algorithm, and attention mechanism are introduced
   to improve the model's performance. Bayesian optimization methods are
   used to optimize hyperparameters throughout the model training, and
   attention mechanisms are used to assign different weights to features to
   increase the prediction accuracy. Finally, the 1-hour and 6-hour
   forecasts are made using the data from China's NJI and BSG
   observatories, and the system performance is analyzed. The results show
   that, compared with mainstream prediction algorithms, GRU based on
   Bayesian optimization and attention mechanism has the highest prediction
   accuracy, with the lowest MAE of 0.3686 and 0.8204, and the highest R2
   of 0.9127 and 0.6436, respectively. Therefore, the prediction model
   proposed here can provide support and reference for the navigation of
   ships powered by wave energy.},

Title = {Population dynamics of methanogens and methanotrophs along the salinity
   gradient in Pearl River Estuary: implications for methane metabolism},

Abstract = {Methane, a major greenhouse gas, plays an important role in global
   carbon cycling and climate change. Methanogenesis is identified as an
   important process for methane formation in estuarine sediments. However,
   the metabolism of methane in the water columns of estuaries is not well
   understood. The goal of this research was to examine the dynamics in
   abundance and community composition of methanogens and methanotrophs,
   and to examine whether and how they take part in methane metabolism in
   the water columns from the lower Pearl River (freshwater) to the coastal
   South China Sea (seawater). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput
   sequencing results showed that the abundance of methanogens decreased
   with increasing salinity, suggesting that growth of these methanogens in
   the Pearl River Estuary may be influenced by high salinity. Also, the
   methane concentration in surface waters was lower than that in
   near-bottom waters at most sites, suggesting sediment methanogens are a
   likely source of methane. In the estuarine mixing zone, significantly
   high methane concentrations existed with the presence of salt-tolerant
   methanogens (e.g., Methanomicrobiaceae, Methanocella, Methanosaeta and
   Methanobacterium) and methanotrophs (e.g., Methylocystis and
   Methylococcaceae), which were found in brackish habitats. Furthermore, a
   number of methanotrophic OTUs (from pmoA gene sequence data) had
   specific positive correlations with methanogenic OTUs (from mcrA gene
   sequence data), and some of these methanogenic OTUs were correlated with
   concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC). The results indicate
   that methanotrophs and methanogens may be intimately linked in methane
   metabolism attached with particles in estuarine waters.},

Title = {Comparison of Climate Response to Anthropogenic Aerosol versus

Abstract = {Spatial patterns of climate response to changes in anthropogenic
   aerosols and well-mixed greenhouse gases ( GHGs) are investigated using
   climate model simulations for the twentieth century. The climate
   response shows both similarities and differences in spatial pattern
   between aerosol and GHG runs. Common climate response between aerosol
   and GHG runs tends to be symmetric about the equator. This work focuses
   on the distinctive patterns that are unique to the anthropogenic aerosol
   forcing. The tropospheric cooling induced by anthropogenic aerosols is
   locally enhanced in the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere with a deep
   vertical structure around 40 degrees N, anchoring a westerly
   acceleration in thermal wind balance. The aerosol-induced negative
   radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere requires a cross-equatorial
   Hadley circulation to compensate interhemispheric energy imbalance in
   the atmosphere. Associated with a southward shift of the intertropical
   convergence zone, this interhemispheric asymmetric mode is unique to
   aerosol forcing and absent in GHG runs. Comparison of key climate
   response pattern indices indicates that the aerosol forcing dominates
   the interhemispheric asymmetric climate response in historical
   all-forcing simulations, as well as regional precipitation change such
   as the drying trend over the East Asian monsoon region. While GHG
   forcing dominates global mean surface temperature change, its effect is
   on par with and often opposes the aerosol effect on precipitation,
   making it difficult to detect anthropogenic change in rainfall from
   historical observations.},

Abstract = {Our climate model, driven mainly by increasing human-made greenhouse
   gases and aerosols, among other forcings, calculates that Earth is now

   measurements of increasing ocean heat content over the past 10 years.
   Implications include(i) the expectation of additional global warming of
   about 0.60 degrees C without further change of atmospheric composition;
   (ii) the confirmation of the climate system's tag in responding to
   forcings, implying the need for anticipatory actions to avoid any
   specified level of climate change; and (iii) the likelihood of
   acceleration of ice sheet disintegration and sea level rise.},

Abstract = {Science and technology centers continue to emerge as hubs for building

   change, accomplished by leading a small-scale community-based
   participatory research campaign (also known as ``citizen science{''}) to
   assess the City of Richmond's urban heat island effect, improved
   audience literacy and recall of adaptation and resilience solutions.
   When further nested within curriculum aligned with the National Oceanic

   hyper-localization produced additional learning and behavioral outcomes

Abstract = {As the regulations on greenhouse gas emissions at sea become strict,
   technology development to minimize environmental pollutants emitted from
   the propulsion system of ships is actively underway. Research on the use
   of renewable energy as a power source of ships propulsion system
   pursuing eco-friendliness is continuously carried out. However,
   considering the recent development of ships' large-scale, and at the
   same time minimizing greenhouse gas emissions at sea, the interest in
   nuclear energy as the means of a stable supply of environmentally
   friendly large-capacity energy has been increased. In this study, the
   effect of marine reactor operation on the material properties of a ship
   hull material is reviewed, and from this, hull structural behaviors are
   investigated. Attention is paid to the neutron irradiation on the
   material in the reactor operation environment, and then the strength
   assessment of a hull structural member assumed in the neutron
   irradiation situation is performed. Considering the neutron irradiation
   effects, the Young's modulus, poisson's ratio and allowable stress of
   DH36, typical high tensile strength steel used in ship hull, are varied
   based on the research findings related with the topic of neutron
   irradiated steels. Rectangular stiffened plated structures, basic common
   structural members for ship hull, are exemplified for the strength
   assessment to understand their structural behaviors such as strength and
   stiffness. Results from this study provide information on the effect of
   neutron irradiation on the hull structural behaviors of the ship using
   nuclear power and possibly can supplement the hull structure part from
   classification societies' rules and regulations.},

Abstract = {Not only are humans responsible for the anthropogenic causes of
   currently observed climate change, but we are also responsible for our
   responses to climate change. How we choose to respond provides important
   insights into our ability to collectively act in the face of threats
   with the unique characteristics of climate change. This communication
   attempts to provide an overview of some of the difficulties in forging
   new policy directions along our coastlines in an era of climate change.
   It is meant as a referential framing for the research presented in this
   Special Issue. As this communication is being written, the world is
   gripped by a global pandemic caused by a variant of the coronavirus.
   There are important corollaries between the underlying characteristics
   of the coronavirus and the causes and effects of climate change. Seeing
   how the global citizenry is responding to the current epidemic provides
   some insight into the difficulties in fostering collective action
   towards climate change. As with the pandemic, the issue is not really
   one of understanding the problem, but rather the varying human responses
   to the problem. We can expect the same difficulties as we continue to
   confront the ever-growing problem of climate change.},

Abstract = {Marine pollution is a major concern but one that has to date been
   largely overlooked; thus, for example, it was not accounted for in the
   Paris agreement on climate change. Maritime fuel combustion currently
   contributes 3\% of the annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly
   all shipping-related emissions occur within 400 km of land and cause
   death and morbidity to millions of people. The initial greenhouse gas
   strategy on the reduction of carbon emissions to at least half of its
   2008 levels by 2050, adopted by the International Maritime Organization,
   has the potential to spur innovations and alternative fuel, enabling the
   shipping industry to adapt to future challenges. Some zero-emission
   options such as the use of hydrogen and biofuels are considered
   potential strategies, but they lack the infrastructure capacity needed
   to meet the world's shipping demand. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has
   gained substantial interest as a marine fuel because it can comply with
   the strictest environmental regulations currently in force, and it is
   often regarded as a future fuel as most newly constructed ships are
   built to run on it. Although the use of LNG leads to lower CO2 emissions
   compared to traditional heavy fuel oils (HFOs), there is still a need to
   consider further reduction. A solution which can be implemented is the
   use of an onboard capture system on ships, also known as ship-based
   carbon capture. In this study, a process and economic evaluation was
   carried out on a solvent-based postcombustion capture process for the
   energy system of a CO2 carrier. A rate-based model was developed,
   validated, and scaled up to process the flue gas from a Wartsila 9L46 DF
   marine diesel engine. Different modes of operation with respect to
   engine load and capture rate were analyzed in this study, and the
   capture cost was estimated. The cost of CO2 capture was used as an
   economic index for this study. It was observed via a sensitivity
   analysis that, at 90\% capture rate, the cost of capture was at least
   \$117/t. The effect of exhaust gas recycling was also explored, and this
   resulted in a considerable reduction in the capture cost. The exhaust
   gas waste heat was utilized and was adequate to supply the required
   energy needed by the reboiler at each capture rate examined. Also, for
   LNG-fueled CO2 ships, the cold energy obtained while converting the LNG
   to gas was utilized to liquefy the captured CO2 from the flue gas.},

Abstract = {Global warming due to the excessive greenhouse gas emissions has led to
   the emergence of green technologies in Malaysia, particularly
   photovoltaic (PV) systems. Under the current regulatory framework,
   islanded operation of the PV system is not permissible. As a result, any
   renewable energy sources will be disconnected immediately in the event
   of grid outages. This practice is to ensure the safety of working
   personnel, as well as the customer equipment connected within the
   distribution networks. In addition, there is no synchronizing equipment
   to aid the reconnection of the islanded network to the grid. However,
   with the shutdown of the Distributed Generator (DG) during islanded
   operation, the customers are not able to utilize the available renewable
   energy and the number of power interruption is not improved with the
   renewable energy sources. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is
   to investigate the feasibility of the PV system in conducting islanding
   operation with the use of Energy Storage System (ESS). This paper also
   proposes a control algorithm to maintain the voltage and frequency
   excursion within the statutory limit by manipulating the real and
   reactive power flow of the ESS within the transition period between grid
   connected and islanding operation.},

Title = {Applying Principles of Uncertainty within Coastal Hazard Assessments to
   Better Support Coastal Adaptation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal hazards result from erosion of the shore, or flooding of
   low-elevation land when storm surges combine with high tides and/or
   large waves. Future sea-level rise will greatly increase the frequency
   and depth of coastal flooding and will exacerbate erosion and raise
   groundwater levels, forcing vulnerable communities to adapt.
   Communities, local councils and infrastructure operators will need to
   decide when and how to adapt. The process of decision making using
   adaptive pathways approaches, is now being applied internationally to
   plan for adaptation over time by anticipating tipping points in the
   future when planning objectives are no longer being met. This process
   requires risk and uncertainty considerations to be transparent in the
   scenarios used in adaptive planning. We outline a framework for
   uncertainty identification and management within coastal hazard
   assessments. The framework provides a logical flow from the land use
   situation, to the related level of uncertainty as determined by the
   situation, to which hazard scenarios to model, to the complexity level
   of hazard modeling required, and to the possible decision type.
   Traditionally, coastal flood hazard maps show inundated areas only. We
   present enhanced maps of flooding depth and frequency which clearly show
   the degree of hazard exposure, where that exposure occurs, and how the
   exposure changes with sea-level rise, to better inform adaptive planning
   processes. The new uncertainty framework and mapping techniques can
   better inform identification of trigger points for adaptation pathways
   planning and their expected time range, compared to traditional coastal
   flooding hazard assessments.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-68},

Abstract = {Analysis of coastal climate change adaptation requires combining
   environmental and resource economics with other disciplines. Sea level
   rise, ocean warming and acidification, and increased storminess threaten
   to alter or intensify biophysical coastal changes. Communities respond
   in ways that neither maximize total economic value nor apply the
   appropriate spatial scale of policy response. Focusing on coastline
   change, particularly in North Carolina, we synthesize modeling
   approaches and empirical studies to identify research that is needed to
   support coastal climate adaptation policy. Modeling coastlines as
   coupled human-natural systems explains historical patterns of coastline
   change, clarifies the need for empirical estimates, and provides a
   roadmap for interdisciplinary policy analysis. Despite the extensive
   literature on coastal amenities, hazards, and ex post policy evaluation,
   more empirical information is needed to parameterize coupled models of
   complex coastal environments facing climate change. Extending coupled
   models of coastal adaptation to incorporate spatial dynamics and market
   and nonmarket values highlights fundamental problems with current
   governance structures. We conclude that to maximize total economic value
   in the coastal zone, adaptation will require governance coordination
   across multiple levels, attention to intensive and extensive margins of
   adaptation, and trade-offs across market and nonmarket values. These
   findings echo recent advances in fisheries bioeconomics.},

Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization has set clear objectives towards
   drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions the coming decades in the
   maritime sector. While different ways to reduce emissions are already
   proposed, these are not expected to generate high CO2 abatement rates
   (in the case of fuel saving measures) or to be available and cost
   competitive in the near future (in the case of alternative fuels).
   Alternatively, ship-based carbon capture (SBCC) technology could be
   implemented on the shorter term and has the potential to drastically
   reduce the CO2 emissions of the maritime sector. This study discusses
   the advancements made towards the SBCC technology on board of
   LNG-fuelled ships using the results of the DerisCO2 project. The study
   covers general design considerations for the SBCC technology (solvent
   selection, heat integration and effect of ship movement), next to
   specific design considerations for the Sleipnir ship of Heerema Marine
   Contractors (analysis of operational profile, conceptual design and high
   level integration of the SBCC system), which is used as a case study for
   SBCC in this paper. Simulation of the SBCC technology including a
   techno-economic analysis on the case studies are included. The SBCC
   technology is a technically and economically viable solution for the
   maritime sector to reduce emissions the coming decades, with the cost of
   CO2 capture for the Sleipnir calculated between 119-133 euro/ton CO2.
   The most important proposed next step for fast development of the SBCC
   system is on board demonstration of the technology.},

Title = {Dual wave farms for energy production and coastal protection},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {18-29},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The synergetic application of wave farms, i.e., arrays of wave energy
   converters (WECs), for protecting the coast in addition to their main
   objective of generating carbon-free energy can place this renewable
   resource as a major element in ocean and coastal management. In
   particular, their ability to mitigate coastal erosion by reducing the
   amount of wave power reaching the coast will be put to use - and this is
   the motivation for this work. We propose a new approach in which the
   wave farm has a dual purpose: to generate carbon-free energy and to
   contribute to coastal erosion management. We illustrate this approach by
   means of a case study: a dual-purpose wave farm off Xago, a beach-dune
   system in Asturias (N Spain) subject to severe erosion - manifested
   dramatically in the retreat of the dune - and located in the area
   earmarked for the first wave farm in Spain. The objective of this work
   is to establish whether or not the wave farm may be useful to counter
   the erosion of the beach-dune system. To this end a wave propagation
   model is coupled with a state-of-the-art coastal processes model and
   applied to analyse the response of the system under storm conditions in
   two scenarios: with and without the farm. The efficiency of the wave
   farm in mitigating erosion is determined by comparing the results in
   both scenarios by means of a series of coastal indicators defined ad
   hoc. We find that the farm reduces storm induced erosion particularly
   where it is most acute, in the dune front, and thus contributes to
   alleviate the current erosive trends. This opens up exciting
   possibilities of using dual wave farms in lieu of, or as a complement
   to, coastal structures or beach nourishment. As wave energy develops
   into a major renewable energy source in the coming decades, dual wave
   farms are poised to constitute a breakthrough in coastal erosion
   management.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of life cycle climate performance (LCCP) for air

Abstract = {Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) is a widely accepted metric to
   evaluate the carbon footprint of air conditioning (AC) systems ``from
   cradle to grave.{''} This paper: (1) reviews the invention and evolution
   of LCCP, including a comprehensive timeline and bibliography; (2)
   documents the successful application of LCCP in the replacement of
   HFC-410A with HFC-32 in room air conditioners; (3) compares the
   conceptual frameworks and the operational approaches; and 4) reflects on
   the drawbacks of current LCCP research and points out possible future
   work. The major policy-relevant findings are: 1. The indirect emissions
   caused by energy consumption is 70 to 80 percent of the LCCP of AC
   systems in most countries but will decline in importance as electric
   power supply shifts rapidly from fossil fuel to renewable energy
   sources, which have near-zero carbon intensity; 2. The embodied
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in refrigerant manufacture are, in most
   cases, negligible but the physical and chemical properties are crucial
   for system optimization for low carbon footprint; 3. The LCCP metric can
   be used for multiple purposes such as refrigerant selection and AC
   system architecture optimization; and 4. Data limitations in material
   manufacturing and the carbon intensity of electric power are the most
   significant challenges. Finally, this paper describes a variety of
   methods to fill in data gaps, including the correction factor method,
   the data-driven method, and the database searching method. The
   next-generation LCCP will be an enhanced evaluation process considering
   local climate, heat islands, and local power supply characteristics.},

Abstract = {We argue that all aspects of demographic change, including migration,
   impact on the social resilience of individuals and communities, as well

   resilience is the ability to cope with and adapt to environmental and
   social change mediated through appropriate institutions. We investigate
   one aspect of the relationship between demographic change, social
   resilience, and sustainable development in contemporary coastal Vietnam:
   the effects of migration and remittances on resource-dependent
   communities in population source areas. We find, using longitudinal data
   on livelihood sources, that emigration and remittances have offsetting
   effects on resilience within an evolving social and political context.
   Emigration is occurring concurrently with, not driving, the expansion of
   unsustainable coastal aquaculture. Increasing economic inequality also
   undermines social resilience. At the same time diversification and
   increasing income levels are beneficial for resilience.},

Title = {Forest harvests and wood products: Sources and sinks of atmospheric
   carbon dioxide},
Journal = {FOREST SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {272-284},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Changes in the net carbon (C) sink-source balance related to a country's
   forest harvesting and use of wood products is an important component in
   making country-level inventories of greenhouse gas emissions, a current
   activity within many signatory nations to the UN Framework Convention on
   Climate Change. We propose two approaches for estimating national C
   inventories from forest harvesting and wood product utilization
   (excluding forest regrowth): the atmospheric-flow method and the
   stock-change method. The former has the atmosphere as its system of
   interest and counts ail flows to and from the atmosphere for a
   particular country. The latter looks at a country's forest and wood
   product C stocks and how they change over time. Here we develop these
   two methods, and estimate national C source-sink balance from the
   readily available FAO global forest products database for countries,
   regions, and the world. Both methods gave a worldwide estimated source
   of 980 Tg of C: in 1990 as a result of forest harvests and wood product
   utilization; about 60\% came from developing countries and 40\% from
   developed countries. Estimates (Tg C) for selected developing countries
   for the atmospheric-flow/stock-change method were: Brazil, 72/73; India,
   81/80; Indonesia, 53/56; and Ivory Coast, 3.9/4.3; and for selected
   developed countries (again atmospheric-flow/stock-change method):
   Canada, 36/50; Finland, 8.8/13; New Zealand, 2.7/3.4; and United States
   141/138. Net wood exporters show lower numbers in the atmospheric-flow
   method, net wood importers in the stock-change method. Among the
   variables that most consistently and strongly affected C emissions for a
   given country in 1990 were: roundwood production, slash left to oxidize,
   and commodity wood put into uses greater than or equal to 5 yr. We
   conclude with a discussion that shows how choosing either one of the two
   methods for wood harvest accounting has potential policy implications or
   impacts on the incentives or disincentives to use wood.},

Abstract = {Climate variability and change drive changes in marine ecosystems, such

   Mitigating measures in response to anthropogenic climate change are
   insufficient, and more attention must be directed toward adaptation to

   management will rest on the capacity of management regimes to be
   adaptive and flexible. This article addresses the management of living
   marine resources, and how management regimes cope with change and
   bolster the resilience of ecosystems. Experiences from the Norwegian
   management regime for living marine resources are used to illustrate how
   an existing regime can respond to change. We conclude that management
   regimes with sufficient capacity, in terms of robust science, regulatory
   frameworks that contribute to reduced fishing effort and maintenance of
   sustainable stock levels, and enforcement capability, are more likely to
   respond adequately to the challenges posed by climate change than those

Title = {Feed additives as a strategic approach to reduce enteric methane
   production in cattle: modes of action, effectiveness and safety},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Number = {14},
Pages = {1303-1317},
Abstract = {Increasing consumer concern in greenhouse-gas (GHG) contributions from
   cattle is pushing the livestock industry to continue to improve their
   sustainability goals. As populations increase, particularly in
   low-income countries, the demand for animal-sourced foods will place
   further pressure to reduce emission intensity. Enteric methane (CH4)
   production contributes to most of the GHG from livestock; therefore, it
   is key to mitigating such emissions. Feed additives have primarily been
   used to increase animal productivity, but advances in understanding the
   rumen has resulted in their development to mitigate CH4 emissions. The
   present study reviewed some of the main feed additives with a potential
   to reduce enteric CH4 emissions, focusing on in vivo studies. Feed
   additives work by either inhibiting methanogenesis or modifying the
   rumen environment, such that CH4 production (g/day) is reduced. Feed
   additives that inhibit methanogenesis or compete with substrate for
   methanogens include 3-nitroxypropanol (3NOP), nitrates, and halogenated
   compounds containing organisms such as macroalgae. Although 3NOP and
   macroalgae affect methyl-coenzyme M reductase enzyme that is necessary
   in CH4 biosynthesis, the former is more specific to methanogens. In
   contrast, nitrates reduce CH4 emissions by competing with methanogens
   for hydrogen. However, nitrite could accumulate in blood and be toxic to
   ruminants. Rumen modifiers do not act directly on methanogens but rather
   on the conditions that promote methanogenesis. These feed additives
   include lipids, plant secondary compounds and essential oils. The
   efficacy of lipids has been studied extensively, and although
   supplementation with medium-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids has
   shown substantial reduction in enteric CH4 production, the results have
   been variable. Similarly, secondary plant compounds and essential oils
   have shown inconsistent results, ranging from substantial reduction to
   modest increase in enteric CH4 emissions. Due to continued interest in
   this area, research is expected to accelerate in developing feed
   additives that can provide options in mitigating enteric CH4 emissions.},

Journal = {GEOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {29},
Number = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {High concentrations of greenhouse gases would haven been required to
   offset low solar luminosity early in Earth's history. Enhanced CO2
   levels are probably at least part of the solution, but CH4 may have
   played a significant role as well, particularly during the Late Archean
   era, 2.5-3.0 Ga, when methanogenic bacteria were almost certainly
   present. Indeed, biological CH4 production should have led to CO2
   drawdown by way of a negative feedback loop involving the
   carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle. We suggest here that the
   atmospheric CH4/CO2 ratio approached the value of similar to1 needed to
   trigger formation of Titan-like organic haze. This haze was strongly
   depleted in C-13 relative to C-12 and was produced at a rate comparable
   to the modern rate of organic carbon burial in marine sediments.
   Therefore, it could provide a novel explanation for the presence of
   extremely low-C-13 kerogens in Late Archean sediments.},

Title = {A Flood Damage Allowance Framework for Coastal Protection With Deep
   Uncertainty in Sea Level Rise},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Deep uncertainty describes situations when there is either ignorance or
   disagreement over (1) models used to describe key system processes and
   (2) probability distributions used to characterize the uncertainty of
   key variables and parameters. Future projections of Antarctic ice sheet
   (AIS) mass loss remain characterized by deep uncertainty. This
   complicates decisions on long-lived coastal protection projects when
   determining what margin of safety to implement. If the chosen margin of
   safety does not properly account for uncertainties in sea level rise,
   the effectiveness of flood protection could decrease over time,
   potentially putting lives and properties at a greater risk. To address
   this issue, we develop a flood damage allowance framework for
   calculating the height of a flood protection strategy needed to ensure
   that a given level of financial risk is maintained. The damage allowance
   framework considers decision maker preferences such as planning
   horizons, protection strategies, and subjective views of AIS stability.
   We use Manhattan-with the population and built environment fixed in
   time-to illustrate how our framework could be used to calculate a range
   of damage allowances based on multiple plausible scenarios of AIS melt.
   Under high greenhouse gas emissions, we find that results are sensitive
   to the selection of the upper limit of AIS contributions to sea level
   rise. Design metrics that specify financial risk targets, such as

Title = {Review: Climate change resilience disconnect in rural communities in

Abstract = {The world has been hit by consequential pandemics in the past two
   millennia. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken center stage, paralyzing
   vulnerable communities in the global south impacted by unprecedented
   climate vagaries. The focus of this study is COVID-19 and climate
   resilience communication rhetoric. In this context, we embed this study
   in response to the resilience of rural livelihoods to the COVID-19
   crisis and climate resilience education communication rhetoric. We posit
   our review based on the following questions: Has COVID-19 worsened the
   climate resilience pathway for rural communities in coastal Kenya? Is
   the COVID-19 pandemic a proxy for climate resilience in rural
   livelihoods? How does COVID-19 communication rhetoric undermine climate
   resilience for vulnerable coastal communities in Kenya? Through a
   resilient theoretical paradigm, we enclose our view based on the
   existing literature along with climate resilience and COVID-19
   proliferation. In light of the current state of COVID-19, the focus has
   shifted to the pandemic that will cover climate resilience. From the
   review, climate resilience pathway has been impacted by corona virus
   with noted funding response variations, in addition, even with the
   corona virus pandemic, climate resilience communication should be
   on-going rather than sporadic. Increasing the discursive process about
   climate change challenges is critical among Kenyan coastal communities.
   We recommend inclusion of climate resilience communication in existing
   policy frameworks as a salient solution to notable information discourse
   bottlenecks.},

Abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up in 1988
   by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations
   Environment Programme to review the stare of knowledge about
   human-induced climate change and assess possible responses. Most of its
   activities are conducted by three working groups, concerned respectively
   with scientific aspects of the climate system, with the vulnerability of
   human and natural systems to climate change, and with options for
   mitigating that change. The major IPCC reports have been highly detailed
   statements of scientific consensus on changes in the climate system,
   issued at roughly five-year intervals. These reflect the input of some
   hundreds of scientists, with drafts scrutinized by expert reviewers,
   revised to attain consensus, and eventually approved (or ``accepted{''})
   by the full Panel. The first such assessment, published in 1990, was
   influential in formulating the Framework Convention on Climate Change
   adopted at the 1992 Rio conference. The second assessment report (SAR),
   Climate Change 1995, produced the winery cited estimate that global
   warming would raise average temperatures by 1 degrees- 3.5 degreesC by
   2100, with a ``best estimate `` of 2 degreesC, and produce a sea-level
   rise of 0.13 - 0.94 meters. That report took the further step of
   explicitly linking the warming to anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions
   of greenhouse gases. Its cautious conclusion: ``The balance of evidence
   suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.},

Abstract = {Global warming and climate change processes are expected to raise sea
   levels. This paper represents a contribution to the efforts of
   investigating the impact of sea level rise (SLR) on the Nile delta
   coastal zone and identifies anticipatory and adaptation measures that
   may be appropriate today in spite of current SLR uncertainties. SLR was
   calculated by applying the quadratic equation for 10-year intervals
   using 1980 as the base year. Despite large variation between SLR
   predictions, the results indicated that SLR is accelerating, with
   estimated value for the present (21st) century in the order of 0.6 m,
   although with a margin of as much as +/- 0.4 m. Local land subsidence in
   the Nile delta would exacerbate the impacts of rising seas. It was
   estimated that with a 1.0m SLR, about 4500 square kilometers
   representing 19\% of the delta area will be submerged and that 6.1
   million people will be affected. These potential impacts of SLR would be
   serious but manageable if appropriate actions are taken. The following
   adaptation measures to the impact of SLR in the Nile delta coastal zone
   were identified: maintaining and building coastal protection structures,
   restoration of sand dunes along the shore, preserving existing wetlands,
   setting regulations to control development in vulnerable areas, change
   of land use, relocation of infrastructures in the landward side, and
   development of comprehensive monitoring and early warning systems.},

Title = {Taxing Carbon Emissions from International Shipping},
Journal = {INTERTAX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {10},
Pages = {832-851},
Abstract = {According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), maritime
   transport emits around 1 billion tonnes of CO2 annually and was
   responsible for approximately 2.5\% of global greenhouse gas emissions
   in 2014. The prediction is that greenhouse gas emissions from maritime
   transport alone may increase between 50 and 250\% by 2050, depending on
   future economic and energy developments.
   In spite of that, there is no concerted action or plan to tax or capture
   the CO2 emissions derived from international maritime shipping - the
   most widespread and popular form of transportation. This occurs in an
   environment where, from the perspective of corporate taxation, the
   international maritime industry is one of the sectors that is often
   taxed at some of the lowest tax brackets, if compared to other business.
   This article fulfils the threefold purpose of (1) discussing the
   international standards to which the international maritime transport
   network is subjected, from international public law and environmental
   law perspectives; (2) analysing the international tax regime applicable
   to the taxation of income derived from international shipping transport;
   and finally, (3) suggesting future policy approaches based on the
   principles and premises identified, to tackle carbon emissions derived
   from international maritime transport.
   The article purports to provide a full overview of the direct and
   indirect tax obligations which the maritime industry is under, and
   suggest policy approaches to assure that the environmental cost of
   transport is captured in the final price of products traded
   internationally, in order to re-establish geographic economic equity
   through the application of a carbon tax instrument.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper addresses housing problems of coastal areas in
   Bangladesh and investigates container-modular-housing (CMH) as a
   potential sustainable solution that establishes a resilient community.
   Design/methodology/approach Primary data highlight the underlying
   challenges of coastal-housing developed by monitoring the day-to-day
   operations of the community and conducting interviews with community
   members. Secondary data came from existing literature on coastal-housing
   rules and regulations, CMH and similar ideas. The study used a
   hypothetical CMH cluster design, with three primary objectives in mind:
   future settlement re-arrangement, economic sustainability and
   environmental sustainability. To achieve the objectives, the research
   used a comparative examination of the current constructed form and CMH,
   as well as a computer-aided simulation approach. Findings Primary
   findings encompass issues of a given coastal area, including surrounding
   site studies, sustainability and resiliency demands due to broad
   exposure to the natural calamities. Driving toward a ``CMH{''} based
   home design has the ability to create strategies for a resilient and
   sustainable community development while taking three primary objectives
   into account. Research limitations/implications A pilot project is
   needed to analyze the socio-cultural impact and overall construction
   feasibility. Practical implications This research could be implemented
   to transform an informal construction system into a technical,
   resilient, sustainable architectural and engineering solution to build
   resilient communities. Originality/value Numerous research projects have
   focused on the environmental sustainability of CMH. However, this study
   focuses on construction sustainability considering three major aspects
   which are yet to be addressed.},

Title = {Aquaculture farms as nature-based coastal protection: Random wave
   attenuation by suspended and submerged canopies},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {160},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As the frequency and intensity of storms increase, a growing need exists
   for resilient shore protection techniques that have both environmental
   and economic benefits. In addition to producing seafood, aquaculture
   farms may also provide coastal protection benefits either alone or with
   other nature-based structures. In this paper, a generalized three-layer
   frequency dependent theoretical model is derived for random wave
   attenuation due to presence of biomass within the water column. The
   biomass can be characterized as submerged, emerged, suspended and
   floating canopies that can consist of natural aquatic vegetation with
   potential aquaculture systems of kelp or mussels. The present analytical
   solutions can reduce to the solutions by Mendez and Losada (2004), Chen
   and Zhao (2012) and Jacobsen et al. (2019) for submerged rigid aquatic
   vegetation. The present theoretical model incorporates the motion of
   these canopies using a cantilever-beam model for slender components and
   a buoy-on-rope model for elements with concentrated mass and buoyancy.
   Analytical results are compared with existing laboratory and field
   datasets for submerged and suspended canopies. The theoretical model was
   then used (in a case study at a field site in Northeastern US) to
   investigate the capacity of suspended mussel farms with submerged
   aquatic vegetation (SAV) to dissipate wave energy during a recent storm
   event. Compared to a dense SAV meadow in shallower water, the suspended
   aquaculture farms more effectively attenuate random waves with a smaller
   peak period and the higher frequency components of wave spectrum. The
   performance of suspended aquaculture farms is less affected by water
   level changes due to tides, surge and sea level rise, while the wave
   attenuation performance of SAV decreases with increasing water level due
   to decreased wave motion near the sea bed. Incorporating suspended
   aquaculture farms offshore significantly enhance the coastal protection
   effectiveness of SAV-based living shorelines and extend the wave
   attenuation capacity over a wider wave period and water level range. The
   combination of suspended aquaculture farms and traditional living
   shorelines provides a more effective nature-based coastal defense
   strategy than the traditional living shorelines alone.},

Title = {LOCAL DIFFERENTIATION AND ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN COASTAL GHANA},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW},
Abstract = {This study investigates the perception of the impact of climate change
   on the livelihoods of small-scale fishing communities in the Western
   Region of Ghana. A mixed-method approach was employed, consisting of a
   survey of 400 fisherfolk households and 20 interviews with stakeholders.
   Changes in rainfall pattern, decreasing rainfall, stronger waves and
   storms that increase coastal erosion and cause persistent flooding were
   found to be the main effects of climate change on the livelihoods of
   small-scale coastal fisherfolk. Transnational fishing practices by
   fisherfolk in response to climate change contributed to the building of
   resilience of fishing households, while other adaptation strategies
   appeared to be insufficient in the long run. Coastal communities are not
   homogenous with respect to climate change impacts and corresponding
   adaptation strategies. Based on the empirical results, policy
   implications are suggested related to early warning systems and
   multiscalar marine planning.},

Abstract = {The golden tide, caused by the brown algae Sargassum horneri, exerts
   severe influences on the Pyropia aquaculture of Jiangsu coast, China. To
   study the outbreak of the golden tide in response to increasing
   greenhouse gas emissions, S. horneri was cultured under four conditions:
   ambient condition (10 degrees C, 400 mu atm), elevated temperature
   condition (14 degrees C, 400 mu atm), elevated CO2 level (10 degrees C,
   1000 mu atm), and potential greenhouse condition (14 degrees C, 1000 mu
   atm). The growth, photosynthetic performances, and inorganic carbon
   affinity of S. horneri were studied. The results showed that elevated
   temperature exerted a more pronounced positive influence on S. horneri
   growth, photosynthesis, and carbon assimilation than CO2 enrichment. The
   growth of S. horneri was significantly improved by moderately elevated
   temperatures, especially under concurrently elevated CO2 levels. This
   suggests that the greenhouse effect will benefit growth and carbon
   sequestration of S. horneri, which may enhance the frequency and scale
   of golden tides.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Glaciers, formed from the gradual accumulation of snow, can be
   continuous records representing past environments and recognized as a
   time capsule of our planetary evolution. Due to extremely harsh
   conditions, glacial ice has long been considered an uninhabitable
   ecosystem for microorganisms to sustain their life. However, recent
   developments in microbiological analysis techniques revealed the
   presence of unexpectedly diverse microbial strains. Glacial
   microorganisms could also provide valuable information, including not
   only biological diversity and structure but also molecular systematics,
   metabolic profiles, and evolutionary changes from the past climate and
   ecosystem. However, there are several obstacles in investigating the
   glacier environment, such as low regional accessibility, technical
   difficulties of ice coring, potential contamination during the sampling
   process, and low microbial biomass. This review aims to summarize recent
   knowledge on decontamination methods, biomass, diversity based on
   culture-dependent and -independent methods, application of biological
   proxies, greenhouse gas production and adaptive strategies in glaciers
   from various regions and to imply further directions for a comprehensive
   understanding of habitatility in an icy world including outer of our
   planet.},

Title = {Unavoidable solutions for coastal adaptation in Reunion Island (Indian
   Ocean)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {393-400},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The study of recent past trajectories of vulnerability to
   climate-related hazards allows for highlighting the prevailing
   environmental and anthropogenic drivers that operated over the last
   fifty to sixty years and given latency phenomena in social systems,
   therefore have the potential to continue driving a system's
   vulnerability in the coming decades. Stop or even reverse these trends
   represents as much unavoidable solutions for enhancing concrete
   long-term adaptation to climate change, whatever the end-century warming
   scenario.
   Using the case study of Reunion Island (Indian Ocean), we emphasize four
   major drivers of the recent coastal trajectory of vulnerability, i.e.
   changes in human-built assets, shoreline position, natural buffers'
   characteristics, and the extent of coastal protection structures.
   Together, these drivers highlight the need for controlling the
   urbanisation process to reduce the anthropogenic pressures exerted on
   morphological-ecological systems, restoring the buffering function of
   the latter, and moving towards a less hard structure-dependent coastal
   defence strategy. Such a shift in coastal management however supposes
   some radical changes in the way coastal development strategies consider
   environmental issues (hazards, resources and services). Here we bring
   empirical material showing that neither Reunion Island decision-makers
   are keen to drive such radical changes, nor the population is ready to
   accept potentially constraining policies that will have benefits only in
   the future. We conclude on the need for further advancing the design of
   adaptation pathways that build on the implementation of context-specific
   unavoidable solutions, and thus that seriously consider limiting the
   risk of maladaptation as a baseline strategy.},

Title = {Assessing the Coastal Resilience of Manasquan Inlet to Sea Bright, New
   Jersey: Regional Sediment Budget 1992-2003},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Assessing the resilience of regional coastal systems requires analysis
   of the short- and long-term erosion and accretion characteristics of
   beach material, including natural and anthropogenic sources and sinks. A
   regional sediment budget provides that accounting and is pivotal to
   successful management practices that enhance the resilience of coastal
   systems. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, updated
   the regional sediment budget for Manasquan Inlet to Sea Bright, New
   Jersey, for 1992-2003, which reflects the effects of various beach
   replenishment projects. The study area is approximately 33.8 km long and
   encompasses two inlets, mainland beaches from Manasquan Inlet to Long
   Branch, and a barrier-spit landform from Long Branch to Sea Bright. The
   previous sediment budgets represented a relatively eroded and limited
   source beach condition. This updated sediment budget is the first to
   analyze the with-project condition incorporating periodic beach
   nourishments/renourishments. The shore protection project consisted of
   an initial fill of approximately 17 Mm(3) (million cubic meters) between
   1994 and 2002 and additional fill/renourishment of 11 Mm(3) between 2008
   and 2016. Data for the sediment budget were based on volumetric change
   of the beach as developed from digitized, historical, aerial shoreline
   images as well as volumes and location of sediment replenishment
   (nourishment) activities in this region of the shoreline. Results from
   this budget indicate a net longshore transport of sediment northward
   from Manasquan Inlet toward Sea Bright, increasing from 106,000 m(3)/y
   just north of Manasquan Inlet to 343,000 m(3)/y north of Monmouth Beach.
   This updated sediment budget establishes a good understanding of the
   beach processes over time, which will enhance the ability to provide
   better coastal management and resilience for the northern New Jersey
   shoreline.},

Title = {Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emission Assessment for Using Alternative
   Marine Fuels: A Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set decarbonisation
   goals for the shipping industry. As a result, shipowners and operators
   are preparing to use low- or zero-carbon alternative fuels. The
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performances are fundamental for choosing
   suitable marine fuels. However, the current regulations adopt
   tank-to-wake (TTW) emission assessment methods that could misrepresent
   the total climate impacts of fuels. To better understand the
   well-to-wake (WTW) GHG emission performances, this work applied the life
   cycle assessment (LCA) method to a very large crude carrier (VLCC)
   sailing between the Middle East and China to investigate the emissions.
   The life cycle GHG emission impacts of using alternative fuels,
   including liquified natural gas (LNG), methanol, and ammonia, were
   evaluated and compared with using marine gas oil (MGO). The bunkering
   site of the VLCC was in Zhoushan port, China. The MGO and LNG were
   imported from overseas, while methanol and ammonia were produced in
   China. Four production pathways for methanol and three production
   pathways for ammonia were examined. The results showed that, compared
   with MGO, using fossil energy-based methanol and ammonia has no positive
   effect in terms of annual WTW GHG emissions. The emission reduction
   effects of fuels ranking from highest to lowest were full solar and
   battery-based methanol, full solar and battery-based ammonia, and LNG.
   Because marine ammonia-fuelled engines have not been commercialised,
   laboratory data were used to evaluate the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.
   The GHG emission reduction potential of ammonia can be exploited more
   effectively if the N2O emitted from engines is captured and disposed of
   through after-treatment technologies. This paper discussed three
   scenarios of N2O emission abatement ratios of 30\%, 50\%, and 90\%. The
   resulting emission reduction effects showed that using full solar and
   battery-based ammonia with 90\% N2O abatement performs better than using
   full solar and battery-based methanol. The main innovation of this work
   is realising the LCA GHG emission assessment for a deep-sea ship.},

Title = {Land use change implications for large-scale cultivation of algae

Abstract = {Algae is considered a promising future feedstock for biofuels. Although
   several studies have been conducted to assess the environmental impact
   of algae-based fuels, land use change is one area that is commonly
   overlooked in previous life cycle assessment studies. However, land use
   change can impact the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of algal
   biofuels when large tracts of land are converted to algal raceway
   cultivation systems. This study assesses the impacts of land use change
   through a variety of means. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) Tier 1 methodology was utilized to assess potential
   emissions resulting from the conversion of potential algae facility
   sites in the U.S. Gulf Coast, consisting of grassland, cropland, and
   forestland in several management conditions. These emission values over
   a 20-year time horizon were combined with guidance on promising sites
   for algae raceway development to provide an estimate of industry-wide
   GHG emissions impacts due to direct land use change (LUC). Direct LUC
   impacts appear to be important, with average GHG emissions of between 4
   and 8 g CO2eq/MJ for grassland and cropland conversion, which is roughly
   6.3\% and 12.5\% of the total GHG emission over the entire algae
   renewable diesel life cycle without considering the LUC. Emissions due
   to direct LUC could be even larger if previously forested lands are
   cleared, averaging 24.7 g CO2eq/MJ across a range of potential algae
   sites. This article details the methods, assumptions and initial LCA
   results for these land use change scenarios when considering the algae
   biofuels life cycle. Results from this LCA can help decision-makers
   recognize the importance of facility siting in overall environmental
   performance, and select locations of algae cultivation facilities to
   minimize direct LUC emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Impact of information seeking, disaster preparedness and typhoon
   emergency response on perceived community resilience in Hong Kong},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Gentrification and urban development in coastal megacities have
   increased community resilience due to better physical and socioeconomic
   conditions to cope with natural hazards. However, perceived community
   resilience, namely public belief regarding the ability of society to
   recover, is under-researched. In particular, specific pathways between
   information seeking and perceived community resilience during extreme
   storm events are rarely discussed. Therefore, this study applied
   structural equation modelling to examine the associations between the
   use of traditional and new information channels in typhoon-related
   information seeking and individual perceived community resilience, with
   disaster preparedness and typhoon emergency response as mediators. This
   analysis was based on a population-based cohort (n = 1015) and the
   Cantonese version of the Conjoint Community Resiliency Assessment
   Measure (CCRAM-10). Generally, CCRAM-10 and four of the five sub
   dimensions were rated lower than average, although 89.8\% of the
   respondents used at least two channels to acquire typhoon-related
   information. Direct associations were found between the use of
   traditional information channels (e.g., television) and greater
   perceived community resilience (beta = 0.096; SE = 0.035), and two
   indirect associations were found via individual disaster preparedness
   behaviours and typhoon emergency response behaviours. However, we found
   only indirect associations between the use of new information channels
   (e.g., social media) and greater perceived community resilience via
   individual and household disaster preparedness behaviours. These
   associations suggest that community-based programmes should consider
   improving perceived community resilience by making more
   information-seeking channels available for residents. To increase urban
   resilience in coastal areas, new information channels should also be
   synergised with both top down and bottom-up typhoon-related information
   as well as physical and socioeconomic conditions of the urban
   environment for urban governance and community based disaster
   management.},

Title = {Seasonal and Diurnal Dynamics of Atmospheric Radon, Carbon Dioxide,

   Seam Gas Field},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {The expected growth of the coal seam gas industry in Australia requires
   baseline information for determining any potential long-term impacts of
   the industry. As such, a 1-year atmospheric time series measuring radon
   (Rn-222), methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), delta C-13-CO2 and delta
   C-13-CH4 was conducted in an area where coal seam gas (CSG; also
   referred to as coal bed methane) extraction is proposed (Casino, New
   South Wales, Australia). We hypothesise that Rn-222 can be used as a
   tracer of soil-atmosphere CH4 and CO2 exchange, and that carbon stable
   isotope values of atmospheric CH4 and CO2 can be used to identify the
   source of greenhouse gases. Radon, CO2 and CH4 followed a diurnal
   pattern related to increased concentrations during the formation of a
   nighttime inversion layer. The study found a significant inverse linear
   relationship between Rn-222 concentrations and both rainfall (r(2)=0.43,
   p<0.01) and temperature (r(2)=0.13, p<0.01), while atmospheric pressure,
   wind speed and wind direction affected concentrations to a lesser degree
   over seasonal time scales. Rn-222 had a significant, but weak positive
   correlation with both seasonal CO2 (r(2)=0.15, p<0.01) and CH4
   (r(2)=0.11, p<0.01) concentrations. The uncoupling between Rn-222 and
   CO2 and CH4 was likely due to biogenic sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4.
   delta C-13 values of CO2 and CH4 indicated variability in the source and
   sinks of the gases that seems to be linked to different seasonal, soil
   and spatial sources. This study provides baseline data from a proposed
   coal seam gas field from which future comparisons can be made.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based management requires integration of multiple system
   components and uses, identifying and striving for sustainable outcomes,
   precaution in avoiding deleterious actions, and adaptation based on
   experience to achieve effective solutions. Efforts underway or in
   planning to restore and manage two major coastal ecosystems, the
   Chesapeake Bay (Chesapeake Bay Program) and coastal Louisiana (Louisiana
   Coastal Area Plan and Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan), are examined with
   respect to these four principles. These multifaceted restoration
   programs represent among the foremost challenges for science and coastal
   management in the United States and, thereby, have important
   implications for addressing the coastal environmental crises being
   experienced throughout the world. Although frameworks exist for
   integration of management objectives in both regions, the technical
   ability for the quantitatively integrated assessment of multiple
   stressors and strategies is still in an early stage of development.
   Science is also being challenged to identify sustainable futures, but
   emerging concepts of ecosystem resilience offer some promising
   approaches. Precautionary management is best conceived with regard to
   fisheries, but should become a more explicit consideration for managing
   risks and avoiding unanticipated consequences of restoration activities.
   Adaptive management is embraced as a central process in coastal
   Louisiana ecosystem restoration, but has not formally been implemented
   in the more mature Chesapeake Bay restoration. Based on these
   experiences, ecosystem-based management could be advanced by: (1)
   orienting more scientific activity to providing the solutions needed for
   ecosystem restoration; (2) building bridges crossing scientific and
   management barriers to more effectively integrate science and
   management; (3) directing more attention to understanding and predicting
   achievable restoration outcomes that consider possible state changes and
   ecosystem resilience; (4) improving the capacity of science to
   characterize and effectively communicate uncertainty; and (5) fully
   integrating modeling, observations, and research to facilitate more
   adaptive management. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The `Unconventional oil and gas resources and the geological storage of
   carbon dioxide' section of the Proceedings is designed to provide new
   insights from recent research and exploitation within these major growth
   areas in applied geology. Research and innovation on unconventional oil
   and gas have been driven by market needs - specifically concerns over
   oil and gas supply - as well as technological development. A
   cross-section of this work is highlighted in the current set of papers,
   covering ultra-heavy oil, shale oil, shale gas, basincentred gas, tight
   gas and clathrates. Unsurprisingly, much of this research has been
   pioneered in North America. This work is complemented herein by some
   initial studies from Europe. Similarly, the geological storage of CO2 is
   not simply a story of technological advance but also a response to an
   urgent societal imperative. Carbon dioxide sequestration is recognized
   as an important method for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the near
   future, and is expected to have growing relevance to the oil and gas
   industry and the energy sector. Recent findings from current commercial
   carbon capture and storage projects in the North Sea and North Africa
   are presented and are complemented by an overview of major research
   programmes established in North America.},

Abstract = {A new research and development project ``CO2 sequestration in coal
   seams{''} began in Japan in 2002 to develop new type of ``coal mines{''}
   for CO2-enhanced coal gas recovery. Coal seams are promising for CO2
   storage and as sources of hydrocarbon gas. Researches are being devoted
   to a deeper understanding Of CO2-coal interaction, to monitoring Of CO2
   behavior in coal seams, to prospecting of untapped deep coal seams, etc.
   Supercritical CO2-enhanced coal seam gas recovery (ECGR) and in situ
   fire-free microbial gasification of coal can produce sufficient amounts
   of methane for the CO2 emission-free closed-circuit power plant and new
   type of ``coal mines{''} without underground works, even in gas-poor
   coalfields. Underground biogeochemical carbon recycling makes
   zero-emission closed-circuit power and heat generation possible, while
   coal seams and saline aquifers are capacious enough to accommodate large
   volume Of CO2 from fossil fuel and refuse-derived fuel (RDF).
   Tertiary sedimentary basins are suitable as CO2 stores, hydrocarbon gas
   reservoirs and possibly CO2-CH4 converters. Subsurface biogeochemical
   carbon recycling can realize greenhouse gas control with restoration of
   energy resources.},

Abstract = {Tropical peat swamp forests, which are predominantly located in
   Southeast Asia (SEA) and play a prominent role as a global carbon store,
   are being intensively degraded and converted to agricultural lands and
   tree plantations. For national inventories, updated estimates of peat
   emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from land use (LU) and land-use
   change in the tropics are required. In this context, we reviewed the
   scientific literature and calculated emission factors of peat net
   emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)
   in seven representative LU categories for SEA i.e. intact peat swamp
   forest, degraded forest (logged, drained and affected by fire), mixed
   croplands and shrublands, rice fields, oil palm, Acacia crassicarpa and
   sago palm plantations. Peat net CO2 uptake from or emissions to the
   atmosphere were assessed using a mass balance approach. The balance
   included main peat C inputs through litterfall and root mortality and
   outputs via organic matter mineralization and dissolved organic carbon.
   Peat net CO2 loss rate from degraded forest, croplands and shrublands,
   rice fields, oil palm, A. crassicarpa and sago palm plantations amounted
   to 19.4 +/- 9.4, 41.0 +/- 6.7, 25.6 +/- 11.5, 29.9 +/- 10.6, 71.8 +/-
   12.7 and 5.2 +/- 5.1 Mg CO2 ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Total peat GHG
   losses amounted to 20.9 +/- 9.4, 43.8 +/- 6.8, 36.1 +/- 12.9, 30.4 +/-
   10.6, 72 +/- 12.8 and 8.6 +/- 5.3 Mg CO2-equivalent ha(-1) y(-1) in the
   same LU categories, respectively. A single land-clearing fire would
   result in additional emissions of 493.6 +/- 156.0 Mg CO2-equivalent
   ha(-1).},

Abstract = {The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has agreed in 2018 on a
   reduction of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international
   shipping, which should lower the total annual CO2 emissions by at least
   50\% by 2050 compared to 2008.
   Although extensive studies exist on the impact of international shipping
   at a global scale, few tools and empirical papers are available to
   assess the progress made so far in the shift towards carbon clean
   maritime supply chains. The paper identifies the key factors affecting
   CO2 emissions by container ships based on extant literature and business
   insights and measures how much has been already achieved in the past
   decade by offering multi-trade comparisons of the situations in 2007 and
   2016.
   The paper concludes to a general decrease in annual CO2 emissions
   estimated at 33\% since 2007. Two factors explain this decrease: first,
   the CO2 fuel efficiency in grams per TEU-km ( -53\%) due to the general
   decrease in speed and change in technology, and second, the decrease
   from changes in network design leading to less distance travelled ( -
   21\%). One factor counterbalances these positive effects, i.e. the
   increase in the total deployed fleet capacity, partly due to an increase
   in the number and average size of vessels ( + 81\%). Finally, the paper
   discusses how these findings could be used by shippers and logistics
   service providers when designing cargo routing solutions in a supply
   chain setting based on their carbon efficiency.},

Abstract = {{[}1] The anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the
   Earth atmosphere will probably induce important modifications of the
   global circulation in the atmosphere and ocean. Due to the angular
   momentum conservation of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system, variation of
   the length-of-day (LOD) can be expected. By using the outputs of the
   models participating to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   (CMIP-2), we reach the following conclusions: (1) the models globally
   agree to an increase of the LOD of the order of 1 m mus/year, (2) the
   effect is mostly associated with an increase of the mean zonal wind, of
   which about one third is compensated by a change in mass repartition.},

Abstract = {Perennial seaweeds are dominant primary producers and foundation species
   along rocky shores, providing essential ecosystem functions and
   services. Although increasingly affected by various anthropogenic
   activities, the cumulative effects of multiple stressors are little
   known. We tested the interactive effects of nutrient enrichment and
   increased water temperatures on growth, nitrogen retention and carbon
   storage in juvenile Ascophyllum nodosum from Nova Scotia, Canada (44
   degrees 29.9' N, 63 degrees 31.7' W) using a multi-factorial laboratory
   experiment. Temperature strongly affected growth, significantly reducing
   weight and length gain from 16 degrees C to 20 degrees C and 24 degrees
   C. Medium nutrient enrichment enhanced while high enrichment slowed
   rockweed growth at lower temperatures, yet these effects disappeared
   with warming. Nitrogen retention in rockweed tissue significantly
   increased with nutrient enrichment and decreased with warming, whereas
   carbon storage remained unaffected. These individual and interactive
   effects of nutrient loading and climate warming may alter the structure
   and function of rockweed habitats with potentially far-reaching
   ecological and economic consequences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Ocean iron fertilization: Why further research is needed},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {911-918},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite large uncertainties in the fertilization efficiency, natural
   iron fertilization studies and some of the purposeful iron enrichment
   studies have demonstrated that Southern Ocean iron fertilization can
   lead to a significant export of carbon from the sea surface to the ocean
   interior. From an economic perspective the potential of ocean iron
   fertilization (OIF) is far from negligible in relation to other
   abatement options. Comparing the range of cost estimates to the range of
   estimates for forestation projects they are in the same order of
   magnitude, but OIF could provide more carbon credits even if high
   discount rates are used to account for potential leakage and
   non-permanence. However, the uncertainty about undesired adverse effects
   of purposeful iron fertilization on marine ecosystems and
   biogeochemistry has led to attempts to ban commercial and, to some
   extent, scientific experiments aimed at a better understanding of the
   processes involved, effectively precluding further consideration of this
   mitigation option. As regards the perspective of public international
   law, the pertinent agreements dealing with the protection of the marine
   environment indicate that OIF is to be considered as lawful if and to
   the extent to which it represents legitimate scientific research. In
   this respect, the precautionary principle can be used to balance the
   risks arising out of scientific OIF activities for the marine
   environment with the potential advantages relevant to the objectives of
   the climate change regime. As scientific OIF experiments involve only
   comparatively small negative impacts within a limited marine area,
   further scientific research must be permitted to explore the carbon
   sequestration potential of OIF in order to either reject this concept or
   integrate it into the flexible mechanisms contained in the Kyoto
   Protocol. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The United States Forest Service, a federal agency entrusted with
   managing 78 M hectares of national forestlands under a broad
   multiple-use mandate, has seen recent shifts in policy direction
   emphasizing ecological restoration, consideration of climate change
   impacts, and a focus on managing for resilient landscapes. The process
   of revising the comprehensive plans guiding national forest management
   presents opportunities to reorient objectives, activities, and
   commitments toward these goals. Here we analyze case studies of three
   national forests that have completed the forest plan revision process
   since 2014: the Francis Marion National Forest in coastal South
   Carolina, the Kaibab National Forest in northern Arizona, and the Rio
   Grande National Forest in southern Colorado. We analyze plan revision
   participants' perspectives on the opportunities and barriers to
   reorienting national forest management toward resilient landscapes and
   the broader political, social, and institutional factors that influence
   these dynamics. Key opportunities included better promoting resilient
   landscape objectives by revising fire management guidelines,
   incorporating scientific data and modeling from multiple agency and
   non-agency partners, and building opportunities for adaptive management
   via long-term trust networks. Major barriers included inconsistent
   higher-level support for resilience objectives, an emphasis on meeting
   narrow quantitative performance targets, and under-investments in

Abstract = {Farmers choose different strategies to cope with disasters. The
   scientific information on what adaption strategies do farmers across
   different socio-economic and regional strata choose to cope with
   disasters can help policymakers to make informed farm-level support

   adaptation strategy choices of farmers in Odisha have not been much
   studied in the literature. Along with identifying the most commonly
   adopted ex ante and ex post adaptation strategies of farmers, we also
   identified the common factors influencing the choice of these adaptation
   strategies. We used the Likert scale and the ordered probit model to
   analyse the primary data collected from the field survey conducted at
   the three selected coastal districts. It finds that migration, reduction
   in food consumption, and pest and disease management are the most common
   ex post strategies, whereas stocking of foodgrains and usage of
   flood-resistant seeds are the most common ex ante strategies adopted by
   the farmers. It also identifies that education, family size and the size
   of landholding are the main determinants of ex post adaptation
   strategies, whereas age, the size of landholding and family income are
   the major determinants of ex ante coping strategies.},

Title = {Nature-Based Engineering: A Review on Reducing Coastal Flood Risk With
   Mangroves},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Integration of mangroves in projects to reduce coastal flood risk is
   increasingly being recognised as a sustainable and cost-effective
   alternative. In addition to the construction of conventional hard flood
   protection infrastructure, mangroves not only contribute to attenuating
   flood events (functionality), they also recover in, and adapt to, a
   changing climate (persistence). The implementation of mangroves in flood
   risk reduction, however, remains complex. This is because the innate
   functionality and persistence of mangroves depend on a range of
   environmental conditions. Importantly, mangroves may collapse when
   environmental impacts or climatic changes exceed key system thresholds,
   bringing uncertainty into a situation where failure could endanger lives
   and livelihoods. The uncertainties in mangrove functionality and
   persistence can be dealt with by (1) improving insights in how
   ecological and physical processes affect mangrove functionality and
   persistence across scales, (2) advancing tools to accurately assess and
   predict mangrove functionality and persistence, and (3) adopting an
   adaptive management approach combined with appropriate engineering
   interventions to enhance mangrove functionality and persistence. Here,
   we review existing evidence, monitoring techniques and modelling
   approaches from the viewpoint of mangrove functionality and persistence.
   Inspired by existing guidelines for Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to
   reduce flood risk, we provide an operationalization for this new
   approach. In addition, we identify where further research efforts are
   required for the practical application of mangroves in coastal flood
   risk management. Key aspects in the variability and uncertainty of the
   functionality and persistence of mangroves are their failure and
   recovery mechanisms, which are greatly site- and storm-specific. We
   propose five characteristic damage regimes that result in increasing
   reductions of mangrove functionality as well as post-storm recovery
   periods. Further research on the quantification of these regimes and
   their thresholds is required for the successful integration of mangroves
   in coastal flood risk management. Ultimately, the key challenge is the
   development of adaptive management strategies to optimise long-term
   mangrove functionality and persistence, or their resilience. Such
   adaptive strategies should be informed by continued mangrove
   functionality and persistence assessments, based on continued monitoring
   and modelling of key mangrove thresholds, and supported through
   well-established guidelines.},

Title = {Power System Security in a Meshed North Sea HVDC Grid},

Abstract = {There are very ambitious plans in Europe for changing the energy
   infrastructure in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This
   involves scenarios where renewable energy sources by 2050 will meet
   almost 100\% of the electric power demand. This has spurred offshore
   wind farm development activities in the North Sea due to the vast wind
   energy potential in this region and the potential lack of suitable
   onshore sites in the future. Large-scale wind farms in the North Sea
   pose grid integration challenges such as the need for long-distance
   subsea power transmission and tackling the impact of wind power
   variation on alternating current (ac) grids. These challenges can be
   properly managed by the use of meshed high-voltage direct current (HVDC)
   grids. Three of the regional groups (RGs) in the European Network of
   Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), namely Regional
   Group Great Britain (RG-GB), Regional Group Nordic (RG-N), and Regional
   Group Continental Europe (RG-CE), surround the North Sea area. A meshed
   North Sea HVDC interconnection between offshore wind farms and these
   three asynchronous ac grids can also enable market integration of the
   otherwise separate regions. This, in turn, results in better utilization
   of generation and transmission infrastructures, improved security of
   power supply, and maximized utilization of renewable energy resources.
   In this paper, a test scenario of a meshed North Sea HVDC grid is
   studied to demonstrate the potential of such a system for enhancing
   power supply security of the ac grids. Simulation studies of the test
   case show that with proper control techniques, a meshed North Sea HVDC
   grid can mitigate the effect of wind power variation by facilitating
   exchange of primary and secondary reserves between asynchronous ac
   grids.},

Title = {Lignocellulosic marine biofuel: Technoeconomic and environmental
   assessment for production in Brazil and Sweden},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {239},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The impending restrictions on the sulfur content and greenhouse gas
   emissions of marine fuels represent a challenge for the maritime
   shipping industry and an opportunity for alternative fuels that may have
   lower environmental impacts but are not currently economically
   competitive. This study developed an integrated screening model to
   compare the technological, economic, and environmental performance of 33
   ``drop-in{''} marine biofuel blendstock supply chains, considering nine
   agroforestry residues and three thermochemical technologies. The biofuel
   production was modeled for 500 tonne per day ``first-of-a-kind{''}
   biorefineries to reflect near-term production.
   Supply chains were modeled for biofuel production in both Brazil and
   Sweden to explore the impact of regional differences on the biofuels'
   break-even prices and their life cycle emissions of greenhouse gases,
   SO2, and NOx. This study indicates that in the immediate term, marine
   biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks may have a minimum fuel selling
   price three or more times higher than current fossil marine fuel prices.
   Biofuels made from agricultural residues saw a 40-100 kg/GJ decrease in
   life cycle GHG emissions, but forestry residue emissions depended highly
   on biogenic carbon dioxide accounting. SO2, and NOx emissions were
   dominated primarily by combustion, which for SO2 were estimated to be
   much lower than fossil fuels, due to the negligible sulfur content of
   the biomass. Overall, no single biofuel was a clear winner in terms of
   economic and environmental performance in the model, but space is opened
   for deeper research, as the new regulations come into effect. (C) 2019

Title = {Expected Limits on the Potential for Carbon Dioxide Removal From
   Artificial Upwelling},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Artificial upwelling, the engineered upward pumping of deep ocean water,
   has long been proposed as a technique to fertilize the ocean and, more
   recently, remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. This study investigated the
   potential of artificial upwelling to contribute to carbon dioxide
   removal using a simple model with high-resolution (1 degrees x 1
   degrees) gridded monthly climatologies of upper ocean and deep ocean
   physical and chemical properties. The potential for carbon dioxide
   removal was explored across a range of observationally-informed
   carbon-to-nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios for microalgae and macroalgae
   communities, providing information on the sensitivity of the estimates
   to any assumed carbon-to-nutrient ratios. Simulated carbon dioxide
   removal across the tropical-to-subpolar ocean did not exceed 0.66 tons
   per square kilometer per year for microalgae, and did not exceed 0.85
   tons per square kilometer per year for macroalgae. Using current
   technology, the estimated global aggregate potential for carbon dioxide
   removal using microalgae was less than 50 megatons (0.05 gigatons) of
   carbon dioxide annually and the estimated global aggregate potential for
   carbon dioxide removal using macroalgae was approximately 100 megatons
   (0.1 gigatons) of carbon dioxide annually. While controlled field trials
   are needed to validate or invalidate the findings of this study, this
   study suggests that artificial upwelling is unlikely to support annual
   carbon dioxide removal at, or close to, the rate of one gigaton of
   carbon dioxide annually.},

Title = {Proposing a potential strategy concerning Mineral-enhanced Biological
   Pump (MeBP) for improving Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF)},
Journal = {APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is a geoengineering strategy aimed at
   mitigating global warming by reducing the amount of atmospheric CO2.
   However, the efficacy by which OIF vertically exports organic carbon of
   bloomed phytoplankton (mostly, diatoms) to the deep sea is low because
   of the remineralization of organic carbon during the sinking of
   diatomaceous silica (BSi). To address the low efficiency of the vertical
   C export of OIF, a potential strategy for enhancing oceanic biological
   pump using clay minerals, so-called mineral-enhanced biological pump
   (MeBP), is proposed herein. Under ideal operation of MeBP, the
   purposefully added clay minerals are supposed to agglomerate with BSi,
   facilitating an increase in the quantity of BSi settling and a decrease
   of organic carbon loss. Meanwhile, the structural Al of clay minerals
   would be assimilated by diatoms due to the biological dissolution of the
   clays, inhibiting the dissolution of BSi during its sinking. The
   abovementioned effects would significantly improve the efficiency of the
   vertical C export of OIF. The preliminary evidence and arguments in
   support of MeBP are presented.},

Title = {Community energy and emissions planning for tidal current turbines: A
   case study of the municipalities of the Southern Gulf Islands Region,
   British Columbia},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Society's dependence on fossil fuels to meet energy demands has resulted
   in an enormous release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the
   atmosphere, thereby perpetuating global climate change. The consequences
   of climate change have prompted progressive governments such as British
   Columbia to establish legislative GHG emission reductions targets, which
   have lead to energy conscience municipalities within the province
   voluntarily committing to helping achieve such targets. Best practices
   examined from European municipalities share a common theme of renewable
   energy adoption and municipally-owned utilities. An emerging renewable
   energy technology are tidal current turbines (MI's), which function to
   extract kinetic energy from the lateral movement of the tides in areas
   with considerable tidal velocities. This paper examines the history,
   physics, operational parameters, and plausible environmental impacts of
   TCTs in order to make a case for their sustainable implementation. The
   feasibility of the municipalities of North Pender Island, South Pender
   Island, and Saturna of the Southern Gulf Islands Region (SGIR), British
   Columbia, to help meet established GHG emissions reduction targets
   through the implementation of TCTs is analyzed, demonstrating that the
   deployment of 10 TCTs can produce 38,266,602 kWh/yr of electricity,
   mitigating 1138 t of CO2e, achieving 9.9\% of the cumulative municipal
   GHG emissions mitigation targets. The paper then examines a case study
   in the Shetland Islands and Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters, Scotland,
   suggesting that jurisdictional regulatory powers over TCT installation
   and operation be devolved from the British Columbia government to the
   municipal governments of North Pender Island, South Pender Island, and
   Saturna, so that such communities can reap the benefits associated with
   a municipally-owned utility.},

Title = {Taking it outside: Exploring social opposition to 21 early-stage
   experiments in radical climate interventions},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Large-scale and highly experimental interventions are being considered
   as strategies to address climate change. These include carbon dioxide
   removal approaches that are becoming a key pillar of post-Paris
   assessment and governance, as well as the more controversial suite of
   solar geoengineering methods. In this paper, we ask: Who defends and
   opposes these experiments, and why? After screening 44 early-stage
   experiments, we conduct a qualitative comparative analysis of 21 of them
   in five areas: ocean fertilization, marine cloud brightening,
   stratospheric aerosol injection, ice protection, and enhanced
   weathering. We develop a common framework of analysis, treating
   experiments as sites in which the risks and appropriate governance of
   early-stage science and technology are envisioned and disputed among
   scientists and other social groups. Our contribution is to map and
   explain the key issues of contention (why), actors (who), and tactics
   (how) that have shaped opposition across these linked fields of
   experimentation and technological development, from the 1990s till
   today. In doing so, we build upon and connect past studies on particular
   climate experiments and develop insights relevant to governance outlooks
   perceptions, discourses, and intents surrounding immature but
   potentially crucial climate technologies.},

Abstract = {Mangrove species have developed nutrient conservation mechanisms to
   adapt to oligotrophic intertidal environments. However, nutrient
   enrichment occurs worldwide, particularly in estuarine and coastal
   regions. Mangrove species may change their adaptive strategies if
   nutrient availability increases substantially. To understand how
   nutrient resorption (a major nutrient conservation strategy) responds to
   nutrient enrichment, a common mangrove species in China, Aegiceras
   corniculatum (black mangrove), was selected, and saplings were
   cultivated in nutrient-enriched soils. After one year, neither N nor P
   resorption efficiency showed significant variations with nutrient
   availability and there was no difference between N and P resorption
   efficiency. Overall, nutrient resorption efficiency of A. corniculatum
   remained at similar to 40\%, lower than the global average levels of
   evergreen plants (similar to 50\%), indicating incomplete resorption of
   nutrients. Incomplete resorption was also evidenced by the nutrient
   concentrations, resorption proficiency and N: P ratio of plant leaves.
   Collectively, these results indicate that black mangrove can maintain
   constant nutrient resorption efficiency under eutrophic conditions.},

Abstract = {An important question in the context of climate change is to understand
   how CH4 production is regulated in anoxic sediments of lakes and
   reservoirs. The type of organic carbon (OC) present in lakes is a key
   factor controlling CH4 production at anoxic conditions, but the studies
   investigating the methanogenic potential of the main OC types are
   fragmented. We incubated different types of allochthonous OC (alloOC;
   terrestrial plant leaves) and autochthonous OC (autoOC; phytoplankton
   and two aquatic plants species) in an anoxic sediment during 130 d. We
   tested if (1) the supply of fresh alloOC and autoOC to an anoxic
   refractory sediment would fuel CH4 production and if (2) autoOC would
   decompose faster than alloOC. The addition of fresh OC greatly increased
   CH4 production and the delta C-13-CH4 partitioning indicated that CH4
   originated exclusively from the fresh OC. The large CH4 production in an
   anoxic sediment fueled by alloOC is a new finding which indicates that
   all systems with anoxic conditions and high sedimentation rates have the
   potential to be CH4 emitters. The autoOC decomposed faster than alloOC,
   but the total CH4 production was not higher for all autoOC types, one
   aquatic plant species having values as low as the terrestrial leaves,
   and the other one having values as high as phytoplankton. Our study is
   the first to report such variability, suggesting that the extent to
   which C fixed by aquatic plants is emitted as greenhouse gases or buried
   as OC in sediment could more generally differ between aquatic vegetation
   types.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The management of civil infrastructure, including the allocation of
   scarce resources, is an engineering issue that now must also consider
   the highly politicized, highly debated hazard of climate change.
   Bridges, in particular, are increasingly vulnerable to damage as a
   result of the sea level rise, increasingly intense precipitation, and
   increasingly intense hurricanes that accompany climate change. This
   review paper focuses on the current challenges facing bridge owners and
   managers as a result of anthropogenic and natural climate changes. The
   complexities of the climate change are discussed and the current state
   of research regarding the direct relationship to anthropogenic climate
   changes, as well as natural climate patterns, is presented. Potential
   adaptation measures are outlined for repair and retrofit measures that
   may help mitigate the negative impact of climate change. Methodologies
   for planning under uncertainty, including stochastic and robust
   optimization methods, are discussed with respect to bridge management
   under climate change. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Sources of uncertainty in Greenland surface mass balance in the 21st
   century},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {315-331},

Abstract = {The surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland ice sheet is subject to
   considerable uncertainties that complicate predictions of sea level rise
   caused by climate change. We examine the SMB of the Greenland ice sheet
   in the 21st century with the Bergen Snow Simulator (BESSI) surface
   energy and mass balance model. To estimate the uncertainty of the SMB,
   we conduct simulations for four greenhouse gas emission scenarios using
   the output of a wide range of Earth system models (ESMs) from the sixth
   phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) to force
   BESSI. In addition, the uncertainty of the SMB simulation is estimated
   by using 16 different parameter sets in our SMB model. The median SMB
   across ESMs and parameter sets, integrated over the ice sheet, decreases
   over time for every emission scenario. As expected, the decrease in SMB
   is stronger for higher greenhouse gas emissions. The regional
   distribution of the resulting SMB shows the most substantial SMB
   decrease in western Greenland for all ESMs, whereas the differences
   between the ESMs are most pronounced in the north and around the
   equilibrium line. Temperature and precipitation are the input variables
   of the snow model that have the largest influence on the SMB and the
   largest differences between ESMs. In our ensemble, the range of
   uncertainty in the SMB is greater than in previous studies that used
   fewer ESMs as forcing. An analysis of the different sources of
   uncertainty shows that the uncertainty caused by the different ESMs for
   a given scenario is larger than the uncertainty caused by the climate
   scenarios. In comparison, the uncertainty caused by the snow model
   parameters is negligible, leaving the uncertainty of the ESMs as the
   main reason for SMB uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Three scenarios for production of Buxus microphylla var. japonica
   {[}(Mull. Arg.) Rehder \& E.H. Wilson] `Green Beauty' marketed in a no.
   3 container on the west coast of the United States were modeled based on
   grower interviews and best management practices. Life cycle inventories
   (LCIs) of input products, equipment use, and labor were developed from
   the protocols for those scenarios and a life cycle assessment (LCA) was
   conducted to determine impact of individual components on the greenhouse
   gas emissions (GHGs) and the subsequent carbon footprint (CF) of the
   product at the nursery gate and in the landscape. CF is expressed in
   global warming potential (GWP) for a 100-year period in units of
   kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (kg CO(2)e). The GWP of the
   plant from Scenario A (propagation to no. 1 to 3 container) was 2.198 kg
   CO2e with variable costs of \$4.043. Scenario B (propagation to field to
   no. 3 container) would result in a GWP of 1.717 kg CO(2)e with variable
   costs of \$2.880 and take a year longer in production than the other two
   models. The GWP of Scenario C (propagation to no. 1 to no. 2 to no. 3
   containers) would be 3.364 kg CO(2)e with variable costs of \$5.733.
   Containers, transplants/transplanting, irrigation, and fertilization
   input products and associated activities accounted for the greatest
   portion of GHG and variable costs in each scenario. Pruning,
   assembling/load trucks, pesticides, and chlorination were other
   important components to variable costs of each scenario but had little
   impact on GWP. Otherwise, the major contributors to GWP are also major
   contributors to cost.},

Abstract = {The development of the marine industry led to an increasing amount of
   fuel consumption and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. However, it is
   hard to evaluate the payback and profitability of a hybrid renewable
   ship without preparing a complete investigation. A dearth of studies
   compares between the hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) on land and
   on ships. Therefore, the main objective of this research work is to
   provide a novel comparison study for the differences between HRES on
   land and on ships, utilizing the well-known Hybrid Optimization of
   Multiple Electric Renewable (HOMER) software. To the best knowledge of
   the authors, this study is the first to do comparison regarding the HRES
   on land and on ships. This study is based on the project titled ``Study
   on the Application of Photovoltaic Technology in the Oil Tanker Ship{''}
   in China. The load profile data used is real and accurate, depending on
   the ship navigation route from Dalian in China to Aden in Yemen. The
   hybrid photovoltaic (PV)/diesel/battery system is found to be the
   optimum system regardless if it is on land or on ships with annual
   capacity shortage of 0\%, which means this system is a 100\% reliable
   system. The optimal system on land consists of 10,000 kW of PV system,
   2000 kW of diesel generators, 500 batteries and 2000 kW of power
   converters. The optimal system on ship consists of only 300 kW of PV
   system, 2000 kW of diesel generators, 10 batteries and 200 kW of power
   converters. The optimal system on ships is able to decrease the amount
   of GHG emissions by 9,735,632.5 kg during the project lifetime (25
   years). In addition, it has capability to decrease the fuel-consumption
   amount by 2,010,475 L during the project lifetime. This represents an
   incentive factor to increase the installed capacity of the PV system on
   the ships that consequently decreases the fuel-consumption amount and
   the total fuel cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Balancing conflicting mitigation and adaptation behaviours of urban
   residents under climate change and the urban heat island effect},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Under a warming climate and urban heat island effects, cooling
   behaviours are increasingly important for city dwellers. Cooling
   actions, especially air conditioning, receive increasing scrutiny in
   social science, as does engagement and communication on behaviours
   spanning adaptation and mitigation. In response, this paper evaluates
   the relation between residents' adaptation and mitigation behaviours
   around cooling in Fukuoka, Japan, and draws lessons for communication on
   encouraging adaptation and mitigation actions. A survey distributed to
   residents in six areas of Fukuoka, Japan, assessed perceptions of global
   warming and urban heat island effects, frequency of mitigation and
   adaptation behaviours, use of air conditioning, electricity bills and
   evaluation of green spaces. We observe a difference between respondents
   using air conditioning with an energysaving (i.e. mitigation) focus,
   versus those using air conditioning with an adaptation (i.e. cooling)
   focus. We also note residents emphasising mitigation behaviours may use
   shade in parks or cooling centres as alternative cooling strategies, but
   that awareness of effective air conditioning use may be lacking. Our
   findings build on existing literature by reinforcing - in a subtropical
   context - the need to reconsider practices around air conditioner use;
   and illustrate the value of a breadth of messages to promote joint
   mitigation and adaptation actions.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The increase in the share of renewable energy in the power generation
   mix plays a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of power systems, thus
   facilitating the achievement of international and national targets for
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change. Due to
   the intermittent nature of variable renewable energy, the integration of
   these sources in power systems requires investments in additional
   solutions and setting strategies to ensure grid stability and
   reliability. For that purpose, a prospective modelling was applied to
   the relatively isolated island named Procida, located in the gulf of
   Naples in Italy, through the bottom-up optimization model TIMES-Procida
   for a long-term energy plan where technical solutions, i.e., deployment
   of photovoltaics on rooftops and storage, and policy scenarios, i.e.,
   energy efficiency, were used to analyse the evolution of the energy
   system. The introduction of renewable energy could be much more relevant
   when dealing with islands; they appear as decisive territories for
   experimentation and analysis of the transformation of all power systems.
   At year 2050, our results address decarbonisation and energy autonomy.
   They show that only with high shares of renewable energy will the
   territory see a noticeable decarbonisation of its economic sectors (up
   to 24\%) and a decreasing dependency on imports (-16.6\% compared to low
   renewable integration). By comparing the results of scenarios including
   or lacking storage solutions, we showcased how this reflected on the
   investments in PV and on grid congestion relief.},

Abstract = {Present study consists solar influence on global climate change,
   including the physics of solar variability. Climate change is a
   long-term change in the weather patterns over periods of time that may
   range from decades to thousands of years. The basic components that
   influence the Earth's climatic system can occur externally (from
   extraterrestrial systems) and internally (from ocean, atmosphere and
   land systems). Total solar irradiance (TSI) has been monitored
   continuously from space since 1977. Long-term solar irradiance
   variations might contribute to global warming over decades or hundreds
   of years. According to TSI variation trends in recent decades, the Sun
   has contributed a slight cooling influence but our globe is warmed up
   continuously. It is indication for a dangerous period and high awareness
   about global warming is most essential. Adverse impact of climate change
   and global warming in our ecosystems and challenges in near future
   along-with perspective role of solar influences in recent climate change
   have been discussed in the present study.},

Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {This paper deals with the biological, ecological and economic impact of
   global warming and mangrove habitat availability on the French Guiana
   shrimp fishery. A dynamic bio-economic model is built by employing a
   shrimp stock's growth function depending on Sea Surface Temperature
   (SST) and on mangrove surface. The model is empirically calibrated for
   the French Guiana shrimp fishery using time series collected over
   1995-2011. First, two Cobb-Douglas functions, which describe shrimp's
   natural growth and harvest, are estimated. Then, a Maximum Economic
   Yield (MEY) harvest rule, based on the optimization of the net present
   value derived from fishing, is computed. Three management strategies are
   compared (Closure, Status Quo management, and MEY) under three mangrove
   surface fluctuations and climatic scenarios: (a) SST and mangrove remain
   stable, (b) SST rises while mangrove declines, (c) SST rises and
   mangrove remains stable. The scenarios considering a SST rise are based
   on the median greenhouse gases emission projections estimated by the
   IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The scenario focused
   on the reduction of mangrove surface is based on a general rate
   calculated on a global level. Our study shows that preserving the
   mangrove will increase the resiliency of French Guiana shrimp fishery in
   the long run.},

Abstract = {Warming of the earth is considered as the major adverse effect of
   climate change along with other abnormalities such as nonavailability of
   water resources, decreased agriculture production, food security, rise
   in seawater level, glaciers melting, and loss of biodiversity. Over the
   years, decreased agriculture production and water quality degradation
   have been observed due to climatic abnormalities. Crop production is
   highly sensitive to climate. It gets affected by long-term trends in
   average rainfall and temperature, annual climate variations, shocks
   during different stages of growth, and extreme weather events. Globally,
   the areas sown for the major crops of barley, maize, rice, sorghum, soya
   bean, and wheat have all seen an increase in the percentage of area
   affected by drought as defined in terms of the Palmer Drought Severity
   Index since the 1960s, from approximately 5-10\% to approximately
   15-25\%. Increase in temperature will be observed in terms of wheat
   yield losses - 5.5 +/- 4.4\% per degree Celsius for the United States, -
   9.1 +/- 5.4\% per degree Celsius for India, and - 7.8 +/- 6.3\% per
   degree Celsius for Russia as these countries are more vulnerable to
   temperature increase. Water management through increasing storage
   capacity (or rainwater storage), fair policies for water supply and
   distribution, river health, and watershed management can reduce the
   negative effects of climate change on water resource availability.
   Similarly, climate change-resistant crop development, water management
   in irrigation, adapting climate-smart agriculture approach, and
   promoting indigenous knowledge can ensure the food security via
   increasing agricultural yield. Technical intervention can equip the
   farmers with the scientific analyses of the climatic parameters required
   for the sustainable agriculture management. These technologies may
   include application of software, nutrient management, water management
   practices, instruments for temperature measurement and soil health
   analysis etc. Holistic efforts of the stakeholders (farmers, local
   society, academia, scientists, policy makers, NGOs etc.) can provide
   better results to reduce the risks of climate change on agriculture and
   water resources as discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Tropical forests play an important role in carbon storage, accumulating
   large amounts of carbon in their aboveground and belowground components.
   However, anthropogenic land-use activities have increasingly threatened
   tropical forests, resulting in accelerated global greenhouse gas
   emissions. This research aimed to estimate the carbon stocks in soil,
   organic layer, and litterfall in tropical montane forests under three
   different land uses (intact forest, logged-over forest, and plantation
   forest) at Long Mio, Sabah, Malaysia. Field data were collected in a
   total of 25 plots from which soil was randomly sampled at three depths.
   Litterfalls were collected monthly from November 2018 to October 2019.
   The results showed that the soil in the study area is Gleyic Acrisol,
   having pH values ranging between 4.21 and 5.71, and high soil organic
   matter contents. The results also showed that the total soil carbon
   stock, organic layer, and litterfall is higher in the intact forest
   (101.62 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by the logged-over forest (95.61 Mg C
   ha(-1)) and the plantation forest (93.30 Mg C ha(-1)). This study
   highlights the importance of conserving intact forests as a strategy to
   sequester carbon and climate change mitigation.},

Title = {Challenges for shared responsibility - Political and social framing of
   coastal protection transformation in the Maldives},
Journal = {ERDE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {150},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {169-183},
Abstract = {There is widespread understanding that climate change has dramatic
   impacts especially for small islands. In the Maldives, a key challenge
   is to confront erosion processes along its coasts - past approaches have
   shown to not always be sustainable. Alternative approaches to coastal
   protection are therefore urgently needed. In this paper we use the
   concept of transformative governance to identify factors in society and
   politics that act as barriers and enablers to the introduction of
   alternative approaches to coastal protection in the Maldives. We
   investigate how inhabitants perceive coastal erosion risks and analyse
   people's receptiveness to alternative coastal protection measures and
   their willingness to get involved in coastal protection. Governance
   structures are assessed against the context of conflicting central
   political, national and island peripherical interests. We identify
   hierarchical political structures in coastal protection governance as a
   dominant obstacle to alternative approaches. Based on empirical data
   collected in the research project DICES (Dealing with change in SIDS -
   societal action and political reaction in sea level change adaptation),
   we stress the importance of cultural aspects and sense of place when
   dealing with coastal protection. Further, we challenge the widespread
   assumption that people of the Maldives prefer hard coastal protection
   structures for their islands - a notion which is utilised by national
   politicians in their decision-making process to support the continuing
   application of hard protection measures. We discuss challenges to
   transformative governance related to shared responsibility, political
   power and openness to innovation.},

Journal = {ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {74},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Operationalizing resilience in fisheries management is a challenging
   issue in the face of global changes. In this perspective, Grafton et al.
   (2019) propose a heuristic based on the `3Rs' of resilience, namely
   resistance, recovery, and robustness. The work presented here applies
   this generic framework to the coastal fishery of French Guiana, which is
   under pressure because of both climate change, energy costs and
   demographic growth. To this end, a dynamic multi-species, resource-based
   and multi-fleet model accounting for climate and socio-economic
   uncertainties is developed and calibrated using catch and effort time
   series. The search for a more resilient management leads us to compare
   different fishing management strategies and projections including
   `Business as usual' (BAU), `Multispecies Maximum Sustainable Yield'
   (MMSY) and `Multispecies Maximum Economic Yield' (MMEY) strategies. The
   comparison between the strategies relies on ecological-economic
   viability goals and thresholds. The two normative strategies MMSY and
   MMEY turn out to provide major gains in terms of the 3Rs and
   ecological-economic resilience as compared to BAU. They both suggest
   major redistributions in the fishing effort of the different fleets. (c)

Title = {Effect of Salinity in Alpine Lakes on the Southern Tibetan Plateau on
   Greenhouse Gas Diffusive Fluxes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES},

Abstract = {Inland waters play an important role in the global carbon cycle and are
   potential hotspots of greenhouse gas (GHG) production and emission.
   However, considerable uncertainty exists in GHG estimations from lakes
   on the Tibetan Plateau due, in part, to the lack of direct in situ
   observations and key predictor analyses. Considering that salinity is an
   important factor regulating lake GHGs, diffusive methane flux (FCH4) and
   carbon dioxide flux (FCO2) and concentrations of dissolved CH4 (dCH(4))
   and CO2 (dCO(2)) were measured in 16 freshwater and brackish Tibetan
   lakes in Shigatse. The results demonstrated that FCH4 at the water-air
   interface in freshwater lakes (45.14 +/- 58.86 mu mol center dot
   m(-2)center dot s(-1)) was 15 times higher than that in brackish lakes
   (2.92 +/- 3.85 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)). There was a
   significant decrease in FCH4 from the littoral zone to the pelagic area
   in these lakes. The FCO2 in freshwater lakes (-0.18 +/- 0.39 mu mol
   center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) was significantly lower than that in
   brackish lakes (0.38 +/- 0.22 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)).
   Therefore, freshwater lakes were regarded as CO2 sinks, while brackish
   lakes were regarded as CO2 sources. According to the comprehensive CO2
   equivalent diffusive fluxes (FCO(2)eq, 0.66 +/- 0.97 mu mol center dot
   m(-2)center dot s(-1)), the 16 lakes were a carbon source to the
   atmosphere during the sampling period. FCO2 enhancement could be
   compensated by the decrease in FCH4 at the water-air interface as a
   result of salinity gradients across lakes. Under the scenarios of
   climate warming and drying in southern Tibet from 2020 to 2035, lake
   FCO(2)eq tended to decrease in this area.},

Abstract = {Recently affected both by high oil prices continue to run and
   environmental pollution and global climate change, the world set off a
   new round of biomass energy development and utilization. In China the
   situation that shortage of power seems getting much more serious. But it
   is well known that less arable land is one of China's basic national
   conditions. In this context shoreline and other marginal lands to
   cultivate energy crops for biomass energy play an important role in the
   field. However in the past two decades the East China Sea environment
   has faced huge stresses from anthropogenic activities and population
   growth in the Yangtze River drainage basin and the coastal areas. In
   order to cope with these environmental problems and provide alternative
   energy, planting trees is of importance and significance for improving
   environment and producing renewable biomass energy in the region.
   Moreover biomass plantations are an effective way to reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions and provide rural people with a diversified source of
   income and products with multiple uses.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Capture and geological sequestration of CO2 from energy production is
   proposed to help mitigate climate change caused by anthropogenic
   emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Performance goals set by
   the US Department of Energy for CO2 storage permanence include retention
   of at least 99\% of injected CO2 which requires detailed assessments of
   each potential storage site's geologic system, including reservoir(s)
   and seal(s). The objective of this study was to review relevant
   basin-wide physical and chemical characteristics of geological seals
   considered for saline reservoir CO2 sequestration in the United States.
   Results showed that the seal strata can exhibit substantial
   heterogeneity in the composition, structural, and fluid transport
   characteristics on a basin scale. Analysis of available field and
   wellbore core data reveal several common inter-basin features of the
   seals, including the occurrence of quartz, dolomite, illite, calcite,
   and glauconite minerals along with structural features containing
   fractures, faults, and salt structures. In certain localities within the
   examined basins, some seal strata also serve as source rock for oil and
   gas production and can be subject to salt intrusions. The regional
   features identified in this study can help guide modeling, laboratory,
   and field studies needed to assess local seal performances within the
   examined basins.},

Abstract = {Some coastal environments facing climate change risks are starting to be
   managed with nature-based solutions (NBS). Strategies based on the
   rehabilitation of green infrastructures in coastal municipalities, such
   as renaturalization of seafronts, are considered adaptive to the effects
   of climate change but may cause misconceptions that could lead to social
   conflicts between the tourist sector and the society. A survey was
   carried out to study user perceptions on the effects of climate change,
   preferences for adaptation strategies, and the assessment of projects of
   dune reconstruction. We find that while beach users recognize the
   benefits of NBS for environmental conservation and storm protection,
   they show little concern about possible effects of climate change on
   recreational activity and have limited understanding about the
   protective capacity of NBS. Thus, a greater effort must be made to
   better explain the effects of climate change and the potential benefits
   of NBS in coastal risk management.},

Title = {The Influence of Volatile Organic Compounds on Climate Change: A brief
   review},
Journal = {REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the increase of anthropic activities has generated
   several environmental and socioeconomic impacts, causing chemical and
   physical changes in Earth's atmosphere. Among them, we can highlight the
   increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, intensified by the
   industrialization and urbanization processes after the industrial
   revolution. In addition to the most common GHGs, volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) emitted by biogenic and anthropogenic sources also
   contribute to the absorption of infrared radiation and the increase in
   the global average surface temperature. VOCs play an important role in
   the atmosphere, such as the formation of photochemical smog, secondary
   aerosols and, consequently, climate change. Furthermore, the occurrence
   of different environmental impacts, such as cyclones, thermal inversion,
   melting glaciers, and rising sea levels, are associated with the
   uncontrolled emission of different VOCs in the atmosphere. Therefore,
   the main objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of VOCs on
   climate change, in addition to proposing some sustainable strategies to
   mitigate the release of these pollutants into the atmosphere, in order
   to control the increase in global warming and reduce the incidence of
   chemical and climatic phenomena, that become more frequent in the
   current scenario.},

Abstract = {A series of coupled atmosphere-ocean-land global climate model (GCM)
   simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
   Community Climate System Model 3 (CCSM3) has been performed for the
   period 1870-2099 at a T85 horizontal resolution following the GCM
   experimental design suggested in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). First, a hindcast was
   performed using the atmospheric concentrations of three greenhouse gases
   (CO2, CH4, N2O) specified annually and globally on the basis of
   observations for the period 1870-1999. The hindcast results were
   compared with observations to evaluate the GCM's reliability in future
   climate simulations. Second, climate projections for a 100-year period
   (2000-2099) were made using six scenarios of the atmospheric
   concentrations of the three greenhouse gases according to the A1FI, A1T,
   A1B, A2, B1, and B2 emission profiles of the Special Report on Emissions
   Scenarios. The present CCSM simulations are found to be consistent with
   IPCC's AR4 results in the temporal and spatial distributions for both
   the present-day and future periods. The GCM results were used to examine
   the changes in extreme temperatures and precipitation in East Asia and
   Korea. The extreme temperatures were categorized into warm and cold
   events: the former includes tropical nights, warm days, and heat waves
   during summer (June-July-August) and the latter includes frost days,
   cold days, and cold surges during winter (December-January-February).
   Focusing on Korea, the results predict more frequent heat waves in
   response to future emissions: the projected percentage changes between
   the present day and the late 2090s range from 294\% to 583\% depending
   on the emission scenario. The projected global warming is predicted to
   decrease the frequency of cold extreme events; however, the projected
   changes in cold surge frequency are not statistically significant.
   Whereas the number of cold surges in the A1FI emission profile decreases
   from the present-day value by up to 24\%, the decrease in the B1
   scenario is less than 1\%. The frequency and intensity of extreme
   precipitation events year-round were examined. Both the frequency and
   the intensity of these events are predicted to increase in the region
   around Korea. The present results will be helpful for establishing an
   adaptation strategy for possible climate change nationwide, especially
   extreme climate events, associated with global warming.},

Title = {Blue carbon effects of mangrove restoration in subtropics where Spartina
   alterniflora invaded},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mangrove swamps and salt marshes are noted for their large carbon
   sequestration and storage capacity. In southeastern China, mangrove
   transplantation is conducted as ecological restoration where exotic
   Spartina alterniflora (hereafter Spartina) is removed. This study aimed
   to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove trans-plantation on carbon
   sink potential. We analyzed chronological sediment accretion, soil
   carbon sequestration, and carbon storage of mangroves and Spartina on
   Maoyan and Ximen islands. Results showed that on both islands mangroves
   and invasive Spartina stored 12.7\%-31.4\% more carbon than bare
   mudflats over top meter soils, with Spartina outperforming restored
   mangroves. Both restored mangroves and invasive Spartina enhanced
   sediment accretion, but this enhancement was minimal in high sediment
   supply areas like Maoyan. Spartina invasion improved carbon
   sequestration capacity compared to bare mudflats in Maoyan, but mangrove
   restoration failed. In low sediment supply areas like Ximen, restored
   mangroves have outperformed Spartina invasion on carbon sequestration
   enhancement since >5 years of planting. Thus, carbon sink potential of
   mangrove restoration depended on sediment supply and time, with sediment
   supply being more important. We suggested that it was preferable to
   conduct mangrove restoration with Spartina eradication in low sediment
   supply areas in subtropics.},

Abstract = {As we struggle to cope with the ongoing buildup of CO2 produced by
   burning fossil fuels, can we acquire guidance from the geologic record?
   Although our ability to reconstruct past atmospheric CO2 content
   reliably is currently confined to the last 800 thousand years, we do
   have compelling evidence that this greenhouse gas played a key role
   throughout the Earth's history. It certainly compensated for the young
   Sun's lower luminosity. There is no question that it bailed us out of
   two snowball episodes or that it led to a brief 5 degrees C warming at
   the onset of the Eocene. Less certain is that diminishing atmospheric
   CO2 content was responsible for the global cooling that began 50 million
   years ago when the Indian subcontinent collided with Asia. Finally, it
   colluded with changing seasonality, ocean circulation re-organisation
   and iron fertilisation to generate the 100 thousand year glacial cycles
   that dominated the last half-million years.},

Abstract = {Currently wind power is dominated by onshore wind farms in the British
   Isles, but both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland have high
   renewable energy targets, expected to come mostly from wind power.
   However, as the demand for wind power grows to ensure security of energy
   supply, as a potentially cheaper alternative to fossil fuels and to meet
   greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets offshore wind power will grow
   rapidly as the availability of suitable onshore sites decrease. However,
   wind is variable and stochastic by nature and thus difficult to
   schedule. In order to plan for these uncertainties market operators use
   wind forecasting tools, reserve plant and ancillary service agreements.
   Onshore wind power forecasting techniques have improved dramatically and
   continue to advance, but offshore wind power forecasting is more
   difficult due to limited datasets and knowledge. So as the amount of
   offshore wind power increases in the British Isles robust forecasting
   and planning techniques are even more critical. This paper presents a
   methodology to investigate the impacts of better offshore wind
   forecasting on the operation and management of the single wholesale
   electricity market in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland using
   PLEXOS for Power Systems.},

Abstract = {Cattle ranchers and dairy farmers operating throughout many tropical
   regions are experiencing major challenges associated with climate change
   such as higher incidence of heat stress and drought. These effects can
   result in reduced productivity of rangeland, shortage of nutritional
   feed, increased heat stress on animals, and high energy costs for
   cooling. High temperatures and resultant heat stress reduce animal
   productivity and increase the proliferation and survival of parasites
   and disease pathogens. Warming reduces the ability of dairy cattle to
   produce milk and gain weight and can also lower conception rates. This
   paper reviews research from the Caribbean on heat tolerant traits in
   bovine and presents evidence that introducing a ``slick hair{''} gene
   into Holstein cows by crossbreeding with Senepols may increase
   thermo-tolerance and productivity. As in other parts of the tropics,
   principal cattle breeds in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have
   been largely introduced from temperate regions. Research indicates these
   animals may be poorly adapted to rising temperatures, leaving them
   increasingly vulnerable to chronic heat stress and reduced productivity.
   Adaptive practices have been developed in breeding and pasture
   management programs including selection for more heat-resistant
   genotypes, silvopasturing and crop diversification in forage production,
   and optimizing facilities and practices to reduce heat stress. Given the
   nature of climate vulnerability, an integrated approach to adaptation
   will likely have the greatest success in reducing future risk for
   producers.},

Abstract = {Biofuels derived from biomass will play a major role in future renewable
   energy supplies in transport. Gaseous biofuels have superior energy
   balances, offer greater greenhouse gas emission reductions and produce
   lower pollutant emissions than liquid biofuels. Biogas derived through
   fermentation of wet organic substrates will play a major role in future
   transport systems. Biogas (which is composed of approximately 60\%
   methane/hydrogen and 40\% carbon dioxide) requires an upgrading process
   to reduce the carbon dioxide content to less than 3\% before it is used
   as compressed gas in transport. This paper reviews recent developments
   in fermentative biogas production and upgrading as a transport fuel.
   Third generation gaseous biofuels may be generated using marine-based
   algae via two-stage fermentation, cogenerating hydrogen and methane.
   Alternative biological upgrading techniques, such as biological
   methanation and microalgal biogas upgrading, have the potential to
   simultaneously upgrade biogas, increase gaseous biofuel yield and reduce
   carbon dioxide emission. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A new framework for rapidly assessing national adaptation policies: an

   Oceans},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},

Abstract = {Adapting to climate change is becoming a routine and necessary component
   of planning at all levels. In the case of small island developing states
   (SIDS), the successful development, implementation and evaluation of
   national-level adaptation policies are especially important because of
   their disproportionate vulnerability. The status of adaptation policies
   in these countries, however, is poorly understood and documented,
   particularly for the Atlantic, Indian Oceans, Mediterranean and South
   China Seas (AIMS) region. This is so largely because of minimal
   mainstream research interest in these small nations. This paper helps
   fill this gap. It develops an Adaptation Policy Assessment Framework
   that facilitates a rapid qualitative assessment of countries' national
   adaptation policies. It applies the framework to seven representative
   policies across six of the nine SIDS in the AIMS region-Comoros,
   Guinea-Bissau, Maldives, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles and
   Singapore. It finds that countries are mostly successful in identifying
   climate and climate-related vulnerabilities and linking associated risks
   to other national development priorities such as poverty reduction.
   Countries, however, struggle with establishing and maintaining systems
   to review and improve adaptation interventions, which is not entirely
   unique to them or their circumstances. This paper's findings provide
   critical points of reflection for countries preparing and revising their
   National Adaptation Plans in the context of the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change. They also contribute to a broader
   understanding of the complexities of climate policy development in small
   jurisdictions.},

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {422-432},
Abstract = {A methodology for assessing fossil fuel-related carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions from operations performed in eucalypt and maritime pine stands
   was developed and applied to Portugal. This methodology includes all the
   operations carried out during site preparation, stand establishment,
   stand tending, logging and infrastructure establishment. For the year
   2000, CO2 emissions for the entire area of maritime pine and eucalypt
   stands in Portugal were estimated to be 51 and 67 Gg CO2 year(-1),
   respectively. These results demonstrate the more intensive nature of the
   management activities used in eucalypt stands, as these stands occupied
   an area approximately 30\% smaller than maritime pine stands and
   produced only 5\% more harvested wood than maritime pine stands. Wood
   logging accounted for approximately 40\% of the total annual CO2
   emissions in both stands. The results obtained from a sensitivity
   analysis suggest that annual CO2 emissions from eucalypt and maritime
   pine stands could be decreased by nearly 20\% if, simultaneously, mowing
   is used instead of disking in clearing/cleaning operations, soil
   scarification is made by furrowing and ridging instead of ripping
   followed by subsoiling, and forwarders are used instead of modified farm
   tractors in wood extraction. A reduction of approximately 30\% could be
   obtained for maritime pine stands if, in addition, natural regeneration
   is used instead of planting.},

Abstract = {The impact of uncertainty in the rate of heat and carbon uptake by the
   deep ocean on climate response to increases in greenhouse gas
   concentrations is studied by means of simulations with a two-dimensional
   climate-chemistry model. We assume that mixing of both heat
   perturbations and carbon into the deep ocean can be parameterized by
   effective diffusion. Comparison of two-dimensional model and coupled
   atmosphere-ocean GCM simulations justifies such an approach for
   projections 100-150 years ahead. Rates of vertical mixing fbr
   temperature perturbations and carbon are assumed to be positively
   correlated. We consider the uncertainty range of transient projections
   of climate change when the above correlation is taken into account.
   Compared to taking into account changes just in the rate of heat uptake,
   we find that the range of projections of global surface warming is
   increased, but the range of projections of sea level rise due to thermal
   expansion is decreased.},

Title = {The supervision and multi-sectoral guarantee mechanism of the global
   marine sulphur limit-assessment from Chinese shipping industry},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {To significantly reduce sulfur oxides emissions from fossil fuel-powered
   ships, reduce air pollution in ports and slow ocean acidification, the
   International Maritime Organization (IMO) has imposed the new 0.50\%m/m
   limit (reduced from 3.50\%m/m in the past) on sulphur in ships' fuel
   oil. This has given rise to a host of issues regarding fuel
   replenishment operations, safe operation management, maritime
   regulation, and coordinated governance of air and climate. In response
   to ocean acidification and climate change, regulations on the use of
   low-sulfur oil or alternative fuels by ships greatly reduce sulfur oxide
   emissions, but have no significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions. In fact, the refining process for low-sulfur fuels and the
   use of the gas cleaning system on ships both increase energy consumption
   and carbon dioxide emissions. To ensure the decarbonization process of
   shipping industry, there is an urgent need for a conceptual change in
   global ocean governance so as to promote the coordinated governance of
   air pollution and climate change. China's conception of ``a maritime
   community with a shared future{''} provides a new model for global ocean
   governance. The Chinese government has formulated regulations at
   different levels to promote the coordinated management of atmospheric
   pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding supervision of sulfur
   oxide emissions from ships, this study proposes to build a
   multi-department collaborative supervision mechanism from marine fuel
   life cycle to enhance sulfur oxide monitoring and risk control
   capabilities. Specific measures of the proposed supervision mechanism
   include: the joint supervision of compliant fuel supply, the compliant
   fuel information disclosure platform, a joint law enforcement mechanism
   for atmospheric pollution, the ability of intelligent ship exhaust
   monitoring, and the construction of port power infrastructure.},

Title = {Measuring Peripherality as a Proxy for Autonomous Community Coping
   Capacity: A Case Study from Bua Province, Fiji Islands, for Improving
   Climate Change Adaptation},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Over the past thirty years, externally-driven interventions for
   climate-change adaptation in rural Pacific Island contexts have largely
   failed to be effective or sustained. One reason is that traditional
   (culturally-grounded) autonomous community coping capacity has been
   overlooked, many external agencies viewing all such communities as both
   homogenous and helpless. A community's autonomous coping capacity can be
   proxied by peripherality, a measure of the degree to which a particular
   community in archipelagic (island) countries engages with core agendas.
   In order to gauge the depth, breadth and efficacy of autonomous coping
   capacity, three indices of community peripherality were developed from
   research within thirteen communities in (peripheral-biased) Bua Province
   in Fiji. Index 1 concerns geography (travel time/cost to town), Index 2
   concerns population and employment (community size, age distribution,
   employment), and Index 3 concerns tradition and global awareness (mobile
   phones per capita, traditional/western healthcare preferences, inherent
   coping capacity, diet, water and energy security). Mapping of Indices
   1-3 allows the nature of community peripherality in Bua to be captured
   using a readily-reproducible tool for rapid assessment in similar
   contexts. It is demonstrated that an understanding of peripherality (as
   a proxy for autonomous community coping capacity) can inform the design
   of future interventions for climate-change adaptation.},

Title = {THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEASURES TO REDUCE THE MAN-MADE GREENHOUSE-EFFECT -
   THE APPLICATION OF A CLIMATE-POLICY MODEL},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {103-118},
Abstract = {In this paper we briefly describe the characteristics and the
   performance of our 1-D Muenster Climate Model. The model system consists
   of coupled models including gas cycle models, an energy balance model
   and a sea level rise model. The chemical feedback mechanisms among
   greenhouse gases are not included. This model, which is a
   scientifically-based parameterized simulation model, is used here
   primarily to help assess the effectiveness of various plausible policy
   options in mitigating the additional man-made greenhouse warming and the
   resulting sea level rise.
   For setting priorities it is important to assess the effectiveness of
   the various measures by which the greenhouse effect can be reduced. To
   this end we take a Scenario Business-as-Usual as a reference case
   (Leggett et al., 1992) and study the mitigating effects of the following
   four packages of measures: The Copenhagen Agreements on CFC, HCFC, and
   halon reduction (GECR, 1992), the Tropical Forest Preservation Plan of
   the Climate Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament on CO, reduction
   (ECGP, 1990), a detailed reduction scheme for energy-related CO2 (ECGP,
   1990), and a preliminary scheme for CH4, CO, and N2O reduction (Bach and
   Jain, 1992-1993).
   The required reduction depends, among others, on the desired climate and
   ecosystem protection. This is defined by the Enquete-Commission and
   others as a mean global rate of surface temperature change of ca.
   0.1-degrees-C per decade - assumed to be critical to many ecosystems -
   and a mean global warming ceiling of ca. 2-degrees-C in 2100 relative to
   1860.
   Our results show that the Copenhagen Agreements, the Tropical Forest
   Preservation Plan, the energy-related CO2 reduction scheme, and the CH,
   and N2O reduction schemes could mitigate the anthropogenic greenhouse
   warming by ca. 12\%, 6\%, 35\%, and 9\% respectively. Taken together,
   all four packages of measures could reduce the man-made greenhouse
   effect by more than 60\% until 2100; i.e. over the climate sensitivity
   range 2.5-degrees-C (1.5 to 4.5) for 2 x CO2, the warming could be
   reduced from 3.5-degrees-C (2.4 to 5.0) without specific measures to
   1.3-degrees-C (0.9 to 2.0) with the above packages of measures; and
   likewise, the mean global sea level rise could be reduced from 65 cm (46
   to 88) without specific measures to 32 cm (22 to 47) with the above
   measures.
   Finally, the model results also emphasize the importance of trace gases
   other than CO2 in mitigating additional man-made greenhouse warming.
   According to our preliminary estimates, CH4 could in the short term make
   a sizable contribution to the reduction of the greenhouse effect
   (because of its relatively short lifetime of 10 yr), as could N2O in the
   medium and long term (with a relatively long lifetime of 150 yr).},

   includes a view of where the region is now, where it seems to be heading
   if conventional development patterns persist, and where alternatively it
   could aim - a sustainability vision. In the sustainability vision, a
   high degree of economic equity and full employment are attained,
   greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced, the acidification of soils
   and waters are kept within safe tolerance levels and the Baltic Sea is
   restored to ecological health. Preconditions for realising this future
   include the diffusion of clean and efficient technologies, reorientation
   of consumer demand towards less resource-intensive products, public
   support for strong sustainability policies, and a cooperative climate

Abstract = {Mauritius relies heavily on fossil fuel imports to satisfy the energy
   requirements of its population. Urged by policies to address climate
   change at the national and international levels, the government is
   committed to promote sustainable development, with emphasis laid on
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, we provide an
   assessment of rooftop PV potential at the national level. A sampling
   strategy is used to acquire reduction coefficients, which are thereafter
   applied to energy-based equations. The result suggests that the rooftop
   PV potential at the country-scale is estimated at 20.04 GW with an
   annual energy output of 32,512 GWh. A novel architectural layout for a
   Solar City to be located at an identified optimum site is proposed. A
   shading analysis is conducted to verify the appropriateness of the
   city's structural design to harness energy from the sun. An energy
   analysis performed, reveals that the Solar City has a solar power
   potential of 13.55 MW and an annual energy generation capacity
   equivalent to 21.99 GWh. Construction of the Solar City would help avert
   the emissions of 13,744 tons of CO2 annually.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of floating offshore wind farms: An evaluation of
   operation and maintenance},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {307},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {One of the key objectives for renewable energy technologies is to reduce
   the environmental impact of energy generation. Floating offshore wind
   technologies have been developed in recent years to exploit the wind
   energy resource available at deep waters where bottom-fixed technologies
   are not economical. However, few studies exist that analyse the
   environmental impact of such technologies. Particularly, offshore
   activities such as those required for Operation and Maintenance (O\&M)
   are not represented in detail in previous studies. The present study
   addresses these gaps by performing a Life Cycle Assessment using an
   advanced O\&M model to quantify the environmental impact of a floating
   offshore wind farm. Different O\&M philosophies - assuming towing to
   shore for major operations vs. performing all operations on site - and
   their impact are evaluated and discussed for two case studies inspired
   by real pilot park deployments. The results show mean Global Warming
   Potential (GWP) values between 25.6 and 45.2 gCO2 eq/kWh depending on
   the assumed O\&M strategy and vessels, with the contribution of O\&M to
   GWP ranging from 6 to 40\%. Assuming O\&M strategies to be the same for
   fixed and floating offshore wind could result in a 20.4\% underestimate
   of GWP, whereas the vessel choice resulted in up to 34.8\% difference in
   the estimated GWP. An environmental impact perspective provides key
   insights on the choice of different designs, operation strategies and
   asset management, and thus should be used in the decision-making
   process.},

Abstract = {The state of Alaska is experiencing increased coastal erosion due to
   climatic changes that threaten shoreline, infrastructure, and Alaska
   Native ways of life. While several Alaska Native villages have been
   impacted by severe erosion, additional communities face burgeoning
   erosion concerns. St. Paul, a remote island located in the Bering Sea,
   Alaska, and home to similar to 450 Unangan, or Aleut, residents, is
   experiencing relatively new erosion and associated flooding issues. This
   study aimed to inform St. Paul's erosion monitoring and climate
   adaptation strategies by documenting community perceptions of coastal
   erosion as an ecological and social threat within a broader context of
   multiple established climate stressors. We interviewed 21 residents to
   answer: (1) what are the community's perceptions of erosion on St. Paul
   in the context of the island's other environmental concerns?; (2) do
   current perceptions of erosion affect how local governing and management
   entities address erosion impacts?; and (3) how does erosion relate to
   and impact Unangan cultural traditions and heritage? Residents
   identified six locations of primary concern, owing to how erosion of
   those areas impact their culture, subsistence practices, and sense of
   place. We suggest methods in which local entities can better support
   proactive climate adaptation and mitigation measures and utilize
   resources for community-driven adaption planning. By documenting
   perspectives in Indigenous communities on emergent climate impacts, as
   well as perceptions of adaptation planning and implementation, it can
   establish the foundation for more collaborative, culturally relevant,
   and successful community-driven climate adaptation planning.},

Title = {Towards the IMO's GHG Goals: A Critical Overview of the Perspectives and
   Challenges of the Main Options for Decarbonizing International Shipping},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {The Initial Strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
   ships adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2018
   commits the IMO to reduce total GHG emissions of shipping by at least
   50\% by 2050. Though the direction of the Strategy is clear, the path to
   implementation remains uncertain. The ambitious IMO's target calls for
   widespread uptake of lower and zero-carbon fuels, in addition to other
   energy efficiency measures, including operational and market ones. Using
   a triangulated research approach, this paper provides a critical
   overview of the main measures and initiatives the shipping industry can
   adopt to try to cope with the new IMO's requirements. The pros and cons
   of the most popular emission reduction options are investigated along
   with the main challenges and barriers to implementation and the
   potential facilitators that could foster a wider application. The
   framework that is outlined is complex and not without controversy.
   Research can play a key role as a facilitator of shipping's
   decarbonization by providing its contribution to overcoming the existing
   controversies on various decarbonization options and by developing a
   wealth of knowledge that can encourage the implementation of low-carbon
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {Recent changes in trend and variability of the main Southern Hemisphere
   climate modes are driven by a variety of factors, including increasing
   atmospheric greenhouse gases, changes in tropical sea surface
   temperature, and stratospheric ozone depletion and recovery. One of the
   most important implications for climatic change is its effect via
   climate teleconnections on natural ecosystems, water security, and fire
   variability in proximity to populated areas, thus threatening human
   lives and properties. Only sparse and fragmentary knowledge of
   relationships between teleconnections, lightning strikes, and fire is
   available during the observed record within the Southern Hemisphere.
   This constitutes a major knowledge gap for undertaking suitable
   management and conservation plans. Our analysis of documentary fire
   records from Mediterranean and temperate regions across the Southern
   Hemisphere reveals a critical increased strength of climate-fire
   teleconnections during the onset of the 21st century including a tight
   coupling between lightning-ignited fire occurrences, the upward trend in
   the Southern Annular Mode, and rising temperatures across the Southern
   Hemisphere.},

Title = {Effect of hydrogen addition on criteria and greenhouse gas emissions for
   a marine diesel engine},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {39},
Number = {21},
Pages = {11336-11345},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Hydrogen remains an attractive alternative fuel to petroleum and a
   number of investigators claim that adding hydrogen to the air intake
   manifold of a diesel engine will reduce criteria emissions and diesel
   fuel consumption. Such claims are appealing when trying to
   simultaneously reduce petroleum consumption, greenhouse gases and
   criteria pollutants. The goal of this research was to measure the change
   in criteria emissions (CO, NOx and PM2.5) and greenhouse gases such as
   carbon dioxide (CO2), using standard test methods for a wide range of
   hydrogen addition rates. A two-stroke Detroit Diesel Corporation
   12V-71TI marine diesel engine was mounted on an engine dynamometer and
   tested at three out of the four loads specified in the ISO 8178-4 E3
   emission test cycle and at idle. The engine operated on CARB ultra-low
   sulfur \#2 diesel with hydrogen added at flow rates of 0, 22 and 220
   SLPM.
   As compared with the base case without hydrogen, measurements showed
   that hydrogen injection at 22 and 220 SLPM had negligible influence on
   the overall carbon dioxide specific emission, EFCO2. However, in
   examining data at each load the data revealed that at idle EFCO2 was
   reduced by 21\% at 22 SLPM (6.9\% of the added fuel energy was from
   hydrogen) and 37.3\% at 220 SLPM (103.1\% of the added fuel energy was
   from hydrogen). At all other loads, the influence of added hydrogen was
   insignificant. Specific emissions for nitrogen oxides, EFNOx, and fine
   particulate matters, EFPM2 5, showed a trade-off relationship at idle.
   At idle, EFNOx was reduced by 28\% and 41\% with increasing hydrogen
   flow rates, whilst EFPM2 5 increased by 41\% and 86\% respectively. For
   other engine loads, EFNOx and EFPM2.5 did not change significantly with
   varying hydrogen flow rates. One of the main reasons for the greater
   impact of hydrogen at idle is that the contribution of hydrogen to the
   total fuel energy is much higher at idle as compared to the other loads.
   The final examination in this paper was the system energy balance when
   hydrogen is produced by an on-board electrolysis unit. An analysis at
   75\% engine load showed that hydrogen production increased the overall
   equivalent fuel consumption by 2.6\% at 22 SLPM and 17.7\% at 220 SLPM.

Title = {Transatlantic wood pellet trade demonstrates telecoupled benefits},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {European demand for renewable energy resources has led to rapidly
   increasing transatlantic exports of wood pellets from the southeastern
   United States (SE US) since 2009. Disagreements have arisen over the
   global greenhouse gas reductions associated with replacing coal with
   wood, and groups on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have raised
   concerns that increasing biomass exports might negatively affect SE US
   forests and the ecosystem services they provide. We use the telecoupling
   framework to test assertions that the intended benefits of the wood
   pellet trade for Europe might be offset by negative consequences in the
   SE US. Through a review of current literature and available data sets,
   we characterize the observed and potential changes in the environmental,
   social, and economic components of the sending and receiving regions to
   assess the overall sustainability of this renewable energy system. We
   conclude that the observed transatlantic wood pellet trade is an example
   of a mutually beneficial telecoupled system with the potential to
   provide environmental and socioeconomic benefits in both the SE US and
   Europe despite some negative effects on the coal industry. We recommend
   continued monitoring of this telecoupled system to quantify the
   environmental, social, and economic interactions and effects in the
   sending, receiving, and spillover systems over time so that
   evidence-based policy decisions can be made with regard to the
   sustainability of this renewable energy pathway.},

Abstract = {Coastal tourism is a vital part of the world economy bit also
   facilitates access to ?blue spaces? ? this offers significant health
   benefits to populations and shapes our relationship with the coast. At
   present, climate change impacts on the coast, such as storm surges and
   rising sea levels, are an inevitability and, in some regions, they are
   already damaging coastal tourism economies. It is clear, therefore, that
   our relationship with the coast will change. Given the importance of
   coastal tourism, this new relationship needs to incorporate adaptive
   measures; including a blue space and wellbeing focus, education and
   awareness of challenges facing the natural environment. We make this
   case by re-evaluating the literature on coastal tourism and climate
   adaptation policies. Using recent examples, we also offer an indication
   of new policy directions for coastal destinations. At present coastal
   tourism plans and policies largely ignore how destinations might respond
   and adapt to climate change impacts. We critique this and suggest that
   the human?environment relationship should be placed directly at the
   centre of all thinking on this topic.},

   provided by the EU-funded Project Euro-CORDEX with horizontal resolution
   of 0.11 degrees (-12 km) under the Representative Concentration Pathway
   RCP 8.5. The climate change scenarios have been characterized at
   seasonal scale, by comparing the current climate (1971-2000) with
   projections at short (FUT1=2021-2050), medium (2041-2070) and long
   (FUT2=2071-2100) terms.
   Without mitigation actions, the more significant results highlight a
   warming of about 2 degrees C in the next decades, 3 degrees C in the mid
   of the century, and more than 5 degrees C in the last thirty years
   period. Moreover a precipitation decrease is expected, with significant
   reduction in the summer ranging in between 10 and 20\% in the first half
   of the century, until 50\% at the end of it.
   Hot days and coastal floods show the most dramatic rise, but the risks
   of inland flooding will depend on both the season and the Italian
   region.
   Wet-snow events are projected to decrease considerably in the areas
   nowadays affected by these phenomena, whereas they are likely to
   increase significantly over Alps, kept free of wet snow until now.
   Larger uncertainties characterize the Central and Northern Apennines
   where the signal is almost absent and no useful information can be
   inferred for these areas.},

Abstract = {Decadal-scale trends in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures
   derived from satellite measurements over 1979-2014 are compared with
   ensemble simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model
   (WACCM). The model is forced with observed sea surface temperatures,
   changes in greenhouse gases, and ozone-depleting substances, plus solar
   and volcanic effects, and results from five WACCM realizations (with
   slightly different initial conditions) are analyzed. We focus on the
   vertical structure of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling
   increasing with height, the latitudinal and seasonal dependence of
   trends, and on the temporal evolution of stratospheric temperatures in
   response to stratospheric ozone depletion and partial recovery. The
   model captures the observed trend structure in most respects, and the
   ensemble of simulations provides quantitative estimates of the impact of
   internal variability on trend estimates. In regions of low variability
   (e.g., over low latitudes) the ensemble mean trends agree with the
   observations, while in regions of high variability (e.g., the polar
   stratosphere) the observations mostly fall within the range of
   realizations. Temperature response to evolving stratospheric ozone is
   evaluated by computing separate trends over 1979-1997 (ozone depletion)
   and 1998-2014 (partial recovery). Robust changes in temperature trends
   between these periods occur in the global upper stratosphere and in the
   Antarctic spring lower stratosphere, with consistent behavior between
   model and observations. Observed lower stratospheric temperatures in the
   Antarctic show statistically significant warming after 1998, reflecting
   recently reported healing of the ozone hole.
   Plain Language Summary This work compares temperature trends during
   1979-2014 measured by satellites with results from a state-of-the-art
   chemistry-climate model, incorporating observed forcings including
   observed sea surface temperatures and changes in greenhouse gases and
   ozone-depleting substances, plus solar cycle and volcanic effects. We
   analyze an ensemble of five different model simulations (with slightly
   different initial conditions) to evaluate effects of internal climate
   variability on temperature trends. Temperature trends show good
   quantitative agreement between model and observations, including
   troposphere warming and stratosphere cooling increasing with altitude.
   This agreement demonstrates that the satellite-observed temperature
   changes are a result of known forcings, both natural and anthropogenic.
   Stratospheric temperatures reflect the influence of stratospheric ozone
   depletion and partial recovery, with stronger cooling during the first
   half of the record. Satellite measurements identify a warming of the
   Antarctic lower stratosphere since 1998, as a response to the recently
   reported ``healing{''} of the Antarctic ozone hole.},

Title = {Sensitivity of Methane Emissions to Later Soil Freezing in Arctic Tundra
   Ecosystems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration, a potent greenhouse gas, is
   on the rise once again, making it critical to understand the controls on
   CH4 emissions. In Arctic tundra ecosystems, a substantial part of the
   CH4 budget originates from the cold season, particularly during the
   ``zero curtain{''} (ZC), when soil remains unfrozen around 0 degrees C.
   Due to the sparse data available at this time, the controls on cold
   season CH4 emissions are poorly understood. This study investigates the
   relationship between the fall ZC and CH4 emissions using long-term soil
   temperature measurements and CH4 fluxes from four eddy covariance (EC)
   towers in northern Alaska. To identify the large-scale implication of
   the EC results, we investigated the temporal change of terrestrial CH4
   enhancements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   monitoring station in Utqiagvik, AK, from 2001 to 2017 and their
   association with the ZC. We found that the ZC is extending later into
   winter (2.6 0.5 days/year from 2001 to 2017) and that terrestrial fall
   CH4 enhancements are correlated with later soil freezing (0.79 0.18-ppb
   CH4 day(-1) unfrozen soil). ZC conditions were associated with
   consistently higher CH4 fluxes than after soil freezing across all EC
   towers during the measuring period (2013-2017). Unfrozen soil persisted
   after air temperature was well below 0 degrees C suggesting that air
   temperature has poor predictive power on CH4 fluxes relative to soil
   temperature. These results imply that later soil freezing can increase
   CH4 loss and that soil temperature should be used to model CH4 emissions
   during the fall.
   Plain Language Summary Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas,
   capturing more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide (CO2). Although CH4
   is less concentrated in the atmosphere, it is the second most important
   greenhouse gas with respect to climate change after CO2. Arctic tundra
   ecosystems are potentially major sources of CH4, given large soil carbon
   storage and generally wet conditions, favorable to CH4 production. This
   study investigates if the persistence of unfrozen soils is associated
   with higher CH4 emissions from the Arctic. We combined long-term soil
   temperature measurements, terrestrial CH4 enhancements from the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration monitoring station in Utqiagvik,
   AK, and CH4 emissions from Arctic tundra ecosystems across four stations
   in the North Slope of Alaska. Our results show that from 2001 to 2017
   the soil is freezing later and that later soil freezing is associated
   with higher fall CH4 enhancements. Given that unfrozen soils are related
   to higher CH4 emissions, a later soil freezing could contribute to the
   observed increase in the regional atmospheric CH4 enhancement. Unfrozen
   soil layers persisted after the air temperature was well below 0 degrees
   C, suggesting that air temperature does not properly predict the
   sensitivity of CH4 emissions to climate warming.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},

Abstract = {Energy systems require technological changes towards climate neutrality.
   In Poland, where the power system is dominated by outdated coal-fired
   power plants, efforts to minimize the environmental impact are
   associated with high costs. Therefore, optimal paths for the development
   of the energy sector should be sought in order to achieve ambitious
   long-term strategic goals, while minimizing the negative impact on the
   consumers' home budget. A methodology and a model for the development of
   the electricity and heat generation structure were developed and
   implemented in market allocation (MARKAL) modelling framework. Two
   scenarios were presented, i.e., business as usual (BAU) and withdrawal
   from coal (WFC) scenarios. The calculations showed a significant role of
   nuclear energy and offshore wind power in the pursuit of climate
   neutrality of electricity generation. In the BAU scenario, the model
   proposes to stay with coal technologies using carbon capture and storage
   systems. Withdrawal from coal (WFC scenario) makes it necessary to
   replace them by gas-fired power plants with CO2 sequestration. Solar
   energy can be used both in electricity and district heating. In order to
   build on the latter technological option, appropriate energy storage
   techniques must be developed. Geothermal energy is expected to be the
   key option for district heat generation in the long-term horizon. The
   proposed development paths guarantee a significant reduction in
   greenhouse gases and industrial emissions. However, complete climate
   neutrality is uncertain, given the current degree and dynamics of
   technological development.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change in geographically isolated, peripheral
   coastal communities holds particular challenges. In the CoastAdapt
   project a common approach was applied to support climate change
   adaptation in study sites in peripheral regions of Northwest Europe
   (Scotland, Ireland, Norway and Iceland). This involved a series of
   workshops at each site to describe the nature of future climate change,
   identify site-specific climate-change-related issues and explore
   adaptation options. While there are common issues related to the impacts
   of sea level rise, other aspects tend to be site and time-specific. The
   occurrence of recent high impact events (storms or floods), in
   particular, exert a strong influence on community perceptions. The
   studies reveal that availability of resources, knowledge of options (and
   their implications), and the particular governance framework in
   operation are major determinants of the adaptation options selected. (C)

Title = {Integrating livestock production with crops and saline fish ponds to
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-52},
Abstract = {Extensive grazing systems in the tropics have large greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. Here an integrated cropping, livestock farming and saline
   pond aquaculture system is described which also reduces GHG emissions in
   tropical farming. The system was developed in the 1980s in the central
   Philippines and is re-evaluated in terms of its potential to reduce
   emissions from livestock production, particularly in wet and wet-dry
   tropical regions. The estimated cumulative annual GHG emission savings
   amount to 12.9 tonne CO2-e per head of cattle exiting the integrated
   feedlot system after 300 days. Use of silage from crop by-products and
   implementation of a feed-lot programme enabled immediate and significant
   reductions of GHG emissions over extensive cattle grazing. Integration
   with a saline animal waste processing pond allowed production of natural
   feed products, cyanobacteria algal mat for use in aquaculture, as crop
   fertiliser and soil amendment or in the silage manufacture process. Fish
   production from ponds receiving the harvested algal mat resulted in an
   annual average of 3300 kg/ha compared to an average 700 kg/ha in
   inorganic fertilised ponds. The unitised ratios for the integrated
   system were respectively: 1 ha sugarcane: 4 head of cattle: 0.13 ha
   saline waste processing pond. Stoichiometrically, bio-processing of
   waste material in saline ponds provides a novel solution to GHG
   emissions from feedlots. It uses a multi-step process dominated by
   cyanobacteria mats in which all the captured liquid and solid waste is
   passed through fermentation and a mixed aerobic and anaerobic
   photosynthesis/photosynthesis and mixed aerobic/anaerobic sulphate
   reduction pathway to use organic wastes and also reduce GHG emissions.
   Sulphate is reduced and sequestered as iron sulphide eliminating the
   potential for harmful sulphide emissions. Calcium carbonate
   precipitation in the cyanobacteria mats results in significant
   sequestration of carbon. The process produces organic feed matter with a
   three-fold increase in nitrogen levels arising from nitrogen fixation in
   the treatment pond.},

Title = {Understanding Tourism Suppliers' Resilience to Climate Change in a Rural
   Destination in Maine},
Journal = {TOURISM PLANNING \& DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {Supplier characteristics influence destination resilience to climate
   change, but there is limited research applying social resilience
   theories to this group. Using socio-ecological and psychology resilience
   theories, we examined how a group of rural, nature-based tourism
   suppliers enhanced their resilience to climate change. We conducted 17
   interviews in the Bay of Machias, Maine, USA to examine how
   characteristics of tourism suppliers influenced their resilience to
   climate change. Despite facing socio-economic challenges, suppliers were
   taking action to adapt to their most pressing climate change threat,
   flooding, by leveraging their knowledge, skill sets, and social ties.
   This study suggests that leveraging resources, collaboration, and
   developing connections to places through livelihoods may enhance the
   resilience of rural tourism suppliers. We suggest that the framework
   used in this study has broader applicability to understanding how
   suppliers can build destination resilience to climate change; however,
   the destination life cycle phase must be incorporated into resilience
   considerations.},

Abstract = {Understanding social resilience can assist in the formulation of
   disaster management policies to help communities better prepare for,
   respond to, and recover from disasters. However, direct social
   resilience measurement methods such as household surveys are not always
   a practical option as they are a time- and resource-exhaustive process.
   Existing measures mainly utilize publicly available census data, which
   often provide a poor and outdated assessment of current social
   resilience status. Another limitation includes a failure to capture
   multiple facets of indicators that are process-oriented and dynamic in
   nature such as mobility of people. These challenges can be addressed by
   employing a surrogate approach. Surrogates are alternative measures to
   depict the target indicator. The surrogate approach can capture key
   facets of a target indicator, which can be used as potential measures
   for the target indicator. A framework to conceptualize the surrogate
   approach is presented, and operationalized using a case study approach
   on the southeastern coast of Sri Lanka to identify surrogates to measure
   mobility of people as a resilience indicator. Six higher-order themes
   were identified as potential surrogates to measure mobility of people in
   a disaster context. The approach proposed to methodically identify
   potential surrogates and their measurement protocols can help to improve
   the current knowledge base and understanding of complex
   interrelationships of social resilience.},

Abstract = {Climate change-related impacts have the capacity to substantially
   influence Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean.
   Currently, many SIDS are engaged in large-scale vulnerability
   assessments that aim to identify, analyse, and inform solutions to
   mitigate climate change-related impacts. Many of these assessments,
   while useful, place little emphasis on the local stakeholders'
   perceptions of climate change. One such Caribbean community impacted by
   climate-related change is Providence Island in Colombia. Using a
   vulnerability assessment framework (Marshall, P.A. et al. 2010. A
   framework for social adaptation to climate change: sustaining tropical
   coastal communities and industries. Gland: IUCN Publication Services),
   researchers interviewed island residents (N = 23) about their
   perceptions of climate change, impacts on the local environment, and how
   the island community may adapt. All interviews were transcribed and
   analysed using a priori and open coding to identify patterns of and
   relationships between stakeholders' responses. Results indicate that
   local perceptions of climate change are linked to (1) environmental
   knowledge, (2) environmental awareness, attitudes, and beliefs, and (3)
   perceptions of risk. Implications for local adaptive strategies,
   education, communication, and suggestions for engagement at the local
   level are discussed.},

Title = {Sustainability challenges of adaptation interventions: do the challenges
   vary with implementing organizations?},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adaptation to climate change is a necessary response to reduce risk and
   vulnerability and to realize opportunities. However, not all adaptation
   measures bring about positive changes. In some cases, local-level
   adaptations may shift risks to other vulnerable places and communities.
   Both maladaptation, generally recognized to be undesirable at least in
   terms of the results it generates, and sustainable adaptation has been
   studied in diverse settings and for a range of climate-related risks.
   Sustainable adaptation aims at reducing poverty and enhancing social
   equity and environmental integrity in concert with risk reduction.
   However, there is limited research on how interventions by state and
   non-state implementing entities differ in addressing issues related to
   sustainable adaptation and the threat of maladaptation. In this paper,
   we use case study analysis to focus on three specific adaptation
   interventions-homestead plinth level raise, pond sand filter for safe
   drinking water, and surface and groundwater irrigation-in Bangladesh.
   Drawing on in-depth interviews with stakeholders facing recurring
   drought and coastal hazards, we emphasis on the implemented
   interventions and the roles played by a local NGO and central
   government. The first two interventions were implemented by a local NGO
   and the irrigation system by the government. Although the selected
   interventions led to many benefits, including reduced community
   vulnerability, enhanced resilience, and adaptive capacity, the
   stakeholders also identified sustainability challenges. NGO-implemented
   interventions, for example, suffer from beneficiary selection bias,
   while state-implemented intervention does not conform, at least partly,
   to environmental integrity. To limit maladaptation, it is necessarily
   better to understand beneficiary attitude(s) towards an intervention.
   Findings can help inform future interventions by raising awareness of
   agencies' roles and responsibilities in implementation and recognizing
   the stakeholders' adaptation needs and priorities.},

   Peatland Streams},

Abstract = {Radiocarbon (C-14) is a key tracer for detecting the mobilization of
   previously stored terrestrial organic carbon (C) into aquatic systems.
   Old C (>1,000years BP) may be masked by postbomb C (fixed from the
   atmosphere post-1950 CE), potentially rendering bulk aquatic dissolved
   organic C (DOC) C-14 measurements insensitive to old C. We collected DOC
   with a modern C-14 signature from a temperate Scottish peatland stream
   and decomposed it to produce CO2 under simulated natural conditions over
   140days. We measured the C-14 of both DOC and CO2 at seven time points
   and found that while DOC remained close to modern in age, the resultant
   CO2 progressively increased in age up to 2,356767years BP. The results
   of this experiment demonstrate that the bulk (DOC)-C-14 pool can hide
   the presence of old C within peatland stream DOC export, demonstrating
   that bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements can be an insensitive indicator of
   peatland disturbance. Our experiment also demonstrates that this old C
   component is biologically and photochemically available for conversion
   to the greenhouse gas CO2, and as such, bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements do
   not reflect the C-14 signature of the labile organic C pool exported by
   inland water systems more broadly. Moreover, our experiment suggests
   that old C may be an important component of CO2 emissions to the
   atmosphere from peatland aquatic systems, with implications for tracing
   and modeling interactions between the hydrological and terrestrial C
   cycles.
   Plain Language Summary The introduction of old carbon previously stored
   in soils for thousands of years into rivers can increase the net flux of
   greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, impacting global climate. This is
   because rivers transport the equivalent of one third of human carbon
   emissions annually from land to the oceans. Much river-borne carbon is
   plant and soil (organic) matter that can decompose during transport,
   releasing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon dating can
   reveal the age of river-borne carbon, but previous measurements may have
   underestimated the age of carbon released into rivers by not considering
   the potential for old carbon hidden within individual bulk water
   samples. Using an incubation experiment, we demonstrate that dissolved
   organic carbon from a Scottish peatland stream that would be considered
   modern in age using traditional bulk radiocarbon dating can readily
   decompose to produce carbon dioxide with an old radiocarbon signature up
   to similar to 2,500years old. This demonstrates that radiocarbon dating
   of bulk riverine dissolved organic carbon can hide the presence of old
   carbon. Furthermore, these results indicate that old carbon may be more
   common in the global carbon cycle than previously thought, with
   important implications for our understanding and modeling of peatland
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Towards a social-ecological resilience framework for coastal planning},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {925-933},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is increasingly recognised that designing and implementing adaptive
   land management and development policies for the coastal zone requires
   an interdisciplinary and integrated approach. Yet, integrative thinking
   and action often remain problematic due to the competing interests and
   ambitions involved in coastal zone planning and management and the
   legacy of established development on the coast. This paper presents a
   developmental timeline to critically consider institutional responses to
   coastal development and seeks to locate contemporary challenges, such as
   climate change, in the context of a new environmental determinism. The
   argument is put forward that securing a shared understanding of
   development conditions and risks needs to be predicated on creating more
   robust conditions for interaction and fostering a sounder appreciation
   of the inter-dependencies of natural processes and governance. The
   concept of resilience is critically explored in order to consider a
   normative analytical framework for facilitating social learning and
   developing a reciprocal understanding of social-ecological dynamics that
   offers a spectrum of resilience options. This is illustrated in the
   context of coastal geomorphological processes and Process-Defined
   Management Units. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Tropical reforestation (TR) has been highlighted as an important
   intervention for climate change mitigation because of its carbon storage
   potential. TR can also play other frequently overlooked, but
   significant, roles in helping society and ecosystems adapt to climate
   variability and change. For example, reforestation can ameliorate
   climate-associated impacts of altered hydrological cycles in watersheds,
   protect coastal areas from increased storms, and provide habitat to
   reduce the probability of species' extinctions under a changing climate.
   Consequently, reforestation should be managed with both adaptation and
   mitigation objectives in mind, so as to maximize synergies among these
   diverse roles, and to avoid trade-offs in which the achievement of one
   goal is detrimental to another. Management of increased forest cover
   must also incorporate measures for reducing the direct and indirect
   impacts of changing climate on reforestation itself. Here we advocate a
   focus on climate-smart reforestation, defined as reforesting for climate
   change mitigation and adaptation, while ensuring that the direct and
   indirect impacts of climate change on reforestation are anticipated and
   minimized.},

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {11},
Pages = {806+},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Future changes in the North American monsoon, a circulation system that
   brings abundant summer rains to vast areas of the North American
   Southwest(1,2,cou)ld have significant consequences for regional water
   resources(3). How this monsoon will change with increasing greenhouse
   gases, however, remains unclear(4-6,) not least because coarse
   horizontal resolution and systematic sea-surface temperature biases
   limit the reliability of its numerical model simulations(5,7). Here we
   investigate the monsoon response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide
   (CO2) concentrations using a 50-km-resolution global climate model which
   features a realistic representation of the monsoon climatology and its
   synoptic-scale variability8. It is found that the monsoon response to
   CO2 doubling is sensitive to sea-surface temperature biases. When
   minimizing these biases, the model projects a robust reduction in
   monsoonal precipitation over the southwestern United States, contrasting
   with previous multi-model assessments(4,9). Most of this precipitation
   decline can be attributed to increased atmospheric stability, and hence
   weakened convection, caused by uniform sea-surface warming. These
   results suggest improved adaptation measures, particularly water
   resource planning, will be required to cope with projected reductions in
   monsoon rainfall in the American Southwest.},

Abstract = {Adequate methods to evaluate the extension of global and local damage on
   coral reefs, and to minimize it, are urgent. The Tropical Southwestern
   Atlantic reefs are partially protected by Marine Protected Areas (MPA)
   that apply spatial zoning as a management strategy. A resilience-based
   management approach was used to evaluate the effectiveness of no-take
   areas in improving reef resilience, inside the largest coastal MPA of
   Brazil. Ecological indicators were used to calculate resilience scores,
   to test the hypothesis that no-take reefs present higher resilience than
   tourism reefs. Score values indicated medium-high resilience for both.
   Despite the similar values, the contribution of the indicators to the
   score varied between reefs. Herbivorous fish biomass was the main
   indicator influencing higher scores. Management through spatial zoning
   and the compliance of this regulation raised the resilience of coral
   reefs. The main management actions recommended are the creation of
   no-take areas in coastal habitats such as mangroves and seagrass beds.},

Title = {Multidecadal climate variability in observed and modeled surface
   temperatures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1104-1121},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study identifies interdecadal natural climate variability in global
   surface temperatures by subtracting, from the observed temperature
   evolution, multimodel ensemble mean based on the World Climate Research
   Programme's (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3)
   multimodel dataset. The resulting signal resembles the so-called
   Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and is presumably associated
   with intrinsic dynamics of the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC).
   While certain phases of the oscillation are dominated by the anomalies
   in the North Atlantic region, other phases are characterized by global
   teleconnections to the North Pacific Ocean, tropical Atlantic Ocean, as
   well as the Southern Ocean. In particular, natural variability of sea
   surface temperature in the Atlantic hurricanes' main development region
   has a peak-to-peak amplitude comparable in magnitude to this region's
   surface temperature increase over the past century, for all seasons.
   Evidence suggests that the AMO influence on secular trends in the
   global-mean surface temperature can arise via direct, regional

Abstract = {Community resilience refers to the degree to which a community can
   survive and recover following a disaster. While resilience itself is
   well understood, decisions that would enhance resilience are
   interdependent and involve various stakeholders. There are indices for
   evaluating community resilience, but these have the shortcoming that
   they compare between political entities, such as counties. Therefore,
   one cannot ascertain that a county is truly resilient. In addition,
   natural disasters depend on the landscape and thus have no relation to
   the political boundaries. Our metric aims to capture the information
   into a Community Intrinsic Resilience Index (CIRI), which embodies the
   resilience level of four critical sectors: transportation, energy,
   health and socio-economic. As a case study, we computed CIRI for the
   counties within New Jersey. Results showed that within NJ, CIRI ranged
   from 63 to 80\%. A post-disaster CIRI, following a scenario of flooding,
   revealed that two coastal counties would have low CIRI values due to the
   reduction in the road area and/or the GDP (local economy shut down) to
   below minimum values. We believe that our platform would further advance
   the efforts to fill the gap between resilience research and applications
   and would help decision and policy makers to integrate resilience within
   the planning and design phases of disaster management.},

Abstract = {Terrestrial vegetation sinks have entered the Kyoto Protocol as offsets
   for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, but ocean sinks have escaped
   attention. Ocean sinks are as unexplored and uncertain as were the
   terrestrial sinks at the time of negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol. It
   is not unlikely that certain countries will advocate the inclusion of
   ocean carbon sinks to reduce their emission reduction obligations in
   post-2012 negotiations. We use a simple model of the international
   market for carbon dioxide emissions to evaluate who would gain or loose
   from allowing for ocean carbon sinks. Our analysis is restricted to
   information on anthropogenic carbon sequestration within the exclusive
   economic zone of a country. We use information on the actual carbon flux
   and derive the human-induced uptake for the period from 1990 onwards.
   Like the carbon sequestration of business as usual forest management
   activities, natural ocean carbon sequestration applies at zero costs.
   The total amount of anthropogenic ocean carbon sequestration is large,
   also in the exclusive economic zones. As a consequence, it substantially
   alters the costs of emission reduction for most countries. Countries
   such as Australia, Denmark, France, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway and
   Portugal would gain substantially, and a large number of countries would
   benefit too. Current net exporters of carbon permits, particularly
   Russia, would gain less and oppose the inclusion of ocean carbon sinks.

Title = {Conceptual design of sustainable integrated microalgae biorefineries:
   Parametric analysis of energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and

Journal = {ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {113-131},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study covers four main aspects of the conceptual design of
   sustainable integrated microalgae-based biorefineries using flue gas
   from CO2-intensive industries (i.e. 100\% CO2): i) screening of
   technologies (4 options for cultivation, 3 for culture dewatering, 3 for
   cell disruption, 4 for lipids extraction \& purification, and 4 for
   fractions upgrading); ii) analysis of processing variables (parametric
   study of the main cultivation conditions affecting the global
   performance of the biorefinery systems); iii) combination of final
   products (10 biorefinery configurations are generated from the
   combination of 9 final products); and iv) assessment of sustainability
   criteria (i.e., non-renewable energy use (NREU), greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and economics). The used approach compares processing options
   and operation conditions to identify those combinations of production
   processes that minimize NREU and GHG emissions. In a second step, 10
   integrated biorefinery concepts are selected and compared with respect
   to their environmental and economic performances. The impacts of
   choosing different microalgae species, locations, and nutrient sources
   were also studied as part of the scenario analysis. The results showed
   that the biorefinery systems with the best economic and environmental
   performances are those where microalgae oil-free cake is used as
   nutrient for substitution of animal feed and where lipids are used for
   substitution of vegetable oils. The worst economic and environmental
   performances of biorefineries were obtained when microalgae oil-free
   cake is anaerobically digested to biogas and lipids are converted to
   either biodiesel or green diesel. Regarding the cultivation technologies
   for the biorefinery systems with the best performance, favorable
   environmental results were obtained for flat panel photobioreactors
   (FPPBRs), followed by open ponds (OPs), vertical photobioreactors
   (VPBRs) and horizontal photobioreactors (HPBRs). In contrast, the best
   economic results were found for FPPBRs followed by VPBRs, HPBRs and OPs.

Title = {The role of the reef-dune system in coastal protection in Puerto Morelos
   (Mexico)},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1247-1260},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Reefs and sand dunes are critical morphological features providing
   natural coastal protection. Reefs dissipate around 90\% of the incident
   wave energy through wave breaking, whereas sand dunes provide the final
   natural barrier against coastal flooding. The storm impact on coastal
   areas with these features depends on the relative elevation of the
   extreme water levels with respect to the sand dune morphology. However,
   despite the importance of barrier reefs and dunes in coastal protection,
   poor management practices have degraded these ecosystems, increasing
   their vulnerability to coastal flooding. The present study aims to
   theoretically investigate the role of the reef-dune system in coastal
   protection under current climatic conditions at Puerto Morelos, located
   in the Mexican Caribbean Sea, using a widely validated nonlinear
   non-hydrostatic numerical model (SWASH). Wave hindcast information,
   tidal level, and a measured beach profile of the reef-dune system in
   Puerto Morelos are employed to estimate extreme runup and the storm
   impact scale for current and theoretical scenarios. The numerical
   results show the importance of including the storm surge when predicting
   extreme water levels and also show that ecosystem degradation has
   important implications for coastal protection against storms with return
   periods of less than 10 years. The latter highlights the importance of
   conservation of the system as a mitigation measure to decrease coastal
   vulnerability and infrastructure losses in coastal areas in the short to
   medium term. Furthermore, the results are used to evaluate the
   applicability of runup parameterisations for beaches to reef
   environments. Numerical analysis of runup dynamics suggests that runup
   parameterisations for reef environments can be improved by including the
   fore reef slope. Therefore, future research to develop runup
   parameterisations incorporating reef geometry features (e.g. reef crest
   elevation, reef lagoon width, fore reef slope) is warranted.},

Title = {Evaluation of aqua MODIS thermal emissive bands stability through
   radiative transfer modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua has been
   in operation providing continuous global observations for science
   research and applications since 2002. The long-term stability of thermal
   emissive bands (TEBs) of Aqua MODIS was monitored through
   inter-comparisons with measurements by hyperspectral or multi-spectral
   infrared sensors or through vicarious monitoring over cold targets such
   as Dome-C and deep convective clouds. The radiative transfer modeling
   (RTM)-based simulation models are developed to perform the long-term
   monitoring of the stability of Aqua MODIS TEBs. Long-term European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global atmospheric reanalysis
   data are used as inputs to the RTM simulation. By confining ocean in low
   to middle latitudes as the area of interest, the long-term stabilities
   of Aqua MODIS TEBs are monitored through observation minus background
   (O-B) brightness temperature (BT) bias between MODIS measurements and
   simulations from the RTM. In general, the RTM-based O-B analysis shows
   that the long-term stability of Aqua MODIS TEBs are maintained well. It
   is shown that Aqua MODIS surface bands are all radiometrically stable
   with yearly BT bias drifts <0.005 K/year for B20, B22, and B23 and
   similar to 0.01 K/year for B31 and B32. The carbon dioxide (CO2)
   absorption channels of Aqua MODIS, e.g., B33 to B36, are stable with a
   BT bias drift < 0.005 K/year. It is also found that after accounting for
   the long-term growth of greenhouse gas N2O, the O-B bias trends for B24
   and B25 are quite stable with yearly BT bias drifts around 0.0002 and
   0.0055 K/year, respectively. The stabilities of the moisture-sensitive
   channels B27 to B29 and the ozone channel B30 of Aqua MODIS are also
   evaluated and the remnant small variations in the O-B bias trending of
   these channels are further discussed. The RTM-based inter-comparison of
   MODIS TEB measurements with global atmospheric and climate re-analysis
   data provides validation of the long-term radiometric stability of Aqua
   MODIS TEBs. The analysis in this paper also demonstrates that the
   comparison of well-calibrated MODIS TEB measurements with RTM simulation
   helps quantify the long-term impacts of global greenhouse gas
   concentration growth on the BT decreases in the MODIS greenhouse
   gas-sensitive channels. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical

Title = {Deep-ocean, sediment-dwelling animals are sensitive to sequestered
   carbon dioxide},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {289},
Pages = {1-4},
Abstract = {The burning of fossil fuel is producing the greenhouse gas CO2 at a rate
   that is causing global warming and threatens to change the global
   environment adversely. One proposed solution involves sequestering in
   the deep sea a substantial portion of the excess CO2 produced. Because
   large areas would be affected and this environment harbors one of the
   world's largest reservoirs of biodiversity, the approach is
   controversial. In particular, deep-sea diversity is found largely in the
   animals that live in the sediment, but the effects of sequestered CO2 on
   these organisms are not known. We therefore introduced similar to 60 1
   of liquid CO2 onto the seafloor at 3250 m depth and sampled similar to 2
   and similar to 40 m from the deposition site 30 d later. The pore water
   in the samples taken near the site was 0.75 pH unit more acidic (pH
   decreases when CO2 concentration increases) than that in samples taken
   farther away, Representative infauna had been killed in significantly
   greater numbers in the former than in the latter location. This
   demonstration that sequestered CO2 can adversely affect the deep-sea
   infauna brings CO2 sequestration in the deep sea into potential conflict
   with the preservation of deep-sea biodiversity.},

   the coast of India},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {79-91},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {India is rapidly growing in the economy and population leading to a
   continuous increase in electricity demand. The wind is a better energy
   source because of its negligible greenhouse gas emissions, cost
   competitiveness, price stability, and energy security. This paper
   presents Geospatial Information System (GIS) based methodology to
   characterise the offshore wind power potential in the western and the
   eastern coast of India with technical, economical, and marine ecosystem
   consideration. Spatial distribution of levelized production cost (LPC)
   and cost-supply curves was developed under different ocean conditions
   (human impact on marine ecosystem). The influence of project lifetime,
   discount rate, and assumptions about investment cost, annual energy
   production, and availability is presented using sensitivity analysis.
   Results show that total potential available along the shallow waters (50
   m water depth) of Indian coast is approximately equal to 12.8\% and 42\%
   respectively of the existing renewable power and wind power capacity. In
   terms of wind resources and economic costs, the shallow waters of
   Gujarat and Tamil Nadu states are the best suitable regions for offshore
   wind power development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Renewable energies can benefit the water sector, reducing the cost and
   the environmental impact of water production. This paper presents a
   technical and economic assessment of a photovoltaic generation project
   to supply energy to a grid-connected seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO)
   desalination plant and of an associated battery energy storage system
   (BESS) using lithium-ion batteries. It examines the case study of the
   SWRO desalination plant on Porto Santo Island (Madeira, Portugal). The
   assessment is supplemented by a sensitivity analysis of several
   variables. The findings indicate that photovoltaic generation in
   desalination plants results in a lower levelized cost of energy (LCoE)
   and reduces the consumption of fossil fuel energy from the electrical
   grid. This can lead to lower desalinated water costs and greenhouse gas
   emissions. A feasible rated power range was identified for the
   photovoltaic plant in this case study, taking the internal rate of
   return, net present value, payback and LCoE into consideration. The
   results also point to a higher LCoE when a lithium-ion BESS is used.},

Title = {Linking the social to the ecological using GIS methods in marine spatial
   planning and management to support resilience: A review},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {108},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) has been put forward as a way to more
   comprehensively manage marine environments by balancing human demands
   and protecting areas that support ecosystem function. Given the recent
   motivations for countries to adopt large-scale marine spatial planning
   approaches, ensuring these plans are grounded in social-ecological
   resilience theories is essential for long-term success. Drawing upon
   recent academic attention from a range of disciplinary areas, this
   review explores current practices and applied examples of published case
   studies from around the world that have integrated social and ecological
   spatial information using GIS techniques. This review intended to use
   these case studies to guide directions of future MSP research that
   considers social-ecological resilience theories. Five overall themes
   were uncovered. First, extractive uses, such as fisheries, were often
   given priority in MSP processes, which even though important, may
   undermine the social resilience of coastal communities by not supporting
   the diversity of non-extractive economies. Second, the quality of
   ecological spatial data used in the studies varied greatly, often with
   little consideration of how ongoing human demands may influence
   long-term ecological resilience. Thrid, many GIS techniques were used to
   integrate social and ecological data including: descriptive maps, site
   prioritisation techniques, and predictive modelling. Lastly, only a
   small number of studies considered cross-ecosystem influences and only
   two incorporated potential climate change impacts on social institutions
   and marine ecosystems. Overall, there is a need for progressing GIS
   predictive modelling techniques to assess and link the responses of
   social and ecological systems to MSP solutions in order to support
   long-term social-ecological resilience.},

   Adaptation in Hong Kong},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Some experts believe that Hong Kong will probably be subjected to more
   extreme weather conditions due to climate change. To better understand
   the potential implications of the effects of climate change on coastal
   structures in Hong Kong and to ascertain necessary revisions to the
   current design standards to minimize the risk of coastal flooding, the
   Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) of the Hong Kong
   Special Administrative Region Government conducted a study to review the
   climate change situation in Hong Kong and its implications to coastal
   structures design. Projection method has been developed to project the
   two major climate change factors pertinent to design of coastal
   structures, i.e. the mean sea levels (MSLs) and extreme wind speeds, to
   different time windows of the 21st century based on IPCC AR5 scenarios.
   CEDD seriously considered investing in the future coastal structures by
   designing the new structures with climate change revisions as one of the
   adaptation measures against the climate change impact and undertook
   benefit-cost assessment to evaluate whether the adaptation measure is
   effective in coastal structures design. Three types of common coastal
   structures to cope with climate impact, i.e. sloping rock armor seawall,
   vertical block work seawall and piled-deck pier, were investigated. The
   cost-benefit analysis results demonstrated that the benefits of
   increased protection on new coastal structures to cope with climate
   change effects outweigh the additional costs incurred to construct and
   maintain these structures.},

   The proposed optimization method is exploiting an interactive approach
   based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and a fuzzy mechanism
   to improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed
   fuzzy-based particle swarm optimization (FPSO) algorithm aims at
   minimizing the operation cost, limiting the greenhouse gas (GHG)

Title = {Carbon sequestration in wetland soils of the northern Gulf of Mexico
   coastal region},
Journal = {WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {289-303},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands play an important but complex role in the global carbon
   cycle, contributing to the ecosystem service of greenhouse gas
   regulation through carbon sequestration. Although coastal wetlands
   occupy a small percent of the total US land area, their potential for
   carbon storage, especially in soils, often exceeds that of other
   terrestrial ecosystems. More than half of the coastal wetlands in the US
   are located in the northern Gulf of Mexico, yet these wetlands continue
   to be degraded at an alarming rate, resulting in a significant loss of
   stored carbon and reduction in capacity for carbon sequestration. We
   provide estimates of surface soil carbon densities for wetlands in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region, calculated from field
   measurements of bulk density and soil carbon content in the upper 10-15
   cm of soil. We combined these estimates with soil accretion rates
   derived from the literature and wetland area estimates to calculate
   surface soil carbon pools and accumulation rates. Wetlands in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region potentially store 34-47 Mg C
   ha(-1) and could potentially accumulate 11,517 Gg C year(-1). These
   estimates provide important information that can be used to incorporate
   the value of wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region in
   future wetland management decisions related to global climate change.
   Estimates of carbon sequestration potential should be considered along
   with estimates of other ecosystem services provided by wetlands in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region to strengthen and enhance the
   conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of these important
   natural resources.},

Title = {Use of community perceptions to evaluate and adapt coastal resource
   management practices in the Philippines},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {163},
Pages = {304-322},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Coastal resource management (CRM) programs have been implemented in the
   Philippines since the 1980s with the specific intent to protect and
   rehabilitate coastal habitats and enhance the sustainability of coastal
   communities. However, the implementation of these programs alone does
   not guarantee the success of program objectives. Monitoring and
   evaluation of program outcomes is essential for determining if programs
   are effective in reaching management goals. The purpose of this research
   was to evaluate long-term CRM programs using community perceptions of
   coastal resource condition, management practices, and program outcomes.
   Coastal residents in Baybay City, Leyte were surveyed and asked to rank
   a series of questions related to resource condition and 20 previously
   described management performance indicators. Respondents reported a
   decline in coastal resource condition over the past decade, even though
   they perceive positive outcomes of management programs aimed at
   enhancing resource condition. The sustainability and efficiency of
   management outcomes were perceived positively, with mixed views on
   equity outcomes. Results suggest that lack of full inclusion, low
   management oversight, and threat to coastal resources are concerns of
   the coastal community. Socioeconomic data collected from respondents,
   yielded a pattern indicating that gender, self-reported level of
   environmental knowledge, and management cluster were significant
   contextual variables associated with perceptions of respondents.
   Overall, CRM programs are perceived to have a positive impact and there
   is a high level of interest for participating in future management

Title = {Climate change under aggressive mitigation: the ENSEMBLES multi-model
   experiment},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},

Pages = {1975-2003},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We present results from multiple comprehensive models used to simulate
   an aggressive mitigation scenario based on detailed results of an
   Integrated Assessment Model. The experiment employs ten global climate
   and Earth System models (GCMs and ESMs) and pioneers elements of the
   long-term experimental design for the forthcoming 5th Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change assessment. Atmospheric carbon-dioxide
   concentrations pathways rather than carbon emissions are specified in
   all models, including five ESMs that contain interactive carbon cycles.
   Specified forcings also include minor greenhouse gas concentration
   pathways, ozone concentration, aerosols (via concentrations or precursor
   emissions) and land use change (in five models). The new aggressive
   mitigation scenario (E1), constructed using an integrated assessment
   model (IMAGE 2.4) with reduced fossil fuel use for energy production
   aimed at stabilizing global warming below 2 K, is studied alongside the
   medium-high non-mitigation scenario SRES A1B. Resulting twenty-first
   century global mean warming and precipitation changes for A1B are
   broadly consistent with previous studies. In E1 twenty-first century
   global warming remains below 2 K in most models, but global mean
   precipitation changes are higher than in A1B up to 2065 and consistently
   higher per degree of warming. The spread in global temperature and
   precipitation responses is partly attributable to inter-model variations
   in aerosol loading and representations of aerosol-related radiative
   forcing effects. Our study illustrates that the benefits of mitigation
   will not be realised in temperature terms until several decades after
   emissions reductions begin, and may vary considerably between regions. A
   subset of the models containing integrated carbon cycles agree that land
   and ocean sinks remove roughly half of present day anthropogenic carbon
   emissions from the atmosphere, and that anthropogenic carbon emissions
   must decrease by at least 50\% by 2050 relative to 1990, with further
   large reductions needed beyond that to achieve the E1 concentrations
   pathway. Negative allowable anthropogenic carbon emissions at and beyond
   2100 cannot be ruled out for the E1 scenario. There is self-consistency
   between the multi-model ensemble of allowable anthropogenic carbon
   emissions and the E1 scenario emissions from IMAGE 2.4.},

Abstract = {Faced with the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
   transitioning toward a greater use of renewable energies, ammonia, as an
   energy carrier, is increasingly seen as a potential ``green{''} fuel for
   transportation, in particular marine applications. However, its
   combustion characteristics (high minimum ignition energy and
   auto-ignition temperature, low combustion speed in comparison to usual
   hydrocarbon fuels) are drawbacks that have so far limited its use. Due
   to the evolution of different pollutant standards for road
   transportation, spark-ignition engines and thus the combustion process
   itself have been subjected to many changes over the last 20 years (e.g.,
   gasoline direct injection, downsizing). The objective of this article is
   to discuss the potential of ammonia as a fuel for spark-ignition
   engines, thanks to the studies carried out so far and to point out
   directions for future work.},

Title = {Discriminated perceptions of climatic impacts on coastal farm management
   practices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Agriculture is responsive to weather and climate variability. In
   addition to the climatic stressors, coastal agriculture is influenced by
   non-climatic factors. Therefore, understanding farmers' perception of
   the causes of their changes in farm management plays a key role in
   motivating them to adopt agricultural adaptations. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the changes in coastal farm management in Bangladesh
   over the last decade compared to the previous one. We explored whether
   the causes of those changes were climatic or non-climatic as perceived
   by the farmers and the factors that shaped their perceptions. We
   interviewed 381 farmers sampled from ten subdistricts along the coast of
   Bangladesh. Descriptive statistics showed that the farmers had changed
   on average 10 to 11 farm management practices. Though the average value
   was 67\%, a higher number of farmers in the western coastal zone
   mentioned that climate change had impacts on their farm management.
   Adoption of rice crop-related adaptations was greater than livestock,
   fisheries or general agricultural practices. According to the
   discriminant function analysis, discriminative variables were perception
   of climatic impacts on farm productivity, climate change awareness,
   involvement with non-farm jobs, age, education, organizational
   affiliation, number of changed farm practices, and meteorologically
   consistent perception of rainfall and temperature. Lessons learned from
   this research are that the farmers should better understand the link
   between climate change and farm management practices while motivating
   them to implement adaptation strategies. This could be achieved by
   improving farmers' climate change awareness, perceptions of changes in
   climatic parameters and involvement with farm-related associations.},

Title = {Effects of Flood Control Strategies on Flood Resilience Under
   Sociohydrological Disturbances},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2661-2680},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A community capacity to cope with flood hazards, or community flood
   resilience, emerges from the interplay of hydrological and social
   processes. This interplay can be significantly influenced by the flood
   control strategy adopted by a society, i.e., how a society sets its
   desired flood protection level and strives to achieve this goal. And
   this interplay can be further complicated by rising land-sea level
   differences, seasonal water level fluctuations, and economic change. But
   not much research has been done on how various forms of flood control
   strategies affect human-flood interactions under these disturbances and
   therefore flood resilience in the long run. The current study is an
   effort to address these issues by developing a conceptual model of
   human-flood interaction mediated by flood control strategies. Our model
   extends the existing model of Yu et al. (2017), who investigated the
   flood resilience of a community-based flood protection system in coastal
   Bangladesh. The major extensions made in this study are inclusions of
   various forms of flood control strategies (both adaptive and nonadaptive
   ones), the challenge of rising land-sea level differences, and various
   high tide level scenarios generated from modifying the statistical
   variances and averages. Our results show that adaptive forms of flood
   control strategies tend to outperform nonadaptive ones for maintaining
   the model community's flood protection system. Adaptive strategies that
   dynamically adjust target flood protection levels through close
   monitoring of flood damages and social memories of flood risk can help
   the model community deal with various disturbances.},

Month = {NOV 15},
Note = {4th International Conference on Low Carbon Asia and Beyond (ICLCA),

Abstract = {Treatment of reverse osmosis desalination (ROD) brine has recently been
   suggested as a means to achieve negative greenhouse gas emissions via
   indirect ocean capture (IOC) of carbon dioxide. In this paper, a novel
   scheme that integrates the ROD/IOC process with combined cooling,
   heating, and power (CCHP) generation is proposed as a new negative
   emissions polygeneration system (NEPS). A mixed integer linear
   programming (MILP) model is then developed for the optimal synthesis and
   operation of such a system. The model uses a multi-period formulation to
   account for hourly variations in product demand and electricity price.
   The polygeneration system takes advantage of the flexible operation of
   the ROD/IOC process to operate as a Power-to-X (PtX) system, without the
   need for direct electricity storage in batteries. An illustrative case
   study is solved to demonstrate the model, and sensitivity analysis is
   performed to assess the effects of techno-economic uncertainties on
   system performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Considerable variability in methane production and emissions has been
   reported in mangroves, explained by methane inhibition and oxidation. In
   this study, soil pore waters were collected from mangrove forests
   located in the Gulf of California (Mexico) exposed to shrimp farm
   disturbance. The delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4
   were analyzed along with the delta C-13 of the soil organic matter to
   assess the proportion of CO2 derived from methanogenesis, its main
   pathway, and the fraction of methane oxidized. We performed slurry
   incubation experiments to fit the isotope-mass balance approach. Very
   low stoichiometric ratios of CH4/CO2 were measured in pore waters, but
   isotope mass balances revealed that 30-70\% of the total CO2 measured
   was produced by methanogenesis. Mangrove soils receiving effluent
   discharges shifted the main methanogenesis pathway to CO2 reduction
   because of an increase in refractory organic matter. Isotope-mass
   balances of incubations indicated that methane was mainly oxidized by
   anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulfate reduction, and
   the increase in recalcitrant organic matter should fuel AOM as humus
   serves as a terminal electron acceptor. Since methanogenesis in mangrove
   soils is strongly controlled by the oxygen supply provided by mangrove
   roots, conservation of the forest plays a crucial role in mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities to marine climate
   change requires that communities have some intrinsic capacity to adapt.
   To assist adaptation planning and the implementation of adaptation
   strategies, identifying barriers and enablers to adaptation is
   important. Adaptive capacity, resource dependence, local climate change
   exposure and biological sensitivity were used to assess socioeconomic
   vulnerability to climate change in three Australian coastal communities:
   St Helens, Tasmania; Bowen, Queensland; and Geraldton, Western
   Australia. Higher adaptive capacity was associated with larger
   population size (i.e., Geraldton) whereas greater resource dependence,
   and lower human and natural capital were associated with smaller
   populations (St Helens and Bowen). Socioeconomic vulnerability was
   greatly influenced by climate exposure and sensitivity with the
   moderately sized Bowen having the highest socioeconomic vulnerability to
   climate change. Adaptation strategies that utilized available assets,
   improved adaptive capacity, or reduced socioeconomic vulnerability were
   identified in partnership with local communities, including increased
   and diversified employment opportunities, the re-establishment of local
   fish markets, and improved education and communication. The level of
   resources, or ``capitals,{''} available to communities can indicate
   where barriers and enablers to adaptation exist. Identified barriers to
   adaptation included a heavy reliance on one sector for employment and a
   lack of physical capital. We demonstrate that knowledge of intrinsic
   community characteristics can be beneficial for prioritizing adaptation
   actions to reduce socioeconomic vulnerability to marine climate change.},

Title = {A climate-change scenario for the Columbia River basin},
Journal = {USDA FOREST SERVICE PACIFIC NORTHWEST RESEARCH STATION RESEARCH PAPER},
Year = {1997},
Number = {499},
Pages = {CP1-\&},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This work describes the method used to generate a climate-change
   scenario for the Columbia River basin. The scenario considers climate
   patterns that may change if the atmospheric concentration of carbon
   dioxide (CO2), or its greenhouse gas equivalent, were to double over
   pre-Industrial Revolution values. Given the current rate of increase in
   atmospheric CO2 concentration, doubling could occur within the next 50
   to 100 years.
   The Columbia River basin is in a transition climate zone between
   predominating maritime to the west, arctic to the north, and continental
   to the east. Consequently, it is difficult to characterize through means
   and averages. Therefore, many of the current stochastic methods for
   developing climate-change scenarios cannot directly apply to the basin.
   To circumvent this problem, a composite approach was taken to generate a
   climate scenario that considers knowledge of current regional climate
   controls, available output from general circulation and regional climate
   models, and observed changes in climate.
   The resulting climate-change scenario suggests that precipitation could
   increase substantially during winter (+20 to +50 percent) and moderately
   during spring and autumn (+5 to +35 percent). A slight decrease (0 to -5
   percent) in summer precipitation is possible, except for the
   southeastern portions of the basin that may experience an increase in
   convective precipitation (+5 percent).
   Low-elevation (<1 kilometer) temperatures throughout the year may
   increase 1 to 3 degrees C, with greatest increases during winter. This
   amount of temperature change is possible because of an expected loss of
   low-elevation snow cover. At high elevations, increased cloud cover
   could cause average temperatures to decrease during winter but be
   synchronized with possible warming at low elevations during summer. The
   diurnal range of temperature could decrease, especially in summer and
   autumn.},

Title = {Strengthening threatened communities through adaptation: insights from
   coastal Mozambique},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Change is a defining characteristic of coastal social-ecological
   systems, yet the magnitude and speed of contemporary change is
   challenging the adaptive capacity of even the most robust coastal
   communities. In the context of multiple drivers of change, it has become
   increasingly important to identify how threatened communities adapt to
   livelihood stressors. We investigate how adaptation is negotiated in two
   coastal fishing communities by documenting livelihood stressors,
   household assets, adaptive strategies, and factors that facilitate or
   inhibit adaptation. Declining catch is the most common stressor being
   experienced in both communities, however, socioeconomic, e. g., disease
   or theft, and ecological, e. g., severe storms and drought, changes are
   also creating livelihood stress. We find that specialized fishers' with
   higher investment in fishing gear and government support are adapting by
   intensifying their fishing efforts, whereas poorer fishers with more
   livelihood options are adapting through diversification. Adaptation is
   facilitated by fishers' groups, occupational pride, and family networks.
   It is inhibited by limited assets, competition over declining resources,
   and pervasive poverty. Our data suggest that adaptation is a
   heterogeneous process that is influenced by multiple factors.
   Understanding the complexity of fishers' responses to livelihood
   stressors is critical for fostering adaptive capacity in coastal
   communities, for strengthening fisheries management, and for improving
   the livelihoods of fishing dependent communities.},

Title = {Relationship between CH4 and N2O flux from soil and their ambient mixing

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Temporal variations of the ambient mixing ratio of greenhouse gas (CH4
   and N2O) in a riparian rice-based agro-ecosystem of tropical region were
   studied during 2005-2006 in coastal Odisha. The endeavour was made with
   the hypothesis that the ambient mixing ratio of CH4 and N2O depends on
   the changes in the flux of CH4 and N2O from the rice fields in the
   riparian rice ecosystems. A higher ambient mixing ratio of CH4 was
   recorded during the tillering to grain filling stages of the rice crop,
   during both dry and wet seasons. The higher ambient mixing ratio of CH4
   during the wet season may attribute to the higher CH4 emission from the
   rice field. The average mixing ratio of CH4 was recorded as 1.84 +/-
   0.05 ppmv and 1.85 +/- 0.06 ppmv during 2005 and 2006, respectively. The
   ambient CH4 mixing ratio was recorded negatively correlated with the
   average ambient temperature. The N2O mixing ratio ranged from 261.57 to
   399.44 ppbv with an average of 330.57 ppbv during 2005. However, the
   average mixing ratio of N2O was recorded as 318.83 +/- 20.00 ppbv during
   2006. The N2O mixing ratio was recorded to be negatively correlated with
   rainfall and average ambient temperature. Significant negative
   correlation (r = -0.209) of N2O with sunshine hours may attribute to the
   photochemical break down of N2O. The temporal variation of N2O flux from
   the rice field does not affect the ambient mixing ratio of N2O in the
   same way as in the case of the ambient mixing ratio of CH4. However, the
   higher mixing ratio of N2O during the fallow period of the post monsoon
   period may attribute to the N2O flux from soil. Results indicate that
   intensively cultivated coastal ecosystems can be a major source of
   ambient greenhouse gas.},

Abstract = {In the international climate change negotiations, the Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS) have emerged as a credible group through the
   AOSIS (Alliance of Small Island States) and have called for a global
   temperature rise of 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. Whatever
   the outcomes of the negotiations, they are exacerbated by climate change
   and a rising sea level. Many share common characteristics of small size,
   high population density, limited land resources, vulnerability to
   natural hazards, threatened biodiversity, high dependence on tourism,
   and limited funds and human resources. The suggestions put forward for a
   research agenda for the SIDS include a comprehensive assessment of the
   SIDS as a group, a focused attention on oceans, increased development on
   renewable energy, inclusion of climate adaptation under natural disaster
   reduction, a strategy of `save some islands rather than not to have any'
   for some SIDS, and large-scale modular mangrove planting for coastal

Abstract = {The article attempts to develop a five dimensional community resilience
   assessment framework and a composite resilience index against climate
   related disasters with special applications to the coastal rural
   communities' in the developing world. Consequently, it narrates the case
   study of Indian Sundarbans, which serves as a typical example of a
   complex \& dynamic `socio-ecological' system characterized by dense
   mangrove forests, high population density and recurrent climate related
   disasters. In the present study, `community resilience' of 19 coastal
   administrative blocks of Indian Sundarbans were assessed through a
   systematic questionnaire survey of administrative officials and the
   composite resilience scores were found to vary between 2.51 and 3.63 in
   a five point scale. Out of the 19 coastal blocks only one could be
   classified as high resilient block and the rest were found to be in low
   to moderate resilience categories. In general, the extreme coastal
   blocks were found to be less resilient due to their high exposure \&
   developmental deficit, however, at the same time, the study finds strong
   correlation of institutional interventions \& effective coastal zone
   management in enhancing the overall resilience scores. The study
   concludes with broad recommendation of integrated planning for disaster
   \& climate resilience in this eco-fragile region where low impact
   economic development remains at the central.},

Abstract = {Future projection of diffusion conditions associated with extreme haze
   events over eastern China is of great importance to government emission
   regulations and public human health. Here, the diffusion conditions and
   their changes under future warming scenarios are examined. The relative
   strength of haze events in the Northern China Plain region increase from
   150\% during 2006-15 to 190\% during 2090-99 under RCP8.5 scenarios,
   induced by a stronger and longer-lasting anticyclone anomaly in eastern
   China. The strengthened anticyclone anomaly is mainly induced by
   increased northern wave train convergence emanating from the
   Barents-Kara Sea, and the longer duration of the anticyclone anomaly is
   mainly induced by stronger local feedback that can extract more energy
   from the basic state to maintain the anticyclone anomaly in eastern
   China. Aerosol reduction is found to play a dominant role in
   strengthening the upstream wave train near the Barents-Kara Sea and the
   downstream anticyclone in eastern China, while the effects from
   increased greenhouse gases are small. The results of this study indicate
   that future aerosol emissions reduction can induce deteriorating
   diffusion conditions, suggesting more stringent regulations on aerosol
   emissions in China are needed to meet air quality standards.},

Title = {Resilience of Infrastructure Systems to Sea-Level Rise in Coastal Areas:
   Impacts, Adaptation Measures, and Implementation Challenges},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Expansive areas of low elevation in many densely populated coastal areas
   are at elevated risk of storm surges and flooding due to torrential
   precipitation, as a result of sea level rise. These phenomena could have
   catastrophic impacts on coastal communities and result in the
   destruction of critical infrastructure, disruption of economic
   activities and salt water contamination of the water supply. The
   objective of the study presented in this paper was to identify various
   impacts of sea level rise on civil infrastructures in coastal areas and
   examine the adaptation measures suggested in the existing literature. To
   this end, a systemic review of the existing literature was conducted in
   order to identify a repository of studies addressing sea level rise
   impacts and adaptation measures in the context of infrastructure
   systems. The study focused on three infrastructure sectors: water and
   wastewater, energy, and road transportation. The collected information
   was then analyzed in order to identify different categories of sea level
   rise impacts and corresponding adaptation measures. The findings of the
   study are threefold: (1) the major categories of sea level rise impacts
   on different infrastructure systems; (2) measures for protection,
   accommodation, and retreat in response to sea level rise impacts; and
   (3) challenges related to implementing adaptation measures.},

   Working Progress?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Growth and diversification of tourism activities in Antarctica have not
   been matched by proactive strategies for planning or management.
   Recognizing that the adaptive management approach has been effectively
   implemented in managing tourism in protected areas, we examine to what
   extent this approach has been incorporated into the Antarctic tourism
   research and management, and what constraints exist for its
   implementation. To better understand the extent of literature
   contributions, we conducted an appraisal of 72 peer-reviewed journal
   articles published from 1992 to 2020 and Antarctic management documents.
   From a scientific perspective, researchers have been advocating for
   adaptive management approaches to Antarctic tourism and have applied
   different elements, particularly ecological assessments, design of
   management measures, monitoring, and regulatory mechanisms. However,
   these contributions have not been necessarily translated into management
   policy and regulations. We acknowledge that full implementation of an
   adaptive management approach is not easily achievable due to the unique
   Antarctic regime. However, we argue that comprehensive site-specific and
   regional adaptive management models could be applied as the first step
   for a more systematic implementation. This incremental approach could
   contribute to enhanced stakeholder participation and improved
   decision-making processes, ultimately leading to a more proactive and
   effective management of Antarctic tourism, essential for the
   conservation of the continent.},

Abstract = {In view of past environmental degradation and anticipated climate change
   impacts, we assessed the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation in the
   Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. In a workshop with staff from three
   Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) who had jurisdiction over three
   sub-basins, as well as technical experts, nine adaptation options were
   identified that ranged from environmental flows, restoring river channel
   habitat, reoperating infrastructure and controlling invasive species. A
   Catchment Adaptation Framework was developed and used to assess and
   compare these adaptation options with each of the CMAs, drawing on
   interviews with their key stakeholders, to identify the risks, benefits
   and costs. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation can augment
   catchment management programs and requires investment in a suite of
   different but complementary measures to lower risk. Our research found
   institutional challenges in implementing this approach, including the
   complexities of multi-agency management, constricting legal
   requirements, narrow funding arrangements, under-developed institutional
   capacity, difficulties of implementing catchment-scale programs on
   private property and the need to adhere to community expectations. These
   institutional issues are ubiquitous internationally and point to the
   wider issues of providing sufficient management capacity to support
   adaptation. The Catchment Adaptation Framework presented here enables
   river basin managers to systematically assess the adaptation options to
   better inform their decision-making.},

Title = {The contribution of ocean-based solutions to carbon reduction in China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},

Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Climate change has become a great challenge for humanity. However, the
   current climate change mitigation measures, primarily concentrate on
   land, more or less neglecting the vital role of the ocean-based
   solutions. While the ocean is a crucial regulator of the global climate,
   ocean-based solutions could also play an essential role in climate
   change mitigation and policymaking. This paper developed an Ocean-based
   Solutions Carbon Reduction Assessment Model (OSCRAM) that addresses
   coastal ecosystems, ocean energy, marine transportation, fishery, and
   seabed to estimate the oceanic contribution to climate change
   mitigation. It has been applied to evaluate the capacity of carbon
   emission reduction through oceans in China. We found that the total
   contribution for carbon emission reduction was about 6.86 Tg CO2 per
   year, and it may reach 139.39 Tg in 2030 under the target scenario. The
   results indicated that the ocean has huge potential to reduce carbon
   emissions. The development of marine energy and low-carbon marine
   shipping may have more potential for emission reduction in China, and
   the government should also protect and restore coastal wetlands for
   their enormous carbon storage. It can also provide a reference for the
   globe and other nations in achieving emission reduction goals. (C) 2021

Abstract = {Climate change is challenging the sustained delivery of ecosystem
   services from urban agriculture. Extreme, prolonged drought in
   combination with high heat events affect urban crop production due to
   limited water availability and affect environmental management and
   adaptation to environmental conditions. In this study, we use urban
   community gardens in central coast California as a system to investigate
   how people are adapting their management behaviors over three time
   periods-before, during and after the longest drought in California's
   recent history. We specifically ask how behavioral change is impacted by
   water policies and gardener characteristics (including gardening
   experience, formal education, drought concern, and relationship to
   nature). Through structural equation modeling and multivariate analyses,
   we show that nature relatedness and gardening experience impact drought
   concern which in turn impact behavioral change, and potentially
   gardener's ability to sustainably manage water and to adapt to drought
   conditions. Planting motivations are also important, influencing
   people's adoption and retention of practices over time. Yet where
   concern may be absent, water policies are able to promote and maintain
   behavioral change and conservation-based practice adoption. Thus,
   environmental awareness and experience in combination with policies are
   needed to promote and support proactive behavioral change and adaptation
   to create resilient urban food production systems under climate change.},

Title = {Changes in sediment methanogenic archaea community structure and methane
   production potential following conversion of coastal marsh to
   aquaculture ponds},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {305},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Widespread conversion of coastal wetlands into aquaculture ponds in
   coastal region often results in degradation of the wetland ecosystems,
   but its effects on sediment's potential to produce greenhouse gases
   remain unclear. Using field sampling, incubation experiments and
   molecular analysis, we studied the sediment CH4 production potential and
   the relevant microbial communities in a brackish marsh and the nearby
   aquaculture ponds in the Min River Estuary in southeastern China.
   Sediment CH4 production potential was higher in the summer and autumn
   months than in spring and winter months, and it was significantly
   correlated with sediment carbon content among all environmental
   variables. The mean sediment CH4 production potential in the aquaculture
   ponds (20.1 ng g-1 d-1) was significantly lower than that in the marsh
   (45.2 ng g-1 d-1). While Methanobacterium dominated in both habitats
   (41-59\%), the overall composition of sediment methanogenic archaea
   communities differed significantly between the two habitats (p < 0.05)
   and methanogenic archaea alpha diversity was lower in the aquaculture
   ponds (p < 0.01). Network analysis revealed that interactions between
   sediment methanogenic archaea were much weaker in the ponds than in the
   marsh. Overall, these findings suggest that conversion of marsh land to
   aquaculture ponds significantly altered the sediment methanogenic
   archaea community structure and diversity and lowered the sediment's
   capacity to produce CH4.},

Journal = {MARITIME POLICY \& MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {444-461},
Abstract = {Recently, shipping lines have focused on efficient ship operation, which
   relates to energy efficiency issues in shipping and, particularly, to
   operational issues such that the minimisation of fuel consumption and
   resulting greenhouse gas emissions. Efficient ship operation in
   container lines is closely related to the ship's time at sea and ship's
   time in port. Reduction in port time, thanks to high-quality port
   operations, allows improvement in the operational efficiency of a liner
   service by reducing the fuel consumption of a ship at sea and its
   resulting CO2 emissions. The main goal of this article is to investigate
   how time in port affects efficient ship operation in terms of operating
   costs, CO2 emissions and externalities. For this, as a methodology, a
   simulation based upon system dynamics is introduced. Major finding is
   that less time in port resulting from the improvement of port operations
   contributes to efficient ship operation in terms of operating costs,
   amount of CO2 emissions and external effects in the liner shipping
   industry. In particular, a sensitivity analysis on efficient ship
   operation vis-a-vis the quality of port operation shows that bigger
   ships need to select highly productive calling ports that provide less
   time in port.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the economic viability of a 30 MW wind power plant

   suitability of siting wind farms for the purpose of electricity
   generation. Bonny Island is presently not connected to Nigeria utility
   grid, as such sustainable and reliable electricity generation is
   desirable. In this work, wind electricity generation and economic
   assessment of Enercon E-82 (2 MW) wind turbines operating at 78 m hub
   height was investigated. The result showed the chosen turbine model can
   generate total annual electricity of 89,684 MWh at an energy cost of
   \$0.1/ kWh and 38,796 tons of CO2 on greenhouse gas saving. The result
   also showed that the wind power generation is economically viable in
   Bonny Island.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many salt marshes throughout southern New England are exhibiting a trend
   toward submergence, as reported in this volume and other published
   literature. This paper provides a brief perspective on sea-level rise
   and the many other interacting factors that contribute to marsh
   submergence in this and other regions. Curtailing nutrient loading and
   removing or altering barriers (e.g., dams, dikes) to the delivery of
   suspended sediment to marshes are discussed as management or restoration
   techniques to consider for increasing long-term sustainability of
   marshes. Adaptation measures are many (e.g., thin-layer sediment
   application to marsh surface, facilitation of landward marsh migration,
   shoreline stabilization), but all require study to evaluate their
   potential for enhancing resilience. Research, monitoring, and dynamic
   modeling, coupled with appropriate management and adaptation approaches
   implemented at local and regional scales, will contribute to the
   challenge of sustaining salt marshes in an uncertain future of sea-level
   rise, other climate factors, and stressors associated with a developing
   coastal zone.},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {Ocean surveys show that extremely sharp thermal boundaries have limited
   the distribution of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the Pacific
   Ocean and adjacent seas over the past 40 years. These limits are
   expressed as a step function, with the temperature defining the position
   of the thermal limit varying between months in an annual cycle. The
   sharpness of the edge, the different temperatures that define the
   position of the edge in different months of the year, and the subtle
   variations in temperature with area or decade for a given month probably
   all occur because temperature-dependent metabolic rates exceed energy
   intake from feeding over large regions of otherwise acceptable habitat
   in the North Pacific. At current rates of greenhouse gas emissions,
   predicted temperature increases under a doubled CO2 climate are large
   enough to shift the position of the thermal limits into the Bering Sea
   by the middle of the next century. Such an increase would potentially
   exclude sockeye salmon from the entire Pacific Ocean and severely
   restrict the overall area of the marine environment that would support
   growth.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Sea level variability increasingly contributes to coastal flooding and
   erosion as global sea levels rise, partly due to the thermal expansion
   of seawater, which accelerates with increasing temperature. Climate
   model simulations with increasing greenhouse gas emissions suggest that
   future sea level variability, such as the annual and interannual
   oscillations that alter local astronomical tidal cycles and contribute
   to coastal impacts, will also increase in many regions. Here, we present
   an analysis of the CMIP5 climate model projections of future sea level
   to show that there is a tendency for a near-global increase in sea level
   variability with continued warming that is robust across models,
   regardless of whether ocean temperature variability increases.
   Specifically, for an upper-ocean warming by 2 degrees C, which is likely
   to be reached by the end of this century, sea level variability
   increases by 4 to 10\% globally on seasonal-to-interannual timescales
   because of the nonlinear thermal expansion of seawater. As the oceans
   continue to warm, future ocean temperature oscillations will cause
   increasingly larger buoyancy-related sea level fluctuations that may
   alter coastal risks.
   Sea level variability will increase by up to 10\% globally on
   seasonal-to-interannual timescales for future upper-ocean warming of
   about 2 degrees C, because thermal expansion accelerates at higher
   temperatures, suggest analyses of climate model simulations.},

Abstract = {Subsurface storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is regarded as a short to
   medium term solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   there are concerns with respect to the integrity of seals in subsurface
   storage of CO2 and the risks associated with leakage to ocean and
   atmosphere. In this paper, we report the results of experimental
   laboratory simulation of CO2 leakage from subsurface storage sites and
   the self-sealing mechanism of CO2 hydrates in subsea sediments, using an
   experimental setup specifically constructed for this work. The results
   demonstrate that the sequestrated CO2 migrated upward and formed
   hydrates with the pore water in the sediment when the pressure and
   temperature conditions in the sediments were inside the hydrate
   stability zone. The CO2 hydrate formation slowed down the CO2 diffusion
   rate by several times to 3 orders of magnitude. The upward migrating CO2
   tended to form hydrate at the base of the hydrate stability zone. On the
   geological time scale the CO2 hydrate formation could create a
   low-permeability secondary cap layer which greatly restricts further
   upward CO2 flow, should a leakage occurs. This potential
   ``self-sealing{''} and ``self-healing{''} process could be an important
   criterion in the selection of suitable sites for geological storage of
   CO2.},

Title = {Spatiotemporally explicit prediction of future ecosystem service
   provisioning in response to climate change, sea level rise, and
   adaptation strategies},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We present a framework to relate the provision of multiple, interacting
   ecosystem services to climate change and land use adaptation, by
   combining hydrological process models with statistical species'
   distribution models and transfer functions to upscale plot data to the
   landscape scale. Functional traits of the projected plant communities
   predict provisional and species conservation services, whereas the
   hydrological model predicts water-related regulatory services. We
   applied the framework to coastal areas of the Baltic Sea to predict
   future ecosystem service outputs in yearly time steps from 2010 to 2100,
   based on a `high emissions' climate change scenario, a projected
   sea-level rise of 1.05 m, and four land-management options corresponding
   to future coastal adaptation strategies. The ``Hold the line{''}
   strategy implies continual pumping of excess rainwater into the sea to
   allow farm income from grassland usage, together with high conservation
   values for rare plants and meadow birds. Towards the end of the century,
   with an increasing sea-level rise, this results in reverse groundwater
   flows from sea to land and soil salinization of grasslands. Conversely,
   ``managed realignment{''} implies the abandonment of pumping, thereby
   changing grasslands to reeds, reducing farm income and species
   conservation values, but promoting water retention and carbon
   sequestration by peat production. Between 2010 and 2100, the time series
   averaged across all landscape patches masked substantial spatial shifts
   in the outputs of ecosystem services from lower to higher elevations,
   emphasizing the relevance of considering both time and
   space.Multifunctional landscapes, by compromising between provisioning
   and regulatory ecosystem services, may create the response diversity
   needed to successfully adapt to climate change and sea-level rise.},

Title = {Optimal Slow Steaming Speed for Container Ships under the EU Emission
   Trading System},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Slow steaming is an operational measure in ocean-going vessels sailing
   at slow speeds. It can help climate mitigation efforts by cutting down
   marine fuel consumption and consequently reducing CO2 and other
   Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG). Due to climate change both the European
   Union (EU) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are
   analysing the inclusion of international shipping in the EU Emissions
   Trading System (ETS) in the near future or alternatively implementing a
   carbon tax. The paper proposes a methodology to decide the optimal speed
   of a vessel taking into account its characteristics and the factors that
   determine its economic results. The calculated cash flow can be used in
   valuation models. The methodology is applied for a case study for any
   container ship in a range from 2000 to 20,000 Twenty-foot Equivalent
   Units (TEU) on a leg of a round trip from Shanghai to Rotterdam. We
   calculate how speed reduction, CO2 emissions and ship owner's earnings
   per year may vary between a business-as-usual scenario and a scenario in
   which shipping is included in the ETS. The analysis reveals that the
   optimal speed varies with the size of the vessel and depends on several
   variables such as marine fuel prices, cargo freight rates and other
   voyage costs. Results show that the highest optimal speed is in the
   range of 5500-13,000 TEUs whether or not the ETS is applied. As the
   number of TEUs transported in a vessel increases emissions per TEU
   decrease. In an established freight rate market, the optimal speed
   fluctuates by 1.8 knots. Finally, the medium- and long-term expectations
   for slow steaming are analysed based on future market prices.},

Abstract = {To combat global warming, Canada has committed to reducing greenhouse
   gases to be (GHGs) 40 \%-45 \% below 2005 emission levels by 2025.
   Monitoring emissions and deriving accurate inventories are essential to
   reaching these goals. Airborne methods can provide regional and area
   source measurements with small error if ideal conditions for sampling
   are met. In this study, two airborne mass-balance box-flight algorithms
   were compared to assess the extent of their agreement and their
   performance under various conditions. The Scientific Aviation's (SciAv)
   Gaussian algorithm and the Environment and Climate Change Canada's
   top-down emission rate retrieval algorithm (TERRA) were applied to data
   from five samples. Estimates were compared using standard procedures, by
   systematically testing other method fits, and by investigating the
   effects on the estimates when method assumptions were not met. Results
   indicate that in standard scenarios the SciAv and TERRA mass-balance
   box-flight methods produce similar estimates that agree (3 \%-25 \%)
   within algorithm uncertainties (4 \%-34 \%). Implementing a
   sample-specific surface extrapolation procedure for the SciAv algorithm
   may improve emission estimation. Algorithms disagreed when non-ideal
   conditions occurred (i.e., under non-stationary atmospheric conditions).
   Overall, the results provide confidence in the box-flight methods and
   indicate that emissions estimates are not overly sensitive to the choice
   of algorithm but demonstrate that fundamental algorithm assumptions
   should be assessed for each flight. Using a different method, the
   Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation
   (AVIRIS-NG) independently mapped individual plumes with emissions 5
   times larger than the source SciAv sampled three days later. The range
   in estimates highlights the utility of increased sampling to get a more
   complete understanding of the temporal variability of emissions and to
   identify emission sources within facilities. In addition, hourly on-site
   activity data would provide insight to the observed temporal variability
   in emissions and make a comparison to reported emissions more
   straightforward.},

Title = {Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis of Impacts of Future Heat Waves on
   Mortality in the Eastern United States},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {122},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate change is anticipated to influence heat-related
   mortality in the future. However, estimates of excess mortality
   attributable to future heat waves are subject to large uncertainties and
   have not been projected under the latest greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios.
   OBJECTIVES: We estimated future heat wave mortality in the eastern
   United States (approximately 1,700 counties) under two Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and investigated sources of uncertainty.
   METHODS: Using dynamically downscaled hourly temperature projections for
   2057-2059, we projected heat wave days that were defined using four heat
   wave metrics and estimated the excess mortality attributable to them. We
   apportioned the sources of uncertainty in excess mortality estimates
   using a variance-decomposition method.
   RESULTS: Estimates suggest that excess mortality attributable to heat
   waves in the eastern United States would result in 200-7,807 deaths/year
   (mean 2,379 deaths/year) in 2057-2059. Average excess mortality
   projections under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were 1,403 and 3,556
   deaths/year, respectively. Excess mortality would be relatively high in
   the southern states and eastern coastal areas (excluding Maine). The
   major sources of uncertainty were the relative risk estimates for
   mortality on heat wave versus non-heat wave days, the RCP scenarios, and
   the heat wave definitions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risks from future heat waves may be an order of
   magnitude higher than the mortality risks reported in 2002-2004, with
   thousands of heat wave-related deaths per year in the study area
   projected under the RCP8.5 scenario. Substantial spatial variability in
   county-level heat mortality estimates suggests that effective mitigation
   and adaptation measures should be developed based on spatially resolved
   data.},

Title = {Social learning for building community resilience to cyclones: role of
   indigenous and local knowledge, power, and institutions in coastal
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Despite wide recognition of the role of social learning in building
   community resilience, few studies have thus far analyzed how the
   power-knowledge-institution matrix shapes social learning processes that
   in turn foster resilience outcomes. Drawing insights from the
   biopolitical lens of resilience, we take a critical stance on
   programmatic interventions for community resilience and social learning,
   arguing that local knowledge, beliefs, practices, and social memory (SM)
   are crucial elements in social learning processes for building community
   resilience to shocks and stresses. In addition, we explore how
   technologies shape social learning processes and build or strengthen
   community resilience. Our research, conducted in cyclone-prone coastal
   zones of Bangladesh, adopts a transformative interpretive framework
   (TIF) and a community-based participatory approach to empirical
   investigation. Findings of our research provide evidence that formal
   institutions frequently exclude indigenous and local knowledge (ILK)
   from social learning processes, and often subjugate communities to
   notions of resilience, as defined by nonlocals, that perceive people as
   subjects of institutional power and objects of scientific knowledge,
   rather than as active agents. We further found that local communities
   are able to obtain early warnings of cyclones through ILK of
   environmental phenomena, such as changing water temperature and animal
   behavior. Despite an abundance of ILK regarding past cyclones, the 2007
   Cyclone Sidr was a surprising event to many and caused considerable loss
   of life and property. Much of this unpreparedness stemmed from an
   overall SM deficit-a key to translating knowledge into action. We
   recommend strengthening efforts to bridge scientific-technical knowledge
   and ILK to ensure effective social-learning-led resilience outcomes are
   achieved.},

Title = {Sustainable development of climate-resilient aquaculture and

Volume = {13},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change is an inevitable event that obstructs the output of
   aquaculture farms and culture-based fisheries in open waters. It poses a
   serious threat to global food security, altering biodiversity,
   ecosystems, and global fish output by displacing fish stocks from their
   natural habitats. When compared to freshwater aquaculture,
   marine/coastal aquaculture is more affected. To combat the effects of
   climate change, several mitigation methods and adaptations are being
   implemented, emphasizing future demands of affordable protein. Selective
   breeding, species diversification, and aquaculture systems like
   integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, aquaponics, and recirculating
   aquaculture system are some of the most widely accepted and adapted
   solutions. Further research on intervention in seed and feed in terms of
   quality improvement, bioresource utilization, and technological and
   genetic improvement is required. Climate change policies from the
   government are also essential. The present study differs from previous
   reviews by portraying the various abiotic stress factors contributing to
   the drastic climate change, encompassing adaptation strategies followed
   in distinct aquaculture sources such as freshwater, inland saline water,
   brackish water, coastal waters, and culture-based capture fisheries with
   its future implications.},

Title = {Adaptive capacity of Arctic communities in the context of climate change
   and shipping growth: A review of Russian and Western literature},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Abstract = {Throughout the past two decades, the number of studies examining the
   adaptive capacity of Arctic communities in the context of climate change
   has been increasing; however, little is known about Arctic communities'
   ability to adapt to certain emerging changes, such as increased shipping
   activity. To address this knowledge gap, this study systematically
   analyses published scientific articles on community adaptive capacity in
   circumpolar Arctic, including articles published in Russian which may
   not be captured in English-only reviews. Throughout this review, the
   study focuses on three areas: the development of the adaptive capacity
   framework; the conditions that enable community adaption abilities; and
   the extent to which shipping developments are addressed in the
   literature. This study demonstrates that the adaptive capacity framework
   has been significantly developed both theoretically and methodologically
   and is broadly used to address new types of climatic and non-climatic
   changes. Though the impacts from the shipping development are discussed
   in some studies, there is a clear need for further examination of
   coastal communities' ability to adapt to such changes. Additionally, the
   study reveals limitations in the application of the Western conceptual
   terminology when exploring community-based research by Russian scholars.},

Abstract = {From an environmental perspective, electricity grid interconnections in
   Northeast Asia make sense. Cities in Northeast China, Mongolia, the
   Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and the Republic of Korea
   (ROK) suffer from poor air quality due to the extensive use of
   coal-fired power generation. Rural communities suffer from a deficit of
   electricity, forcing reliance on coal and biofuels for cooking and
   heating in the home, which causes health-damaging indoor air pollution.
   Regional air pollution from acid rain and ozone is widespread. In
   addition, Japan is finding it hard to meet its commitment under the
   Kyoto Protocol. Yet, just across their borders in far eastern Russia are
   extensive, clean energy resources: hydroelectricity and natural gas, and
   (potentially) nuclear power and tidal power. It would be environmentally
   beneficial to generate electricity cleanly, in far eastern Russia and
   transmit the electricity across the borders into China, Mongolia, the
   DPRK, the ROK, and Japan, thereby displacing coal-fired electricity
   generation. We estimate that currently planned projects could alleviate
   the problems of two to five Chinese cities, with the potential for much
   larger benefits in the future. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Earth System models (ESMs) are global climate models with the added
   capability to explicitly represent biogeochemical processes that
   interact with the physical climate and so alter its response to forcing
   such as that associated with human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases.
   Representing the global carbon cycle allows for feedbacks between the
   physical climate and the biological and chemical processes in the ocean
   and on land that take up some of the emitted carbon dioxide and so act
   to reduce warming. The sulfur cycle is also important in that both
   natural and human emissions of sulfur contribute to the production of
   sulfate aerosols which reflect incoming solar radiation (a direct
   cooling effect) and alter cloud properties (an indirect cooling effect).
   Other components such as ozone are also being incorporated into some
   ESMs. Evaluating the physical component of an ESM is becoming
   increasingly comprehensive and sophisticated, but the evaluation of the
   biogeochemical components suffer somewhat from a lack of comprehensive
   global-scale observational data. Nevertheless, such models provide
   valuable insight into climate variability and change, and the role of
   human activities and possible mitigation actions on future climate
   change. Internationally coordinated experiments are increasingly
   important in providing a multimodel ensemble of climate simulations,
   thereby taking advantage of some `cancellation of errors' and allowing
   better quantification of uncertainty. (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Mechanisms for stronger warming over drier ecoregions observed since
   1979},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {47},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {2955-2974},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Previous research found that the warming rate observed for the period
   1979-2012 increases dramatically with decreasing vegetation greenness
   over land between 50A degrees S and 50A degrees N, with the strongest
   warming rate seen over the driest regions such as the Sahara desert and
   the Arabian Peninsula, suggesting warming amplification over deserts. To
   further this finding, this paper explores possible mechanisms for this
   amplification by analyzing observations, reanalysis data and historical
   simulations of global coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation
   models. We examine various variables, related to surface radiative
   forcing, land surface properties, and surface energy and radiation
   budget, that control the warming patterns in terms of large-scale
   ecoregions. Our results indicate that desert amplification is likely
   attributable primarily to enhanced longwave radiative forcing associated
   with a stronger water vapor feedback over drier ecoregions in response
   to the positive global-scale greenhouse gas forcing. This warming
   amplification and associated downward longwave radiation at the surface
   are reproduced by historical simulations with anthropogenic and natural
   forcings, but are absent if only natural forcings are considered,
   pointing to new potential fingerprints of anthropogenic warming. These
   results suggest a fundamental pattern of global warming over land that
   depend on the dryness of ecosystems in mid- and low- latitudes, likely
   reflecting primarily the first order large-scale thermodynamic component
   of global warming linked to changes in the water and energy cycles over
   different ecosystems. This finding may have important implications in
   interpreting global warming patterns and assessing climate change
   impacts.},

Abstract = {The payload of the EOS AM-1 spacecraft consists of five scientific
   instruments: the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Radiometer
   (ASTER), the Clouds and the Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES), the
   Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), the Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Measurements of Pollution in
   the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument. The EOS AM-1 instruments will
   collect data on the physical and radiative properties of clouds (ASTER,
   CERES, MISR, MODIS); on air-land and air-sea exchanges of energy,
   carbon, and water (ASTER, MISR, MODIS); and on vertical profiles of
   greenhouse gases (MOPITT). The EOS AM-1 spacecraft and its instruments
   are fully integrated and launch is expected in mid-1999.},

Abstract = {The growing generation of plastic waste (PW) is placing severe burdens
   in the terrestrial and marine environments due to its inappropriate
   management at end of life. Governments are aware of this situation and
   have proposed production bans or initiatives to minimize the amount of
   PW that is landfilled and encourage recycling or energy recovery.
   Circular economy is a strategy that reuses PW to produce new polymers
   while avoiding its disposal and displacing the use of virgin materials.
   This study reports on a refinery design that employs fast pyrolysis of
   waste high-density polyethylene and downstream separations to obtain
   monomers, aromatics, and hydrocarbon fuels. This study focuses on a life
   cycle carbon footprint analysis (CFA) and the effects of regional
   electricity grids on cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions using
   process simulation for life cycle assessment inputs. The effects of heat
   integration on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were investigated in
   scenarios, as well as the investigation of parameter sensitivity and
   uncertainty. The CFA results show that the GHG emissions of ethylene,
   propylene, and aromatics mixture (1.08, 1.10, and 1.16 kg CO2 equiv/kg,
   respectively) are equal to or less than those of fossil products when
   heat integration is included assuming U.S. average electricity grid. The
   evaluation of regional electricity grids on GHG emissions for all
   products was conducted for 50 states in the U.S.},

Title = {Impact of Greenhouse Gas Concentration Changes on Surface Energetics in

   Glacial-Interglacial Differences},

Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {The temperature response to a greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration change
   is studied in an ocean-atmosphere coupled model-L'Institut Pierre-Simon
   Laplace Coupled Model, version 4 (IPSL-CM4)-for both a glacial and an
   interglacial context. The response to a GHG concentration changing from
   Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to preindustrial values is similar for both
   climatic contexts in terms of temperature pattern, but the magnitude is
   greater under modern ones. The model simulates the classical
   amplification of the temperature response in the northern high latitudes
   compared to lower latitudes and over the land surfaces compared to the
   ocean.
   The physical reasons for the differential warming according to the
   latitude and to the surface type are studied through an analysis of the
   energy flux changes, which are decomposed to consider and quantify many
   different physical processes. The results highlight the role of many
   different factors in the thermal response to a GHG forcing for different
   regions, and stress, for instance, the large effect of increased water
   vapor concentration in the atmosphere. Concerning the land-sea warming
   ratio, several fluxes contribute to the final value of the ratio, with
   latent flux having the greatest influence. The different contributions
   are quantified. The comparison of the flux changes between the
   interglacial and glacial contexts shows that the differences are more
   than a simple effect of different surface emissions of the base state.
   It suggests that the climatic context is particularly important for the
   cloud and oceanic advection responses to the forcing, along with albedo
   effects.},

Abstract = {Many coastal landscapes across Europe are undergoing change due to the
   impacts of a changing climate. In the context of coastal erosion,
   especially the question of physical access to the landscape for a
   variety of publics is becoming ever more important. Where a multitude of
   actors are involved in landscape management, diverging subjective and
   collective perceptions of these changing landscapes, hold potential for
   disagreement about suitable adaptive measures. Although the body of
   literature on the role of subjective values in processes of climate
   adaptation is growing the societal constructions of respective places
   and landscapes underlying different adaptation approaches remain
   under-researched. We show in this paper that how landscapes are
   understood by actors in environmental management matters for
   decision-making. In particular, differentunclerstandings of the Cornish
   landscape at Godrevy Headland are shown to have material implications
   for how issues of access, visitor management and long-term responses to
   climate change and coastal erosion are addressed. In the case of
   Godrevy, coastal erosion has required local actors to plan the
   relocation of a visitor car park, bringing contrasting perspectives on
   the landscape, its use and protection to the fore. Uncovering the
   individual and collective assumptions about the landscape behind these
   conflicting narratives, is vital for fostering inclusive policy and
   planning processes around climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Governance and stakeholder perspectives of managed re-alignment:
   adapting to sea level rise in the Inner Forth estuary, Scotland},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2231-2243},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {With climate change, coastal areas are faced with unprecedented sea
   level rise and flooding, raising questions as to how societies will
   choose to adapt. One option is to strengthen existing sea walls to
   maintain current land uses; however, scientists, policy-makers and
   conservationists increasingly see the benefits of managed realignment,
   which is a nature-based coastal adaptation that involves the conversion
   of reclaimed farmland back to wetlands, allowing periodic local flooding
   in designated areas to reduce the risk of flooding downstream. We
   interviewed 16 local organisations, landowners and farmers and held
   workshops with 109 citizens living the Inner Forth estuary in eastern
   Scotland, to examine how managed realignment is supported by stakeholder
   attitudes and their engagement. Most of the farmers we interviewed
   prefer strengthened sea walls, to maintain their livelihoods and
   agricultural heritage. Citizens and local organisations were mainly
   supportive of managed realignment, because it provided wildlife and
   flood regulation benefits. However, we identified several barriers that
   could present obstacles to implementing managed realignment, for
   example, uncertainty whether it would support their principles of
   economic and rational decision-making. Our findings suggest that the
   local capacity to cope with rising sea levels is limited by lack of
   engagement with all relevant stakeholder groups, the limited scope of
   existing stakeholder partnerships and poor short-term funding prospects
   of landscape partnerships that would facilitate collaboration and
   discussion. We suggest that including citizens, landowners, farmers and
   industries would strengthen existing stakeholder deliberation and
   collaboration, and support the Inner Forth's transition towards a more
   sustainable future shoreline.},

Abstract = {Local governments are under pressure to tackle an increasing spectrum of
   complex contemporary problems, such as climate change, while ensuring
   multiple stakeholder interests are incorporated into decision processes.
   Multi-criteria decision tools can assist, but challenges remain in
   creating an enabling environment for incorporating and balancing
   different stakeholder perspectives. Here, we draw on interview data and
   a sensitivity analysis to investigate the use of an evaluation matrix to
   guide local coastal adaptation decision-making in South Africa. We adopt
   a participatory action research framework and find that decision-making
   is influenced by individual, departmental and institutional values that
   are not adequately captured in the matrix approach. Our study reveals
   the compromise between achieving broad stakeholder representation and
   utilising technical expertise, and that altering matrix assumptions can
   imply different decision outcomes. Suggestions are made to improve
   multi-criteria decision approaches to better facilitate integrated
   coastal management in responding to local coastal adaptation challenges.},

Journal = {AICHE JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The global temperature increase over the last century and a half
   (similar to 0.8 degrees C), and the last three decades in particular, is
   well outside of that which can be attributed to natural climate
   fluctuations. The increase of atmospheric CO2 over this period has been
   conclusively demonstrated to be a result largely of fossil fuel burning.
   The global mean temperature change that results in response to a
   sustained perturbation of the Earth's energy balance after a time
   sufficiently long for both the atmosphere and oceans to come to thermal
   equilibrium is termed the Earth's climate sensitivity. The purely
   radiative (blackbody) warming from a doubling of CO2 from its
   preindustrial level of 280 parts-per-million (ppm) to 560 ppm is similar
   to 1.2 degrees C; the actual warming that would result is considerably
   larger owing to amplification by climate feedbacks, including that owing
   to water vapor. Increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) levels are estimated
   to have contributed about +3.0 W m(-2) perturbation (radiative forcing)
   to the Earth's energy balance. Particles (aerosols), on the whole, exert
   a cooling effect on climate, with a total forcing estimated by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007)(1) as -1.2 W m(-2), a
   value that is subject to considerable uncertainty. If the actual
   magnitude of aerosol forcing is close to the low end of its estimated
   uncertainty range, then it offsets a considerably smaller fraction of
   the GHG forcing and the total net forcing is at the high end of its
   range, similar to 2.4 W m(-2); at the other extreme, if the actual
   aerosol cooling is at the high end of its range, then aerosol forcing is
   currently offsetting a major fraction of GHG forcing, and the total net
   forcing is only similar to 0.6 W m(-2). To explain the actual global
   increase in temperature of similar to 0.8 degrees C, these two extremes
   have major implications in terms of the Earth's climate sensitivity.
   Climate sensitivity is determined by the strength of feedbacks, of which
   cloud feedback is the most uncertain. That the Earth has warmed and that
   GHGs are responsible is unequivocal; the Earth's climate sensitivity and
   the effect of aerosols complicate answers to the question: how much
   warming and how soon? (C) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {In recent years, the destruction of the ecosystem, due to the strong
   emission of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere by humans has led to
   significant damage to wildlife, human health, and flora. This has
   significantly changed the human life cycle. Nowadays, the environmental
   damage costs are applied for the countries strongly impacting pollutant
   emission. To this end, developing countries receive annual compensation
   from the countries considered to be the most polluting. So far,
   decision-makers seem to be unaware that, at the scale of an
   eco-neighborhood, some emerging countries produce also a significant
   amount of CO2. The main purpose of this research is to quantify and to
   compare the effect of the energy mix of 150 countries on three
   environmental impacts generated by an eco-neighborhood: greenhouse
   effect, energy demand, and biodiversity damage. To perform this
   comparison, the same neighborhood design is applied to 150 countries,
   but four parameters are adapted to each country: energy mix, local
   climate, building materials, and occupants' mobility. In addition, this
   research evaluates the induced environmental costs of the neighborhood
   over a life cycle of 100 years and examines the impact of mobility and
   photovoltaic panel on these environmental costs. The different
   environmental impacts were evaluated by the Pleiades ACV simulation
   software under four phases (construction, use, renovation, and
   demolition), before being translated into environmental costs. Among the
   four local parameters (energy mix, local materials, climate, and
   transport), the energy mix has the most significant effect on the three
   studied environmental impacts. The results show that the countries
   having a higher concentration of renewable energy sources produce lower
   CO2 than others. Domestic and material wastes are also one of the main
   sources of greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity damage in a
   sustainable neighborhood. The biodiversity damage is high in Sub-Sahara
   Africa, and MiddleEast, but low in the USA, Brazil, Eu-ropean Union,
   Russia, and Australia. The implementation of photovoltaic panels in a
   sustainable neighborhood mitigates, on average, 15.9\% of carbon dioxide
   emissions and 21.2\% of primary energy demand; but, unfortunately, this
   solution increases up to 25.0\% the biodiversity damage. (C) 2020

Title = {Implementation of the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index: An
   important but costly step towards ocean protection},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For decades, the shipping sector has been incorporated into the global
   decarbonization process. At present, global shipping - as a whole - aims
   to reduce its emission levels by 40 \% by 2030 in relation to the 2008
   level. In reducing greenhouse gas emissions, regulations such as the
   MARPOL 73/78 Convention and Energy Efficiency Design Index as well as
   other monitoring and managing schemes already in operation (e.g., Ship
   Energy Efficiency Management Plan and Energy Efficiency Operational
   Indicator) play a crucial role in measuring fuel consumption and ship
   engine emission output. Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) is
   another measure, projected to be ratified in 2023, in-line with
   decarbonization targets in which the International Maritime Organization
   has planned a 70 \% reduction in emissions level by 2050 using the same
   2008 baseline. For this to happen, ship speed may need to be reduced, a
   decrease of fleet capacity may also need to be considered, and new ships
   may need to replace older ones already in service. The costs of
   implementing these types of reforms are obviously significant to the
   sector. Such change will augment the overall shipping overhead,
   effecting subsequent transportation and consumer costs. This paper aims
   to specify the scale of the expected costs of implementing EEXI
   globally. The current maritime fleet has been analyzed in terms of
   energy demand, deadweight tonnage, and expected CO2 emission reduction
   marginal abatement costs (MAC). Two pathways to achieve the desired EEXI
   values are presented, including the most common and available
   technologies to reduce demand. These technologies are subjected to MAC
   valuation and presented quantitatively for the world fleet. The research
   also investigates alternative fuel options in regard to lessening the
   CO2 impact, developing wind support systems, and avoiding conventional
   advancements to ships (e.g., upgrading the propeller or the propulsion
   system). At length, the target of the work is to elucidate a realistic
   CO2 reduction potential in 2030 with the long view of 2050.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Algae is a very promising source for renewable energy production since
   it can fix the greenhouse gas (CO2) by photosynthesis and does not
   compete with the production of food. Compared to microalgae, researches
   on biofuel production from macroalgae in both academia and industry are
   at infancy for economically efficient and technological solutions. This
   review provides up to-date knowledge and information on macroalgae-based
   biofuels, such as biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel and bio-oils
   respectively obtained from anaerobic digestion, fermentation,
   transesterification, liquefaction and pyrolysis technique methods. It is
   concluded that bioethanol and bio-oils from wet macroalgae are more
   competitive while biodiesel production seems less attractive compared to
   high lipid content microalgae biomass. Finally, a biorefinery concept
   based on macroalgae is given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {9735-9748},

Abstract = {The tropical atmospheric circulation and attendant rainfall exhibit
   seasonally dependent responses to increasing temperatures. Understanding
   changes in the South American monsoon system is of particular interest
   given the sensitivity of the southern Amazon rainforest to changes in
   dry season length. We utilize the latest Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
   Laboratory Atmospheric Model (GFDL AM4) to analyze the response of the
   South American monsoon to uniform sea surface temperature (SST) warming.
   SST warming is a poorly understood yet impactful component of greenhouse
   gas-induced climate change. Region-mean rainfall declines by 11\%, and
   net precipitation (precipitation minus evaporation) declines by 40\%,
   during the monsoon onset season (September-November), producing a more
   severe dry season. The column-integrated moist static energy (MSE)
   budget helps elucidate the physical mechanisms of the simulated drying.
   Based on the seasonal analysis, precipitation reductions tend to occur
   when 1) a convecting region's climatological MSE export is dominated by
   horizontal rather than vertical advection, and 2) the horizontal MSE
   advection increases in the perturbed climate, impeding ascent. On a
   synoptic scale, the South American low-level jet strengthens and exports
   more moisture from the monsoon sector, exacerbating spring drying.},

Abstract = {A life cycle inventory analysis has been conducted for the production of
   HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, CH2FCF3)(1) through from basic raw
   materials (crude oil, natural gas, sulphur and fluorspar) to the pure
   product delivered to industrial customers. The analysis was based on
   real industrial operations in Japan, USA and UK. It showed that
   production required limestone, water and transition metal catalysts, in
   addition to the basic raw materials, and that the energy required to
   provide these raw materials in a form that can be used at the plants and
   to process them through intermediates into HFC-134a is the equivalent of
   4.52 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of product. Environmental releases
   associated with HFC-134a included waste salt brine (to the sea), mine
   tailings (mainly ``country{''} rock landfilled at the mine) and small
   quantities of calcium sulphate and spent catalyst (both sent to
   landfill). In addition, greenhouse gases amounting to the equivalent of
   2.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of product were emitted to the atmosphere
   from the plants studied, an effect very much smaller than that estimated
   in previous studies mainly because the real release rates from current
   processes are very much less than those assumed in prior work. The
   global warming potential(2) of HFC-134a is 1300, meaning that, during
   the first 100 years following the release of one tonne, the effect on
   climate change is equivalent to 1300 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
   Consequently, the 6.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, emitted
   during production in the form of energy required and other greenhouse
   gases, is of relatively little importance and the key requirement to
   reduce environmental impact is containment during use. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {Climate change poses significant challenges to coastal cities. Local
   governments around the world are using various strategies to address sea
   level rise and coastal flooding. Most of these responses are reactive,
   developed in an ad hoc manner following a specific event, but there is
   an increasing recognition of the need for more comprehensive and
   proactive approaches. Research into the topic reflects practice, with
   numerous studies of particular locations or strategies providing
   information in a piecemeal manner lacking in comprehensive evaluations.
   This paper addresses this gap through a systematic literature review
   that identifies coastal flooding and sea level rise adaptation practices
   and evaluates their comparative advantages and disadvantages. The
   findings identify a major knowledge gap in comparative costs and
   benefits of alternative adaptation strategies and indicate that coastal
   climate adaptation needs to be tailored to local characteristics and use
   a combination of different structural and non-structural measures to be
   effective.},

Abstract = {With accelerating climate change, US coastal communities are
   experiencing increased flood risk intensity, resulting from accelerated
   sea level rise and stronger storms. These conditions place pressure on
   municipalities and local residents to consider a range of new disaster
   risk reduction programs, climate resilience initiatives, and in some
   cases transformative adaptation strategies (e.g., managed retreat and
   relocation from highly vulnerable, low-elevation locations). Researchers
   have increasingly understood that these climate risks and adaptation
   actions have significant impacts on the quality of life, well-being, and
   mental health of urban coastal residents. We explore these relationships
   and define conditions under which adaptation practices will affect
   communities and residents. Specifically, we assess climate and
   environmental stressors, community change, and well-being by utilizing
   the growing climate change literature and the parallel social science
   literature on risk and hazards, environmental psychology, and urban
   geography work, heretofore not widely integrated into work on climate

Title = {Lack of methane hotspot in the upstream dam: Case study in a tributary
   of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {754},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {River damming has seen a growing trend in demand worldwide and the
   impounded reaches are considered hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions.
   However, it remains unclear how the spatial distribution of C-gas in
   sediments and methane (CH4) emissions of dammed tributary changes under
   different operation periods of the Three Gorges reservoir (TGR). We
   measured CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in sediment and CH4
   emissions from a dammed river of the TGR, and evaluated the effect of
   damming on the spatial variability of carbon in the sediment and on CH4
   flux. It was found that damming led to a distinct spatial pattern of
   total organic carbon (TOC) in the sediment, which resulted in higher CH4
   and CO2 in upstream sediment compared to the downstream. During the TGR
   impounding period, the upstream CH4 diffusive flux (0.253-0.427 mg m(-2)
   h(-1)) across the water-air interface was higher than in the downstream
   (0.093 mg m(-2)h(-1)), which was consistent with the spatial variation
   of CH4 in the sediments. However, the CH4 emission was predominantly by
   ebullition and the flux in the downstream (169.173 mg m(-2) h(-1)) was
   significantly higher than upstream (12.23-123.05 mg m(-2) h(-1)) in the
   discharging period. This can be attributed to a sharp increase in TOC in
   downstream sediment due to riparian zone soil erosion on both banks,
   which was caused by periodic large fluctuation in the water level, and a
   shallow water depth in the downstream. This study adds to our
   understanding of effects of the TGR's operation on CH4 emissions from a
   dammed tributary and suggests that the water level fluctuation of
   tributaries which has direct influence on ebullition and methane
   oxidation caused by manipulation of the TGR should not be overlooked.

Title = {Participatory evaluation for adaptive co-management of social-ecological

Abstract = {Within the adaptive co-management field, evaluation has been receiving
   increased attention over the last 10years. Although monitoring and
   evaluation are integral components of adaptive co-management, they are
   sometimes weakly incorporated. Participatory evaluation could play a
   role in embedding monitoring and evaluation more strongly, but there is
   very little empirical research about its outcomes and implications for
   adaptive co-management. Small-scale fisheries in Uruguay were used as
   case study as they are going through a governance transition; local
   multistakeholder councils have been formed to look for solutions to
   fishery-related problems in a collective manner. In one of these
   councils, we facilitated a participatory evaluation process with
   involvement of the four stakeholder groups (fishers, fisheries agency,
   coast guard and local governments). The objective was to investigate the
   potential of participatory evaluation for enhancing the two main pillars
   of adaptive co-management: collaboration and learning. Findings from
   interviews with workshop participants show that cooperation and
   communication among stakeholders were enhanced. However, trust only
   increased between some stakeholders, and existing conflicts were not
   resolved. The evaluation workshops became a learning space and
   stakeholders improved their skills to participate and interact with
   different actors. An important outcome was a series of operational
   agreements for the council, to overcome the weaknesses and challenges
   that the council was facing. Learning is crucial in the initial stage of
   an adaptive co-management process (and throughout it). The implications
   of the study are discussed in light of the scholarship on adaptive
   co-management, transdisciplinary research and sustainability science.},

Title = {Air Pollution Damages from Offshore Energy Production},
Journal = {ENERGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {39-60},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This analysis uses an integrated assessment model to link emissions from
   offshore oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico to impacts in the
   continental U.S. The analysis employs emission and production data for
   rigs located in the Gulf of Mexico to estimate the air pollution damages
   for the years 2000, 2005, and 2008. For platforms in the western Gulf of
   Mexico, extraction yields damage due to air pollution that average
   between \$0.31 and \$0.75 per unit of oil extracted. For platforms in
   the central Gulf of Mexico, damage due to air pollution averages between
   \$0.26 and \$0.57 per unit of oil extracted. The distribution of
   marginal social costs is right-skewed; the paper finds that in 2008 115
   platforms produce damages in excess of \$12.80 per barrel of oil.
   Optimal management of the air pollution emissions from platforms in the
   Gulf must recognize this spatial heterogeneity in damages.},

Title = {The role of nature-based infrastructure (NBI) in coastal resiliency
   planning: A literature review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {183},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1088-1098},

Abstract = {The use of nature-based infrastructure (NBI) has attracted increasing
   attention in the context of protection against coastal flooding. This
   review is focused on NBI approaches to improve coastal resilience in the
   face of extreme storm events, including hurricanes. We not only consider
   the role of NBI as a measure to protect people and property but also in
   the context of other ecological goods and services provided by tidal
   wetlands including production of fish and shellfish. Although the
   results of many studies suggest that populated areas protected by
   coastal marshes were less likely to experience damage when exposed to
   the full force of storm surge, it was absolutely critical to place the
   role of coastal wetlands into perspective by noting that while tidal
   marshes can reduce wave energy from low-to-moderate-energy storms, their
   capacity to substantially reduce storm surge remains poorly quantified.
   Moreover, although tidal marshes can reduce storm surge from fast moving
   storms, very large expanses of habitat are needed to be most effective,
   and for most urban settings, there is insufficient space to rely on
   nature based risk reduction strategies alone. The success of a given NBI
   method is also context dependent on local conditions, with,potentially
   confounding influences from substrate characteristics, topography, near
   shore bathymetry, distance from the shore and other physical factors and
   human drivers such as development patterns. Furthermore, it is important
   to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of newly developed NBI
   projects through rigorous evaluations and characterize the local
   specificities of the particular built and natural environments
   surrounding these coastal areas. In order for the relevant science to
   better inform policy, and assist in land-use challenges, scientists must
   clearly state the likelihood of success in a particular circumstance and
   set of conditions. We conclude that ``caution is advised{''} before
   selecting a particular NBI method as there is no ``one size fits all{''}
   solution to address site specific conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {High CO2 Under Nutrient Fertilization Increases Primary Production and
   Biomass in Subtropical Phytoplankton Communities: A Mesocosm Approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {The subtropical oceans are home to one of the largest ecosystems on
   Earth, contributing to nearly one third of global oceanic primary
   production. Ocean warming leads to enhanced stratification in the
   oligotrophic ocean but also intensification in cross-shore wind
   gradients and thus in eddy kinetic energy across eastern boundary
   regions of the subtropical gyres. Phytoplankton thriving in a future
   warmer oligotrophic subtropical ocean with enhanced CO2 levels could
   therefore be patchily fertilized by increased mesoscale and submesoscale
   variability inducing nutrient pumping into the surface ocean. Under this
   premise, we have tested the response of three size classes (0.2-2, 2-20,
   and >20 mu m) of subtropical phytoplankton communities in terms of
   primary production, chlorophyll and cell biomass, to increasing CO2
   concentrations and nutrient fertilization during an in situ mesocosm
   experiment in oligotrophic waters off of the island of Gran Canaria. We
   found no significant CO2-related effect on primary production and
   biomass under oligotrophic conditions (phase I). In contrast, primary
   production, chlorophyll and biomass displayed a significant and
   pronounced increase under elevated CO2 conditions in all groups after
   nutrient fertilization, both during the bloom (phase II) and post-bloom
   (phase III) conditions. Although the relative increase of primary
   production in picophytoplankton (250\%) was 2.5 higher than in
   microphytoplankton (100\%) after nutrient fertilization, comparing the
   high and low CO2 treatments, microphytoplankton dominated in terms of
   biomass, contributing >57\% to the total. These results contrast with
   similar studies conducted in temperate and cold waters, where
   consistently small phytoplankton benefitted after nutrient additions at
   high CO2, pointing to different CO2-sensitivities across plankton
   communities and ecosystem types in the ocean.},

Abstract = {With the extensive electrification introduced into the shipboard power
   systems, the navigation routine has become more important in an electric
   propulsion and solar power integrated ships since various sailing paths
   and speeds will lead to different operation performances. Unlike
   traditional navigation, which solves the shortest path problem, a
   data-driven optimization scheme is developed in this article for a
   photovoltaic (PV)-dependent navigation routing. In order to minimize the
   total cost and greenhouse gas emissions of an all-electric ship (AES), a
   new coordinated optimization framework is proposed to jointly optimize
   the energy storage system (ESS) sizing and voyage scheduling while
   considering solar power variations. Several cases are compared to verify
   the proposed method on a cargo ship, and numeral results reveal that the
   deep-learning-based forecasting method can better characterize the
   onboard solar power variations, and the proposed joint optimization
   framework can well accommodate the onboard PV generation.},

Abstract = {During recent decades, Earth system research has provided overwhelming
   evidence that climate change, with disastrous consequences, will result
   from unbridled anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. It is well
   accepted among climate scientists that these emissions, especially of
   CO2, may force the planet to warm by up to seven degrees C by the end of
   the century. During recent years, however, a second comparably dangerous
   consequence of steadily increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels has
   received growing attention, namely the acidification of the oceans. Here
   we discuss its potential effects on marine biogeochemistry and review
   the recent literature on this issue. Calcifying organisms such as
   corals, pteropods, coccolithophorides and foraminifera are among the
   species that will suffer most from unabated ocean acidification.},

Title = {Road Use Contributions to Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas
   Emissions for Two Flexible Pavement Maintenance Strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION},
Abstract = {Energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on a 10-km
   4-lane flexible pavement road were calculated for two maintenance
   strategies: conventional mill and fill treatments for strategy I and
   preventative treatments and a cold in-place recycling treatment for
   strategy II. Comparative calculations featured the road maintenance and
   use stages of a simplified life cycle assessment. The maintenance stage
   included the material production, mix manufacturing, and material
   transport that support road maintenance activities. Energy consumption
   and GHG emissions for maintenance activities were-.33 GJ/lane/km/yr
   and-.1.6 tonnes/lane/km/yr for strategy I, respectively, and-.22
   GJ/lane/km/yr and-.1.4 tonnes/ lane/km/yr for strategy II. Also
   calculated were the excess energy consumption and excess GHG emissions
   by vehicles because of road roughness, characterized by the
   international roughness index. These results were-.710 GJ/lane/km/yr and
   50 tonnes/lane/km/yr for strategy I, respectively, and-.300
   GJ/lane/km/yr and-.21 tonnes/lane/km/yr for strategy II. Preventative
   road maintenance and in-place pavement recycling have the potential for
   environmental and economic benefits to both road builders and road
   users.},

Title = {Indigenous food harvesting as social-ecological monitoring: A case study
   with the Gitga'at First Nation},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1085-1099},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Indigenous peoples have been monitoring and managing the natural
   resources in their homelands and waters for millennia. Meanwhile,
   social-ecological systems thinkers are embracing the capacity of
   Indigenous knowledge systems, which are informed by land-based
   practices, to inform adaptive management.
   2. Following the collaborative design of a community-based
   social-ecological monitoring system over two traditional seafood
   harvesting seasons, we conducted a conceptual framework analysis of
   meeting notes and interview transcripts with Gitga'at harvesters and
   knowledge holders to discern how Gitga'at people monitor their territory
   and what indicators they focus on.
   3. An interconnected set of social-ecological concepts and indicators
   emerged, evidencing an intrinsic part of Gitga'at life: Gitga'at
   harvesters closely monitor their coastal social-ecological system
   through ongoing land- and sea-based practices.
   4. The conceptual framework highlights the importance of maintaining and
   revitalizing Indigenous knowledge and harvesting practices to inform
   social-ecological monitoring and adaptive management at local and
   broader scales.
   5. Amidst discussions of marine and coastal resource co-management in
   British Columbia, our results also suggest opportunities for scientific
   approaches to situate themselves within and support existing Indigenous
   frameworks and priorities.
   6. This research also adds to the discussion on the development of
   appropriate regional and global indicators and frameworks to monitor the
   resilience of social-ecological systems.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the Anthropocene, marine ecosystems are rapidly shifting to new
   ecological states. Achieving effective conservation of marine
   biodiversity has become a fast-moving target because of both global
   climate change and continuous shifts in marine policies. How prepared
   are we to deal with this crisis? We examined EU Member States Programs
   of Measures designed for the implementation of EU marine environmental
   policies, as well as recent European Marine Spatial Plans, and
   discovered that climate change is rarely considered operationally.
   Further, our analysis revealed that monitoring programs in marine
   protected areas are often insufficient to clearly distinguish between
   impacts of local and global stressors. Finally, we suggest that while
   the novel global Blue Growth approach may jeopardize previous marine
   conservation efforts, it can also provide new conservation
   opportunities. Adaptive management is the way forward (e.g., preserving
   ecosystem functions in climate change hotspots, and identifying and
   targeting climate refugia areas for protection) using Marine Spatial
   Planning as a framework for action, especially given the push for Blue
   Growth.},

Title = {Distribution Characteristic of Soil Organic Carbon Fraction in Different
   Types of Wetland in Hongze Lake of China},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Abstract = {Soil organic carbon fractions included microbial biomass carbon (MBC),
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and labile organic carbon (LOC), which
   was investigated over a 0-20 cm depth profile in three types of wetland
   in Hongze Lake of China. Their ecoenvironmental effect and the
   relationships with soil organic carbon (SOC) were analyzed in present
   experiment. The results showed that both active and SOC contents were in
   order reduced by estuarine wetland, flood plain, and out-of-lake
   wetland. Pearson correlative analysis indicated that MBC and DOC were
   positively related to SOC. The lowest ratios of MBC and DOC to SOC in
   the estuarine wetland suggested that the turnover rate of microbial
   active carbon pool was fairly low in this kind of wetland. Our results
   showed that estuarine wetland had a strong carbon sink function, which
   played important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions; besides,
   changes of water condition might affect the accumulation and
   decomposition of organic carbon in the wetland soils.},

   should be an integral part of SMART Cities. Implementation of adaptation
   measures frequently faces numerous problems, including insufficient
   awareness of manifestations of climate change or importance of different
   measures. On an example of the urban district Brno-Novy Liskovec, the
   paper demonstrates possible approaches that play a supporting role in
   planning and implementation of adaptation measures. To promote further
   development of nature based solutions, the paper presents an economic
   assessment of existing measures, including an assessment of their
   benefits. The results indicate that the implementation of a park with a
   wetland in the densely built-up area has brought high social benefits
   greatly exceeding the costs.},

Abstract = {Livestock production impacts air and water quality, ocean health, and
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on regional to global scales and it is
   the largest use of land globally. Quantifying the environmental impacts
   of the various livestock categories, mostly arising from feed
   production, is thus a grand challenge of sustainability science. Here,
   we quantify land, irrigation water, and reactive nitrogen (Nr) impacts
   due to feed production, and recast published full life cycle GHG
   emission estimates, for each of the major animal-based categories in the
   US diet. Our calculations reveal that the environmental costs per
   consumed calorie of dairy, poultry, pork, and eggs are mutually
   comparable (to within a factor of 2), but strikingly lower than the
   impacts of beef. Beef production requires 28, 11, 5, and 6 times more
   land, irrigation water, GHG, and Nr, respectively, than the average of
   the other livestock categories. Preliminary analysis of three staple
   plant foods shows two-to sixfold lower land, GHG, and Nr requirements
   than those of the nonbeef animal-derived calories, whereas irrigation
   requirements are comparable. Our analysis is based on the best data
   currently available, but follow-up studies are necessary to improve
   parameter estimates and fill remaining knowledge gaps. Data
   imperfections notwithstanding, the key conclusion-that beef production
   demands about 1 order of magnitude more resources than alternative
   livestock categories-is robust under existing uncertainties. The study
   thus elucidates the multiple environmental benefits of potential,
   easy-to-implement dietary changes, and highlights the uniquely high
   resource demands of beef.},

Abstract = {Assessment of the global budget of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide
   (N2O) is limited by poor knowledge of the oceanic N2O flux to the
   atmosphere, of which the magnitude, spatial distribution, and temporal
   variability remain highly uncertain. Here, we reconstruct climatological
   N2O emissions from the ocean by training a supervised learning algorithm
   with over 158,000 N2O measurements from the surface ocean-the largest
   synthesis to date. The reconstruction captures observed latitudinal
   gradients and coastal hot spots of N2O flux and reveals a vigorous
   global seasonal cycle. We estimate an annual mean N2O flux of 4.2 +/-
   1.0 Tg N.y(-1), 64\% of which occurs in the tropics, and 20\% in coastal
   upwelling systems that occupy less than 3\% of the ocean area. This N2O
   flux ranges from a low of 3.3 +/- 1.3 Tg N.y(-1) in the boreal spring to
   a high of 5.5 +/- 2.0 Tg N.y(-1) in the boreal summer. Much of the
   seasonal variations in global N2O emissions can be traced to seasonal
   upwelling in the tropical ocean and winter mixing in the Southern Ocean.
   The dominant contribution to seasonality by productive, low-oxygen
   tropical upwelling systems (>75\%) suggests a sensitivity of the global
   N2O flux to El Nino-Southern Oscillation and anthropogenic
   stratification of the low latitude ocean. This ocean flux estimate is
   consistent with the range adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change, but reduces its uncertainty by more than fivefold,
   enabling more precise determination of other terms in the atmospheric
   N2O budget.},

Abstract = {Fisheries resources play a major role in the national economy and to
   food security in Solomon Islands. Climate change is likely to have a
   substantial impact on fish production that can lead to a fragile food
   security condition in the country. This paper assesses the potential
   economic impact of three important climate change adaptation strategies
   - natural resource management (NRM), fish aggregating devices (FAD) and
   aquaculture - in Solomon Islands. The study used a country-specific
   partial equilibrium economic model with six fish sub-sectors and
   analyzed potential impact of alternate climate change adaptation
   strategies for 2035 and 2050. The modeling and scenario analyses show
   that total fish demand is likely to surpass domestic fish production in
   2050. Without appropriate climate adaptation strategy, per capita
   consumption of domestically produced fish will decline, which has
   serious negative food security implications for the country. The
   economic (welfare) analysis conducted based on modeling results show
   that the national level net economic gains due to climate change
   adaptation strategies are substantial. If cost and topographic
   conditions permit, low-cost inshore FADs are expected to be a good
   mechanism for augmenting domestic supplies of tuna and similar species
   in Solomon Islands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The nutritional, economic and livelihood contributions provided by
   aquatic food systems are threatened by climate change. Building climate
   resilience requires systemic interventions that reduce social
   vulnerabilities.
   Aquatic foods from marine and freshwater systems are critical to the
   nutrition, health, livelihoods, economies and cultures of billions of
   people worldwide, but climate-related hazards may compromise their
   ability to provide these benefits. Here, we estimate national-level
   aquatic food system climate risk using an integrative food systems
   approach that connects climate hazards impacting marine and freshwater
   capture fisheries and aquaculture to their contributions to sustainable
   food system outcomes. We show that without mitigation, climate hazards
   pose high risks to nutritional, social, economic and environmental
   outcomes worldwide-especially for wild-capture fisheries in Africa,
   South and Southeast Asia, and Small Island Developing States. For
   countries projected to experience compound climate risks, reducing
   societal vulnerabilities can lower climate risk by margins similar to
   meeting Paris Agreement mitigation targets. System-level interventions
   addressing dimensions such as governance, gender equity and poverty are
   needed to enhance aquatic and terrestrial food system resilience and
   provide investments with large co-benefits towards meeting the
   Sustainable Development Goals.},

Title = {Reducing pollutant emissions from vessel maneuvering in port areas},

Abstract = {We propose an activity-based model to calculate ships' exhaust emissions
   while maneuvering in port. The exhaust emissions from the seven
   international commercial ports in Taiwan (namely Kaohsiung, Keelung,
   Taichung, Taipei, Hualien, Anping, and Suao) were calculated using
   actual data. Then, the regional ship exhaust emissions were estimated
   based on the number and size of ships and the type of fuel they used.
   Our method of predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of green port
   policies is shown to be intuitive and precise. Small vessels, which are
   the most common vessel type to enter and leave Taiwan ports, were shown
   to generate most of the emissions, but unit emissions from large vessels
   were the highest among three types of vessels (i.e., small, medium, and
   large). Moreover, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponded to sailing
   speed. Taiwan International Ports Co., Ltd (TIPC) has slightly reduced
   carbon dioxide equivalent and sulfur oxide emissions by implementing a
   green port policy, consisting of multiple ways of building a sustainable
   port environment (such as vessel speed reduction and use of low-sulfur
   oil). However, nitrogen oxide emissions have not decreased
   significantly. Our findings indicate that lower speeds and onshore power
   supply can reduce local air pollution, and assist transportation
   authorities, who should consistently monitor GHG emissions in port, to
   proactively respond to the International Maritime Organization's
   regulations for ensuring a sustainable future.},

Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Salinity generally strongly affects the solubility of carbon dioxide in
   aqueous solution. This would seem to involve a reduction of the
   efficiency of the carbonate mineralization process with the objective to
   sequester this greenhouse gas. On the contrary, we demonstrate here that
   with a more concentrated solution of magnesium chloride, the residence
   time of CO2 is enhanced in the aqueous medium because of a reduced
   tendency to produce CO2(g). Experiments intended to simulate more
   closely the Mg-rich wastewaters that are industrially available have
   been carried out using solutions differing in Mg concentration (7, 16,32
   g L-1 Mg). A comparison of the efficiency of the CO2 mineralization
   process among sets of experiments shows that the reduction of the
   efficiency, to about 65\%, was lower than that expected, as the low
   degree of CO2 degassing results in the enhanced availability of carbonic
   ions to react with Mg ions to form stable carbonate minerals over a
   longer time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate change effects in the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {46-56},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Evidences are accumulating on the long-term changes in seawater
   temperature, acidity, deoxygenation, cyclones and sea level in the Bay
   of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem. These changes have impacts on ocean
   productivity, habitats and biological processes. Distributional and
   phenological changes in fish species, and increase in frequency and
   intensity of coral bleaching are becoming evident. Fisheries,
   particularly traditional fisheries, will be the most vulnerable to
   climate change. Climate warming will also affect the inland and coastal
   aquaculture sectors of the Bay of Bengal LME countries. Impacts will
   include changes in hydrology and therefore availability of water,
   physical threats to aquaculture facilities, and prevalence or spread of
   known and new diseases of aquatic organisms. The most important and
   critical adaptation measures will be to develop human resources capacity
   to increase understanding of the marine resources, and implement
   measures to sustainably manage fisheries. Bay of Bengal Large Marine
   Ecosystem project's two main directions taken for climate change
   response are contribution to the understanding of large-scale processes
   and climate change effects on one hand, and contributions to adaptation
   by addressing habitat degradation, pollution and fisheries management,
   as well as developing capacity and resilience of coastal populations on
   the other. Recognizing that current problems in weak fisheries
   management make the sector vulnerable to climate change, BOBLME supports
   adaptation and increases resilience by strengthening fisheries
   management and providing assistance to improve fisheries assessments. By
   strengthening governance, BOBLME also contributes to the integration of
   climate change adaptation into decision-making and response initiatives,
   e.g. disaster risk management plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights

Title = {Increasing the ambition of mitigation action in small emitters: the case
   of Mauritius},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {The objective of the Paris Agreement is to constrain the global
   temperature increase to well below 2 degrees C and to pursue efforts to
   limit it to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. It is undisputed
   that the collective mitigation actions proposed by Parties are largely
   insufficient to meet this objective. All Parties are expected to revise
   their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) prior to the 26th
   Conference of the Parties (COP 26) with the aim of increasing levels of
   mitigation ambition. This paper focuses on Mauritius which has no
   climate mitigation policy and no strategy for low-carbon development. In
   this context, a number of policy issues are considered, and propositions
   are made on how the level of ambition of its updated NDC can be
   increased. For this, energy-related emissions pathways to 2050 are used
   to argue for an equity-based, effort-sharing approach to CO2 emissions
   reductions by capitalizing on a developing country's ability to propose
   a combination of unconditional and conditional mitigation contributions.
   Such a proactive approach will place Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS) and developing countries in a better position to justify and
   attract technology transfer, capacity building and climate finance.
   Further, the energy-climate mitigation nexus is examined to highlight
   the co-benefits of increasing mitigation ambition. It is shown that, all
   else being equal, increasing the percentage share of renewables in the
   electricity mix is necessary but not sufficient for increasing the
   ambition of mitigation contributions. The insights in this paper are
   expected to be valuable for other SIDS and small developing countries.
   Key policy insights
   A multi-criteria approach is more appropriate for assessing the level of
   ambition of SIDS and other small emitters than absolute share of global
   emissions or the percentage share of renewable energies in the energy
   mix.
   Based on this approach, the climate change mitigation policy orientation
   of Mauritius is not ambitious.
   As Mauritius updates its NDC, it should apply a systemic approach to
   investigate emission reduction scenarios across sectors and covering
   time horizons up to at least 2050, in order to better link national
   climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals.},

Abstract = {We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate,
   examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in
   lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is
   likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes
   as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of
   lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent
   of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates
   that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to
   the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by
   the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water
   sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The
   role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may
   be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments,
   which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large
   amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also
   expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here
   indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of
   the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has
   significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will
   continue to change in response to future climate change causing
   decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases
   in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Globally, sea-level rise is expected to impact on many coastal regions
   and settlements. While mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions
   remains an important task, adaptation is now seen as a critical
   component of the policy equation. Local government is a key player in
   adaptation planning and managing risk through their mandated role in
   land use planning and development control. Yet, managing the predicted
   impacts of climate change is proving to be a complex and difficult task
   for planners and policy makers. This paper reports on a case of local
   government deliberation on possible planning responses to address future
   sea-level rise impacts in New South Wales, Australia. Using structured,
   expert opinion of planners and other technical experts engaged in a
   collaborative network in the Sydney region, we explore the feasibility
   of implementing planning and policy measures at the local and regional
   scales to respond to inundation risk as a result of sea-level rise and

Title = {Aquaculture drastically increases methane production by favoring
   acetoclastic rather than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in shrimp pond
   sediments},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {563},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Emissions of methane (CH4), a major greenhouse gas, should be cut by at
   least 30\% by 2030 according to the last Conference of the Parties,
   CoP26. Aquaculture pond is a major CH4 emitter, yet the microbial
   mechanisms ruling methanogenesis by degradation of organic matter in
   sediments remain unclear. In particular, the respective roles of
   hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis, and the impact of
   aquaculture farming practices are unknown. We studied methanogenesis in
   the surface sediments from a freshwater and an oligohaline pond before,
   during, and after shrimp farming. Hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic
   contributions were distinguished by acetoclastic inhibition with
   methylfluoride (CH3F), and by C-13-analysis of CO2 and CH4. We also
   monitored the methanogenic community structure, dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) levels, carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios, and humification indices
   derived from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results reveal
   that aquaculture farming practices increased methanogenesis rates, and
   these increases were explained by higher levels of DOC and lower C/N
   ratios during farming. Of the total methane produced, 51\%-78\% was by
   hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. However, the total methane contribution
   from acetoclastic methanogenesis increased from approximately 22\%
   before farming to approximately 45\% during and after farming, with a
   decreasing isotope fractionation factor alpha c and an increasing
   relative abundance of Methanosaeta acetoclastic methanogen. All
   hu-mification indices decreased during and after farming compared to
   before farming due to the input of polysaccharide-rich aquafeed. The
   close relationship between the humification indices and methanogenesis
   pathways indicates that the changes in sediment substrate quality drove
   the variation in the methanogenesis pathways. Increases in salinity
   decreased the methanogenesis rates but did not change the methanogenesis
   pathways. Overall, our findings reveal that aquaculture farming
   practices increase methanogenesis rates and favor acetoclastic over
   hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and that adjusting shrimp diets,
   increasing salinity, and removing residual aquafeed could reduce
   methanogenesis.},

Title = {Importance of Protection Service Against Erosion and Storm Events
   Provided by Coastal Ecosystems Under Climate Change Scenarios},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Increasing sea level rise (SLR), and frequency and intensity of storms,
   paired with degrading ecosystems, are exposing coastal areas to higher
   risks of damage by storm events. Coastal natural habitats, such as dunes
   or saltmarshes, can reduce exposure of coastlines to these events and
   help to reduce the impacts and the potential damage to coastal property.
   The goal of our study was to evaluate the current vulnerability of the
   Portuguese northern coast to erosion and flooding caused by extreme
   events and to assess the contribution of natural habitats in reducing
   both vulnerability and property damages considering SLR scenarios. The
   Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs (InVEST)
   Coastal Vulnerability model was used to produce an Exposure Index (EI)
   for the northern Portuguese coastline, for the current situation, and
   for future International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5,
   considering the presence and absence of coastal habitats. Results showed
   an increase in exposure with rising sea levels and expansion of high
   vulnerability areas. Coastal habitats contributed to a 28\% reduction of
   high exposed segments for the Current scenario, corresponding to a
   potential reduction of coastal property damage of 105 Meuro during
   extreme events. For the SLR scenarios, coastal habitats could
   potentially reduce the amount of property damage by 190 Meuro in 2050
   and 285 Meuro in 2100, considering RCP8.5 projections. This study
   highlighted the importance of natural habitats in protecting vulnerable
   coastlines and reducing the potential damages to properties from
   flooding. Such results can be incorporated in management plans and
   support decision-making toward implementing an ecosystem-based approach
   to increase the resilience of coastal communities to cope with future
   environmental changes.</p>},

Abstract = {The process of assessing vulnerability in agriculture, water resources,
   marine and terrestrial ecosystems and coastal zone management due to
   climate change requires construction of predicted vision of climate
   scenarios under physically reasonable assumptions of greenhouse gas
   levels. In and and hot climatic conditions, even minor climatic changes
   will have significant impact on survival of plant species, wild animals,
   and other desert ecosystems as well as on human health. The paper
   presents future changes in temperature, precipitation and humidity in
   Yemen, Oman, UAE and Qatar under different scenarios using IPCC database
   derived through GCM's. Various climatic change scenarios developed by
   IPCC were reviewed, A2 and B2 climatic scenarios were selected for the
   study. Long-term simulated records derived by the following models were
   retrieved from the database:
   1. Hadley Model -(HADCM3) 2. Canadian Climatic Model - (CGCM2) 3.
   National Center for Atmospheric Research Model - (NCAR-PCM)
   Using 1970-2000 values as baseline, variations in 2020-2050 and
   2070-2099 were estimated and statistically analyzed to determine
   uncertainties in prediction.
   Summarized impacts of climate change on human health based on empirical
   approach for the region is presented in the paper to make it better
   prepared (adapted) to the climatic changes with recommendations on
   future capacity building in modeling and data collection.},

Title = {Microseepage in drylands: Flux and implications in the global
   atmospheric source/sink budget of methane},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {72},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {265-274},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Drylands are considered a net sink for atmospheric methane and a main
   item of the global inventories of the greenhouse gas budget. It is
   outlined here, however, that a significant portion of drylands occur
   over sedimentary basins hosting natural gas and oil reservoirs, where
   gas migration to the surface takes place, producing positive fluxes of
   methane into the atmosphere. New field surveys, in different
   hydrocarbon-prone basins, confirm that microseepage, enhanced by faults
   and fractures in the rocks, overcomes the methanotrophic consumption
   occurring in dry soil throughout large areas, especially in the winter
   season. Fluxes of a few units to some tens of mg m(-2) day(-1) are
   frequent over oil-gas fields, whose global extent is estimated at
   3.5-4.2 million km(2); higher fluxes (>50 mg m(-2) day(-1)) are
   primarily, but not exclusively, found in basins characterized by
   macro-seeps. Microseepage may however potentially exist over a wider
   area (similar to 8 million km(2), i.e. 15\% of global drylands),
   including the Total Petroleum Systems, coal measures and portions of
   sedimentary basins that have experienced thermogenesis. Based on a
   relatively large and geographically dispersed data-set (563
   measurements) from different hydrocarbon-prone basins in USA and Europe,
   upscaling suggests that global microseepage emission exceeding 10 Tg
   year(-1) is very likely. Microseepage is then only one component of a
   wider class of geological sources, including mud volcanoes, seeps,
   geothermal and marine seepage, which cannot be ignored in the
   atmospheric methane budget. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The legacy of historical and the long-term impacts of 21st century
   greenhouse gas emissions on climate, ocean acidification, and
   carbon-climate feedbacks are investigated with a coupled carbon
   cycle-climate model. Emission commitment scenarios with zero emissions
   after year 2100 and 21st century emissions of 1,800, 900, and 0 gigatons
   of carbon are run up to year 2500. The reversibility and irreversibility
   of impacts is quantified by comparing anthropogenically-forced regional
   changes with internal, unforced climate variability. We show that the
   influence of historical emissions and of non-CO2 agents is largely
   reversible on the regional scale. Forced changes in surface temperature
   and precipitation become smaller than internal variability for most land
   and ocean grid cells in the absence of future carbon emissions. In
   contrast, continued carbon emissions over the 21st century cause
   irreversible climate change on centennial to millennial timescales in
   most regions and impacts related to ocean acidification and sea level
   rise continue to aggravate for centuries even if emissions are stopped
   in year 2100. Undersaturation of the Arctic surface ocean with respect
   to aragonite, a mineral form of calcium carbonate secreted by marine
   organisms, is imminent and remains widespread. The volume of
   supersaturated water providing habitat to calcifying organisms is
   reduced from preindustrial 40 to 25\% in 2100 and to 10\% in 2300 for
   the high emission case. We conclude that emission trading schemes,
   related to the Kyoto Process, should not permit trading between
   emissions of relatively short-lived agents and CO2 given the
   irreversible impacts of anthropogenic carbon emissions.},

   reservoir's response to the injection of 60,000 t of CO2 over a period
   of two years under realistic reservoir conditions. This helps to explore
   possible environmental impacts of a future CO2 sequestration test
   project for the study area. We focus mainly on fluid and mass
   transports. The results show that the pore overpressure does not exceed
   a level considered critical for the creation of hydraulic fractures. Our
   study also indicates how the amount and extent of salt precipitation
   near the injection well may be altered by variations in relative
   permeability and capillary pressure. We show that the temperature and
   strata inclination's effects are marginal. Further, results indicate a
   great potential for reactions between CO2, water, and rock. In summary,
   this numerical simulation addresses both transport and precipitation of
   salt dissolved in the fluid. Therefore, it provides both a better
   understanding of the fate of the CO2 plume in a reservoir in time and
   guidance for practical decisions.},

Abstract = {This study examines the impacts of the reduction in the network of
   private kill abattoirs on the delivery of public goods supported under
   the redesigned UK agriculture policy. An online survey was used to
   gather information about farmers selection and use of abattoirs, and a
   telephone survey of abattoir owners and managers complemented the farmer
   survey. Of the 300 respondents, 185 used abattoirs for private kill
   retail (PKR) services. 121 of these PKR farmers (65.4\%) reported their
   PKR business as ``essential{''} ``or ``very important{''} to the
   viability of their farm business. Seventy-five (41\%) had no alternative
   abattoir, 21 of these 75 would have to close their PKR business if the
   abattoir they currently used closed, 22.7\% would reduce their grassland
   area, releasing greenhouse gases, and 30\% would stop farming native
   breeds, reducing the gene pool and conservation grazing environmental
   management options. 110 PKR farmers did have a viable alternative
   abattoir, but using it would increase livestock journeys, increasing
   greenhouse gas emissions and making it more likely farmers would need to
   use commercial rather than farm transport, further jeopardising animal
   welfare and biosecurity. Therefore, the continuing closure of private
   kill services threatens core government policy objectives. However,
   private kill services could be supported by government grant schemes,
   resolving confusion regarding food labelling, and reducing small
   abattoir costs by introducing ``de minimis{''} derogation - as currently
   used on some Channel Island and mainland Europe abattoirs.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spanish government
   declared a State of Emergency, and domestic passenger ship traffic was
   restricted in Spanish ports. This manuscript presents scenarios of
   emissions from domestic shipping traffic in the seas of the Strait of
   Gibraltar (Spain) over three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emissions
   were estimated for only 90 days of the pandemic, and two scenarios were
   studied: emissions while vessels were berthed at the Algeciras Port and
   emissions as a consequence of the interruption of passenger ship
   transportation in the Strait of Gibraltar. To this end, the authors' own
   model was used, which has near zero uncertainties. This model was used
   for the first time in this study and takes into account both
   meteorological and sea condition parameters, as well as the efficiency
   of the propulsion system. The manuscript concentrates on the emissions
   of greenhouse gases (GHGs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx),
   carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter (PM) from six Ro-Pax ships
   that ceased to operate. The main finding is that as a consequence of the
   pandemic, reductions of up to 12\% were found in the Strait of Gibraltar
   in all the pollutants and GHGs when taking into account all
   international traffic, while the decrease in emissions from domestic
   traffic only reached 51\%.},

Abstract = {currently, lots of research have revealed the great potentials of the
   land-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) system on the control of the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. But when it comes to the shipboard
   applications, the CCS integration becomes rather complicated since very
   limited operating conditions onboard, especially for the shortage of
   power supply. Nowadays, the all-electric ship (AES), which uses
   electricity to meet both the propulsion and service loads, has become a
   trend for future ship designing due to higher efficiency and
   flexibility, as well as providing a better platform for CCS integration
   and paving a new way for maritime GHG emission control. To address the
   power shortage issue led by the CCS integration, this paper first
   incorporates the demand-side management on the propulsion load and a
   corresponding joint generation and demand-side management model is
   proposed. The mathematical model is formulated as a bi-level
   optimization after certain constraint decomposition and solved by the
   column and constraint generation algorithm. Extensive simulations
   demonstrate that, the proposed method is able to relieve the power
   shortage issue of shipboard CCS, and the corresponding carbon capture
   level increases from 86\% to 93\%.},

Abstract = {Mangrove species are undergoing environmental changes from nutrient-poor
   to enrichment due to the large nutrient input. The potential difference
   in adaptive strategies between the slow- and fast-growing species may
   lead to great changes in species interaction and ecosystem stability.
   This study aims to test whether the slow-growing species Aegiceras
   corniculatum (L.) Blanco and Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu \& Yong sp.
   nov. are distinctly different from a fast-growing species Laguncularia
   racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f. in response to soil nutrient enrichment. With
   the increase of soil nutrients, L. racemosa shifted from a more
   conservative to a more acquisitive strategy. The potential causes
   included the increases in specific leaf area, nutrient resorption
   efficiency, and photosynthetic capacity as indicated by the increase of
   leaf delta C-13 and unchanged leaf succulence, as well as the relocation
   of photosynthetic products as indicated by the shift toward fast-growing
   at the cost of constructive and defense compounds. In contrast, A.
   corniculatum and K. obovata maintained conservative strategies at any
   soil nutrient levels with only a slight increase in growth. These
   findings implied that L. racemosa will be more competitive over the
   slow-growing species in nutrient-rich soils through altering adaptive
   strategies.},

Title = {On the potential of building adaptation measures to counterbalance the
   impact of climatic change in the tropics},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {229},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most significant environmental issues
   facing communities, while poor construction and absence of effective
   air-conditioning (AC) predominantly cause indoor overheating. Although
   AC may help meeting indoor comfort, it increases the vulnerability of
   low-income residents, triggers large energy consumption, and generates
   anthropogenic heat, which worsens heat stress out-door. The capacity of
   buildings to maintain comfortable thermal conditions without mechanical
   cooling is the key factor protecting occupants against the rising
   temperature. Residents of Darwin, Australia, will be largely affected by
   increasing temperature where the annual peak ambient temperature may
   increase by 7.4 degrees C in 2060, while the number of hours above 30
   degrees C will rise by 70\%. Based on regional climate modelling for the
   Australian area and using a building energy simulation platform, we
   computed that by 2060 the indoor air temperature in a typical
   residential building may exceed 30 degrees C for over 4000 h under
   free-floating condition, with a peak daytime and night-time temperatures
   of 39 degrees C and 36.5 degrees C, respectively. The sensible thermal
   energy need for cooling per unit area under thermostatically controlled
   condition will increase from the current level of 110.7 kWh/m 2 to 196.8
   kWh/m(2) in 2060. Different adaptation techniques when applied to the
   typical residential building yield to the peak indoor air temperature
   drop by 3.3-12 degrees C, and cooling energy needs reductions by
   23.5-195.3 kWh/m(2) (12-99.7\%) for low, medium, and high retrofit
   buildings compared to the typical residential building in 2060. Our
   study indicates that improved building quality is necessary to enhance
   survivability and energy efficiency in Darwin considering the role of
   building adaptation measures to counterbalance the impacts of global
   warming. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Nature-Based Solutions in Coastal and Estuarine Areas of Europe},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Momentum for sustainable and climate resilience solutions for coastal
   protection are growing globally given the pressing need to prevent
   further loss of biodiversity and ecosystems while meeting the climate
   change adaptation and mitigation goals. Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)
   represent an opportunity to align environmental and resilience goals, at
   a time of strained budgets in a global context and when short-term needs
   may run counter to long-term goals. In Europe, NbS fit the mandates of
   major EU environmental and climate change policies by restoring
   biodiversity and enhancing climate-resilience and carbon sequestration.
   Previous studies have compiled scientific evidence about
   hydro-meteorological hazards for the use of NbS. However, their
   implementation at scale is still lacking. As the knowledge and
   experience with NbS for adaptation to natural hazards and climate change
   increases, it becomes more important to draw lessons learned and
   insights for replicating and scaling up NbS, especially in coastal areas
   where their implementation is still limited compared to other
   environments. This study analyzed NbS case studies across European
   coastal and estuarine areas to draw key lessons, understand better the
   current status of implementation, and identify key challenges and gaps.
   From a total of 59 NbS case studies associated with flooding, erosion
   and biodiversity loss, results show an increase in NbS implementation
   since 1990s, but most rapidly between 2005 and 2015. Most of the case
   studies are hybrid solutions employing wetlands, predominantly located
   in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands. Funding of NbS is
   largely from public sources, and rarely come from a single or a private
   source. Three-quarters of the case studies reported monitoring
   activities, but more than half did not disclose quantitative results
   related to effectiveness against flooding and/or erosion. The need to
   improve coastal defenses was indicated as the main motivation for NbS
   implementation over traditional structures, while sustainability was the
   most mentioned additional reason. Although a variety of co-benefits and
   lessons learned was identified, clearer descriptions and enhanced
   details of such information are required. There is a need for tools and
   strategies to expand knowledge sharing of lessons learned to enable
   further replication of successful cases in other areas.},

Abstract = {Soil health is essential and irreplaceable for plant growth and global
   food production, which has been threatened by climate change and soil
   degradation. Degraded coastal soils are urgently required to reclaim
   using new sustainable technologies. Interest in applying biochar to
   improve soil health and promote crop yield has rapidly increased because
   of its multiple benefits. However, effects of biochar addition on the
   saline-sodic coastal soil health and halophyte growth were poorly
   understood. Response of two halophytes, Sesbania (Sesbania cannabina)
   and Seashore mallow (Kosteletzkya virginica), to the individual or
   co-application of biochar and inorganic fertilizer into a coastal soil
   was investigated using a 52 d pot experiment. The biochar alone or
   co-application stimulated the plant growth (germination, root
   development, and biomass), primarily attributed to the enhanced nutrient
   availability from the biochar-improved soil health. Additionally, the
   promoted microbial activities and bacterial community shift towards the
   beneficial taxa (e.g. Pseudomonas and Bacillus) in the rhizosphere also
   contributed to the enhanced plant growth and biomass. Our findings
   showed the promising significance because biochar added at an optimal
   level (<= 5\%) could be a feasible option to reclaim the degraded
   coastal soil, enhance plant growth and production, and increase soil
   health and food security.},

Title = {Combined effects of global climate change and nutrient enrichment on the
   physiology of three temperate maerl species},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {24},
Pages = {13787-13807},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Made up of calcareous coralline algae, maerl beds play a major role as
   ecosystem engineers in coastal areas throughout the world. They undergo
   strong anthropogenic pressures, which may threaten their survival. The
   aim of this study was to gain insight into the future of maerl beds in
   the context of global and local changes. We examined the effects of
   rising temperatures (+3 degrees C) and ocean acidification (-0.3 pH
   units) according to temperature and pH projections (i.e., the RCP 8.5
   scenario), and nutrient (N and P) availability on three temperate maerl
   species (Lithothamnion corallioides, Phymatolithon calcareum, and
   Lithophyllum incrustans) in the laboratory in winter and summer
   conditions. Physiological rates of primary production, respiration, and
   calcification were measured on all three species in each treatment and
   season. The physiological response of maerl to global climate change was
   species-specific and influenced by seawater nutrient concentrations.
   Future temperature-pH scenario enhanced maximal gross primary production
   rates in P. calcareum in winter and in L. corallioides in both seasons.
   Nevertheless, both species suffered an impairment of light harvesting
   and photoprotective mechanisms in winter. Calcification rates at ambient
   light intensity were negatively affected by the future temperature-pH
   scenario in winter, with net dissolution observed in the dark in L.
   corallioides and P. calcareum under low nutrient concentrations.
   Nutrient enrichment avoided dissolution under future scenarios in winter
   and had a positive effect on L. incrustans calcification rate in the
   dark in summer. In winter conditions, maximal calcification rates were
   enhanced by the future temperature-pH scenario on the three species, but
   P. calcareum suffered inhibition at high irradiances. In summer
   conditions, the maximal calcification rate dropped in L. corallioides
   under the future global climate change scenario, with a potential
   negative impact on CaCO3 budget for maerl beds in the Bay of Brest where
   this species is dominant. Our results highlight how local changes in
   nutrient availability or irradiance levels impact the response of maerl
   species to global climate change and thus point out how it is important
   to consider other abiotic parameters in order to develop management
   policies capable to increase the resilience of maerl beds under the
   future global climate change scenario.},

Title = {Nutrient enrichment shifts mangrove height distribution: Implications
   for coastal woody encroachment},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Global changes, such as increased temperatures and elevated CO2, are
   driving shifts in plant species distribution and dominance, like woody
   plant encroachment into grasslands. Local factors within these ecotones
   can influence the rate of regime shifts. Woody encroachment is occurring
   worldwide, though there has been limited research within coastal
   systems, where mangrove (woody shrub/tree) stands are expanding into
   salt marsh areas. Because coastal systems are exposed to various degrees
   of nutrient input, we investigated how nutrient enrichment may locally
   impact mangrove stand expansion and salt marsh displacement over time.
   We fertilized naturally co-occurring Avicennia germinans (black
   mangrove) and Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) stands in Port
   Aransas, TX, an area experiencing mangrove encroachment within the
   Northern Gulf of Mexico mangrove-marsh ecotone. After four growing
   seasons (2010 +/- 2013) of continuous fertilization, Avicennia was more
   positively influenced by nutrient enrichment than Spartina. Most
   notably, fertilized plots had a higher density of taller (> 0.5 m)
   mangroves and mangrove maximum height was 46\% taller than in control
   plots. Fertilization may promote an increase in mangrove stand expansion
   within the mangrove-marsh ecotone by shifting Avicennia height
   distribution. Avicennia individuals, which reach certain
   species-specific height thresholds, have reduced negative neighbor
   effects and have higher resilience to freezing temperatures, which may
   increase mangrove competitive advantage over marsh grass. Therefore, we
   propose that nutrient enrichment, which augments mangrove height, could
   act locally as a positive feedback to mangrove encroachment, by reducing
   mangrove growth suppression factors, thereby accelerating the rates of
   increased mangrove coverage and subsequent marsh displacement. Areas
   within the mangrove-marsh ecotone with high anthropogenic nutrient input
   may be at increased risk of a regime shift from grass to woody dominated
   ecosystems.},

Title = {The Implications of Coastal Protection and Development on Surfing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {427-434},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The impact of coastal protection on surfing resources is poorly
   understood and rarely quantified prior to construction. There is an
   increased requirement for surfing resources worldwide as participation
   levels in the sport grow. There is also an increased requirement for
   coastal protection as the occupancy in the coastal zone increases. This
   research paper takes the first steps towards a schematic categorization
   of the effect of coastal protection on surfing resources. To do this, we
   sourced the data through the global network of Surfrider Foundations via
   questionnaires. These: questionnaires enquired about wave quality, crowd
   levels, stakeholder participation, and the economic importance of
   surfing to the local area before and after the construction of coastal
   protection.
   The results show that of the 30 surfing resources surveyed, 18
   experienced a reduction in wave quality and 12 showed an enhancement, or
   no change, in wave quality.
   The paper provides an explanation of the results by proposing mechanisms
   of enhancement and reduction of wave quality after the construction of
   coastal protection. The conclusion states that coastal protection
   usually has an effect on the surfing resource that may be positive or
   negative in terms of the outcome on wave quality and crowd levels.},

Abstract = {This paper brings, as an element of novelty and originality, a strategic
   feasibility study, in the form of a logical analysis related to the
   proposed objective, with particularization to the area of the EFTA plus
   the UK and Ireland. We tried to achieve an overall picture of a
   sustainable and prudent transition at the macroeconomic level, but also
   at the microeconomic and local levels, with specific values of
   ecological and energy-smart villages/towns. The convergent actions of
   the signatory states of the climate treaty COP-26/2021-Glasgow, UK are
   to improve the logistics and financing of the large-scale replacement of
   fossil fuels used in the economy and lives of human society. Various
   strategies have been discussed to address the energy mixes that could be
   used in the transition phase in stages and combined-cycle natural-gas
   plants, conditioned by the implementation of CCUS technology. The
   preliminary stage will focus on the provision and implementation of
   modern technologies for the production of electricity in photovoltaic
   and wind power. Starting with the 2030s, the industrialized production
   of blue and green hydrogen is expected; the first is expected to be
   obtained from the chemical synthesis of natural gas with the separation
   and storage of residual carbon from chemical reactions, and the second
   directly from ocean water through the phenomenon of H2O electrolysis. As
   a basic legislative element, the strategy aims to refine the idea of a
   carbon tax at the border or at the user, in order to discourage the use
   of fossil fuels.},

Title = {Use of SF(5)CF(3) for ocean tracer release experiments},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {SF(6) tracer release experiments (TREs) have provided fundamental
   insights in many areas of Oceanography. Recently, SF(6) has emerged as a
   powerful transient tracer, generating a need for an alternative tracer
   for large-scale ocean TREs. SF(5)CF(3) has the potential to replace
   SF(6) in TREs, due to similarities in their properties and behavior, as
   well as techniques for injection, sampling, and analysis. The
   suitability of SF(5)CF(3) for TREs was examined in Santa Monica Basin,
   off the coast of Southern California. In January 2005, a mixture of ca.
   10 mol of both SF(6) and SF(5)CF(3) was injected on an isopycnal surface
   near 800 m depth. Over the next 23 months, concentrations of the two
   tracers mirrored each other very closely, indicating that SF(5)CF(3) is
   a viable replacement for SF(6) in ocean TREs. The mixing parameters
   inferred from the experiment confirmed the results from an earlier SF(6)
   TRE in the Santa Monica Basin.},

Title = {Decarbonizing bulk shipping combining ship design and alternative power},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {266},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The Sixth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) stresses the urgency to rapidly reduce global Greenhouse
   Gas (GHG) emissions to contain global warming. The main focus in the
   design of bulk vessels for several decades has been maximizing
   cargo-carrying capacity at the lowest build cost. Reduction in energy
   consumption and emissions, if achieved at all, was heavily limited by
   the main design focus. This paper decarbonizes bulk shipping by
   combining ship design and alternative power. The results indicate:
   First, building more slender bulk vessels that are powered with
   wind-assisted propulsion reduces fuel con-sumption and GHG emissions by
   around 25\% at an abatement cost of less than Zero, i.e., free of
   charge; Second, when combining slender hull and wind-assisted propulsion
   with Zero-carbon fuels, a 100\% GHG reduction comes at an abatement cost
   of 328 USD per ton of CO2, which is still significantly less than the
   459 USD per ton of CO2 with Zero-carbon fuels only.},

Title = {Large increase in CH4 emission following conversion of coastal marsh to
   aquaculture ponds caused by changing gas transport pathways},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Methane emissions from aquatic ecosystems play an important role in
   global carbon cycle and climate change. Reclamation of coastal wetlands
   for aquaculture use has been shown to have opposite effects on sediment
   CH4 production potential and CH4 emission flux, but the underlying
   mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we compared sediment
   properties, CH4 production potential, emission flux, and CH4 transport
   pathways between a brackish marsh and the nearby reclaimed aquaculture
   ponds in the Min River Estuary in southeastern China. Despite that the
   sediment CH4 production potential in the ponds was significantly lower
   than the marsh, CH4 emission flux in the ponds (17.4 +/- 2.7 mg m(-2)
   h(-1)) was 11.9 times higher than the marsh (1.3 +/- 0.2 mg m(-2)
   h(-1)). Plant-mediated transport accounted for 75\% of the total CH4
   emission in the marsh, whereas ebullition accounted for 95\% of the
   total CH4 emission in the ponds. CH4 emission fluxes in both habitat
   types were highest in the summer. These results suggest that the
   increase in CH4 emission following the conversion of brackish marsh to
   aquaculture ponds was not caused by increased sediment CH4 production,
   but rather by eliminating rhizospheric oxidation and shifting the major
   transport pathway to ebullition, allowing sediment CH4 to bypass
   oxidative loss. This study improves our understanding of the impacts of
   modification of coastal wetlands on greenhouse gas dynamics.},

Title = {Seaweed farms provide refugia from ocean acidification},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {776},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Seaweed farming has been proposed as a strategy for adaptation to ocean
   acidification, but evidence is largely lacking. Changes of pH and carbon
   system parameters in surface waters of three seaweed farms along a
   latitudinal range in China were compared, on the weeks preceding
   harvesting, with those of the surrounding seawaters. Results confirmed
   that seaweed farming is efficient in buffering acidification, with
   Saccharina japonica showing the highest capacity of 0.10 pH increase
   within the aquaculture area, followed by Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis
   (Delta pH = 0.04) and Porphyra haitanensis (Delta pH = 0.03). The ranges
   of pH variability within seaweed farms spanned 0.14-0.30 unit during the
   monitoring, showing intense fluctuations which may also help marine
   organisms adapt to enhanced pH temporal variations in the future ocean.
   Deficit in pCO(2) in waters in seaweed farms relative to control waters
   averaged 58.7 +/- 15.9 mu atm, ranging from 27.3 to 113.9 mu atm across
   farms. However, Delta pH did not significantly differ between day and
   night. Dissolved oxygen and Omega(arag) were also elevated in surface
   waters at all seaweed farms, which are benefit for the survival of
   calcifying organisms. Seaweed farming, which unlike natural seaweed
   forests, is scalable and is not dependent on suitable substrate or light
   availability, could serve as a low-cost adaptation strategy to ocean
   acidification and deoxygenation and provide important refugia from ocean
   acidification. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Care practices in Aotearoa New Zealand},

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Coastal protection measures are intended to stabilize the boundaries of
   land and sea-and of private property. But structural engineering
   solutions, such as seawalls, have negative side-effects in terms of
   environmental and climate justice: they cause erosion of adjacent areas,
   they limit public access, and they can lead to the loss of sandy
   beaches. So-called ``soft{''} coastal protection approaches promise more
   sustainable and just alternatives. The article explores the role of the
   more-than-human in such practices. Arguing that the popular framing of
   coastal protection as ``working with nature{''} is a strategic
   naturalization, the paper aims to develop a more-than-human take on the
   political ecology of coastal protection. The empirical basis is built
   from ethnographic material on volunteer dune restoration by Coast Care
   groups in Aotearoa New Zealand. The analysis shows that the
   ``multispecies agencies{''} (Locke, 2013) at work in various practices
   associated with Coast Care include communities of plants and animals,
   human care work and artefacts, as well as abiotic elements such as sand,
   wind, water and concrete. The article argues that to foster political
   and practical engagements for more sustainable coastal naturecultures,
   these entanglements should be made explicit and accountable. A
   more-than-human political ecology approach to understand the promises of
   soft coastal protection therefore combines three analytic sensibilities.
   Firstly, it looks at the ontological politics and categorization
   practices that define and enact specific versions of coastal nature.
   Secondly, it focuses on the politics of care in multispecies worlds,
   including the abiotic. And thirdly, it takes into account the ``ordinary
   politics{''} of contested coastal space, decision-making and planning.},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion is a complex problem, mainly in terms of its effects and
   management strategies. Based on the increasing coastal erosion problem,
   it is crucial to ensure shore protection, considering all stakeholders'
   perspectives. This research investigates users' preferences for various
   options to deal with costal erosion, through a discrete choice
   experiment, and concludes that the respondents prefer some interventions
   to mitigate the problem than no action, and prefer lighter intervention
   (palisades, gangways) to heavy infrastructures (rockfills, seawalls,
   groynes). Moreover, the results show the presence of preference
   heterogeneity and thus the need to use more flexible and complex models.
   Based on the results obtained it is possible to drive some policy
   implications. First, the do-nothing option is not viable from the
   population standpoint; second, although some time of coastal erosion
   protection is demanded by the general population, the preferred approach
   is for light forms, contrary to the policy adopted in the last century,
   and that which still characterizes most existent coastal defense
   infrastructures. Lastly, there is considerable heterogeneity in
   respondents' preferences, demanding careful consideration of the welfare
   impact of coastal interventions on population segments.},

Abstract = {The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature
   of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years.
   Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was
   smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved.
   Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases
   in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a
   deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record
   for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the
   data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between
   740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced
   warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of
   each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to
   interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago ( Termination V)
   resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms
   of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but
   there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The
   interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long -
   28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far
   in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this
   earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human
   intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well
   into the future.},

Abstract = {Canada's Action Plan is the federal response to its international
   obligation under the UN Framework Convention of 1992 whereby Canada must
   reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2000.
   The Plan is failing completely, because of its essentially voluntary
   nature. Overall, greenhouse gas emissions will have increased 13 per
   cent in Canada between 1990 and 2000, four per cent more than the
   population increase for that period. Five other plans studied by
   government agencies are projected to fail to achieve the called-for
   reductions in emission. An analogous plan, the Rational Energy Plan,
   developed by a network of nongovernment organizations, is projected to
   enable the federal government to achieve its obligations under the
   Framework Convention and also its further obligations under the 1995
   Berlin Mandate. This Plan has been analyzed using the government's own
   analytical tools which project that it will offer Canada substantial
   annual increases in employment for at least ten years, more prosperous
   households for more than ten years, and a smaller federal deficit for at
   least eight years. The federal government has no viable alternative to
   adopting this plan as soon as practicable. This paper explains some of
   the needed preliminaries to introducing the Plan, together with examples
   of tax-shifting and of easily implemented stick-and-carrot inducements
   to making the Plan work in a sea of partly hostile provinces (Alberta,
   Saskatchewan, Ontario and Newfoundland). The Plan will not be easy to
   implement because of necessary changes in human habits of thinking and
   attitudes. A new and simple strategy for reducing fuel wastage on
   highways is introduced in this paper; and also the concept of extended
   cogeneration, the Rational Energy Plan itself being a particularly fine
   example.},

Abstract = {Insular power systems are characterized by their isolated geographical
   location, which makes their interconnection with other power systems a
   challenging task. Moreover, these islands have important renewable
   resources that allow the reduction of generation costs and greenhouse
   gas emissions (GHE). To guaranty the quality, flexibility and robustness
   of the electrical framework, the representation of renewable power
   forecasting error by scenario generation or even the implementation of
   demand response tools have been adopted. In this paper, the failure
   events of a specific unit are considered according to its capacity.
   Then, using the forced outage rate, the probability of each failure
   event is computed. Results of energy not supplied and fuel consumption
   cost are determined by applying probabilistic concepts, while the final
   results are obtained by fitting and evaluating a nonlinear trend line
   carried out using the previous results, resulting in a proficient
   computational tool compared with classical ones.},

Abstract = {Climate change (CC) may have substantial impacts on the distribution of
   current tourist flows by changing patterns of seasonal volumes of
   tourist demand. Such impacts are of potential importance for the Spanish
   coastal tourism destinations. In a context where the implementation of
   adaptation measures becomes relevant to counteract the expected
   CC-induced travel market share losses, this paper examines the role of
   preference analysis in the design of CC adaptation policies. Using data
   from the 2005 Familitur Survey on summer domestic tourist flows, a
   destination choice model is implemented to: I) highlight the role of
   temperature and its relationship with other destination-specific
   attributes, 2) estimate CC-induced changes in travel market shares, and
   3) compute the economic value tourists assign to a set of destination
   assets as a way to better permit the recovery the expected market share
   losses by regional tourism authorities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This article presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of electricity
   generated by the European pressurized reactor (EPR), a Generation III
   (Gen III) nuclear reactor concept. The focus of the LCA is on the
   potential locations in Switzerland and France in the year 2030.
   Environmental burdens from the EPR are also compared to those from
   current pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology in Switzerland. The
   entire fuel cycle is analysed and includes improved modelling of natural
   uranium mining. The indicators employed in the impact assessment
   characterize a broad range of burdens to the environment and human
   health at both the global and the regional/local level and includes an
   analysis on the basis of external costs. The LCA shows a reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions by around just 7 per cent for the EPR in
   Switzerland in 2030 compared to the current PWR cycle emitting just
   above 5 g CO2-eq/kWh. Due to differences in cooling strategies, which
   cause slightly different output capacities, the French EPR is expected
   to achieve marginally better reductions of almost 16 per cent. The
   processing of natural uranium to yellowcake was shown to be the stage in
   the nuclear fuel cycle having the highest burdens and potential impacts
   across a majority of indicators, accounting for between 25 per cent and
   60 per cent of burdens and potential impacts. External costs of normal
   operation are shown to be around just 2 per cent of estimated internal
   (production) costs and similar to those of hydro and offshore wind. The
   potential impacts due to nuclear-related accidents were not considered.},

Abstract = {Hard engineered structures such as seawalls, groynes and breakwaters are
   often built to reduce coastal erosion and maintain a minimum beach width
   for recreation along coast regions. China has a seawall coastline of
   some 13 830 km that is the most popular erosion countermeasure along the
   Chinese coast; groynes and breakwaters always appear along muddy coasts
   or are used as aided structures. The latter are a common way to trap
   sediment in a particular coastal cell to maintain the nourished beach
   width; reclamation has already produced 12 000 km(2) of new land for the
   Chinese coastal area since the 1940's, including artificial islands in
   recent years. Soft engineering and combined structures are more and more
   popular in China; including those in Taiwan there are 34 documented
   nourishment sites. Other significant countermeasures to protect the
   coastline include planting Spartina alterniflora, mangrove
   afforestation, coral reef transplants, and introducing marine natural
   reserves. Since its introduction in the 1980's, over 34 km(2) of coastal
   wetland has been covered by Spartina alterniflora in China. Mangrove
   afforestation and coral reef transplants have also been carried out in
   the south China coastal area as environmentally friendly measures for
   coastal management, together with the declaration of marine natural
   reserves. More than 8 300 km(2) of coastal land has been protected in
   this way. Before the 1960's hard engineering works were mainly built on
   the Chinese coast, from then on soft engineering solutions became more
   common. The advantages and disadvantages of the countermeasures taken in
   China to combat coastal erosion are also dependent upon the country's
   economic circumstances. China needs to establish an effective coastal
   erosion management system, guiding managers and stakeholders to balance
   environmental and economic needs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {An observationally based energy balance for the Earth since 1950},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {114},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {We examine the Earth's energy balance since 1950, identifying results
   that can be obtained without using global climate models. Important
   terms that can be constrained using only measurements and radiative
   transfer models are ocean heat content, radiative forcing by long-lived
   trace gases, and radiative forcing from volcanic eruptions. We
   explicitly consider the emission of energy by a warming Earth by using
   correlations between surface temperature and satellite radiant flux data
   and show that this term is already quite significant. About 20\% of the
   integrated positive forcing by greenhouse gases and solar radiation
   since 1950 has been radiated to space. Only about 10\% of the positive
   forcing (about 1/3 of the net forcing) has gone into heating the Earth,
   almost all into the oceans. About 20\% of the positive forcing has been
   balanced by volcanic aerosols, and the remaining 50\% is mainly
   attributable to tropospheric aerosols. After accounting for the measured
   terms, the residual forcing between 1970 and 2000 due to direct and
   indirect forcing by aerosols as well as semidirect forcing from
   greenhouse gases and any unknown mechanism can be estimated as -1.1 +/-
   0.4 W m(-2) (1 sigma). This is consistent with the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change's best estimates but rules out very large
   negative forcings from aerosol indirect effects. Further, the data imply
   an increase from the 1950s to the 1980s followed by constant or slightly
   declining aerosol forcing into the 1990s, consistent with estimates of
   trends in global sulfate emissions. An apparent increase in residual
   forcing in the late 1990s is discussed.},

Abstract = {The use of fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns and causes
   major adverse effects such as the ocean level rise and the increased
   occurrence of hurricanes. To alleviate such problems, a global movement
   towards the generation of renewable energy is considered to be an
   effective way to help reducing the global greenhouse gas emissions and
   to sustain social development. Bioenergy is one attractive renewable
   energy source in Taiwan because a substantial amount of cropland has
   been released after the participation in the World Trade Organization
   (WTO). This study proposes two dynamic agricultural sector models to
   analyse how changes in the land fertility affect agricultural activities
   and bioenergy development. The analytical result indicates that economic
   incentives such as the direct subsidy and tax credit can be used to
   maintain a desired fertility level. In addition, the objectives of
   bioenergy development must be defined in advance because changes in
   discount rates and planning horizons have considerable influences on the
   effectiveness of policies.},

Title = {Dual wave farms and coastline dynamics: The role of inter-device spacing},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {646},
Pages = {1241-1252},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {In dual wave farms, i.e., arrays of wave energy converters (WECs) with a
   dual function - generation of renewable power and mitigation of coastal
   erosion - the spacing between the WECs is a fundamental design
   parameter. The present research has the objective of establishing how
   this parameter affects the shoreline evolution behind the array and, on
   this basis, to propose and apply a method to determine the optimum
   spacing for coastal protection. The method is demonstrated on a beach
   subjected to severe erosion. Five case studies are considered: four with
   different inter-WEC spacings, and one without the wave farm (baseline).
   A spectral wave propagation model is applied to analyse the variations
   in significant wave height behind the WEC array. Longshore sediment
   transport rates are calculated, and a shoreline model is applied. We
   find that in all the case studies the dry beach area is greater than in
   the baseline (no farm) case study, which proves the capacity of the dual
   WEC array to mitigate the erosive trends of the system. Importantly, we
   obtain that the inter-WEC spacing plays a fundamental role in the
   evolution of the shoreline and, consequently, in the effectiveness of
   the WEC array for coastal protection. The case studies with intermediate
   spacings yield the best performance in terms of dry beach area. More
   generally, the benefits of dual wave farms in terms of protection of
   coastal properties and infrastructure, and the ensuing savings in
   conventional coastal defence measures (coastal structures, beach
   nourishment, etc.) contribute to the development of wave energy by
   enhancing its economic viability. The methodology presented in this
   paper can be used to optimize the design of dual wave farms elsewhere.

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine and understand the dynamics of
   households' income in Hindu Kush Himalayan region in the face of
   changing climate and to explore the value chain development of two
   unique mountain products (yak and sea buckthorn) as potential strategies
   to increase socioeconomic resilience for enhanced adaptive capacity. The
   study seeks to answer that how local people perceive climate change and
   its impact on their household income and to what extent value chain
   development of mountain products prove to be a potential strategy for
   building climate resilience among local people? This study contributes
   to the existing scholarship on climate adaptation by proposing
   non-conventional and innovative livelihood strategies for enhancing
   climate resilience of local communities in four valleys of northern
   Pakistan. The research relies on both primary and secondary data. A
   field survey was carried out to collect data from 443 households using a
   structured questionnaire. This study shows that the mountain communities
   consider climate-induced natural hazards as major causes of change in
   households' income. To enhance the socioeconomic resilience against
   these climate vulnerabilities, cultivating sea buckthorn, breeding yak
   and developing value chains for related products has been suggested.
   Breeding yaks are both less labor intensive and climate resilient.
   Products made from yak hair and dung have the potential for high return
   if their value chains are established. Likewise, sea buckthorn is also
   considered less labor intensive and insensitive to extreme weather
   conditions. It could generate by-products used for food, medicine,
   cosmetics and construction. In order to improve socioeconomic resilience
   of local communities and enhance their adaptive capacity against effects
   of climate change, a value chain approach for yak and sea-buckthorn
   products has been proposed.},

Abstract = {The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a major contemporary
   challenge. This has prompted the requirements concerning energy
   efficiency for ships, among other things. Improvement in efficiency of
   ship operations could be achieved by reducing unnecessary power
   consumption by induction motors. Specifically, the occurrence of power
   quality disturbances, such as frequency and voltage deviations, voltage
   unbalances, and voltage harmonics, can cause an extraordinary increase
   in the power losses occurring in induction motors, as well as an
   unnecessary increase in the output power. Furthermore, excessive power
   quality disturbances are often interconnected with failures of on-board
   equipment, and in extreme cases, these may even pose a threat to safety
   at sea. Consequently, strict power quality monitoring of on-board
   microgrids can also contribute to improving safety while afloat. In this
   study, a dedicated tool for power quality monitoring is proposed, namely
   the <italic>coefficient of voltage energy efficiency</italic>, which has
   a value proportional to the power losses occurring in induction motors
   under power quality disturbances.},

Abstract = {Results of a vulnerability assessment of the Indian River Lagoon to
   climate change indicate future risks to water quality can be mitigated
   through adaptation actions targeting anticipated increases in pollutant
   loads from wastewater treatment plants, on site treatment and disposal
   systems, and surface water storage and conveyance infrastructure. Nine
   adaptation actions are recommended and if successfully implemented could
   reduce risks caused by climate change by fifty percent. The mitigating
   benefits of these actions are expected to cascade into other elements of
   the Lagoon, like living resources and habitats. The results and
   recommendations of this investigation are novel because they are based
   upon site-specific data and anticipated risks prioritized using a
   repeatable and defensible methodology. Furthermore, the focus and
   deliverables were informed by stakeholder involvement to facilitate
   utility to and implementation by resource practitioners. The next
   challenge is to implement, monitor, and revise each adaptation action as
   warranted. This will require a substantial increase in funding dedicated
   to the Lagoon's restoration and coherently managed for decades.
   Strengthened collaboration between local, state, and federal programs is
   necessary to enhance the probability of successfully reducing future
   climate-related water quality impairments and facilitating the emergence
   of a more resilient, climate-ready estuary.},

Abstract = {Climate change presents significant challenges to modelling and managing
   aquatic resources. Equilibrium assumptions common in many modelling
   approaches need to be replaced by formulations that allow for changing
   baselines and integration of ongoing changes and adaptations by species,
   ecosystems and humans. As ecosystems change, so will the ways humans
   use, monitor and manage them. Consequently, adaptive management loops
   and supporting tools deserve more prominence in the management toolbox.
   Models are critical tools for providing an early understanding of the
   challenges to be faced by integrating observations and examining
   possible solutions. We review modelling tools currently available to
   incorporate the effect of climate change on marine and freshwater
   ecosystems, and the implications for management of natural resources.
   System non-linearity can confound interpretations and hence adaptive
   management responses are needed that are robust to unexpected outcomes.
   An improvement in the ability to model the effects of climate change
   from a social and economic perspective is necessary. The outputs from
   `end-to-end' and socio-ecological models can potentially inform
   planning, in both Australia and the Pacific region, about how best to
   build resilience to climate change. In this context, the importance of
   well directed data-collection programs is also emphasised. Lessons from
   this region, which is advanced with regard to modelling approaches, can
   guide increased use of models to test options for managing aquatic
   resources worldwide.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Adopting a policy of migration can be one possible adaptation strategy
   against climate change. It has been forecasted that if the worst
   predictions regarding climate change and sea level rise become reality
   atolls around the world could become submerged in the future. This would
   render them uninhabitable and could lead to questions about whether
   Atoll Island States could still be considered as States. The
   international community has been avoiding any commitment to create a
   convention that would protect people displaced by climate change. In
   order to solve such potential problems, the authors will argue that a
   framework of bilateral agreements, initiatives, and national policies
   could constitute a viable solution for the various interested parties.
   The article will discuss the characteristics of Atoll Island States,
   touching on possible solutions for climate change displacement which
   have been discussed by the governments and civil society of the affected
   States.},

Abstract = {Coastal erosion is one of the most serious threats to the coastal
   environment, as it can cause a variety of problems, such as loss of
   properties, social problems and environmental disasters. The present
   paper examines the effect of coastal erosion due to both natural and
   human causes and proposes protection measures for low-tide coastal
   areas. First, the causes of coastal erosion and the regulatory framework
   for coastal zone management are presented. Among the measures taken to
   protect the coastal environment against the phenomenon of erosion that
   are examined in this study are (a) beach nourishment with no other shore
   protection structures, (b) beach nourishment combined with a floating
   breakwater, (c) beach nourishment combined with an artificial reef and
   (d) beach nourishment combined with a submerged breakwater. The aim of
   this work is to rank the alternative treatment approaches that deal with
   coastal erosion through a multi-criteria decision-making analysis. The
   theoretical background for the selected multi-criteria method, called
   PROMETHEE, is briefly presented in order to explain the classification
   of alternative approaches. Visual PROMETHEE Academic Edition software
   was used to rank the coastal protection methods and select the best
   ones. Through the analysis performed, beach nourishment combined with
   reef breakwater construction is found to be the most appropriate method
   to reduce erosion and protect the coast.},

Abstract = {Various measures have been used to protect coastal areas controlling
   beach erosion. During the last decades all over the world there has been
   many alternatives from engineering to soft coastal defence techniques,
   among which artificial beach nourishment and breakwaters are
   particularly popular. This study evaluates the changes of sediment
   processes in Lithuanian nearshore using two measures of shore
   protection: breakwaters and shoreface nourishment. The current study
   aims to estimate which measure is more effective in Lithuanian
   nearshore. For this purpose the calculations of sediment transport were
   done for breakwaters and nearshore berms separately (case study area is
   in Baltic Sea near Palanga). The analysis is based on the results of
   MIKE 21 modelling system (waves, hydrodynamic processes and sediment
   transport) under varying climatic conditions, especially in stormy
   weather that has the major impact on hydrodynamic and sediment

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {A simplified climate model of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system is
   used to perform extensive sensitivity studies concerning possible future
   climate change induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
   Supplemented with an active atmospheric hydrological cycle, experiments
   with different rates of CO2 increase and different climate sensitivities
   are performed. The model exhibits a threshold value of atmospheric CO2
   concentration beyond which the North Atlantic Deep Water formation stops
   and never recovers. For a climate sensitivity that leads to an
   equilibrium warming of 3.6 degrees C for a doubling of CO2 and a rate of
   CO2 increase of 1\% yr(-1), the threshold lies between 650 and 700 ppmv.
   Moreover, it is shown that the stability of the thermohaline circulation
   depends on the rate of increase of greenhouse gases. For a slower
   increase of atmospheric pCO(2) the final amount that can be reached
   without a shutdown of the circulation is considerably higher. This
   rate-sensitive response is due to the uptake of heat and excess
   freshwater from the uppermost layers to the deep ocean.
   The increased equator-to-pole freshwater transport in a warmer
   atmosphere is mainly responsible for the cessation of deep water
   formation in the North Atlantic. Another consequence of the enhanced
   latent heat transport is a stronger warming at high latitudes. A model
   version with fixed water vapor transport exhibits uniform warming at all
   latitudes. The inclusion of a simple parameterization of the ice-albedo
   feedback increases the model sensitivity and further decreases the
   pole-to-equator temperature difference in a greenhouse climate. The
   possible range of CO2 threshold concentrations and its dependency on the
   rate of CO2 increase, on the climate sensitivity, and on other model
   parameters are discussed.},

Abstract = {Freight movement is a significant and growing contributor to
   transportation emissions globally. Modal shifts in freight, that is,
   moving freight from a higher emission mode to one associated with lower
   emissions, are discussed as a strategy to reduce emissions of criteria
   pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, there is limited
   knowledge of the magnitude of potential benefits and their impacts on
   human health. The overall goal of this study is to identify and
   characterize the potential of modal shifts in freight transport for
   mitigating air pollutant emissions, air pollutant concentrations,
   population exposure to air pollutants, and health impacts. The analysis
   was conducted in the Canadian context, with a focus on land-based
   freight such as trucks, trains, and pipelines, as well as marine
   shipping for inland and coastal waters. A structured review of the
   existing literature database, and a critical assessment of the findings
   was conducted, using a weight-of-evidence approach. The assessment took
   into consideration potential local and regional variables for Canada.
   The results indicated that there is limited evidence that road-to-rail,
   road-to-marine, and rail-to-marine modal shifts could reduce pollutant
   and GHG emissions. There was insufficient evidence on modal shifts
   involving the pipeline mode, and on the air quality, population
   exposure, and health impacts related to any modal shift. Several
   research gaps remain, which must be addressed establish the emissions,
   air quality, and health impacts of freight modal shifts.},

Abstract = {Agriculture sector is the second biggest source of greenhouse gases
   (GHG) emission, and rice is one of the most important grains in China.
   Reducing rice carbon emission is playing an important role in low-carbon
   agriculture. Based on life-cycle assessment, this paper assesses rice
   carbon footprint (CF) of 17 main rice-producing provincial areas in
   China respectively, and analyzed change trend of rice CF amount and
   structure from 1997 to 2008. The results show that: the CF produced in
   extraction and transportation of raw materials, and arable farming is
   accounted to 90\%-97\% of the total rice CF. The proportion of CF that
   emerged in the production and transportation of agrochemical was
   decreasing gradually during the time from 1997 to 2008. And the CF of
   each ton of rice in developed coastal regions such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang
   and Guangdong, was several times. higher than other regions. It suggests
   to improve the process of energy extraction and to develop energy-saving
   technologies in the rice cultivation, meantime, promoting clean energy,
   biomass energy and renewable energy in rural areas continuously, and
   adjusting the production structure of rice production are the ways to
   reduce rice carbon emission.},

Title = {Vegetation and hydrology stratification as proxies to estimate methane
   emission from tidal marshes},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {157},

Abstract = {Direct measurement of methane emissions is cost-prohibitive for
   greenhouse gas offset projects, necessitating the development of
   alternative accounting methods such as proxies. Salinity is a useful
   proxy for tidal marsh CH4 emissions when comparing across a wide range
   of salinity regimes but does not adequately explain variation in
   brackish and freshwater regimes, where variation in emissions is large.
   We sought to improve upon the salinity proxy in a marsh complex on Deal
   Island Peninsula, Maryland, USA by comparing emissions from four strata
   differing in hydrology and plant community composition. Mean CH4
   chamber-collected emissions measured as mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) ranked as S.
   alterniflora (1.2 +/- 0.3) >> High-elevation J. roemerianus (0.4 +/-
   0.06) > Low-elevation J. roemerianus (0.3 +/- 0.07) = S. patens (0.1 +/-
   0.01). Sulfate depletion generally reflected the same pattern with
   significantly greater depletion in the S. alterniflora stratum (61 +/-
   4\%) than in the S. patens stratum (1 +/- 9\%) with the J. roemerianus
   strata falling in between. We attribute the high CH4 emissions in the S.
   alterniflora stratum to sulfate depletion likely driven by limited
   connectivity to tidal waters. Low CH4 emissions in the S. patens stratum
   are attributed to lower water levels, higher levels of ferric iron, and
   shallow rooting depth. Moderate CH4 emissions from the J. roemerianus
   strata were likely due to plant traits that favor CH4 oxidation over CH4
   production. Hydrology and plant community composition have significant
   potential as proxies to estimate CH4 emissions at the site scale.},

Title = {A vision of an electric power architecture for the next generation},
Journal = {ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING IN JAPAN},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {150},
Number = {1},
Pages = {18-25},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Since the present hierarchical power grid structure and AC interface are
   mature and rigid, a new electric power system architecture is proposed
   here to save the earth by making use of renewable energy sources. The
   architecture consists of a new concept and a historical technology, that
   is, a network of many ``electric clusters{''} with a DC interface. The
   cluster includes dispersed electric power generators, electric
   appliances, electric storage, and ``electric power routers.{''} The
   router is equipment to resourcefully route electrical energy between
   neighboring clusters and to manage electrical energy in the cluster. The
   transfers of electrical energy (between clusters and within clusters)
   and the generation of electricity from renewal energy sources (such as
   sunlight, wind, tides, and biogas) are intermittent and have very wide
   dynamic ranges, so that the interface must make use of DC. When we
   achieve an energy society with this architecture, we will be able to
   reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and materials use.

Title = {Farmers' Net Income Distribution and Regional Vulnerability to Climate
   Change: An Empirical Study of Bangladesh},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Widespread poverty is the most serious threat and social problem that
   Bangladesh faces. Regional vulnerability to climate change threatens to
   escalate the magnitude of poverty. It is essential that poverty
   projections be estimated while bearing in mind the effects of climate
   change. The main purpose of this paper is to perform an agrarian
   sub-national regional analysis of climate change vulnerability in
   Bangladesh under various climate change scenarios and evaluate its
   potential impact on poverty. This study is relevant to socio-economic
   research on climate change vulnerability and agriculture risk management
   and has the potential to contribute new insights to the complex
   interactions between household income and climate change risks to
   agricultural communities in Bangladesh and South Asia. This study uses
   analysis of variance, cluster analysis, decomposition of variance and
   log-normal distribution to estimate the parameters of income variability
   that can be used to ascertain vulnerability levels and help us to
   understand the poverty levels that climate change could potentially
   generate. It is found that the levels and sources of income vary greatly
   among regions of Bangladesh. The variance decomposition of income showed
   that agricultural income in Mymensingh and Rangpur is the main cause of
   the total income difference among all sources of income. Moreover, a
   large variance in agricultural income among regions is induced by the
   gross income from rice production. Additionally, even in the long run
   the gradual, constant reduction of rice yield due to climate change in
   Bangladesh is not a severe problem for farmers. However, extreme events
   such as floods, flash floods, droughts, sea level rise and greenhouse
   gas emissions, based on Representative concentration pathways (RCPs),
   could increase the poverty rates in Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Barisal and
   Khulnaregions that would be greatly affected by unexpected yield losses
   due to extreme climatic events. Therefore, research into and development
   of adaptation measures to climate change in regions where farmers are
   largely dependent on agricultural income are important.},
