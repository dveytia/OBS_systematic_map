Abstract = {Multiple tunneling junctions consisting of metal islands about 2 nm in
   diameter and < 2 nm gaps were fabricated by a combination of high
   resolution electron-beam lithography and an ionized beam deposition
   technique. The effective tunneling capacitance of this structure is
   calculated to be about 0.2 aF, implying that the charging energy
   associated with an electron tunneling on or off the islands is well
   above the thermal energy at room temperature. Electrical measurements
   showed clear Coulomb blockade effects in this structure. Coulomb gaps of
   0.16 V were observed at 77 K in the source-drain current-voltage
   characteristics and the nonlinearity persisted up to room temperature
   although the Coulomb gaps disappeared as the temperature was raised.
   When the voltage applied to the gate electrode was swept, the
   drain-source current showed strong oscillations at constant drain-source
   bias voltage, confirming the existence of single electron charging
   effects. This process can be used to fabricate single electron devices
   operating at liquid nitrogen temperature or perhaps even at room
   temperature and is compatible with the methods used in integrated
   circuit processes. (C) 1995 American Vacuum Society.},

Abstract = {Recent splurge in the civil engineering industry is fuelled by the
   growth of industrial clusters across nation and also by conversion of
   villages into towns and cities. The technological developments and
   changes are results of industrial growth which resulted in tremendous
   use of natural resources as a raw material and mass production of
   manufacturing goods. The development of new technologies and their use
   in industry also effected the non-industrial sectors. Agriculture sector
   is also influenced by the industrial growth, with the advent of newer
   processing technologies it grown manifold. Surging pop-ulation had put
   thrust on more production of agricultural produce, the production ended
   up only with huge amount of waste materials and by products. Among those
   materials Phosphate is one valuable material which is a nutrient that is
   very essential for the survival of plants and animal, this is derived
   from Phosphate rock. Phosphate rock is converted into fertilizer through
   industrial process, and it is being used widely for agricultural
   purpose. Also, phosphate is used in many products that produces wastes
   including phosphogypsum which is generated as waste from phosphate
   industry. This waste is dis-charged in sea, rivers and other water
   courses which has huge adverse effects on ecological system and human
   life. Much research is carried out to reuse the waste products for
   making sustainable goods and reduce the problem of disposal. In
   construction industry, phosphogypsum can be used in concrete. In this
   work, an attempt is made to utilise waste phosphogypsum in concrete that
   is widely used construc-tion material to produce light weight panels for
   industrial and residential purpose. Thrust is given to understand the
   strength and durability characters of the produced composite so that its
   industrial usage can be defined. Promising results were obtained with
   decent increasing in strength and durability which shows that the
   material can be used effectively in Civil engineering industry. (c) 2021

Title = {Get up early: Revealing behavioral responses of sandeel to ocean warming

Abstract = {Warming of the oceans and shifts in the timing of annual key events are
   likely to cause behavioral changes in species showing a high degree of
   site fidelity. While this is well studied in terrestrial systems, there
   are fewer examples from the marine environment. Sandeel (Ammodytes
   marinus) is a small eel-shaped teleost fish with strong behavioral
   attachment to sandy habitats in which they are buried from late summer
   through winter. When spring arrives, the sandeel emerge to feed during
   the day for several of months before returning to the sand for
   overwintering refuge. Using fisheries data from the North Sea, we
   investigated whether catch rates reflect the timing of emergence and if
   seasonal patterns are related to temperature and primary production.
   Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was used to describe sandeel emergence. We
   developed indicators of the relative timing of the emergence from the
   winter sand refuge and the subsequent growth period. Different modeling
   approaches were used to investigate the relationship with bottom
   temperature and primary production. Variation in emergence behavior was
   correlated with variation in sea bottom temperature. Warmer years were
   characterized by earlier emergence. Significant warming over the last
   three decades was evident in all sandeel habitats in the North Sea
   throughout most of their adult life history, though no net shift in the
   phenology of emergence was detected. Minimum temperature during spring
   was a better predictor of emergence behavior than, for example, degree
   days. This study emphasizes how temperature-induced changes in behavior
   may have implications for predators and fisheries of sandeel. The method
   can be applied to other species for which the timing of exploitation
   (i.e., fisheries) and species life history are well matched.},

Title = {Variation of wave directional spread parameters along the Indian coast},
Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-102},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Directional spreading of wave energy is popularly modeled with the help
   of the Cosine Power model and it mainly depends on the spreading
   parameter. This paper describes the variation of the spreading parameter
   estimated based on the wave data collected at four locations along the
   East as well as the West side of the Indian coast. The directional
   spreading parameter was correlated with other characteristic wave
   parameters, like non-linearity parameter, and directional width. Working
   empirical relationships between them have been established. The mean
   spreading angle was found to be slightly lower than the directional
   width with a correlation coefficient of 0.8. The maximum spreading
   parameter, s, underwent a sudden reduction in its value with the
   increase in the value of directional width. The average value of the
   maximum spreading parameter for the locations studied was found to be
   23. The study shows that the spreading parameter can be related to
   significant wave height, mean period and water depth through the
   non-linearity parameter and can be estimated with an average correlation
   coefficient of 0.7 for the Indian coast and with higher correlation
   coefficient of 0.9 for the high waves (H-S > 1.5 m). (C) 2006 Elsevier

Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {546},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Desalination using solar-driven water evaporation is one of the most
   efficient, green, and sustainable approaches. However, the purification
   of oil-contaminated seawater, salt inhibition, and recovery of water
   evaporators remain challenging. Herein, a water evaporator based on a
   C/ZnFe2O4-x composite deposited on floral foam (FF) was developed, and
   its water evaporation performance was optimized by adjusting the
   reaction and calcination temperatures, concentration of deposited
   C/ZnFe2O4-x, and height of the FF. Owing to the excellent optical
   properties of C/ZnFe2O4-x, the water evaporator absorbed more than 96 \%
   of sunlight in the wavelength range of 280-2500 nm, and its excellent
   magnetic properties promoted the recycling of the evaporator using a
   magnetic drive. The evaporator exhibited an excellent solar evaporation
   rate of 4.06 kg m- 2 h-1, and a high light-to-heat conversion efficiency
   of 95.4 \% under one-sun irradiation. The water evaporator exhibited
   excellent salt inhi-bition properties, and no salt crystals formed
   during the water evaporation process. The total organic carbon and
   organic dissolved matter in the purified water were significantly lower
   than those of the oil-contaminated seawater. Because of its low cost,
   high evaporation rate, and excellent durability, recyclability, and salt
   inhi-bition properties, the 3D evaporator can be a reliable device for
   purifying oil-contaminated seawater.},

Abstract = {The theory of wave propagation and fluctuations in random media has been
   broadly studied; however the works studying the influence of a changing
   underwater acoustic environment on the spatial decay and fluctuations of
   the peak pressure in broadband and impulsive signals are limited. Using
   a method based on the formulation developed by Dyer and Makris to
   estimate intensity fluctuations of sound signals in the ocean in
   conditions of saturated multipath propagation, this paper presents an
   approach to model peak pressure fluctuations of transient signals
   propagating underwater. In contrast to the formulation of Dyer and
   Makris, the approach presented in this work applies extreme value theory
   using the properties of the peak pressure as a maximum value taken from
   a Rayleigh distributed amplitude. The location and scale parameters
   obtained from the best fit to a Gumbel distribution are used to estimate
   the probability of the peak pressure level staying below a certain
   threshold. The theory was applied to measurements of signals from an
   airgun array and offshore impact pile driving, resulting in good
   agreement in both cases. (C) 2017 Acoustical Society of America.},

   contributing to the oceanic input of DIC and alkalinity},
Journal = {TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {65},
Abstract = {In models of the marine carbon system, it is important to correctly
   represent riverine and aerial inputs of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
   and alkalinity. We have examined the different processes contributing to
   this exchange. In terms of DIC, we have divided the fluxes into their
   internal component, constituting the carbon ultimately derived from the
   atmosphere, and their external component originating from rocks. We find
   that the only process contributing to external DIC input is carbonate
   and fossil carbon weathering and that erosion of organic matter
   ultimately constitutes a DIC sink. A number of both riverine and aerial
   inputs affect the alkalinity. Beside carbonate and silicate weathering,
   we examine processes of pyrite weathering, aerial input of sulphuric
   acid, and riverine and aerial inputs of various nitrogen species. Using
   the observation that, in the ocean, the nitrate concentration follows
   that of phosphate, we assume a steady state in nitrate. This leads to
   the surprising result that the only processes affecting the alkalinity
   is riverine input of nitrate, constituting an alkalinity source and
   input of ammonia, constituting an alkalinity sink. Furthermore, we
   compare the flux sizes. As expected, carbonate and silicate weathering
   has the largest effect on alkalinity, though we note that burial of
   pyrite might be of importance during periods of large-scale anoxia.},

Abstract = {One of the main crises that the world will face is the over pollution of
   the environment due to the use of fossil fuels. This problem will be
   solved by replacing renewable energy sources (RESs). DC microgrids
   (DCMGs) provide the ability to exploit all the potential of RESs. But,
   high penetration of these sources reduces the inertia and damping of the
   DCMGs. Therefore, it makes DCMG vulnerable to fluctuations and
   disturbances. This challenge can be addressed by using distributed
   energy storage systems (DESS) in DCMGs and inertial simulations. To
   improve the inertia as well as to balance the charge/discharge of the
   DESS, the concept of a virtual supercapacitor based on the state of
   charge (SOC) is introduced. Under the proposed control strategy, DCMG
   inertia is provided and the SOC balance is maintained in charge and
   discharge mode. Due to the bidirectional power transmission capability,
   symmetrical structure and considering the protection purposes of dual
   half-bridge converter (DHB) can be selected. A small signal has also
   been investigated to analyse the role of virtual inertia in stability.
   The simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink show the correct performance
   dynamics and high impact of the proposed scheme compared to conventional
   schemes.},

Abstract = {Sedimentary bacteria have generally been recognized as an essential food
   for protists and invertebrates, forming the base of benthic food webs.
   This trophic role has been well documented, but bacteria play an equally
   important role as mineralizers of organic detritus and recyclers of
   essential nutrients. Recent evidence suggests that this latter role is
   more important than their trophic function in tropical mangrove and
   coastal sediments. Bacteria in these systems are, on average, more
   abundant and productive than their counterparts in higher-latitude
   systems. They account for a disproportionate share of nutrient uptake to
   the extent that bacterial communities act as a sink for carbon,
   processing most of the energy and nutrients in tropical aquatic systems.
   Most bacteria remain unconsumed in tropical deposits, dying naturally
   and lysing, with the next generation of cells consuming, mineralizing
   and recycling this material either into new biomass or dissolved
   material. Bacteria in tropical aquatic sediments are ultimately
   controlled by inputs of dissolved and particulate detritus, natural
   mortality and recycling. To replenish damaged ecosystems in the tropics,
   restoration of the natural geochemical profile in the sediments is
   necessary to re-initiate the growth of bacteria in order to restore the
   essential recycling processes which assist in the conservation of
   nutrients.},

   long-term detrital manipulations},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Riparian habitats provide organic matter inputs that influence stream
   biota and ecosystem processes in forested watersheds. Over a 13-yr
   period, we examined the effects of litter exclusion, small- and
   large-wood removal, and the addition of leaf species of varying detrital
   quality on organic matter standing crop and export of organic and
   inorganic particles in a high-gradient headwater stream. Using eight
   pretreatment years of export data and two pretreatment years of
   particulate organic matter (POM) standing crop data, we report on 21 and
   15 years of continuous export and POM standing crop results,
   respectively. Litter exclusion resulted in the elimination of leaf
   standing crop by the end of year three. Wood and fine benthic organic
   matter (FBOM) standing crops declined significantly during the exclusion
   and wood removal periods, but never completely disappeared. Following
   the introduction of artificial wood structures for retention, the
   addition of fast, slow, and mixed breakdown leaves in the treatment
   stream resulted in significantly increased mean annual leaf standing
   crops. After five years of leaf addition, FBOM standing crop and fine
   particulate organic matter (FPOM) export remained below pre-treatment
   levels. The reduction in leaf standing crop in the treatment stream
   resulted in significant increases in FPOM (23), fine inorganic
   particulate (33), and gravel export (103). After small wood removal we
   observed significant increases in export of fine inorganic particulates
   (23) and gravel (73) from the treatment stream. A greater proportion of
   coarse and FBOM standing crop was exported from the treatment stream
   during the litter exclusion and small wood removal periods than from the
   reference stream. Following the addition of slow and mixed leaves this
   trend was reversed, demonstrating the importance of leaf standing crop
   in the retention of POM. Our long-term experiment demonstrates that the
   quantity and type of riparian inputs to forested headwater streams will
   affect POM standing crop and export of POM and sediments to downstream
   ecosystems, and that small wood is more critical to retaining sediments
   and POM in small streams than previously recognized.},

Abstract = {Annual fluxes of particulate Th-230 and Pa-231 collected by sediment
   traps deployed at two locations in the Ross Sea are compared to expected
   fluxes, derived by combining the seasonal depletion of Th-230 and Pa-231
   in surface waters with the steady-state production of each nuclide by
   radioactive decay of its respective dissolved uranium parent.
   Conservative (minimum) estimates of the expected Th-230 flux are greater
   than the flux collected by sediment traps deployed at similar to 200 m
   by factors of 3 and 6 at the two sites. The actual discrepancy may be
   much larger. The discrepancies between expected and measured fluxes of
   Pa-231 are slightly smaller, but comparable in magnitude to those for
   Th-230. The discrepancies between expected and measured fluxes for these
   natural radionuclides are similar in magnitude to those determined
   previously, using the same sediment traps, for particulate organic
   carbon, which suggests that the sediment traps undercollected the actual
   flux of sinking particles. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {An experimental study on the effects of relative rotation direction on
   the wake interferences among tandem wind turbines},
Journal = {SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS \& ASTRONOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {57},

Abstract = {An experimental study was conducted to investigate the effects of
   relative rotation direction on the wake interferences among two
   tandemwind turbines models. While the oncoming flow conditions were kept
   in constant during the experiments, turbine power outputs, wind loads
   acting on the turbines, and wake characteristics behind the turbines
   were compared quantitatively with turbine models in either co-rotating
   or counter-rotating configuration. The measurement results reveal that
   the turbines in counter-rotating would harvest more wind energy from the
   same oncoming wind, compared with the co-rotating case. While the
   recovery of the streamwise velocity deficits in the wake flows was found
   to be almost identical with the turbines operated in either co-rotating
   or counter-rotating, the significant azimuthal velocity generated in the
   wake flow behind the upstream turbine is believed to be the reason why
   the counter-rotating turbines would have a better power production
   performance. Since the azimuthal flow velocity in the wake flow was
   found to decrease monotonically with the increasing downstream distance,
   the benefits of the counter-rotating configuration were found to
   decrease gradually as the spacing between the tandem turbines increases.
   While the counter-rotating downstream turbine was found to produce up to
   20\% more power compared with that of co-rotating configuration with the
   turbine spacing being about 0.7D, the advantage was found to become
   almost negligible when the turbine spacing becomes greater than 6.5D. It
   suggests that the counter-rotating configuration design would be more
   beneficial to turbines in onshore wind farms due to the smaller turbine
   spacing (i.e., similar to 3 rotor diameters for onshore wind farms vs.
   similar to 7 rotor diameters for offshore wind farms in the prevailing
   wind direction), especially for those turbines sited over complex
   terrains with the turbine spacing only about 1-2 rotor diameters.},

   turbines},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {1328-1341},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In laboratory experiments involving wind or water turbines, it is often
   desirable to correct measured performance for the effects of model
   blockage. However, there has been limited experimental validation of the
   analytical blockage corrections presented in the literature. Therefore,
   the objective of this study is to evaluate corrections against
   experimental data and recommend one or more for future use. For this
   investigation, we tested a cross-flow turbine and an axial-flow turbine
   under conditions of varying blockage with other non-dimensional
   parameters, such as the free-stream Reynolds and Froude numbers, held
   approximately constant. Increasing blockage improved turbine
   performance, resulting in higher thrust and power coefficients over a
   larger range of tip-speed ratios. We used these experimental data to
   assess the effectiveness of multiple analytical blockage corrections for
   both turbine types. Of the corrections evaluated, the two based on
   measured thrust performed best. These corrections were more effective
   for the cross-flow turbine than the axial-flow turbine. We attribute
   this result to changes in the local Reynolds number caused by increasing
   blockage, an effect not captured by the analytical theory. For both
   turbines, the corrections performed better for thrust than power, which
   is consistent with the assumptions that underlie the analytical theory.

Abstract = {The refugee situation is becoming a major challenge globally. Scenarios
   leading to refugee crises are increasing and extending for protracted
   lengths of time. Meeting the basic needs of refugees, especially with
   regard to energy, is a difficult issue that typically requires
   anticipatory planning. This work proposes a design for an off-grid
   hybrid energy system (HES) capable of providing adequate continuous
   energy for a refugee camp. The design is based on the islanded
   micro-grid concept allowing for straightforward modular expansion. It is
   built to address energy requirements for locations with significant
   annual temperature and climate variations. The HES is comprised of
   photovoltaic panels, battery-based energy storage, and a backup
   generator. Specifications and sizing parameters are put forth for the
   different components including an intelligent dispatch algorithm that
   mitigates the effects of transitory clouds to provide a consistent
   stable energy supply. Detailed simulations across different weather
   conditions and seasons show that the proposed HES reduces generator
   usage by more than 45\% under worst-case conditions. Economic analysis
   also shows that the proposed system reduces Levelized Cost Of Energy
   (LCOE) by more than 14\% compared to the typical generator-only
   installation.},

   on important issues affecting the distribution system as a result of PV
   penetration is presented. Pertinent issues such as voltage fluctuation,
   voltage rise, voltage balance, and harmonics and their effect on the
   system are discussed in details. The islanding issues, which are of
   critical importance to the stability and integrity of the system, are
   also thoroughly reviewed. Details on different islanding techniques -
   remote and local techniques and their advantage and disadvantages are
   shown. Therefore, this paper can provide useful information and serve as
   a reference for researchers and utility engineers on issues to be
   considered with regards to PV penetration. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {In order to analyze thermal hydraulic phenomena during a DVI (Direct
   Vessel Injection) line break LOCA (Loss-of-Coolant Accident) in the
   APR1400 (Advanced Power Reactor 1400 MWe), we performed experimental
   studies with the SNUF (Seoul National University Facility), a
   reduced-height and reduce-pressure integral test loop with a scaled down
   APR1400. We performed experiments dealing with eight test cases under
   varied tests. As a result of the experiment, the primary system
   pressure, the coolant temperature, and the occurrence time of the
   downcomer seal clearing were affected significantly by the thermal power
   in the core and the SI flow rate. The break area played a dominant role
   in the vent of the steam. For our analytical investigation, we used the
   MARS code for simulation of the experiments to validate the calculation
   capability of the code. The results of the analysis showed good and
   sufficient agreement with the results of the experiment. However, the
   analysis revealed a weak capability in predicting the bypass flow of the
   SI water toward the broken DVI line, and it was insufficient to simulate
   the streamline contraction in the broken side. We, hence, need to
   improve the MARS code.},

Abstract = {With the increase of steam parameters of coal-fired thermal power
   plants, high strength 9\%Cr steel containing niobium and vanadium became
   major material in high temperature boiler components. As the
   microstructure of these steels is tempered martensite, it is known that
   the softening occurs in HAZ of the weldment. In the creep rupture test
   of these welded joints the rupture strength is lower than that of the
   parent metal, and sometimes this reduction of strength is caused by Type
   IV cracking. To develop an effective method to improve the rupture
   strength of welded joints, a normalizing-tempering heat treatment after
   weld was proposed. 9Cr1MoNbV plates with a thickness of 40-50 mm were
   welded by 10 mm width automatic narrow gap MAG welding procedure using
   specially modified welding material. After normalizing at 1050C and
   tempering at 780C, material properties of the welded joints were
   examined. Microstructure of the HAZ was improved as before weld, and
   rupture strength of the welded joints was equal to that of the parent
   metal. The long term rupture strength of the welded joints as confirmed
   in the test exceeded 30,000 hours. This welding procedure has been
   applied to the seam weld of boiler hot reheat piping in USC plants
   successfully.},

Abstract = {Iceland has a great amount of indirect solar energy in the form of
   hydropower. With this energy, hydrogen is produced by electrolysis,
   pressurised to 200 bar and transported to Hamburg (Germany) in standard
   trailers. In Hamburg, six vans. originally equipped with gasoline
   engines are converted for operation with hydrogen, the fuel tanks being
   replaced by hydrogen gas tanks. The vans are used for urban
   distribution. These vehicles are suitable for ordinary operations,
   comply with the necessary safety requirements and can be driven and
   fuelled by drivers without any special skills or permits. The project is
   the world's first public hydrogen vehicle system for private
   utilisation. The paper describes the performance and the experience
   gained with the whole hydrogen system from the source to vehicle
   operation. The technical data of the daily operation is presented.
   Six project partners run the vehicles and bear the total costs of the
   project. ``Wasserstoff-Gesellschaft Hamburg (WGH){''} initiated the
   project and coordinates the executive activities. The project's acronym
   is ``W.E.I.T.{''} (in German: Wasserstoff-Energie Island Transfer).
   The project is split into two phases for administrative and financial
   reasons: Phase I: Hydrogen is delivered as a by-product from local
   chemical processes Phase ii: Hydrogen is delivered from renewable energy
   sources in Iceland.},

Abstract = {Lake Jezero v Ledvici ( NW Slovenia) is a 14 m deep mountain lake at an
   elevation of 1860 m, situated on limestone bedrock. It is an
   oligotrophic, alkaline and hard-water lake with a transparency of about
   14 m and has suffered several times over recent centuries from strong
   earthquakes. In 1996 five sediment cores, between 35 and 45 cm long,
   were collected from the deepest part of the lake and analysed to
   reconstruct environmental changes over the last few centuries. The data
   indicate changes induced by pollution and climate change during the last
   two centuries similar to those in other European mountain and remote
   lakes. However, at this site earthquakes have also affected the lake and
   partly obscure the interpretation of the sediment record. From 1780 to
   1890, sediment records show low abundance of diatoms and relatively high
   abundance of Cladocera. After 1890, the number of diatoms started to
   increase coinciding with a strong earthquake. From the beginning of the
   20th century, concentrations of spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCP),
   diatom valves and head capsules of chironomids gradually increased
   whilst in Cladocera the main difference observed was a change in the
   proportion of benthic taxa. After 1960, in parallel with a rise in air
   temperature, a further increase in accumulation rate of diatoms started,
   but there was a decrease in Cladocera.},

Abstract = {Recent ecological changes in a small Scottish mountain loch, Loch Coire
   Fionnaraich (LCFR), were inferred using Cladocera analysis and an
   application of a Cladocera-based temperature transfer-function approach.
   Modem assemblages of Cladocera from 68 mountain lakes in Scotland and
   Norway were used to derive the transfer function. Among 21 measured
   environmental variables, mean summer lake surface-water temperature
   (LSWT) accounted for the highest (8\%) variation in a redundancy
   analysis of the modem data. A quantitative inference model (r(2) = 0.72,
   RMSEP = 1.81 degrees C) for summer LSWT was developed using linear
   partial least squares regression and calibration. The resulting
   reconstructed summer LSWT at LCFR was compared with local instrumental
   air-temperature records over the last 20 yr and the Central England
   Temperature (CET) series over the last 110 yr. The reconstruction showed
   a broadly similar pattern to the local instrumental temperature records.
   However, the relationship between the longer CET series and
   reconstructed summer LSWT was poor suggesting that the site was
   relatively insensitive to temperature changes prior to the recent
   warming of the last few decades. Clear changes in Cladoceran species
   diversity and relative abundance of littoral taxa coincident with the
   most recent period of climate warming recorded both locally and in the
   CET suggest that Cladocera do respond to climate change. However, their
   response to temperature is complex and indirect. The underlying
   mechanism leading to change in Cladocera assemblages may involve changes
   in trophic status and habitat availability of the system. It is
   concluded that understanding other factors such as atmospheric
   pollution, controls of community dynamics of Cladocera and the overall
   ecological complexity of mountain lakes is required before any reliance
   can be placed on a Cladocera-temperature transfer-function for
   reconstructing climatic change. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by

Title = {Oceanic CO2 outgassing and biological production hotspots induced by
   pre-industrial river loads of nutrients and carbon in a global modeling

Abstract = {Rivers are a major source of nutrients, carbon and alkalinity to the
   global ocean. In this study, we firstly estimate pre-industrial riverine
   loads of nutrients, carbon and alkalinity based on a hierarchy of
   weathering and terrestrial organic matter export models, while
   identifying regional hotspots of the riverine exports. Secondly, we
   implement the riverine loads into a global ocean biogeochemical model to
   describe their implications for oceanic nutrient concentrations, net
   primary production (NPP) and air sea CO2 fluxes globally, as well as in
   an analysis of coastal regions. Thirdly, we quantitatively assess the
   terrestrial origins and the long-term fate of riverine carbon in the
   ocean. We quantify annual bioavailable pre-industrial riverine loads of
   3.7 Tg P, 27 Tg N, 158 Tg Si and 603 Tg C delivered to the ocean
   globally. We thereby identify the tropical Atlantic catchments (20 \% of
   global C), Arctic rivers (9 \% of global C) and Southeast Asian rivers
   (15 \% of global C) as dominant suppliers of carbon for the ocean. The
   riverine exports lead to a simulated net global oceanic CO2 source of
   231 Tg C yr(-1) to the atmosphere, which is mainly caused by inorganic
   carbon (source of 183 Tg C yr(-1)) and by organic carbon (source of 128
   Tg C yr(-1)) riverine loads. Additionally, a sink of 80 Tg C yr(-1) is
   caused by the enhancement of the biological carbon uptake from dissolved
   inorganic nutrient inputs from rivers and the resulting alkalinity
   production. While large outgassing fluxes are simulated mostly in
   proximity to major river mouths, substantial outgassing fluxes can be
   found further offshore, most prominently in the tropical Atlantic.
   Furthermore, we find evidence for the interhemispheric transfer of
   carbon in the model; we detect a larger relative outgassing flux (49 \%
   of global riverine-induced outgassing) in the Southern Hemisphere in
   comparison to the hemisphere's relative riverine inputs (33 \% of global
   C inputs), as well as an outgassing flux of 17 Tg C yr(-1) in the
   Southern Ocean. The addition of riverine loads in the model leads to a
   strong NPP increase in the tropical west Atlantic, Bay of Bengal and the
   East China Sea (+166 \%, +377 \% and +71 \%, respectively). On the
   light-limited Arctic shelves, the NPP is not strongly sensitive to
   riverine loads, but the CO2 flux is strongly altered regionally due to
   substantial dissolved inorganic and organic carbon supplies to the
   region. While our study confirms that the ocean circulation remains the
   main driver for biogeochemical distributions in the open ocean, it
   reveals the necessity to consider riverine inputs for the representation
   of heterogeneous features in the coastal ocean and to represent
   riverine-induced pre-industrial carbon outgassing in the ocean. It also
   underlines the need to consider long-term CO2 sources from volcanic and
   shale oxidation fluxes in order to close the framework's atmospheric
   carbon budget.},

Abstract = {A three-dimensional tidal turbine simulation based on an oceanographic
   numerical model has been tested for suspended sediment calculation,
   particularly in the wake of a standalone tidal turbine. The results
   suggest a need for further improvement of the model in order to obtain
   correct predictions of suspension strength of the wake and suspended
   sediment concentration under the influence of a turbine (compared to
   measured data). Due to the wide use of FVCOM in coastal applications
   where turbines are commonly installed, it proves necessary to address
   this issue. Two approaches with respect to modifying bed shear stress
   and turbulent mixing calculations in the presence of a turbine are
   proposed and tested in this research. Using data collected in the
   laboratory as reference, the turbulent mixing enhancement approach is
   shown to be effective. A series of tests are carried out to identify the
   impact of the turbine on suspended sediment transport in its vicinity.
   The results suggest that the impact is highly dependent upon the
   sediment grain size. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Metabolic Consequences of Cobalamin Scarcity in the Diatom Thalassiosira

Abstract = {Diatoms perform an estimated 20\% of global photosynthesis, form the
   base of the marine food web, and sequester carbon into the deep ocean
   through the biological pump. In some areas of the ocean, diatom growth
   is limited by the micronutrient cobalamin (vitamin B-12), yet the
   biochemical ramifications of cobalamin limitation are not well
   understood. In a laboratory setting, we grew the diatom Thalassiosira
   pseudonana under replete and low cobalamin conditions to elucidate
   changes in metabolite pools. Using metabolomics, we show that the diatom
   experienced a metabolic cascade under cobalamin limitation that affected
   the central methionine cycle, transsulfuration pathway, and composition
   of osmolyte pools. In T. pseudonana, 5'-methylthioadenosine decreased
   under low cobalamin conditions, suggesting a disruption in the diatom's
   polyamine biosynthesis. Furthermore, two acylcarnitines accumulated
   under low cobalamin, suggesting the limited use of an
   adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl CoA mutase. Overall,
   these changes in metabolite pools yield insight into the metabolic
   consequences of cobalamin limitation in diatoms and suggest that
   cobalamin availability may have consequences for microbial interactions
   that are based on metabolite production by phytoplankton. (C) 2019

Abstract = {The short and medium-term coastal evolution of Necochea Municipality,
   Buenos Aires province (Argentina) was studied. The medium-term evolution
   study was based on aerial photographs from 1967 and 1984, and satellite
   images from 2004, using the dune or cliff toe as coastline indicator.
   The short-term evolution was studied from February 2006 to December 2009
   by means of seasonal beach profiles and sediment sampling. Results
   showed that in the medium-term at Necochea, the coastline has remained
   stable or has advanced. Whereas in the short-term, the analysis has
   evidenced incipient erosion processes. On the other hand, at Quequ,n the
   retreat of the coastline and the negative sedimentary balances (medium
   and short-term) are clearly indicating an accentuated erosion process.
   The different degrees of coastal erosion are related in part to beach
   vulnerability to wave storms but mainly to anthropogenic actions, which
   have affected the beach sediment supply. These results evidence the
   necessity to develop a coastal management programme.},

Abstract = {A coupled ice-ocean Arctic ocean model is forced with output from a
   Canadian Climate Center (CCC) model of the atmosphere. Two cases are
   considered the first where the atmospheric CO2 is `'normal'' and the
   second where the atmospheric CO2 is `'doubled.'' The CCC normal forcing
   data are also compared with observed fields. It is found that the
   forcing fields from the CCC normal model run are quite similar to
   observed values of surface temperature and humidity. The wind stresses
   are, however, lower than observed geostrophic values and are hence
   scaled to more closely match observed values. Significant differences
   are found between the normal and doubled CO2 forcing fields in regard to
   temperature and humidity forcing fields. In particular, the surface air
   temperature is typically 10 degrees Celsius warmer in the doubled case
   for the winter months, and the relative humidity is up to 50\% higher in
   the summer months. The surface moisture flux from the CCC data is found
   to be relatively insensitive to doubling of CO2, with more precipitation
   less evaporation (P-E) in winter months. When the ice-ocean model is
   run, less ice volume and increased areas of open ocean are observed with
   the doubled forcing, however, the decrease in ice volume is not as large
   as previous, simpler models have suggested and the model ice cover
   differs significantly from the ice cover from the atmospheric model. It
   is also found that there are differences in the oceanic temperature and
   salinity fields consistent with the forcing inputs; but these appear to
   be minimized by the insulating properties of the ice cover. On balance.
   the Arctic ice field appears to act as a regulator of climate change,
   rather than an accelerator.},

Abstract = {Overexploitation and climate change can reduce the abundance and shift
   the spatial distribution of marine species. Determining the habitat
   suitability of a mobile pelagic species, such as blue marlin (BUM)
   Makaira nigricans and black marlin (BAM) Istiompax indica, can help
   describe their spatiotemporal distribution patterns over a broad spatial
   scale, which is crucial for fisheries management. We applied a species
   distribution model (MaxEnt) to model the dynamic suitable habitat of BUM
   and BAM using 14 yr (1997-2010) of Inter-American Tropical Tuna
   Commission occurrence data (n = 20 348) from purse-seine vessels in the
   eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) and high-resolution remotely sensed
   oceanographic data. The spatial distribution of suitable habitat for
   both species varied seasonally and in response to El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO), with BUM positively correlated with chlorophyll a
   (chl a) concentrations and sea surface temperature and BAM with chl a
   concentrations and sea surface height. The influence of these
   environmental variables shifted seasonally suitable habitat between
   coastal (winter and spring) and oceanic (summer and fall) waters. During
   La Nina events, suitable habitat was along the equator, while during El
   Nino, suitable habitat shifted to farther northern and southern waters
   of the EPO. Analyses on species' centers of suitable habitat (CSH)
   revealed that the strength of ENSO did not influence CSH; however, large
   displacements were observed during these events. The models applied in
   our study provide critical information on the spatiotemporal patterns of
   2 mobile pelagic predators, which can potentially be used to forecast
   future distributions and develop effective management strategies in
   response to climate change.},

Title = {Soil Carbon Fractions from an Alluvial Soil Texture Gradient in North

Volume = {81},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1096-1106},

Abstract = {Soil texture is known to affect soil organic C (SOC) concentration and
   microbial activity, but these relationships are not always
   straightforward. We characterized total, mineral-associated, and
   mineralizable C fractions along a gradient of soil texture within a
   flood plain field in the Coastal Plain region of North Carolina. Soil
   was collected from 0-to 5-, 5-to 15-, and 15-to 30-cm depth intervals at
   204 locations within a 7-ha area. Samples were analyzed for soil
   particle size distribution, specific surface area (SSA),
   oxalate-extractable Al and Fe to estimate short-range-ordered (i.e.,
   poorly crystalline) oxyhydroxides, and soil C fractions. Overall,
   relationships among soil C fractions, textural classes, and depths were
   complex. Both SOC (0.4-13.9 g kg(-1) soil) and mineral-associated
   organic C (0-12 g kg(-1) soil) increased as soil clay concentration
   increased (73-430 g kg(-1) soil), but having two distinct slopes in each
   relationship with an inflection point of similar to 50 g clay kg(-1)
   soil at 0 to 5 and 5 to 15 cm and an inflection point of similar to 250
   g clay kg(-1) soil at 15 to 30 cm. As clay concentration increased, SSA
   (12-76 m(2) g(-1) soil) and oxalate-extractable Fe (0.45-5.9 g kg(-1)
   soil) also increased. A weaker relationship was observed between
   oxalate-extractable Al (0.38-1.5 g kg(-1) soil) and either SSA or
   mineral-associated organic C. Mineralizable C increased with increasing
   clay concentration up until 143 +/- 3, 152 +/- 5, and 161 +/- 11 g
   kg(-1) (0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm, respectively), but decreased (0-5 and
   5-15 cm) or stayed constant (15-30 cm) at higher clay concentrations. On
   the basis of untested observations, we surmise that binding of C to
   oxalate-extractable Fe contributed to the accumulation of SOC and
   suppression of mineralizable C as the clay concentration increased.
   These results suggest that complex soil texture-physicochemical
   interactions underlie the inherent fertility of floodplain soils.},

Title = {Research on self-propelled performance of multi-body system of
   wave-driven robot},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {221},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {wave-driven robot is a flexible multi-body dynamic system driven by
   ocean waves. Self-propelled performance is an important index of
   wave-driven robot, which includes propulsion performance, resistance
   performance and rapidity of wave-driven robot, as well as its ability to
   capture and utilize ocean wave energy. However, the wavedriven robot
   belongs to flexible multi-body structure, whose dynamic model is more
   complex compared with conventional ocean vehicle, and the motion of
   wave-driven robot is completely driven by waves. It is difficult to
   predict its dynamic response and kinematic performance. In this paper, a
   numerical method is developed to solve the self-propelled process of
   wave-driven robot by coupling flexible multi-body dynamics and
   computational fluid dynamics. Firstly, the flexible multi-body dynamic
   model of the whole wave-driven robot is established. Secondly, the
   numerical flow field which can simulate regular waves is established.
   Finally, the dynamic model is combined with the numerical flow field,
   and the self-propelled process of the wave-driven robot is simulated by
   overlapping grid under typical wave parameters, and the propulsion
   performance, resistance performance and rapidity of wave-driven robot
   are analysed in depth. Through the test in water pool, it is found that
   the prediction accuracy of the velocity of float can reach 92.52\%.},

Abstract = {Current shifts in ecosystem composition and function emphasize the need
   for an understanding of the links between environmental factors and
   organism fitness and tolerance. The examples discussed here illustrate
   how recent progress in the field of comparative physiology may provide a
   better mechanistic understanding of the ecological concepts of the
   fundamental and realized niches and thus provide insights into the
   impacts of anthropogenic disturbance. Here we argue that, as a link
   between physiological and ecological indicators of organismal
   performance, the mechanisms shaping aerobic scope and passive tolerance
   set the dimensions of an animal's niche, here defined as its capacity to
   survive, grow, behave, and interact with other species. We demonstrate
   how comparative studies of cod or killifish populations in a latitudinal
   cline have unraveled mitochondrial mechanisms involved in establishing a
   species' niche, performance, and energy budget. Riverine fish exemplify
   how the performance windows of various developmental stages follow the
   dynamic regimes of both seasonal temperatures and river hydrodynamics,
   as synergistic challenges. Finally, studies of species in extreme
   environments, such as the tilapia of Lake Magadi, illustrate how on
   evolutionary timescales functional and morphological shifts can occur,
   associated with new specializations. We conclude that research on the
   processes and time course of adaptations suitable to overcome current
   niche limits is urgently needed to assess the resilience of species and
   ecosystems to human impact, including the challenges of global climate
   change.},

Title = {Experimental and numerical investigation of cavitation in marine Diesel
   injectors},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {169},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {To further increase the efficiency and decrease emissions of large
   two-stroke marine Diesel engines, the understanding of the fuel
   injection, spray breakup and the resulting combustion plays a vital
   role. Investigations have shown that the strongly asymmetrically and
   eccentrically arranged nozzle bores of the fuel injectors can lead to
   undesirable spray deflections that provoke increased component
   temperatures, emissions and fuel consumption. In order to investigate
   the origin of these spray deviations, transparent nozzles have been used
   to qualitatively visualize the in-nozzle flow under realistic
   geometrical and fuel pressure conditions. Three different, 0.75 mm
   diameter, single-hole nozzle geometries that represent typical
   geometrical characteristics have been used in cavitating nozzle flow
   experiments. The optical measurement technique Shadowgraphy has been
   applied to visualize the in-nozzle flow over the complete fuel injection
   process. The experiments have been performed with Diesel fuel at a rail
   pressure of 50 MPa with ambient back-pressure and temperature.
   Impingement measurements have been executed to compare the nozzle
   performance and validate CFD simulations using URANS with cavitation
   modeling in order to provide qualitative and quantitative support to the
   experimental results. The volume of fluid (VOF) method has been applied
   to simulate the multiphase flow with High Resolution Interface Capturing
   (HRIC). The cavitation model is based on a flash-boiling method with
   rapid heat transfer between the liquid and vapor phases. A Homogeneous
   Relaxation Model (HRM) has been utilized to describe the rate at which
   the instantaneous quality, the mass fraction of vapor in a two-phase
   mixture, will approach its equilibrium value.
   The numerical modeling of the cavitation inside the nozzle bore and the
   evaluated momentum flux have been compared to the experimental findings
   and show good agreement for the qualitative comparison of the cavitation
   patterns and differences of less than 6\% for the quantitative momentum
   flux comparison. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {11-12},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An improved method is developed to couple an inner domain solution of
   the blade element momentum theory with an outer domain solution of the
   Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations for evaluating performance of
   tidal current turbines. A mesh sensitivity study shows that a mesh of at
   least 6 M cells with at least 40\% of these within the turbine wake is
   required to ensure satisfactory convergence of the velocity deficit. In
   addition to the usually applied axial momentum source terms, angular
   momentum and turbulence intensity source terms are shown to be required
   to model the near wake evolution. Three different lateral turbine
   spacing of 2, 4 and 6 turbine diameters are used to demonstrate the
   influence of the effective channel blockage on the velocity distribution
   in the turbine bypass region, the rate of spread of the wake and the
   recovery of velocity distribution. A final study shows that for a fixed
   number of turbines minimising the lateral spacing within each row, with
   a small number of staggered rows spaced as longitudinally as far apart
   as practical, is the most effective strategy for energy capture. (C)

Abstract = {In this paper, we report about hydrothermal synthesis, structural
   characterization and photocatalytic properties of beta-silver molybdate
   (beta-Ag2MoO4) microcrystals obtained at different temperatures (100,
   120, 140 and 160 degrees C) for 2 h. These crystals were characterized
   structurally using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence, Rietveld
   refinement, micro-Raman (m-Raman) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR)
   spectroscopies. Experimental and theoretical band gap values were
   correlated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance
   spectroscopy and periodic first-principles calculations in the framework
   of density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP-D3 hybrid functional.
   The crystals morphology was observed through field-emission scanning
   electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images. The photocatalytic properties of
   these crystals were investigated for degradation of rhodamine B (RhB)
   dye under UV-light. XRD patterns and Rietveld refinement data indicate
   that all crystals exhibit a spinel-type cubic structure with space group
   (Fd3'm) formed by tetrahedral {[}MoO4] clusters and distorted octahedral
   {[}AgO6] clusters. m-Raman spectra exhibited five Raman-active modes in
   a range from 50 to 1000 cm(-1), while FT-IR spectra have three infrared
   active modes in a range from 400 to 1100 cm(-1). The experimental
   results from Raman and IR modes are in reasonable agreement with
   theoretically calculated results. Experimental UV-Vis spectra indicate a
   decrease in optical band gap (E-ga(p )= 3.35 eV to 3.32 eV) with the
   temperature rise. The calculated band structure revealed an indirect
   optical band gap (E-gap) of approximately 3.94 eV. Moreover, theoretical
   calculations based on density of states and electron density maps were
   employed to understand the polarization phenomenon induced by structural
   defects in the beta-Ag2MoO4 microcrystals. FE-SEM images revealed that
   the increase of processing temperatures promotes a change in shape of
   microcrystals from potatoes-like to coral-like. Finally, photocatalytic
   measures to degradation of the RhB dye resulted in the best catalytic
   performance for beta-Ag2MoO4 microcrystals synthesized at temperatures
   of 120 and 140 degrees C, corresponding to 97.3\% and 96.8\% in the
   photodegradation of RhB dye under UV-light up to 2 h. The stability of
   the beta-Ag2MoO4 was investigated by reusing, resulting in f 97.2, 93.9
   and 78.8\% degradation of the RhB dye for the first, second and third
   cycle, respectively. (C) 2018 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on

Abstract = {To assess the properties of aerosol particles generated over the surf
   zone, two experiments were held at the pier of Scripps Institution of
   Oceanography (SIO), La Jolla CA, and at the pier of the U. S. Army Corps
   of Engineers Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck NC. On both sites
   concentrations of surf-generated sea spray particles, wave parameters
   and meteorological conditions were measured. The surf-aerosol
   concentrations in the diameter range 0.2-10 microns were obtained from
   the difference in aerosol size distributions measured upwind and
   downwind of the surf zone. It was found that the flux of surf-generated
   particles at diameters at formation can be expressed in terms of wave
   energy dissipation, which itself is related to the properties of the
   incoming wavefield and the bathymetry of the beach. Although the flux
   can also be modeled in terms of wind speed, this relation is considered
   to be not universal and limited to low-to medium wind speeds. In Duck
   NC, two transport experiments were performed under offshore flow
   conditions. In this case, the surf-aerosol concentrations were obtained
   from the differences in three aerosol size distributions, measured just
   before and just behind the surf zone and up to 16 km downwind (out to
   sea). No significant decrease in concentration was observed at the
   farthest range, which suggests that an appreciable amount of
   surf-generated aerosols is advected over tens of kilometers.},

Title = {Laboratory experiment on rip current circulations over a moveable bed:
   Drifter measurements},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},

Abstract = {This study describes a laboratory experiment on rip current circulations
   over a moveable bed. Rip current characteristics over eight contrasting
   nature-like beach morphologies are investigated. The seabed varied from
   reasonably alongshore uniform to strongly alongshore nonuniform with
   crescentic patterns and bar-rip morphologies, representative of a full
   morphological down-state sequence. The same offshore shore-normal waves
   were generated by the wavemaker for the eight situations with the same
   mean water level to study the sensitivity of rip current characteristics
   as a function of the beach morphology only. In each case, a 30 to 60 min
   video run was used to track a large number of drifters released within
   the surf zone. Results show the presence of classic rip current patterns
   with counterrotating cells and a relatively narrow offshore-directed jet
   varying from shore-normal to strongly skewed. Wave-driven circulations
   were strongly unstable. Computed standard deviations of flow intensity
   and direction provide high-resolution information on the spatial
   variability of rip current instabilities. Highly pulsating and weakly
   directionally variable offshore-directed flow is observed in the rip
   neck for well-developed bar-rip morphologies that turns into a weakly
   pulsating and highly directional variable rip current flow with
   decreasing beach alongshore nonuniformity. Proposing a definition of rip
   current intensity based on the rip current circulation geometry, rip
   current intensity was found to linearly increase with increasing measure
   of beach alongshore nonuniformity within both the low-energy and
   moderate-energy rip current regimes. To date, our laboratory experiment
   provides the first extensive quantitative rip current information during
   a full down-state sequence for a given wave condition.},

Title = {Marine macroalgae in a circular economy context: A comprehensive
   analysis focused on residual biomass},
Journal = {BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The accumulation of Marine Macroalgal Waste (MMW) - drifted marine
   macroalgae - is a growing phenomenon. The lack of appropriate management
   protocols for this residual biomass leaves it mostly unmanaged or
   disposed of in landfills. Such inappropriate solutions lead to negative
   environmental impacts, health concerns and coastal degradation,
   representing an opportunity to develop the bioeconomy. Although a
   relevant number of studies exists on the use of edible marine macroalgae
   for several purposes, there is generally a lack of information
   concerning MMW valorisation, at both local and global scales. This
   review thus explores the ecological and biotechnological potential for
   the establishment of a new approach for MMW valorisation based in the
   circular and blue economies. It is supported in literature on the use of
   residual biomass whenever possible and also includes studies with fresh
   biomass to extrapolate, considering known characteristics of MMW;
   consequently, a roadmap for its utilisation is provided. The review
   includes characteristics of various seaweeds, MMW accumulation worldwide
   and traditional uses, together with the development of alternative and
   integrated valorisation strategies. By analysing a large number of
   studies, it was possible to perceive a clear potential to explore MMW to
   obtain renewable fuels, especially biogas and bioethanol and for use in
   agricultural activities. Allied to this, the extraction of value-added
   compounds, such as lipids, pigments, phenolic compounds and specific
   polysaccharides is highlighted, aiming to contribute to the development
   of an economically feasible zero-waste biorefinery approach.},

Title = {A workflow for hydroacoustic source analyses based on a scale-resolving
   flow simulation of a hubless propeller},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {261},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The steady increasing noise level in the oceans caused by shipping
   traffic and the resulting disturbance of marine mammals enhances the
   need for environmentally sustainable quiet ship propulsion systems.
   Acoustic optimizations as well as alternative propulsion concepts are
   able to reduce the noise emissions of ships. In terms of alternative
   propeller concepts, hubless propellers are a particularly interesting
   object of research due to their modified blade geometry and compact
   design. This work builds on a workflow that allows to calculate and
   analyze the hydroacoustic pressure field of a marine propeller. The
   transient pressure and velocity fields from a stress blended eddy
   simulation (SBES) of the hubless propeller was used for the calculation
   of the resulting hydroacoustic field using the expansion about
   incompressible Flow (EIF) approach. The calculation of the acoustic
   field is performed in a second step after the calculation of the flow
   field, which avoids the problem of the large disparity of time and
   length scales between the hydrodynamic and the acoustic field
   quantities. In addition, coherent flow structures were filtered using
   the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for specific analysis
   of the hubless propeller hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic. The acoustic
   source term \& part;p/\& part;t was furthermore calculated from the POD
   modes and time coefficients and used for the hydroacoustic analysis in
   order to identify dominant source regions of individual tonalities.
   Thus, this research aims to provide a workflow for hydroacoustic
   calculation and analysis as well as an approach for optimizations of
   marine propellers.},

Abstract = {The Okinawa Trough is one of three known hydrothermal sites worldwide
   where liquid carbon dioxide is emitted from the seafloor into the water
   column. In March 2008, investigations were performed at two active
   areas, Yonaguni Knoll IV and Hatoma Knoll, in order to identify impacts
   of hydrothermal venting on the water column chemistry. Vertical profiles
   of pH and redox potential (Eh) were recorded and discrete water samples
   were taken for the analysis of total carbon dioxide (C-T) and helium
   (He-3, He-4). Anomalies with respect to reference stations (C-T, pH) and
   He-3 with respect to saturation with the atmosphere (He-3(excess)) were
   used to characterize the impact of hydrothermal vents. These data
   indicate that the flux of CO2 into the water column is dominated by hot
   hydrothermal CO2-rich vents located in close proximity to the liquid CO2
   emission sites. Bubbles and droplets sampled at the cold gas outlets at
   Hatoma Knoll differed considerably from the water column regarding
   CO2/He-3 ratios, and thus, provide additional evidence that cold liquid
   phase CO2 is of minor importance for the total CO2 flux at both
   hydrothermal systems. Although hydrothermal vents at back-arc basins are
   known to emit large amounts of acids other than CO2, the correlation
   between pH and C-T at both research areas clearly suggests that the
   observed pH reduction is mainly caused by the addition of CO2. Deviating
   C-T/He-3 and C-T/pH ratios and the prevailing water currents indicate a
   yet undiscovered vent site at the flank of a seamount in the northeast.},

Abstract = {Organic matter production by cyanobacteria blooms is a major
   environmental concern for the Baltic Sea, as it promotes the spread of
   anoxic zones. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) measurements
   carried out on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) since 2003 have proven to be
   a powerful tool to resolve the carbon dynamics of the blooms in space
   and time. However, SOOP measurements lack the possibility to directly
   constrain depth-integrated net community production (NCP) in moles of
   carbon per surface area due to their restriction to the sea surface.
   This study tackles the knowledge gap through (1) providing an NCP best
   guess for an individual cyanobacteria bloom based on repeated profiling
   measurements of pCO(2) and (2) establishing an algorithm to accurately
   reconstruct depth-integrated NCP from surface pCO(2) observations in
   combination with modelled temperature profiles.
   Goal (1) was achieved by deploying state-of-the-art sensor technology
   from a small-scale sailing vessel. The low-cost and flexible platform
   enabled observations covering an entire bloom event that occurred in
   July-August 2018 in the Eastern Gotland Sea. For the biogeochemical
   interpretation, recorded pCO(2) profiles were converted to C-T{*}, which
   is the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration normalised to
   alkalinity. We found that the investigated bloom event was dominated by
   Nodularia and had many biogeochemical characteristics in common with
   blooms in previous years. In particular, it lasted for about 3 weeks,
   caused a C-T{*} drawdown of 90 mu mol kg(-1), and was accompanied by a
   sea surface temperature increase of 10 degrees C. The novel finding of
   this study is the vertical extension of the C-T{*} drawdown up to the
   compensation depth located at around 12 m. Integration of the C-T{*}
   drawdown across this depth and correction for vertical fluxes leads to
   an NCP best guess of similar to 1:2 mol m(-2) over the productive
   period.
   Addressing goal (2), we combined modelled hydrographical profiles with
   surface pCO(2) observations recorded by SOOP Finnmaid within the study
   area. Introducing the temperature penetration depth (TPD) as a new
   parameter to integrate SOOP observations across depth, we achieve an NCP
   reconstruction that agrees to the best guess within 10 \%, which is
   considerably better than the reconstruction based on a classical
   mixed-layer depth constraint.
   Applying the TPD approach to almost 2 decades of surface pCO(2)
   observations available for the Baltic Sea bears the potential to provide
   new insights into the control and long-term trends of cyanobacteria NCP.
   This understanding is key for an effective design and monitoring of
   conservation measures aiming at a Good Environmental Status of the
   Baltic Sea.},

Title = {Responsible Practices for Minimizing and Monitoring Environmental
   Impacts of Marine Seismic Surveys with an Emphasis on Marine Mammals},
Journal = {AQUATIC MAMMALS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {356-377},
Abstract = {Marine seismic surveys, which use loud, primarily low-frequency sound to
   penetrate the sea floor, are known to disturb and could harm marine
   life. The use of these surveys for conventional and alternative offshore
   energy development as well as research is expanding. Given their
   proliferation and potential for negative environmental impact, there is
   a growing need for systematic planning and operational standards to
   eliminate or at least minimize impacts, especially when surveys occur in
   sensitive areas. Mitigating immediate impacts is obviously critical, but
   monitoring for short-as well as long-term effects and impacts is also
   needed. Regulatory requirements for both mitigation and monitoring vary
   widely from one country or jurisdiction to another. Historically, most
   have focused on acute effects but share a common objective of minimizing
   potential adverse impacts. Specific examples in different areas are
   given to illustrate general approaches for predicting, minimizing, and
   measuring impacts for operations in essentially any marine environment.
   The critical elements of a robust mitigation and monitoring plan for
   responsibly conducting marine seismic surveys include obtaining baseline
   ecological data; substantial advance planning, communication, and
   critical review; integrated acoustic and visual monitoring during
   operations; and systematic analysis of results to inform future planning
   and mitigation.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {180},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper proposes and assesses policy options to achieve the
   objectives of the EU marine litter strategy, based on the existing EU
   legislation. A group of experts and stakeholders was involved through a
   multi-staged workshop organized to generate the information to assess
   the contribution of the policies to the set of objectives, as well as
   the relative importance of the objectives, on qualitative scales. The
   ELECTRE TRI multi-criteria decision analysis method was used to rate the
   policies, which were subsequently ranked. Per the results, all policies
   deserve to be considered, even when the more pessimistic assessments
   (33rd percentile) are used. Revising the Urban Wastewater Treatment
   Directive, setting legislative targets on marine litter and ensure they
   are fully monitored, and funding proven clean-up technologies were
   deemed to be the most potentially impactful policies. The remaining
   policies assessed can nevertheless play an important role in
   complementing the higher-ranked policies.},

Title = {Connectivity Patterns for Direct Developing Invertebrates in Fragmented
   Marine Habitats: Fish Farms Fouling as Source Population in the
   Establishment and Maintenance of Local Metapopulations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Artificial structures can be considered as high spatially structured
   habitats in the marine pelagic system, where patch connectivity would be
   strongly dependent on the exchange of larvae or dispersing individuals.
   Fish-farms located offshore may alter ecological connectivity, modifying
   trophic resources, and species dispersal among patches. High population
   densities of invertebrates can be found associated with fish-farm
   fouling communities, which can act as a seed source, contributing to the
   patterns of connectivity through individuals exchange between
   subpopulations or with sink populations. A field experiment was
   performed to analyse the role of fish-farms in the colonisation of new
   uninhabited habitats (floating experimental units) located at different
   positions relative to the fish farm and the main current, containing
   artificial habitats with and without feed pellets similar to those used
   in the fish farm. Amphipods were used as example of direct developing
   invertebrates for studying dispersing individuals from the fish farm to
   the new habitats. The richest and most abundant populations in this
   study were found close to and downstream of the fish farm, surpassing
   1,000 amphipods at their maximum. Moreover, some floating habitats
   located more than 2 km from the fish farm were colonised in only 15
   days. Thus, the role of fish farms has been shown to extend beyond a
   `stepping-stones' effect in species dispersal, and have an additional
   effect on ecological connectivity by increasing population sizes and
   acting as population source. Our study aims to provide recommendations
   for coastal zone management in order to predict potential spread from
   fish farms to other platforms in the future and promote solutions
   related to interactions and consequences of connectivity within and
   between marine facilities.},

Abstract = {In order to explore the effect of the amphoteric modifier dodecyl
   dimethyl betaine (BS-12) on the adsorption stability and morphology of
   copper along River, eight coastal soil samples of Cangxi (CX), Nanbu
   (CX), Jialing (JL), and Hechuan (HC) from Jialing River, Santai (ST),
   and Chuanshan (CS) from Fu River, Quxian (QX) and Guangan (GA) from Qu
   River were choose as the research objects. The adsorption and desorption
   of copper on original and BS-12 coexisted coastal soil samples were
   studied by batch treatment, and the morphological changes of copper
   adsorption were discussed. Results showed that: (1) The adsorption
   isotherms of Cu(2+)on original and BS-12 coexisted soil samples were all
   accorded with Langmuir model, and the maximum adsorption amount (q(m))
   of Cu2+ changed in 97.28-272.96 mmol/kg. The adsorption capacity of Cu2+
   on BS-12 coexisted soil was 1.07-2.52 times higher than that of the
   original soil (except JL). (2) The maximum desorption amount of Cu2+ in
   the tested soil sample was 5.10-51.05 mmol/kg. The Cu2+ adsorbed by
   BS-12 coexisted soil was easier to desorb than that in original soil,
   with the highest desorption rate of 42.8\%. (3) Cu absorbed on original
   and BS-12 coexisted soil were all the highest in carbonate binding form.
   Cu content in ion exchange form of BS-12 coexisted soil was higher than
   that of original soil, and Cu content in carbonate binding and Fe-Mn
   oxidation form was lower than that of original soil (except HC). (4)
   Cation exchange capacity (CEC) of original soil had a significant
   positive correlation with q(m) and carbonate bound copper content, while
   total organic carbon (TOC) had a significant negative correlation with
   Fe-Mn oxidation and organic bound copper. The change of pH in BS-12
   coexisted soils significantly affected the copper content in
   ion-exchanged and Fe-Mn oxide forms. Organic bound copper in BS-12
   coexisted soil significantly affected by CEC and TOC.},

Abstract = {Prolonged droughts and excessive water harvesting in western Asia has
   accelerated desertification and caused longer dry seasons of salt lakes.
   The Aral Sea experience has proven that dust from saline soil is a
   serious health issue. Various stabilization techniques to reduce wind
   erosion have been used in the past. However, in recent years, a
   potentially viable method has been developed; microbial induced calcite
   precipitation (MICP) has been introduced as a method of soil
   stabilization, though its effectiveness in saline soils remains to be
   examined. The effect of salt content in loose sandy soil on calcite
   precipitation of calcite through stimulation of native bacteria is
   investigated in this article. Samples with salinity up to 30\% salt
   content were prepared and treated with different culture medium
   compounds. A number of tests were used to evaluate the effect of the
   mentioned parameters. The results show that improvement increases with
   increasing salinity up to 5\% salt, and further increase in salinity
   reduces the effectiveness of improvement. It is also shown that the
   addition of urea in the culture medium has a significant effect on the
   urea hydrolysis which resulted in a five-fold increase in compressive
   strength. Four native strains of halotolerant urease-positive bacteria
   were also identified.},

Abstract = {Direct current (dc) microgrids are highly compatible with photovoltaic
   (PV) sources due to their dc nature. However, as PV penetration
   increases, conventional current-source control configurations tracking
   the maximum power point may encounter the overvoltage problem, among
   others. This paper presents a V-dp/dv droop control strategy, which
   enables the PV sources to work in the maximum power point tracking
   (MPPT) mode, as well as behave as voltage sources to participate in
   dc-bus voltage regulating. The V-dp/dv droop method unifies MPPT and
   dc-bus voltage regulating in the sense of using the same control
   configuration, which avoids the controller reconfiguration during the PV
   mode switching. Further, the coordinated operation of multiple PV
   sources in the dc microgrid, including autonomous mode switching and
   primarily power sharing, is achieved by the proposed control strategy
   without any communication. Hardware-in-loop tests are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Title = {Contribution of Ocean Physics and Dynamics at Different Scales to Heat
   Uptake in Low-Resolution AOGCMs},

Abstract = {Using an ensemble of atmosphere-ocean general circulation models
   (AOGCMs) in an idealized climate change experiment, this study
   quantifies the contributions to ocean heat uptake (OHU) from ocean
   physical parameterizations and resolved dynamical processes operating at
   different scales. Analysis of heat budget diagnostics reveals a
   leading-order global heat balance in the subsurface upper ocean in a
   steady state between the large-scale circulation warming it and
   mesoscale processes cooling it, and shows that there are positive
   contributions from processes on all scales to the subsurface OHU during
   climate change. There is better agreement among the AOGCMs in the net
   OHU than in the individual scales/processes contributing to it. In the
   upper ocean and at high latitudes, OHU is dominated by small-scale
   diapycnal processes. Below 400 m, OHU is dominated by the superresidual
   transport, representing large-scale ocean dynamics combined with all
   parameterized mesoscale and submesoscale eddy effects. Weakening of the
   AMOC leads to less heat convergence in the subpolar North Atlantic and
   less heat divergence at lower latitudes, with a small overall effect on
   the net Atlantic heat content. At low latitudes, the dominance of
   advective heat redistribution is contrary to the diffusive OHU mechanism
   assumed by the commonly used upwelling-diffusion model. Using a density
   water-mass framework, it is found that most of the OHU occurs along
   isopycnal directions. This feature of OHU is used to accurately
   reconstruct the global vertical ocean warming profile from the surface
   heat flux anomalies, supporting advective (rather than diffusive) models
   of OHU and sea level rise.},

Abstract = {Density, biomass and fish-habitat correlations were estimated for
   selected species of herbivorous fish on crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS)
   impacted and control reefs in the central Great Barrier Reef. The
   objective was to investigate a long-term numerical and/or biomass
   response to increased food availability (algal turfs) on COTS affected
   reefs. Out of 14 variates investigated, 2 showed evidence of a numerical
   response on COTS affected reefs. importantly, total number of
   individuals and total biomass showed no response. Instead, a negative
   effect (i.e. higher abundances on control reefs) was detected for
   Zebrasoma scopas, although this was attributable to very high abundances
   on one of the non-impacted reefs (Coil). Density of Siganus corallinus
   was higher on COTS impacted reefs; however, this was not greater than
   variability over time. On COTS affected reefs, there was a negative
   correlation of herbivorous fish with thick turf algal abundance and a
   positive correlation with live coral cover, whereas on non-affected
   reefs, there were a similar number of positive and negative correlations
   with thick turf algae and live coral. Additionally, a distinct
   cross-shelf trend in length frequency of Acanthurus nigrofuscus was
   observed. Differences in food availability, wave energy and
   intraspecific competition were hypothesized to be important factors in
   this observed distribution.},

Abstract = {Assessing sustainability of coastal groundwater is significant for
   groundwater management as coastal groundwater is vulnerable to
   over-exploitation and contamination. To address the issues of serious
   groundwater level drawdown and potential seawater intrusion risk of a
   multi-layered coastal aquifer system in Zhanjiang, China, this paper
   presents a numerical modelling study to research groundwater
   sustainability of this aquifer system. The transient modelling results
   show that the groundwater budget was negative (-3826x10(4) to
   -4502x10(4) m(3)/a) during the years 2008-2011, revealing that this
   aquifer system was over-exploited. Meanwhile, the groundwater
   sustainability was assessed by evaluating the negative hydraulic
   pressure area (NHPA) of the unconfined aquifer and the groundwater level
   dynamic and flow velocity of the offshore boundaries of the confined
   aquifers. The results demonstrate that the Nansan Island is most
   influenced by NHPA and that the local groundwater should not be
   exploited. The results also suggest that, with the current groundwater
   exploitation scheme, the sustainable yield should be 1.784 x 10(8)
   m(3)/a (i.e., decreased by 20\% from the current exploitation amount).
   To satisfy public water demands, the 20\% decrease of the exploitation
   amount can be offset by the groundwater sourced from the Taiping
   groundwater resource field. These results provide valuable guidance for
   groundwater management of Zhanjiang.},

Abstract = {Primary production rates were determined in the central North Pacific

   measurements were made over periods of 12 and 24 h.  In situ rates were
   measured at three depths within the surface mixed layer and compared to
   in vitro changes in bottles.  Clean techniques were used for the
   collection and incubation of samples.  Rates of gross production, net
   community production and respiration determined from in vitro
   incubations compared favourably with in situ derived rates, with no
   evidence of major (i.e. 10-fold) systematic discrepancies between the
   two approaches.  High chlorophyll-normalized rates of photosynthesis
   were measured both in vitro and in situ, which was taken as strong
   evidence that in vitro techniques were not seriously in error.  The in
   situ rates of production were shown to be sufficient to produce the
   observed sub-surface oxygen maximum of ca 107-110\% and to sustain the
   calculated losses of oxygen to the atmosphere from the mixed layer and

Title = {Surprisingly complex community discovered in the mid-Devonian fossil
   forest at Gilboa},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {The origin of trees by the mid-Devonian epoch (398-385 million years
   ago) signals a major change in terrestrial ecosystems with potential
   long-term consequences including increased weathering, drop in
   atmospheric CO2, modified climate, changes in sedimentation patterns and
   mass extinction(1-3). However, little is known about the ecology of
   early forests or how changes in early terrestrial ecosystems influenced
   global processes. One of the most famous palaeontological records for
   this time is the `oldest fossil forest' at Riverside Quarry, Gilboa, New
   York, USA, discovered in the 1920s(4,5). Hundreds of large
   Eospermatopteris sandstone casts, now thought to represent the bases of
   standing cladoxylopsid trees(6), were recovered from a horizon that was
   originally interpreted as a muddy swamp. After quarry operations ceased,
   relatively minor outcrops of similar fossils at nearby localities have
   provided limited opportunities to evaluate this pervasive view using
   modern methods(7,8). In 2010, removal of the quarry backfill enabled
   reappraisal of the palaeoecology of this important site. Here we
   describe a 1,200 m(2) map showing numerous Eospermatopteris root systems
   in life position within a mixed-age stand of trees. Unexpectedly, large
   woody rhizomes with adventitious roots and aerial branch systems
   identified as aneurophytalean progymnosperms run between, and probably
   climb into, Eospermatopteris trees. We describe the overall habit for
   these surprisingly large aneurophytaleans, the earliest fossil group
   having wood produced by a bifacial vascular cambium. The site also
   provides evidence for arborescence within lycopsids, extending the North
   American range for trees in this ecologically critical group. The
   rooting horizon is a dark grey sandy mudstone showing limited root
   penetration. Although clearly belonging to a wetland coastal plain
   environment(9), the forest was probably limited in duration and subject
   to periodic disturbance. These observations provide fundamental
   clarification of the palaeoecology of this mixed-group early forest,
   with important implications for interpreting coeval assemblage data
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Global sea surface height anomaly signals from the TOPEX/Poseidon
   satellite altimeter from 1992 to 2000 are filtered into several spectral
   bands. These bands include propagating (Rossby, Kelvin, and tropical
   instability waves) and nonpropagating (annual and interannual
   basin-scale variability and eddies) signals. These signals are
   decomposed through a series of finite impulse response band-pass
   filters. Phase speed, period, wavelength, and amplitude are estimated.
   Signal-to-noise ratio, methodological errors, and natural variability
   are also estimated. Results are shown for the Pacific, Atlantic, and
   Indian basins for four Rossby wave components with periods between 3 and
   24 months. Equatorial Kelvin waves and tropical instability waves are
   shown as peripheral results. The clearest and most energetic wave
   signals are generally observed for annual Rossby waves. Semiannual
   Rossby waves often have the largest amplitudes near the tropics. The
   Rossby wave phase speeds are in agreement with the linear theory, except
   for a similar to25\% bias toward high speeds found in mid to high
   latitudes. This revitalizes the idea that on the average the Rossby wave
   signal in the ocean is in the form of free waves.},

Abstract = {Policy development is a dynamic and cyclic process characterised by
   successive stages of development, implementation and evaluation.
   Throughout this process, interaction between science and coastal
   management plays an important role. An illustration is given in this
   paper, based on an analysis of the history of coastal policy in the
   Netherlands over the last two decades. Evaluation in 1995 of the coastal
   policy of Dynamic Preservation, developed during the late 80's and
   implemented in 1990, led to a redefinition in 2000. Implementation in
   2001, of a sustainable coastal policy in the Netherlands with both a
   small- and a large-scale approach, is the result.
   The analysis in this paper indicates that the successful development and
   implementation of coastal policy in the Netherlands, is related to the
   use of a systematic `frame of reference'; characteristics are explicit
   definitions of both strategic and operational objectives applied in a
   4-step decision recipe of (1) a quantitative state concept, (2) a bench
   marking procedure, (3) a procedure for CZM measures or intervention and
   (4) an evaluation procedure. Applications of this frame of reference
   show its high potential to better integrate coastal science and coastal
   policy and -management and to stimulate co-operation.},

Abstract = {Cooling greenhouses in the Arabian Peninsula is very crucial to extend
   the growing season. This poster presentation reviews modification and
   inclusion of greenhouse cooling through optimization of the most
   commonly used evaporative cooling system in the region. In Kuwait,
   researchers conducted a study on four identical greenhouses, each
   equipped with different cooling systems: two positive pressure cooling
   systems, with fans respectively located at the top and at the bottom of
   the cooling chamber and two negative cooling systems, with air entry
   inlet respectively located at the top and at the bottom of the cooling
   chamber. In United Arab Emirates the evaporative-cooled greenhouses were
   equipped with desiccant pads for the purpose of removing the water vapor
   from the incoming air streams. In these greenhouses solar energy was
   used to regenerate desiccant solution and maintain their desiccant
   properties. In Oman, researchers used sea water, instead of scarce
   freshwater for operating the cooling systems. They were able to reduce
   the consumption of freshwater to zero compared to the classical cooling
   systems, for which the consumption of water represents about 2/3 of the
   total freshwater used in greenhouse production. In Bahrain, researchers
   came up with an oval-shape greenhouse enabling them to increase the
   cooling efficiency by reducing the air relative humidity before it
   passes over the cooling pads. These studies gave positive results with
   respect to water consumption, profitability, and growing season
   extension. But they also concluded that additional research is required
   to determine an optimal configuration of a greenhouse to meet climatic
   conditions of the Arabian Peninsula.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {417},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to review and present the state of the arte
   about the status of toxic elements (TEs) in soils and assess the
   potential risk using single and total complex pollution indices in a
   global scale. We compiled, integrated, and analyzed soil TE pollution
   data over almost a decade through key maps, which have not been reviewed
   up to date. All the in-situ and ex-situ remediation treatments have been
   also reviewed, illustrated, and compared, for the first time. The future
   perspectives have been discussed and summarized. This review
   demonstrates that the cornerstone maps and integrated information
   provide reliable geographical coordinates and inclusive information on
   TEs pollution, particularly in China. In-situ treatment approaches for
   TEs polluted soils are more cost-effective and applicable than ex-situ
   treatment trials. Selecting a feasible remediation strategy should to
   take the extent of contamination, treatment objectives, site
   characteristics, cost-efficiency, and public suitability into account.
   The summarized findings in this review may help to develop innovative
   and applicable methods for assessing the global soil pollution by TEs.
   Also, these findings may help to develop innovative, applicable, and
   feasibly economic methods for sustainable management of TEs contaminated
   soils to mitigate the environmental and human health risk.},

Title = {Layout of CCS monitoring infrastructure with highest probability of

Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Monitoring of the marine environment for indications of a leak, or
   precursors of a leak, will be an intrinsic part of any subsea CO2
   storage projects. A real challenge will be quantification of the
   probability of a given monitoring program to detect a leak and to design
   the program accordingly. The task complicates by the number of pathways
   to the surface, difficulties to estimate probabilities of leaks and
   fluxes, and predicting the fluctuating footprint of a leak. The
   objective is to present a procedure for optimizing the layout of a fixed
   array of chemical sensors on the seafloor, using the probability of
   detecting a leak as metric. A synthetic map from the North Sea is used
   as a basis for probable leakage points, while the spatial footprint is
   based on results from a General Circulation Model. Compared to an
   equally spaced array the probability of detecting a leak can be nearly
   doubled by an optimal placement of the available sensors. It is not
   necessarily best to place the first in the location of the highest
   probable leakage point, one sensor can monitor several potential leakage
   points. The need for a thorough baseline in order to reduce the
   detection threshold is shown. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Passive fluid transport, which plays a crucial role in a wide range of
   processes from engineering to biology field, is becoming increasingly
   attractive due to the prospect of a lower energy demand. Here, we focus
   the attention on passive thermal evaporation, which is considered an
   emerging and promising water treatment technique. In detail, we report
   an extensive theoretical study of capillary-driven fluid flow in
   hydrophilic and porous materials to be used as thermal evaporators in
   water treatment devices such as vapor generators or distillers. These
   materials are designed to spontaneously and properly soak up the water
   to be treated and absorb thermal energy, establishing a continuous vapor
   generation. Design guidelines are reported and extensively discussed
   with the aim of preventing dry-out phenomena, which could compromise the
   correct functioning of the component and limit the performance. The
   results presented here envision a potential component size on the order
   of meters, which is, to the best of our knowledge, two orders of
   magnitude more than the size effectively explored in the experimental
   tests reported in the recent literature. Moreover, this modelling
   framework may be leveraged to assist innovation actions on materials
   and/or manufacturing techniques, further increasing the competitiveness
   and the widespread deployment of passive and sustainable solutions.},

Title = {Experimental Investigation of Fouling Behavior of 90/10 Cu/Ni Tube by

Abstract = {This paper describes an advanced monitoring system for fouling
   phenomenon in a wide range of tubular heat exchangers such as condensers
   and intercoolers. First, a mathematical model of fouling resistance in
   tubular heat exchangers is adapted. The model is based on the applied
   thermal power, the inside heat transfer coefficient, and geometrical
   characteristics of the heat exchanger under consideration. The resulting
   model is a function of measured quantities such as water and tube wall
   temperatures, fluid flow velocity, and some physical properties of the
   fluid flowing inside the tubes, such as viscosity, conductivity, and
   density. Second, an on-line fouling monitoring system was prepared, and
   the heat transfer resistance for selected solutions was measured in real
   time by this system. The effect of concentration and chemical reactions
   on fouling was studied experimentally using contaminants such as sodium
   bicarbonate, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and a mixture of sodium
   bicarbonate and calcium chloride. Experimental results provide
   quantitative information of liquid-side fouling on heat transfer
   surfaces, and its effects on the thermal efficiency. Experimental data
   are critical for heat exchanger design and for planning operating and
   cleaning schedules of the heat exchanger. Uncertainty analysis shows
   that the experimental results are acceptable and the experimental setup
   is appropriate for measuring fouling resistance in industrial
   applications. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004165]},

Abstract = {Understanding the long-term response of CO2 injected into porous
   reservoirs is one of the most important aspects to demonstrate safe and
   permanent storage. In order to provide quantitative constraints on the
   long-term impacts of CO2-charged fluids on the integrity of
   reservoir-caprock systems we recovered some 300m of core from a
   scientific drill hole through a natural CO2 reservoir, near Green River,
   Utah. We obtained geomechanical, mineralogical, geochemical,
   petrophysical and mineralogical laboratory data along the entire length
   of the core and from non CO2-charged control samples. Furthermore, we
   performed more detailed studies through portions of low permeability
   layers in direct contact with CO2-charged layers. This was done to
   constrain the nature and penetration depths of CO2-promoted
   fluid-mineral reaction fronts. The major reactions identified include
   the dissolution of diagenetic dolomite cements and hematite grain
   coatings, and the precipitation of ankerite and pyrite and have been
   used as input for geochemical 1D reactive transport modelling, to
   constrain the magnitude and velocity of the mineral-fluid reaction
   front.
   In addition, we compared geomechanical data from the CO2-exposed core
   and related unreacted control samples to assess the mechanical stability
   of reservoir and seal rocks in a CO2 storage complex following mineral
   dissolution and precipitation for thousands of years. The obtained
   mechanical parameters were coupled to mineralogy and porosity. Key aim
   of this work was to better quantify the effect of long-term chemical
   CO2/brine/rock interactions on the mechanical strength and elastic
   properties of the studied formations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Sand-spit accumulations at the mouths of the eastern Cantabrian
   estuaries: The example of the Oka estuary (Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve)},
Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {364},
Pages = {206-216},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {The majority of the eastern Cantabrian estuaries occur on a coast with
   waves approaching dominantly from a NW direction. However, at their
   mouths sand-spit accumulations occur on their eastern margin. These
   sedimentary features have extended westwards, although the main littoral
   transport path on this coast is dominantly eastwards. The origin,
   morphology and development of these sand accumulations can be considered
   unusual, because they do not show the expected sedimentary response.
   Through a multidisciplinary approach (surface sediment analysis,
   morphodynamic, oceanographic and meteorological monitoring, and
   mathematical modelling) developed during the period May 2005eApril 2006
   in the Oka estuary, it has been possible to establish a genetic,
   hydrodynamic and morphodynamic sedimentary model for these estuaries.
   The main factors to determine the origin of these sedimentary features
   are wave intensity and direction, wave refraction and diffraction
   processes, spatial orientation and morphology of estuarine mouths, tidal
   range and the intensity and direction of tidal currents. On this coast,
   but elsewhere due to the influence of headlands, usually situated in the
   western margin of the estuarine mouths, wave diffraction and a variation
   in energy occur along the approaching waves. Consequently, wave set-up
   is forced in the eastern side of the estuarine mouths. Because of this
   induced wave pressure gradient an energy-compensation is needed and thus
   wave induced currents towards southwest originate. The action of the
   tidal currents is also important. In this paper a cyclical sedimentary
   transport pattern for the nearshore zone around the mouths of these
   estuaries is described. This process is taking place under tidal
   influence that induces wave set-up and breaking processes and reinforces
   also the sedimentary transport towards the estuarine inlet. The
   combination of all these hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes has
   produced these ``anomalously-oriented{''} sedimentary features. (C) 2014

Title = {Investigating a conventional and retrofit power plant on-board a
   Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ship from a sustainability perspective - A life
   cycle assessment case study},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {117},

Abstract = {Following the enforcement of MARPOL Annex VI Regulations for the
   Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships, retrofitting conventional power
   plants with emerging technologies is seen as a means to promote
   sustainability of marine transport and comply with more stringent
   emissions legislation. However, a knowledge gap exists as the
   environmental performance of retrofit power plant solutions
   incorporating emerging technologies has not been examined using an
   integrated system approach based on Life Cycle Assessment. The purpose
   of this research was to investigate if integrating selected emerging
   technologies i.e. photovoltaic systems, lithium-ion batteries, cold
   ironing and power-take-off/power-take-in systems supplemented by
   frequency converters and variable frequency drives into an existing
   power plant would be to the advantage of a chosen ship type i.e.
   Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ships, from the perspectives of resource
   consumption and environmental burden. Using the power plant of an
   existing vessel as a case study, it was found that cast iron, steel,
   copper and aluminium were the four materials most commonly consumed
   during manufacturing phase i.e. 2.9 x 10(5) kg, 1.9 x 10(5) kg, 5.3 x
   10(4) kg and 2.9 x 10(4) kg respectively. By burning 2.9 x 10(7) kg of
   heavy fuel oil and 2.3 x 10(8) kg of marine diesel oil during operation,
   8.2 x 10(8) kg of carbon dioxide, 1.7 x 10(7) kg of nitrogen oxides, 6.1
   x 10(6) kg of sulphur dioxide, 7.6 x 10(5) kg of carbon monoxide, 6.5 x
   10(5) kg of hydrocarbon and 4.7 x 10(5) kg of particulate matter would
   be released. Over a projected 30-year period, emissions released to air
   and freshwater were found to be significant. Based on 3 characterisation
   methodologies, ecotoxicity potential, with 7-10 orders of magnitude, was
   identified as the most significant environmental burden. Consuming and
   storing resources had the least impact, operating diesel engines and
   auxiliary generators had a moderate impact, and disposing metallic waste
   had the highest impact. The research concluded that the environmental
   burden caused by a marine power plant was significant but retrofitting
   existing power plant with suitable emerging technologies could reduce a
   number of impacts by 4-7 orders of magnitude, as verified via scenario
   analysis. However, the system should be designed and managed with due
   care as the environmental benefits, such as lower fuel consumption,
   emission reduction and performance improvement in some environmental
   measures are always achieved at the expense of an increase in other
   detrimental impacts. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   albatrosses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {13},
Number = {119},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Changes to patterns of wind and ocean currents are tightly linked to
   climate change and have important implications for cost of travel and
   energy budgets in marine vertebrates. We evaluated how El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO)-driven wind patterns affected breeding Laysan and
   black-footed albatross across a decade of study. Owing to latitudinal
   variation in wind patterns, wind speed differed between habitat used
   during incubation and brooding; during La Nina conditions, wind speeds
   were lower in incubating Laysan (though not black-footed) albatross
   habitat, but higher in habitats used by brooding albatrosses. Incubating
   Laysan albatrosses benefited from increased wind speeds during El Nino
   conditions, showing increased travel speeds and mass gained during
   foraging trips. However, brooding albatrosses did not benefit from
   stronger winds during La Nina conditions, instead experiencing stronger
   cumulative headwinds and a smaller proportion of trips in tailwinds.
   Increased travel costs during brooding may contribute to the lower
   reproductive success observed in La Nina conditions. Furthermore,
   benefits of stronger winds in incubating habitat may explain the higher
   reproductive success of Laysan albatross during El Nino conditions. Our
   findings highlight the importance of considering habitat accessibility
   and cost of travel when evaluating the impacts of climate-driven habitat
   change on marine predators.},

Title = {Extending the design space in solvent extraction - from supercritical
   fluids to pressurized liquids using carbon dioxide, ethanol, ethyl

Abstract = {Plants and food byproducts contain high-value bioactive compounds like
   carotenoids, tocopherols, flavonoids, and other phenolic compounds that
   can potentially be extracted prior to usage of the lower-ranked biomass,
   all in line with a circular bioeconomy. Extraction is typically
   performed by leaching using an organic solvent, or alternatively with
   more advanced techniques such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE),
   pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), microwave assisted extraction (MAE)
   or ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE). With the exception of SFE, mass
   transfer is enhanced and solvent consumption is minimised by the use of
   elevated temperature, which has a negative impact on the extraction
   yield and structural preservation for thermally labile bioactive
   compounds. Hence, in this study we aim to explore the use of CO2 in
   extraction solvent mixtures as a viscosity-lowering entrainer.
   Furthermore, we aim to disregard the instrumental boundaries between SFE
   and PLE by extending the design space for extraction method development,
   using solvent mixtures of pressurized carbon dioxide, water, and either
   ethanol or ethyl lactate, covering a uniquely large area of the
   solvent's relative permittivity. Such a strategy will inherently enable
   extraction method optimisation for target compounds differing a lot in
   polarity, here demonstrated for beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, and
   quercetin in sea buckthorn berry pomace. Our results show that by the
   use of experimental design, optimum extraction conditions were found for
   each of the three compounds: supercritical CO2 with 10 vol\% of ethanol
   at 300 bar and 80 degrees C for beta-carotene, liquid CO2/ethanol/water
   (50/44/6, v/v/v) at 210 bar and 60 degrees C for alpha-tocopherol, and
   liquid CO2/ethyl lactate/water (33/54/13, v/v/v) at 200 bar and 62
   degrees C for quercetin. Extraction rates were fast in all three cases,
   giving complete extractions within less than 20 min at the highest flow
   rate explored, 3 mL min(-1). The developed extraction methods gave
   significantly higher extraction yields than published optimised
   extraction methods based on PLE. Moreover, the optimized methods for the
   less polar compounds, beta-carotene, and alpha-tocopherol, enabled a
   significantly lower consumption of organic solvents (30-52\%), which
   makes them greener in comparison with the more conventional PLE
   extraction methods.},

Abstract = {Increasing evidence of links between climate change, anthropogenic
   stress and coral disease underscores the importance of understanding the
   mechanisms by which reef-building corals resist infection and recover
   from injury. Cellular inflammation and melanin-producing signalling
   pathway are two mechanisms employed by invertebrates to remove foreign
   organisms such as pathogens, but they have not been recorded previously
   in scleractinian corals. This study demonstrates the presence of the
   phenoloxidase (PO) activating melanin pathway in two species of coral,
   Acropora millepora and a massive species of Porites, which both develop
   local pigmentation in response to interactions with a variety of
   organisms. L-DOPA (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine) substrate-based
   enzyme activation assays demonstrated PO activity in healthy tissues of
   both species and upregulation in pigmented tissues of A. millepora.
   Histological staining conclusively identified the presence of melanin in
   Porites tissues. These results demonstrate that the PO pathway is active
   in both coral species. Moreover, the upregulation of PO activity in
   areas of non-normal pigmentation in A. millepora and increased melanin
   production in pigmented Porites tissues suggest the presence of a
   generalized defence response to localized stress. Interspecific
   differences in the usage of pathways involved in innate immunity may
   underlie the comparative success of massive Porites sp. as long-lived
   stress tolerators.},

Abstract = {The Romanian North Western coastal and shelf zones of the Black Sea and
   Danube delta are a mosaic of complex, interacting ecosystems, rich
   natural resources and socio-economic activity. Dramatic changes in the
   Black Sea's ecosystem and resources are due to natural and anthropogenic
   causes (increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input,
   industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and
   dumping on the open sea). A scientific management system for protection,
   conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on
   bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion,
   sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields, water quality,
   climatic change effects. Synergetic use of quasi-simultaneously acquired
   multi-sensor data may therefore allow for a better approach of change
   detection of coastal area. This paper is an application of
   multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite remotely sensed data
   (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM, SAR ERS, ASTER, MODIS) over a period of time
   between 1975 and 2003 for North-Western Black Sea coastal zone change
   detection assessment. Spectral mixture analysis, supervised and
   unsupervised classification are used to study chosen test areas. The
   results can be utilized as a temporal land-use change model for a region
   to quantify the extent and nature of change, and aid in future
   prediction studies, which helps in planning environmental agencies to
   develop sustainable land-use practices.},

Abstract = {Strong earthquake induced huge tsunami has occurred for three times in
   Pacific ocean in recent ten years; for example, the tsunami triggered by
   the Sumatra earthquake in 2004, Chile earthquake in 2010 and Tohoku
   earthquake (Japan) in 2011. Tsunami carrying huge energy always would
   bring high risks to the population living near to coastline. Breakwater
   is widely used to dissipate the wave energy, and protect coastline and
   ports. However, they are vulnerable when being attacked by tsunami wave.
   At present, the interaction mechanism between tsunami, breakwater and
   its seabed foundation is not fully understood. In this study, the
   dynamics and stability of a breakwater under the attacking of tsunami
   wave is investigated by adopting an integrated model PORO-WSSI 2D, in
   which the VARANS equation for wave motion, and the Blot's dynamic
   equation for soil are used. Based on the numerical results, it is found
   that offshore breakwater interacts intensively with tsunami wave when it
   overtopping and overflowing over a breakwater. The impact force on the
   lateral side of breakwater applied by tsunami wave is huge. The shear
   failure is likely to occur in the seabed foundation of breakwater. The
   liquefaction is unlikely to occur due to the fact that there is
   basically no upward seepage force in seabed foundation in the process of
   tsunami wave passing through the breakwater. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {The recent search for a missing airliner in the Southern Indian Ocean
   has highlighted the gap between current standard ``black box{''} pingers
   and the potential requirements of a deep ocean search. When the general
   location of an object, in this case a crashed airliner, is known basic
   pingers are adequate. But even when the actual entry point into the
   water is precisely known there are operational benefits to be achieved
   by more advanced technologies. In the terrestrial realm tools such as
   Global Positioning Systems (GPS), WiFi, Bluetooth and radio frequency
   identification (RFID) have made tracking and meta data gathering of all
   manner of objects ubiquitous. This has created many opportunities for
   new business and improved services. Such technologies are not available
   in the undersea domain. However, advanced acoustic technologies such as
   transponders, ultrashort baseline positioning, long baseline positioning
   and digital acoustic telemetry are commonly employed for undersea
   operations. This paper will:
   1) Review the concept of operations of the search for MH370 in the
   Indian Ocean to analyze the theoretical performance of standard aviation
   emergency pingers.
   2) Review currently employed acoustic technologies that could support
   the location of objects undersea.
   3) Consider the value of unconventional observation systems in the
   search for lost objects marked with advanced locators.
   This paper draws upon practical field experience with all of the current
   technologies described. It will also benefit from the technology
   insights of authors familiar with both legacy undersea locator
   technology and near-future undersea acoustic capabilities.},

Title = {Circular Economy Contributions to the Tourism Sector: A Critical
   Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Economic activity today is still based on a linear model of production
   and consumption: extract/produce and consume/throw, which exhausts
   natural resources and generates waste. The current linear economy does
   not optimize materials nor favour their recycling, reuse or recovery.
   Hence, the concept of Circular Economy (CE) has received increasing
   attention between policymakers and stakeholders worldwide. However, the
   literature on CE was mainly developed for the manufacturing sector, and
   only a few references are found on the tourism sector even though it is
   a sector where huge consumption of energy and water, food waste,
   congestion problems and CO2 emissions take place. This work aims to
   evaluate the importance of tourism in the CE literature and to identify
   current research trends and possible gaps in the literature on CE and
   tourism. In order to identify papers for this, the authors carried out a
   literature review of papers in the social science citation index (Web of
   Science) and Scopus. The keywords used are related to the tourism sector
   and CE, and the last search was made at the end of January 2020. Only
   papers published in English have been considered in the sample, which
   totals to 55 articles. Each contribution is analysed and, according to
   its content, classified into eight streams; then, the paper identifies
   two knowledge areas in tourism that this scientific production covers
   and the areas with lack of knowledge generated. Findings show that more
   research is needed about tourism's intersection with CE in order to
   generate possible solutions towards a more sustainable tourism industry.},

Abstract = {Entanglement of marine mammals in fishing gear is recognised worldwide
   and is a continuous management concern. Gill-net entanglement data from
   the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) on the Gold Coast,
   Australia, from 1990 to 2012 were analysed in the present study.
   Environmental drivers that may affect entanglements of humpback whales
   (Megaptera novaeangliae) and common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were
   selected. M. novaeangliae entanglements coincided with their annual
   migration, with the greatest occurrences in September. D. delphis were
   mostly entangled from March to November, with the greatest occurrences
   in June. For both species, entanglements primarily occurred when the
   wave height was between 0.5 and 1.25 m, the wave power was between 0 and
   5 kW m(-1) and the wind speed was between 12 and 19 km h(-1). M.
   novaeangliae entanglements were significantly more likely to occur in
   low rainfall (, 6 mm h(-1)), and D. delphis entanglements were more
   likely to occur during spring tides. There was a correlation between
   entanglements and the position of the East Australian Current's (EAC)
   maximum velocity, with 73\% of M. novaeangliae entanglements and 79\% of
   D. delphis entanglements occurring when the EAC's maximum velocity was
   west (shoreward) of its average position at 1548E. The present study
   provides the first set of possible management intervention targets
   associated with environmental conditions.},

Title = {Quantifying the effect of seasonal and vertical habitat tracking on
   planktonic foraminifera proxies},

Abstract = {The composition of planktonic foraminiferal (PF) calcite is routinely
   used to reconstruct climate variability. However, PF ecology leaves a
   large imprint on the proxy signal: seasonal and vertical habitats of PF
   species vary spatially, causing variable offsets from annual mean
   surface conditions recorded by sedimentary assemblages. PF seasonality
   changes with temperature in a way that minimises the environmental
   change that individual species experience and it is not unlikely that
   changes in depth habitat also result from such habitat tracking. While
   this behaviour could lead to an underestimation of spatial or temporal
   trends as well as of variability in proxy records, most
   palaeoceanographic studies are (implicitly) based on the assumption of a
   constant habitat. Up to now, the effect of habitat tracking on
   foraminifera proxy records has not yet been formally quantified on a
   global scale. Here we attempt to characterise this effect on the
   amplitude of environmental change recorded in sedimentary PF using core
   top delta O-18 data from six species. We find that the offset from mean
   annual near-surface delta O-18 values varies with temperature, with PF
   delta O-18 indicating warmer than mean conditions in colder waters (on
   average by -0.1\%(equivalent to 0.4 degrees C) per degrees C), thus
   providing a firstorder quantification of the degree of underestimation
   due to habitat tracking. We use an empirical model to estimate the
   contribution of seasonality to the observed difference between PF and
   annual mean delta O-18 and use the residual Delta delta O-18 to assess
   trends in calcification depth. Our analysis indicates that given an
   observation-based model parametrisation calcification depth increases
   with temperature in all species and sensitivity analysis suggests that a
   temperature-related seasonal habitat adjustment is essential to explain
   the observed isotope signal. Habitat tracking can thus lead to a
   significant reduction in the amplitude of recorded environmental change.
   However, we show that this behaviour is predictable. This allows
   accounting for habitat tracking, enabling more meaningful
   reconstructions and improved data-model comparison.},

Title = {Modelling wave-ice interactions in three dimensions in the marginal ice

Abstract = {This study concerns wave-ice interactions in the marginal ice zone
   (MIZ). We compare idealized simulations using two recent
   three-dimensional formulations for wave-ice interactions for flexible
   ice floes, with selected parametrizations for the scattering of ocean
   surface waves due to individual ice floes. These parametrizations are
   implemented in a modern version of the wave model WAVEWATCH III (R)
   (hereafter, WW3) as source terms in the action balance equation. The
   comparisons consist of simple hypothetical experiments to identify
   characteristics of the wave-ice parametrizations. Comparisons show that
   the two new wave-ice formulations give attenuation of wave heights that
   can be less intense in the direction of propagation than those of other
   considered formulations. Within the wave energy spectrum, the
   one-dimensional attenuation extends over the entire frequency domain to
   the high-frequency limit. Within the MIZ beyond the ice edge, there is
   evidence for a `roll-over' effect in the simulations of attenuation.
   These new formulations can potentially improve previous parametrizations
   in simulations of wave scattering and attenuation within the MIZ.This
   article is part of the theme issue `Theory, modelling and observations
   of marginal ice zone dynamics: multidisciplinary perspectives and
   outlooks'.},

Abstract = {Sulfur and oxygen dynamics in the seagrasses Thalassia testudinum and
   Syringodium filiforme and their sediments were studied in the US Virgin
   Islands (USVI) in order to explore sulfide intrusion into tropical
   seagrasses. Four study sites were selected based on the iron
   concentration in sediments and on proximity to anthropogenic nutrient
   sources. Meadow characteristics (shoot density, above- and below-ground
   biomass, nutrient content) were sampled along with sediment
   biogeochemistry. Sulfide intrusion was high in T testudinum, as up to
   96\% of total sulfur in the plant was derived from sediment-derived
   sulfides. The sulfide intrusion was negatively correlated to the
   turnover of sulfides in the sediments regulated by both plant parameters
   and sediment sulfur pools. Sediment iron content played an indirect role
   by affecting sulfide turnover rates. Leaf production was negatively
   correlated with sulfide intrusion suggesting that active growth reduced
   sulfide intrusion. Sulfide intrusion was lower in S. filiforme (up to
   44\%) compared to T testudinum consistent with a higher internal
   nighttime oxygen concentrations found for S. filiforme. When S.
   filiforme can take advantage of its ability to maintain high internal
   oxygen concentrations, as was the case on the USVI, it could increase
   its success in colonizing unvegetated disturbed sediments with
   potentially high sulfide concentrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Marine heatwaves depress metabolic activity and impair cellular
   acid-base homeostasis in reef-building corals regardless of bleaching
   susceptibility},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Ocean warming is causing global coral bleaching events to increase in
   frequency, resulting in widespread coral mortality and disrupting the
   function of coral reef ecosystems. However, even during mass bleaching
   events, many corals resist bleaching despite exposure to abnormally high
   temperatures. While the physiological effects of bleaching have been
   well documented, the consequences of heat stress for bleaching-resistant
   individuals are not well understood. In addition, much remains to be
   learned about how heat stress affects cellular-level processes that may
   be overlooked at the organismal level, yet are crucial for coral
   performance in the short term and ecological success over the long term.
   Here we compared the physiological and cellular responses of
   bleaching-resistant and bleaching-susceptible corals throughout the 2019
   marine heatwave in Hawai'i, a repeat bleaching event that occurred 4
   years after the previous regional event. Relative bleaching
   susceptibility within species was consistent between the two bleaching
   events, yet corals of both resistant and susceptible phenotypes
   exhibited pronounced metabolic depression during the heatwave. At the
   cellular level, bleaching-susceptible corals had lower intracellular pH
   than bleaching-resistant corals at the peak of bleaching for both
   symbiont-hosting and symbiont-free cells, indicating greater disruption
   of acid-base homeostasis in bleaching-susceptible individuals. Notably,
   cells from both phenotypes were unable to compensate for experimentally
   induced cellular acidosis, indicating that acid-base regulation was
   significantly impaired at the cellular level even in bleaching-resistant
   corals and in cells containing symbionts. Thermal disturbances may thus
   have substantial ecological consequences, as even small reallocations in
   energy budgets to maintain homeostasis during stress can negatively
   affect fitness. These results suggest concern is warranted for corals
   coping with ocean acidification alongside ocean warming, as the feedback
   between temperature stress and acid-base regulation may further
   exacerbate the physiological effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {Clean water scarcity is still an intense, prolonged global issue that
   needs to be resolved urgently. The solar steam generation has shown
   great potential with a high energy conversion efficiency for clean water
   production from seawater and wastewater. However, the high evaporation
   rate of water cannot be preserved due to the inevitable fouling of solar
   absorbers. Herein, a self-floatable and super hydrophilic solar-driven
   steam generator composed of activated carbon coated melamine foam (ACM).
   The deposited ACM photothermal layer exhibits outstanding solar
   absorption (92\%) and an efficient evaporation rate of 1.27 kg m(-2)
   h(-1), along with excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (80\%) as
   compared to commercially available primitive solar stills. The open
   porous assembly of melamine foam equipped with 80\% flexibility (0.8
   MPa) enabled smooth water transport and sustain heat accumulation within
   the matrix. The thermal insulation of ACM is 10 times greater than pure
   water. Moreover, open porous assembly of designed solar-powered steam
   generator rejects salt ions as well as volatile organic compounds
   efficiently. The low-cost and facile fabrication of photothermal based
   water production presents a potential solution to single step drinking
   water supply from various resources of the sea, the lakes and mixtures
   of emulsified oil and industrial wastewater.},

Abstract = {Peatlands are one of the important parameters to determine environmental
   quality because peatlands can store carbon stocks in their biomass.
   Based on the official page pantaugambut.id , Kalimantan Island is the
   second largest area that has peatlands. Land subsidence (subsidence) on
   peatland is one of the physical environmental impacts due to the
   shrinking volume of peat due to the drought process at a certain level
   in peatland processing, but also due to the decomposition process,
   erosion, and peat fires. This subsidence phenomenon will be measured
   using the InSAR technique, which is one of the existing methods in
   active remote sensing technology to measure changes in the earth's
   surface which is calculated based on changes in the phase difference
   between two SAR image acquisitions. Our research used the time series
   InSAR technique with the incorporation of Persistent Scatterer (PS) and
   small baseline approach to accurately calculate the value of soil
   subsidence rate to the cm-mm level. Furthermore, the estimation of CO2
   emission was calculated from the carbon parameters observed by the
   in-situ measurement, the affected peatland area, and its subsidence
   obtained by satellite remote sensing. We found that the highest CO2
   emission was located in the southern part of the study area. Since years
   ago, the region has been affected by deforestation and land expansion
   due to the need for fiscal revenues from palm oil and urbanization.},

Abstract = {The pyrolysis of algal (Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus and mix
   macroalgae species from Black sea) and lignocellulosic (safflower oil
   cake and grape seed) biomasses was studied at 500 degrees C in a
   fluidized bed reactor. The yields of pyrolysis products (char, liquid
   and gas) were quantified. Pyrolysis condensates were produced in two
   separate phases; aqueous phase and oil. The yield and composition of
   products from seaweed pyrolysis were compared with those obtained from
   terrestrial biomass. Chemical compositions of pyrolysis products
   relevant to fuel applications were determined. In addition, oils and
   aqueous phases were analyzed by GC-MS and HPLC. The oil yields from
   seaweeds varied between 11 and 17\%, whereas yields from lignocellulosic
   biomasses were in the range of 23-40\%. The oils from lignocellulosic
   biomasses showed a higher heating value (30.04-31.25 MJ kg(-1)) than
   that of oil from seaweeds. The aqueous phase yields from lignocellulosic
   biomasses and seaweeds were about 19-21\% and 17-26\%, respectively. The
   pyrolysis gases with a yield of about 17-37\% were composed of mostly of
   carbon oxides. The yields of char were in the range 29-36\% for seaweeds
   and 23-26\% for lignocellulosic biomass. Due to the higher content of
   ash (41-52\%), the char obtained from seaweeds had a lower heating value
   than those from grape seed and safflower oil cake. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Changes in Dendritic Spine Morphology and Density of Granule Cells in
   the Olfactory Bulb of Anguilla anguilla (L., 1758): A Possible Way to
   Understand Orientation and Migratory Behavior},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The olfactory bulb can process odour cues through
   granular cells (GCs) and dendritic spines, changing their synaptic
   plasticity properties and their morphology. The GCs' dendritic spines
   density and morphology were analysed in Anguilla anguilla, considering
   the olfaction as a driver involved in fish orientation and migration.
   For the head and neck morphology, spines were classified as mushroom,
   long thin, stubby, and filopodia. Spines' density decreased from
   juvenile migrants to no-migrant stages and increased in the adult
   migrants. Spines' density was comparable between glass and silver eels
   as an adaptation to migration, while at non-migrating phases, spines'
   density decreased. For its phylogenetic Elopomorph attribution and its
   complex life cycle, A. anguilla could be recommended as a model species
   to study the development of dendritic spines in GCs of the olfactory
   bulb. Considering the role of olfaction in the orientation and migration
   of A. anguilla, the modification of environmental stimuli (ocean
   alterations and climate change) could represent contributing factors
   that threaten this critically endangered species. Olfaction could
   represent a pivotal process involved in fish orientation and migration.
   The olfactory bulb can manage olfactive signals at the granular cell
   (GC) and dendritic spine levels for their synaptic plasticity properties
   and changing their morphology and structural stability after
   environmental odour cues. The GCs' dendritic spine density and
   morphology were analysed across the life stages of the catadromous
   Anguilla anguilla. According to the head and neck morphology, spines
   were classified as mushroom (M), long thin (LT), stubby (S), and
   filopodia (F). Total spines' density decreased from juvenile migrants to
   no-migrant stages, to increase again in the adult migrant stage. Mean
   spines' density was comparable between glass and silver eels as an
   adaptation to migration. At non-migrating phases, spines' density
   decreased for M and LT, while M, LT, and S density increased in silver
   eels. A great dendritic spine development was found in the two migratory
   phases, regressing in trophic phases, but that could be recreated in
   adults, tracing the migratory memory of the routes travelled in juvenile
   phases. For its phylogenetic Elopomorph attribution and its complex life
   cycle, A. anguilla could be recommended as a model species to study the
   development of dendritic spines in GCs of the olfactory bulb as an index
   of synaptic plasticity involved in the modulation of olfactory stimuli.
   If olfaction is involved in the orientation and migration of A. anguilla
   and if eels possess a memory, these processes could be influenced by the
   modification of environmental stimuli (ocean alterations and rapid
   climate change) contributing to threatening this critically endangered
   species.},

Title = {Electrode selection rules for enhancing the performance of triboelectric
   nanogenerators and the role of few-layers graphene},
Journal = {NANO ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {76},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The development of portable and wearable electronics requiring only few
   tens of microwatts to operate fosters the search for low power energy
   sources. Moreover, the fast-growing demand for new sustainable energy
   has raised the interest in energy harvesters able to convert mechanical
   energy into electrical power. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can
   provide such green power supply. Recent developments in TENGs technology
   show that they can be used in different applications ranging from
   wearable self-powered sensors to wind and sea wave energy harvesting. In
   spite of the wide number of TENGs developed so far, an in depth
   understanding of their working mechanism operating at the sub-microscale
   is still missing. In this work, we highlight the fundamental role played
   by the interface between the triboelectric material and the electrode
   collector in contributing to the TENG's power generation. We show that
   by simply replacing the gold electrodes with flexible few-layer
   graphene-based electrodes in TENGs operating in vertical contact mode, a
   26-fold increase in power density is achieved. Here, we elucidate the
   main mechanism at the base of such boost in power output, describing
   guidelines for the combination of electrode and triboelectric materials
   to optimize the mechanical energy conversion efficiency in TENGs.},

Title = {Assessing recovery of biological soil crusts across a latitudinal
   gradient in Western Europe},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {543-554},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Biological soil crusts are ecologically important communities in areas
   where vascular plant coverage is low, and their presence is often vital
   in prevention of soil erosion. Despite recurrent threats to biological
   soil crusts across different environments, their recovery after
   disturbance has been little studied. We therefore established
   experiments across a latitudinal gradient in Europe, from oland, Sweden
   in the north, to Gossenheim, Germany and Hochtor, Austria, to Almeria,
   Spain in the south, spanning over 20 degrees latitude and 2,300 m in
   altitude, and including natural and semi-natural sites. At each site 10
   (1 x 1 m) paired plots were constructed where the biological soil crusts
   were either completely removed, or left intact. Over a 2-year period
   (2012-2014) the plots were regularly sampled to assess functional group
   recovery (cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, bryophytes, vascular plants),
   soil stability, and chlorophyll, carbon, and nutrient contents.
   Cyanobacterial assemblages were examined by denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis, a technique used to detect DNA in environmental
   samples. The results indicated that recovery was site dependent,
   suggesting that physical and climatic parameters play a major role in
   biological soil crust recovery. This conclusion is supported by the
   results of the soil properties, which were found to differ between
   sites, although they did not show meaningful recovery over the study
   period. Although 2 years was insufficient for pronounced biological soil
   crust recovery, this study documents changes over the initial recovery
   period, suggests management practices for future projects, and
   recommends proxies for measuring recovery over time.},

Abstract = {Vertical temperature profiles obtained by radiosonde and Raman lidar
   measurements are used to investigate a climatology of total energy
   density of gravity waves (GW) in the Upper Troposphere (UT) and the
   Lower Stratosphere (LS) from 1992 to 2004 above Mahe (4 degrees S, 55
   degrees E), Tromelin (15 degrees S, 54 degrees E) and La Reunion (21
   degrees S, 55 degrees E) located in the tropical South-West Indian
   Ocean. The commonly used spectral index value (p approximate to 5/3) of
   the intrinsic frequency spectrum is used for calculating estimated total
   energy density in the UT and LS. Estimated total energy density provides
   good estimation of total energy density in the LS but underestimates
   total energy density by one half in the UT above Mahe and Tromelin
   probably due to the activity of near-inertial frequency waves. Estimated
   total energy density reveals a strong seasonal variability as a function
   of latitude and convection as an evident active source of GW activity in
   the LS in austral summer. Above La Reunion, a semi-annual GW activity is
   observed in the LS with the signature of the subtropical barrier in the
   UT. Moreover, radiosondes and Raman lidar provide consistent GW surveys
   in the UT/LS at heights < 23 km above La Reunion.},

Title = {Associations between climate stress and coral reef diversity in the

Abstract = {Climatic-oceanographic stress and coral reef diversity were mapped in
   the western Indian Ocean (WIO) in order to determine if there were
   associations between high diversity coral reefs and regions with
   low-to-moderate climate stress. A multivariate stress model developed to
   estimate environmental exposure to stress, an empirical index of the
   coral community's susceptibility to stress, and field data on numbers of
   fish and corals taxa from 197 WIO sites were overlain to evaluate these
   associations. Exposure to stress was modeled from satellite data based
   on nine geophysical-biological oceanographic characteristics known to
   influence coral bleaching (i.e. temperature, light, and current
   variables). The environmental stress model and the coral community's
   susceptibility index were moderately correlated (r=-0.51) with southern
   and eastern parts of the WIO identified as areas with low environmental
   stress and coral communities with greater dominance of bleaching
   stress-sensitive taxa. Numbers of coral and fish taxa were positive and
   moderately correlated (r=0.47) but high diversity regions for fish were
   in the north and west while diversity was highest for corals in central
   regions from Tanzania to northwestern Madagascar. Combining three and
   four of these variables into composite maps identified a region from
   southern Kenya to northern Mozambique across to northern-eastern
   Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands and the Mozambique-South Africa
   border as areas where low-moderate environmental exposure overlaps with
   moderate-high taxonomic diversity. In these areas management efforts
   aimed at maintaining high-diversity and intact ecosystems are considered
   least likely to be undermined by climate disturbances in the near term.
   Reducing additional human disturbances, such as fishing and pollution,
   in these areas is expected to improve the chances for their persistence.
   These reefs are considered a high priority for increased local,
   national, and international management efforts aimed at establishing
   coral reef refugia for climate change impacts.},

Title = {The dynamical landscape of marine phytoplankton diversity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {111},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Observations suggest that the landscape of marine phytoplankton
   assemblage might be strongly heterogeneous at the dynamical mesoscale
   and submesoscale (10-100 km, days to months), with potential
   consequences in terms of global diversity and carbon export. But these
   variations are not well documented as synoptic taxonomic data are
   difficult to acquire. Here, we examine how phytoplankton assemblage and
   diversity vary between mesoscale eddies and submesoscale fronts. We use
   a multi-phytoplankton numerical model embedded in a mesoscale flow
   representative of the North Atlantic. Our model results suggest that the
   mesoscale flow dynamically distorts the niches predefined by
   environmental contrasts at the basin scale and that the phytoplankton
   diversity landscape varies over temporal and spatial scales that are one
   order of magnitude smaller than those of the basin-scale environmental
   conditions. We find that any assemblage and any level of diversity can
   occur in eddies and fronts. However, on a statistical level, the results
   suggest a tendency for larger diversity and more fast-growing types at
   fronts, where nutrient supplies are larger and where populations of
   adjacent water masses are constantly brought into contact; and lower
   diversity in the core of eddies, where water masses are kept isolated
   long enough to enable competitive exclusion.},

Title = {Reliability of design approaches for axially loaded offshore piles and
   its consequences with respect to the North Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the near future, several offshore wind farms are planned to be built
   in the North Sea. Therefore, jacket and tripod constructions with mainly
   axially loaded piles are suitable as support structures. The current
   design of axial bearing resistance of these piles leads to deviant
   results regarding the pile resistance when different design methods are
   adopted. Hence, a strong deviation regarding the required pile length
   must be addressed. The reliability of a design method can be evaluated
   based on a model error which describes the quality of the considered
   design method by comparing measured and predicted pile bearing
   resistances. However, only few pile load tests are reported with regard
   to the boundary conditions in the North Sea. This paper presents 6
   large-scale axial pile load tests which were incorporated within a new
   model error approach for the current design methods used for the axial
   bearing resistance, namely API Main Text method and cone penetration
   test (CPT)-based design methods, such as simplified ICP-05, offshore
   UWA-05, Fugro-05 and NGI-05 methods. Based on these new model errors, a
   reliability-based study towards the safety was conducted by performing a
   Monte-Carlo simulation. In addition, consequences regarding the
   deterministic pile design in terms of quality factors were evaluated. It
   is shown that the current global safety factor (GSF) prescribed and the
   partial safety factors are only valid for the API Main Text and the
   offshore UWA-05 design methods; whereas for the simplified ICP-05,
   Fugro-05 and NGI-05 design methods, an increase in the required embedded
   pile length and thus in the GSF up to 2.69, 2.95 and 3.27, respectively,
   should be considered to satisfy the desired safety level according to
   DIN EN 1990 of beta = 3.8. Further, quality factors for each design
   method on the basis of all reliability-based design results were
   derived. Hence, evaluation of each design method regarding the
   reliability of the pile capacity prediction is possible. (C) 2018

Title = {Compensation irradiance for planktonic community metabolism in the ocean},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {24},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {The light compensation irradiance for planktonic metabolic balance,
   defined as the irradiance where gross planktonic primary production
   equals community respiration, is an important property describing
   ecosystem dynamics. Planktonic communities receiving irradiances above
   the compensation irradiance or compensation depth (i.e., the depth at
   which the compensation irradiance is received) are autotrophic and act
   as CO2 sinks, whereas those at lower irradiances or located deeper in
   the water column act as CO2 sources. However, this property is undefined
   for heterotrophic communities in which metabolic balance is not set by
   light availability. The compensation irradiance for planktonic
   metabolism in the ocean was quantified experimentally and calculated
   using data available in the literature to assess its variability and
   possible controls. Gross primary production by the oceanic planktonic
   communities examined here meet their respiratory requirements at
   irradiances of about 1.1 +/- 0.4 mol quanta m(-2) d(-1) and tend to be
   autotrophic above a depth of 36 +/- 9 m, on average. The depth of
   nitracline is closely correlated with the compensation depth for
   community metabolism across the studied areas, but the compensation
   depth tends to be located above the depth of the nitracline. This is
   expected from the facts that the underlying, net heterotrophic
   communities should act as sources of inorganic nutrients and that the
   nitracline cannot develop within the mixed layer where the compensation
   depth is often located. These results imply that the planktonic
   communities examined extending from 36 m depth, on average, to the
   bottom of the euphotic layer tend to be heterotrophic, acting as CO2 and
   inorganic nutrient sources.},

Abstract = {Soil quality assessment is a process for understanding long-term effects
   of soil and crop management. Our objective was to assess those effects
   on Vertisols in Texas after 57 yr. Five fields were sampled in 2006: a
   managed native pasture (NP), two pastures that were previously cropped
   and then seeded to Coastal bermudagrass {[}Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.]
   for the past 57 (CB) or 31 (CBTL) yr, and two fields that have been
   continuously cropped (RCTL and RC). The RCTL and CBTL fields have had
   turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) litter amendments. The soil quality
   assessment was conducted using the Soil Management Assessment Framework,
   using 10 measured soil attributes. There were significant differences in
   the overall soil quality ratings, which ranged from 75 to 94\% of
   optimum in the following order: CBTL > NP = RCTL > CB approximate to RC.
   When separated into index values by sector, physical soil quality ranged
   from 66 to 84\% of optimum, with NP approximate to CBTL > RCTL
   approximate to CB approximate to RC. All management systems had nearly
   the same chemical quality rating (94-95\%). Focusing only on nutrient
   attributes, RC, RCTL, and CBTL had significantly higher ratings than the
   other treatments (99\%), with NP being significantly lower (47\%).
   Biological and biochemical soil quality ratings ranged from 44 to 81\%,
   with the NP performing significantly better (81\%) and RC significantly
   lower (44\%) than the other treatments. The CBTL treatment exhibited the
   greatest levels of enzymatic activity and RC the lowest. There were
   several significant correlations between soil enzymatic activities and
   other soil parameters. Overall, turkey litter amendments improved soil
   quality, demonstrating that carefully managed bermudagrass pastures can
   be more productive than managed native grass pastures, primarily because
   of improved plant nutrient availability.},

Title = {How does ocean biology affect atmospheric pCO(2)? Theory and models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Number = {C7},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {{[}1] This paper examines the sensitivity of atmospheric pCO2 to changes
   in ocean biology that result in drawdown of nutrients at the ocean
   surface. We show that the global inventory of preformed nutrients is the
   key determinant of atmospheric pCO2 and the oceanic carbon storage due
   to the soft- tissue pump ( OCSsoft). We develop a new theory showing
   that under conditions of perfect equilibrium between atmosphere and
   ocean, atmospheric pCO2 can be written as a sum of exponential functions
   of OCSsoft. The theory also demonstrates how the sensitivity of
   atmospheric pCO2 to changes in the soft- tissue pump depends on the
   preformed nutrient inventory and on surface buffer chemistry. We
   validate our theory against simulations of nutrient depletion in a suite
   of realistic general circulation models ( GCMs). The decrease in
   atmospheric pCO2 following surface nutrient depletion depends on the
   oceanic circulation in the models. Increasing deep ocean ventilation by
   increasing vertical mixing or Southern Ocean winds increases the
   atmospheric pCO2 sensitivity to surface nutrient forcing. Conversely,
   stratifying the Southern Ocean decreases the atmospheric CO2 sensitivity
   to surface nutrient depletion. Surface CO2 disequilibrium due to the
   slow gas exchange with the atmosphere acts to make atmospheric pCO2 more
   sensitive to nutrient depletion in high- ventilation models and less
   sensitive to nutrient depletion in low- ventilation models. Our findings
   have potentially important implications for both past and future
   climates.},

Title = {Territorial user rights for artisanal fisheries in Chile - intended and
   unintended outcomes},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Granting property property rights in fisheries is assumed to provide
   incentives for sustainable resource exploitation. These rights might
   also open other income options for fishers, including some that go
   beyond the original objectives intended by authorities establishing the
   right. The opportunity for alternative uses is especially high if the
   details of these rights are not clearly identified. In Chile, a de novo
   TURF (Territorial User Rights for Fishery) system, called Management
   Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (Areas de Manejo y Explotacion
   de Recursos Bentonicos-AMERB) was created to achieve sustainable
   exploitation of benthic resources. This study compares two small-scale
   fishing communities in Chile, Guayacan and Huentelauquen, representing
   two typical contrasting settings, regarding geographical contexts and
   surroundings, origin, history, location, social embeddedness, main
   fisheries activities as well as the motivation and the process through
   which they acquired their AMERB. While in Guayacan the main fishing
   activity outside the AMERB is the giant squid and finfish fishery, in
   Huentelauquen the main and traditional activity has been diving for
   benthic resources. The objectives to acquire their AMERBs were different
   in both cases. Huentelauquen applied the AMERB for their traditional
   activity, the fishery of Concholepas concholepas ({''}loco{''}), thus in
   accordance with the official objective of the AMERB. Due to reduced
   catches of loco, fishers also added the collection of kelps, using their
   AMERB to control access to the entire coast surrounding their fishing
   community, beyond the limits of their AMERB. In Guayacan the AMERB,
   applied for the management of scallops and a species of red algae, began
   to be used for sea squirt aquaculture. Within the framework of
   sustainable fisheries implied by the AMERBs, there was in both cases a
   clear expectation to gain new sources of income. However with time both
   AMERBs are being used as a tool for territorial exclusion of other
   fishers beyond the limits of their respective AMERBs. In Huentelauquen
   fishers mention mostly negative aspects about the performance of their
   AMERB, given the poor economic results, being unsatisfied with the AMERB
   system in general, because they feel that the system disrupted their
   traditional migration along the coast. In Guayacan, fishers mentioned
   mostly positive aspects for their AMERB, as it was an opportunity to add
   new activities. Both examples show that rights-based management
   approaches are very attractive; they could promote new uses or
   developments, whose sustainability nevertheless needs to be analyzed
   further. The analyzed case studies show that, contrary to how the system
   was developed in Chile, a more bottom-up implementation of new
   management arrangements may make it easier to agree on common
   objectives, and/or leave more freedom for fishers to adjust and arrange
   their livelihood. Considering the importance the AMERBs have acquired
   for fishers, these kinds of systems need flexible regulations in order
   that fishers can adapt the system to local traditions, uses or needs and
   also to their learning and adapting capacities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Theoretical Derivation of a Prediction Model for CO2 Adsorption by Coal},

Abstract = {Adsorption characteristics of CO2 by coal are an important reservoir
   parameter to determine the CO2 storage capacity of the coal seam. The
   Langmuir isotherm adsorption model is commonly used to describe the
   isothermal adsorption line of coal. However, we cannot predict the CO2
   adsorption capacity at other temperatures by using the Langmuir model
   based on the experimental data at a fixed temperature. This paper
   analyzes the epsilon-V-ad adsorption characteristic curves of three coal
   samples over a range of temperatures and pressures. The study
   demonstrates that the adsorption characteristic curves of CO2 gas are
   independent of temperature and depend mainly on the dispersion force
   between coal and the CO2 molecules. In addition, the adsorption
   potential of CO2 gas has a negative correlation with the volume of the
   adsorbed phase. Hence, the CO2 adsorption characteristic curve of coal
   conforms to the logarithmic function. Based on the adsorption potential
   theory, the prediction model of CO2 adsorption by coal is derived. The
   deviation analysis from measured data shows that the average relative
   deviation of the three coal samples is similar to 5\%, and the
   prediction results are accurate and reliable. Under different
   temperature and pressure conditions of the three coal samples, the
   results from the prediction model of CO2 adsorption by coal and the
   Langmuir model have a strong correlation with the experimental results.
   In comparison with the Langmuir model, the prediction model of CO2
   adsorption by coal can predict the adsorption capacity under different
   temperature and pressure conditions. Hence, it has a wide range of
   applications when compared to that of the Langmuir model. In practical
   applications, better results are achieved with a significant reduction
   in experimental time and labor.},

Title = {Gas desorption characteristics and related mechanism analysis under the
   action of superheated steam and pressurized water based on an
   experimental study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a kind of unconventional natural gas, efficient and clean energy, CBM
   (Coalbed methane) exhibits great potential in adjusting energy structure
   and formulating energy development strategy. Desorption of methane from
   coal is essential for CBM production. And the desorption characteristics
   of methane in coal under different conditions and how to improve the
   desorption capacity have always been a hot issue of interest to
   researchers. So, research in this aspect becomes urgent. In this study,
   a series of desorption experiments of coal samples with various particle
   sizes under different adsorption pressures were carried out and the
   influence mechanism of pressurized water and superheated steam on the
   desorption was analyzed. The results were as follows: 1) The gas
   desorption capacity is more influenced by the adsorption pressure than
   the particle size, the particle size mainly affects gas release rate of
   the desorption process. It can be found that the lower the adsorption
   pressure, the more obvious the enhancement effect of superheated steam
   on desorption. 2) The inhibition of desorption by water injection can be
   attributed to four inhibition mechanisms caused by water, i.e. Water
   blocking effect, Wetting effect, Capillary effect, and Jamin effect. 3)
   Superheated steam can provide the energy required for the desorption of
   methane, intensify the thermal movement of molecules, and can also carry
   and displace methane, which together increases the desorption capacity
   and effective diffusion coefficient of gas in coal. These research
   results can provide a theoretical basis for hydraulic measures and heat
   injection techniques related to on-site CBM extraction.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an ocean compressed air energy storage (OCAES) system is
   introduced as a utility scale energy storage option for electricity
   generated by wind, ocean currents, tides, and waves off the coast of
   North Carolina. Geographically, a location from 40km to 70km off the
   coast of Cape Hatteras is shown to be a good location for an OCAES
   system. Based on existing compressed air energy storage (CAES) system
   designs, a conceptual design of an OCAES system with thermal energy
   storage (TES) is presented. A simple thermodynamic analysis is presented
   for an adiabatic CAES system which shows that the overall efficiency is
   65.9\%. In addition, finite element simulations are presented which show
   the flow induced loads which will be experienced by OCAES air containers
   on the ocean floor. We discuss the fact that the combination of the
   buoyancy force and the flow induced lift forces (due to ocean currents)
   generates a periodic loading on the storage container and seabed, and
   how this presents engineering challenges related to the development of
   adequate anchoring systems. We also present a system, based on
   hydrolysis, which can be used for storing energy (in the form of oxygen
   and hydrogen gas) in containers on the ocean floor.},

Abstract = {The utilization of swine wastewater is affected by salinity and pH owing
   to the extensive use with seawater instead of domestic water as swine
   farm flushing water in coastal city. Therefore, swine wastewater
   pretreated with thermophilic bacteria was used as fermentation substrate
   in this work, the effects of salinity and pH on dark fermentation under
   mesophilic condition were investigated. The research showed that 1.5\%
   salinity and pH 6.0 were the optimal conditions for hydrogen production
   with swine wastewater. The activity of hydrogenogen was inhibited at
   3.5\% salinity and pH 5.0. Soluble organic matter in substrate was
   accumulated under high salinity and alkaline conditions. The utilization
   of carbohydrate during dark fermentation was up to 61.1\% at 1.5\%
   salinity and 51.5\% at pH 9.0. Enhancing of salinity and pH had an
   advantage in accumulation of total soluble metabolites. Acetate was the
   main metabolite during dark fermentation, and 1.5\% salinity contributed
   to the formation of butyrate.},

Abstract = {Rivers have always been the most important source of water for man. And
   not only were that, often in its natural state, through natural
   retention and bayou, the rivers have the best flood defense. It is also
   important to note that coastal vegetation has had a significant impact
   on the purification of water that is infiltrated from the waterways into
   the groundwater. Human development, population growth, urbanization,
   climate change have led to a significant drop in river health at the
   global level. In the zone of settlements, the rivers have undergone
   major morphological and hydraulic changes, which ultimately led to
   disturbances of the river's ecological status and the loss of
   sociological role of the river in the urban environment. In this
   connection, this paper will give an overview of the most common mistakes
   made in river regulation over the past period. It will also highlight
   the ways and possibilities of reconstructing the river from the position
   of ecologically sustainable development and flood protection. It is
   reflected in the passive and active ways of restoring the river, and the
   importance of applying the principle of integral river management in the
   context of water recovery.},

Abstract = {The impacts Of CO2 ocean sequestration on microbial communities and
   their metabolism are of great concern because they play an important
   role in the biogeochemical cycles. A mesocosm, experiment was conducted
   to study the responses of marine microbial communities to different
   concentrations Of CO2. Seawater was delivered to four tanks on land from
   the offshore, using a tube pump. Four CO2 conditions of experimental
   ecosystems were formed by CO2 enriched air under dark conditions.
   Chemical and biological parameters were analysed to evaluate the impacts
   of CO2 on the microbial communities. The biomass of each tank was not
   affected considerably by the different CO2 conditions, but the potential
   activities of ectoenzyme were decreased under high concentration Of CO2.
   The effects Of CO2 on bacterial communities were also confirmed using
   molecular biological methods. The present studies were carried out in
   short term and limited conditions using biota of estuarine. Further
   experiments are needed to generalize the impacts of CO2 on the marine
   ecosystem.},

Abstract = {As a renewable energy utilization system, seawater source heat pump
   district heating system can eliminate the local air pollution compared
   with the direct combustion of fuel in the conventional boiler house
   district heating system in northern cold climate area. A field
   measurement with an emphasis on the energy efficiency of an actual
   seawater source heat pump district heating system was conducted and
   analyzed. The field measurement showed that the heat pump units consumed
   the largest part of energy consumption of the whole system (as high as
   78.9\% in the project). However, the coefficient of heating performance
   (COP) of the seawater source heat pump unit was as low as 2.43. Then the
   energy efficiency enhancement potential of the heat pump unit was
   carefully analyzed and calculated in the light of the index of
   Thermodynamic Perfectibility for the heat pump unit. And the results
   showed that there is about an average of 24.2\% energy efficiency
   enhancement potential of the heat pump units in the project. In the end,
   a verification case study indicated that the COP of the heat pump units
   in the project will increase 34.6\% if they are substituted by the ones
   made by another manufacturer. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Lombok Island, including its dryland area, has a high potential for
   developing many kinds of crops, not excluded porang (elephant foot yam).
   This study describes the development of porang agribusiness in Lombok,
   its opportunities, and ways to develop forward. This study uses several
   sources of data and several data collection methods, in a term called
   triangulation. Primary data were collected through interviews guided by
   the instrument of unstructured questions listed as topics of
   investigations. Secondary data collection capitalize on available data
   from individuals and bodies. Data were analyzed mainly using descriptive
   statistics and qualitative evaluation. Results of the study evidenced
   several points. Porang is one of the promising crops to be developed in
   the dryland of Lombok Island. It grows easily and is adaptable to many
   agricultural conditions. It has also high demand in several forms of
   products. The consequences that follow from these are that the
   development of this crop can benefit not only porang growers, but also
   others, including traders, workers, or regional economic development as
   a whole. Above all, given that porang grows better with shades, then it
   brings implications for conserving nature better than that without
   porang, to add to the benefits of economic and social. This study
   recommends developing porang in dryland of Lombok or other regions.},

Abstract = {Phytodetrital sedimentation, bacterial activity in sediments, and
   benthic macro- and meiofauna abundance were measured to calculate a
   carbon budget for pelagic-benthic coupling in Lake Erken. Bacterial
   activity in surficial sediment was limited by temperature in spring,
   although a significant correlation with the input of spring-bloom
   phytodetritus was noted. Population dynamics of benthic meiofauna during
   a period of increased food availability in spring were highly
   taxon-specific and closely correlated to feeding behavior. Abundances of
   ostracods and nematodes rapidly increased when phytodetritus became
   available in hypolimnetic water and surficial sediment, respectively.
   Considerable time lags (months) were found between phytodetritus
   deposition and population development of harpacticoid copepods and
   chydorids.
   Carbon budget calculations based on sedimentation data (traps) and
   surficial sediment C content showed that during spring between 1.1 and
   7.2\% of deposited phytodetritus is assimilated by benthic meiofauna,
   whereas the dominant macroinvertebrates, sedentary chironomids,
   assimilated between 2.4 and 6.0\%. On average, between 1.9 and 12.4\% of
   the deposited phytodetritus was mineralized by sediment bacteria. A
   significant negative correlation was found between abundances of benthic
   meiofauna and bacteria in the sediment. Chlorophyll a analysis of
   surficial sediment was a necessary, complementary tool to detect
   sedimentation that was not detected by the traditional, cylindric
   sediment traps.},

Title = {Unsteady load mitigation through a passive trailing-edge flap},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {106},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There are a wide range of applications in which it is desirable to
   mitigate unsteady load fluctuations while preserving mean loading. This
   is often achieved with active control systems, but passive systems are
   sometimes more desirable for enhancing reliability. This is the case,
   for example, for wind and tidal turbines, where unsteady loading limits
   the fatigue life of the turbine and results in power peaks at the
   generator. Here, we consider the unsteady load mitigation that can be
   achieved through a foil with a trailing edge flap that is connected to
   the foil via a torsional spring. We develop a theoretical model and show
   that the preload can be tuned to preserve the mean foil loading. The
   spring moment that maximises the unsteady load mitigation is
   approximately constant, and the load fluctuation reduction is linearly
   proportional to the ratio of the flap to the full chord of the foil. We
   verify this relationship through water tunnel tests of a foil with a
   hinge at 25\% of the chord from the trailing edge. As theoretically
   predicted, we measure unsteady load mitigation of up to 25\%, without
   any variation in the mean load. In highly unsteady flow conditions, when
   boundary layer separation occurs, the unsteady load reduction decreases.
   Overall we conclude that passive trailing-edge flaps are effective in
   alleviating unsteady load fluctuations and their effectiveness depends
   on their size relative to the foil. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Three color strains of the K-carrageenan producing red alga Kappaphycus
   alvarezii were cultured in Dzilam, Yucatan, over a 6-month period using
   the fixed off bottom monoline culture method to determine the technical
   viability of producing commercially this seaweed in the tropical waters
   of the Yucatdn peninsula. Seawater temperature ranged from 28 to 31
   degreesC, with a daily fluctuation range between 25.9 and 31.9 degreesC.
   Irradiance showed a strong fluctuation along the study period with
   maximal recorded irradiance during April (881.8 mumol photon m(-2)
   s(-1)). Ammonia accounted for 55.1-89.8\% of total DIN depending on the
   season, and salinity did not change significantly. Temperature was the
   only environmental factor that explained 96\% of the observed variation
   in K. alvarezii growth rate (R-2=0.96). The highest average growth rates
   obtained were 6.5 +/- 1\% day(-1) for the red strain, 7.1 +/- 1.8\%
   day(-1) for the brown strain, and 8.1 +/- 1.6\% day(-1) for green strain
   during June. Lowest growth rates were obtained during August and
   September for the green strain (2.0 +/- 0.6\% day(-1)). Despite the
   significant differences in growth between months no significant
   differences among color strains were found (P>0.05). The growth rates of
   K. alvarezii were exponential during April to June. A 10-fold increase
   in weight was obtained after 30 days in cultivation for all the colored
   strains. As propagule weight increased the growth rate was reduced.
   Further, biomass yield (\% weight gained) fluctuated as propagule weight
   increased and averaged 33.2 +/- 8.4\% for the green, 35.4 +/- 6.0\% for
   the red and 36.3 +/- 10.8\% for the brown strain after 15 days. The
   highest carrageenan yield was obtained for the green strain (40.7\%),
   whereas average carrageenan yields for the red strain were 32.7 +/-
   3.9\% and 37.5 +/- 1.1\% for the brown. This study shows that K.
   alvarezii can be grown in the tropical waters of the Yucatan peninsula
   during the dry and part of the wet season. This period coincided with
   the closed season of the main fisheries. Thus, seaweed farming could be
   proposed as an alternative activity in the area. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Saltwater intrusion is a common problem associated with every coastal
   region all over the globe, and Lagos state is not an exception. This
   study was carried out in the coastal belt of Lagos, Southwestern Nigeria
   with the main objective of assessing the risk of shallow groundwater and
   its susceptibility to contamination. In this research, geophysical and
   geochemical techniques coupled with the concepts of Dar- Zarrouk (D-Z)
   parameters were employed. Resistivity measurements were taken at twelve
   vertical electrical sounding (VES) stations and eight 2-D resistivity
   profiles using the Schlumberger, dipole-dipole and pole-dipole arrays
   were analyzed and interpreted respectively. The D-Z parameters such as
   longitudinal conductance (S-L), transverse resistance (Tr), longitudinal
   resistivity (??L) and transverse resistivity (??T) data were computed
   from the qualitative interpretation of VES data to reveal the aquifer
   hydraulic characteristics. The 2-D sections display the lateral invasion
   of saline water within the aquifer systems and variations in resistivity
   of the subsurface being the geo-electric property that differentiates
   lithologies. The geo-electric model interpretation supported with
   available geologic information revealed four/five geo-electric layers
   namely; top sandy layer, clayey sand/sandy clay, clay and sand. Two
   aquifers (Upper and Lower) were delineated within the depth of
   investigation hosted mainly by sand and sandy clay/clayey sand.
   Furthermore, the longitudinal conductance data was used to predict the
   protective capacity of the coastal aquifer. Generally, the water table
   aquifer falls within the poor/weak protective capacity, while the lower
   semi-confined to confined aquifer is within the zone of good to
   excellent protective capacity. The lower aquifer is essentially impacted
   with saline intrusion while the phreatic aquifer contaminations are both
   from saline and anthropogenic sources. These assertions corroborate the
   geochemical results and previous findings in the study area. Hence,
   geophysical method with the use of D-Z parameters proved to be useful
   tool in the pollution assessment of groundwater.},

Title = {Influences of sea level rise on tides and storm surges around the Taiwan
   coast},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {56-72},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Global sea level rise (SLR) rates are accelerating, and abnormal weather
   is occurring more frequently due to global warming and climate change.
   SLR could intensify coastal disasters and concerns of an increase in
   storminess. In this study, a two-dimensional advanced circulation model
   (ADCIRC) was used to simulate tides and storm surges around the Taiwan
   coast. The model was calibrated and verified using observed tides and
   storm surges at four tidal gauge stations, including Taipei Tamsui,
   Taichung Harbor, Kaohsiung Harbor, and Hualien Harbor, based on
   historical typhoon events. The root mean square error and skill value of
   the differences between the computed and observed water levels for model
   calibration and validation were in the range of 0.08-0.27 m and
   0.92-0.99, respectively. The results showed a reasonable agreement
   between the simulated and observed tidal levels and surge heights. The
   validated model was then used to assess the impact of SLR on the tides
   and surge heights. Four typical typhoon events under present-day sea
   level conditions and under SLR conditions of 0.87 m and 1.9 m were used
   for the model simulations. The simulated results show that the largest
   differences in water levels and surge heights between present-day
   conditions and SIR of 0.87 m and 1.9 m are found at Taichung Harbor
   compared to other three-gauge stations. The changes in M-2 tidal
   amplitude are less than 1 cm due to sea level rise. Moreover, the timing
   of the M-2 tide was earlier by approximately 4.7 min and 9 min under SLR
   0.87 m and 1.9 m, respectively, at Taichung Harbor. The maximum
   increases in water level ranged from 9.2 cm to 13.7 cm under SLR of 0.87
   m and from 19.2 cm to 24.8 cm under SLR of 1.9 mat Taichung Harbor. The
   peak water level can significantly increase as a result of the SLR. All
   of these characteristics respond to an SLR with nonlinear and nonuniform
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Along with the flourishing of the wind energy industry, floating
   offshore wind turbines have aroused much interest among the academia as

   platform motion on the aerodynamics of a floating wind turbine are
   studied using the open source CFD framework OpenFOAM. The platform
   motion responses, including surge, heave and pitch, are superimposed
   onto the rotation of the wind turbine. Thrust and torque on the wind
   turbine are compared and analysed for the cases of different platform
   motion patterns together with the flow field. It is shown that the
   movement of the supporting platform can have large influences on a
   floating offshore wind turbine and thus needs to be considered carefully
   during the design process.},

Title = {On the tidal evolution of the orbits of low-mass satellites around black

Journal = {ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {487},
Number = {2},
Pages = {527-532},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Context. Low-mass satellites, like asteroids and comets, are expected to
   be present around the black hole at the Galactic center. We consider
   small bodies orbiting a black hole, and we study the evolution of their
   orbits due to tidal interaction with the black hole.
   Aims. In this paper we investigate the consequences of the existence of
   plunging orbits when a black hole is present. We are interested in
   finding the conditions that exist when capture occurs.
   Methods. Earlier analysis of the evolution of classical Keplerian orbits
   was extended to relativistic orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole.
   Results. The main difference between the Keplerian and black hole cases
   is in the existence of plunging orbits. Orbital evolution, leading from
   bound to plunging orbits, goes through a ``final{''} unstable circular
   orbit. On this orbit, tidal energy is released on a characteristic black
   hole timescale.
   Conclusions. This process may be relevant for explaining how small,
   compact clumps of material can be brought onto plunging orbits, where
   they may produce individual short duration accretion events. The
   available energy and the characteristic timescale are consistent with
   energy released and the timescale typical of Galactic flares.},

Title = {Breaking of Internal Waves and Turbulent Dissipation in an Anticyclonic

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A4-month glider mission was analyzed to assess turbulent dissipation in
   an anticyclonic eddy at the western boundary of the subtropical North
   Atlantic. The eddy (radius approximate to 60 km) had a core of low
   potential vorticity between 100 and 450 m, with maximum radial
   velocities of 0.5ms(-1) and Rossby number approximate to -0.1. Turbulent
   dissipation was inferred from vertical water velocities derived from the
   glider flight model. Dissipation was suppressed in the eddy core
   (epsilon approximate to 5 x 10(-10) W kg(-1)) and enhanced below it
   (>10(-9) W kg(-1)). Elevated dissipation was coincident with
   quasiperiodic structures in the vertical velocity and pressure
   perturbations, suggesting internal waves as the drivers of dissipation.
   Aheuristic ray-tracing approximation was used to investigate the
   wave-eddy interactions leading to turbulent dissipation. Ray-tracing
   simulations were consistent with two types of wave-eddy interactions
   that may induce dissipation: the trapping of near-inertial wave energy
   by the eddy's relative vorticity, or the entry of an internal tide
   (generated at the nearby continental slope) to a critical layer in the
   eddy shear. The latter scenario suggests that the intense mesoscale
   field characterizing the western boundaries of ocean basins might act as
   a ``leaky wall'' controlling the propagation of internal tides into the
   basin's interior.},

Abstract = {Early Miocene limestones from the Wairarapa region of New Zealand were
   deposited on thrust-bounded margins of trench-slope basins, and consist
   of two superposed stratal units, namely units A and B, interpreted as
   forced regressive and forced transgressive foralgal and
   rhodolith-bearing deposits, respectively. Unit A is floored by a
   regressive surface of marine erosion cut into shelfal to bathyal
   siliciclastic successions, and is overlain across a transgressive
   surface of erosion by Unit B. A drowning surface abruptly places the
   latter deposits in contact with deeper hemipelagites and turbidites. The
   succession is explainable within a tectono-eustatic based framework as
   follows: (1) Structurally controlled rapid relative sea-level fall,
   (i.e. sea-bed rise), from upper bathyal to shelfal depths promoted
   development of regressive ('lowstand') mixed carbonate-siliciclastic
   deposits. Continuation of seabed rise resulted in deposition of pure
   carbonate sediments, which are represented by channel-fill rhodolithic
   rudstones; (2) early stage of relative sea-level rise (i.e. seabed
   drowning) caused emplacement of transgressive glauconitic limestones,
   consisting of either foralgal deposits, or incised rhodolithic
   limestones; (3) continued relative sea-level rise terminated carbonate
   production. The present study documents carbonate production and
   termination in a tectonically active and confined intra-slope setting,
   reflected in the development and distribution of unusual forced
   regressive, and transgressive rhodolithic-heterozoan carbonates.},

   Station and Corpus Christi, RPS Group, CLS Woods Hole Group, Fugro, and
   Ocean Sierra LLC, has gained access to many of these data from
   individual companies and also from Joint Industry Projects (JIPs). The
   acquired datasets have been fully quality controlled to U.S. Integrated
   Ocean Observing System (IOOS) standards and metadata appropriately
   supplemented. The datasets are available online through the GCOOS
   GulfHub data portal for us by anyone. In this paper, the overall
   project, system architecture and disaster recovery plan are described
   and an introduction to the available datasets, previously privately
   held, is provided. At the time of writing, more than 4600 unique
   physical oceanographic datasets are available on the GulfHub ERDDAP
   server. Of these, more than 2900 were previously industry proprietary
   datasets from deepwater moorings, offshore oil rigs and platforms, and
   vessels. It is anticipated that more than 5000 datasets will be
   available upon completion of the project, including data collected in
   the Understanding the Gulf Ocean Systems (UGOS) initiative of the
   National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The paper
   includes summaries of the extent and content of the various datasets.
   The research reported in this paper was supported by the Gulf Research
   Program of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
   under award number 2000009971.},

Title = {A sediment flow-through system to study the impact of shifting fluid and
   methane flow regimes on the efficiency of the benthic methane filter},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The efficiency of the ``benthic microbial methane filter{''} at marine
   cold seeps is controlled by diffusive sulfate supply from the overlying
   seawater and advective methane flux from deep reservoirs. High fluid
   fluxes reduce the penetration depth of sulfate and limit the filter to a
   very narrow zone close to the sediment-water interface. Here, we
   introduce a new sediment-flow-through (SLOT) system, to mimic the
   balance between fluid/methane flow and sulfate supply in natural
   sediments. SLOT enables anaerobic incubations of intact sediment cores
   under natural flow regimes. In addition to traditional in-and outflow
   sampling, geochemical parameters can be monitored along the sediment
   core using microsensors and rhizons. In a first test run, two cores with
   gassy sediments from the Eckernforde Bay (Baltic Sea) were incubated and
   monitored for 310 days under low (11.2 cm y(-1)) and high fluid flow
   (112.1 cm y(-1)) conditions. Rates of anaerobic oxidation of methane
   (AOM) were one order of magnitude higher (3.07 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) in the
   high flow compared to the low flow regime (0.29 mmol m(-2) d(-1)),
   whereas methane efflux was twice as high (0.063 and 0.033 mmol m(-2)
   d(-1), respectively). Sediment profiles of sulfide, sulfate, total
   alkalinity, pH, redox, and other parameters offered important
   information on the nature and dynamics of the biogeochemical reactions
   in the sediment cores including methanotrophy, sulfate reduction,
   carbonate precipitation, and sulfide oxidation. The SLOT system proofed
   to be an effective device to study the temporal evolution of
   biogeochemical parameters in intact sediments subjected to advective
   fluid transport.},

Abstract = {The distribution, contamination status, and ecological risks of heavy
   metals in Tahaddart estuary were investigated. 24 surface sediment
   samples and two cores were collected and analyzed for major (Al and Fe),
   heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn), and grain size
   composition. The heavy metals assessment was carried out using different
   environmental indices. The results indicated that the spatial
   distribution patterns of Al, Fe, and Zn were mainly determined by the
   distribution of the finer grained fraction (<63 mu m) in the sediment.
   In contrast, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb concentrations were controlled
   by anthropogenic activities (vehicular traffic from Highway Bridge and
   thermal power plant). The distribution of heavy metals in sediment cores
   showed an upward enrichment in heavy metals with high concentration
   found in the uppermost may related to the increasing in human
   activities. The pollution indexes confirmed that the Tahaddart estuary
   sediment was considerably to high contaminated by heavy metals near to
   different anthropogenic inputs. Similarly, the potential ecological risk
   index and the biological risk index present 21\% probability of toxicity
   posing potential risk to the aquatic organisms. These results provide
   basic information that can be used to protect and improve the quality of
   this ecosystem.},

Title = {Ability of crassulacean acid metabolism plants to overcome interacting
   stresses in tropical environments},
Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2010},
Number = {SI},
Abstract = {Background and aims Single stressors such as scarcity of water and
   extreme temperatures dominate the struggle for life in severely dry
   desert ecosystems or cold polar regions and at high elevations. In
   contrast, stress in the tropics typically arises from a dynamic network
   of interacting stressors, such as availability of water, CO2, light and
   nutrients, temperature and salinity. This requires more plastic
   spatio-temporal responsiveness and versatility in the acquisition and
   defence of ecological niches.
   Crassulacean acid metabolism The mode of photosynthesis of crassulacean
   acid metabolism (CAM) is described and its flexible expression endows
   plants with powerful strategies for both acclimation and adaptation.
   Thus, CAM plants are able to inhabit many diverse habitats in the
   tropics and are not, as commonly thought, successful predominantly in
   dry, high-insolation habitats.
   Tropical CAM habitats Typical tropical CAM habitats or ecosystems
   include exposed lava fields, rock outcrops of inselbergs, salinas,
   savannas, restingas, high-altitude paramos, dry forests and moist
   forests.
   Morphotypical and physiotypical plasticity of CAM Morphotypical and
   physiotypical plasticity of CAM phenotypes allow a wide ecophysiological
   amplitude of niche occupation in the tropics. Physiological and
   biochemical plasticity appear more responsive by having more readily
   reversible variations in performance than do morphological adaptations.
   This makes CAM plants particularly fit for the multi-factor stressor
   networks of tropical forests. Thus, while the physiognomy of
   semi-deserts outside the tropics is often determined by tall succulent
   CAM plants, tropical forests house many more CAM plants in terms of
   quantity (biomass) and quality (species diversity).},

Abstract = {The present paper aims at describing the use of a Synthetic-Eddy-Method
   (SEM), initially proposed by Jarrin et al. {[}12], in the 3D Lagrangian
   Vortex method framework. The SEM method is used here in order to
   generate a far-field incoming flow with a prescribed ambient turbulence
   intensity. However, for the account of the diffusive term in the
   NavierStokes equations, a classical Particle Strength Exchange model
   with a LES eddy viscosity is used.
   Firstly, the general characteristics of the Synthetic-Eddy-Method will
   be presented together with its integration in the framework of the
   developed 3D unsteady Lagrangian Vortex software {[}27]. The capability
   of the ambient turbulence model to reproduce a perturbed flow that
   verifies any turbulence intensity I-infinity and any anisotropic ratio
   (sigma(mu):sigma(upsilon):sigma(omega)) will be discussed and validated.
   Then, the capability of the presented ambient turbulence model to
   compute turbine wakes will also be presented together with first
   results. Finally, comparisons will be made between the obtained
   numerical results against experimental data {[}22, 23] for two levels of
   ambient turbulence, namely I-infinity = 3\% and I-infinity = 15\%.
   Although the present study was initially performed in the framework of
   tidal energy, its application to wind energy is straightforward.},

Title = {Modeling spatial and temporal variation of suitable nursery habitats for

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {For rare and endangered species, bioenergetics modeling can represent a
   valuable approach for understanding issues of habitat value and
   connectivity among potential habitats within nurseries in restoration
   programs. We used multivariable bioenergetics and survival models for
   Atlantic sturgeon to generate spatially explicit maps of potential
   production in the Chesapeake Bay. For the period 1993-2002, spatial and
   temporal patterns in water quality effects (temperature, dissolved
   oxygen {[}DO] and salinity) on potential production were evaluated. In
   addition, two forecasted scenarios were modeled: one implementing newly
   revised U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) DO-criteria for the
   Chesapeake Bay, and the other assuming a bay-wide increase of 1 degrees
   C due to an underlying trend in regional climate. Atlantic sturgeon's
   low (survival/growth) tolerance to temperatures > 28 degrees C was a
   critical constraint during their first 1-2 summers of life. Hatched in
   freshwater (spring to mid-summer), young-of-the-year were predicted to
   occupy cooler (deeper) areas as temperature approached sub-lethal
   levels. While most thermal refuges were located down-estuary, a large
   fraction of potential refuges were unsuitable due to persistent hypoxia
   and/or salinity levels beyond the limited osmoregulatory capabilities of
   early juvenile Atlantic sturgeon. As a result, suitable summer habitats
   for juvenile Atlantic sturgeons in the Chesapeake Bay were predicted to
   be spatially restricted and variable between years, ranging from 0 to
   35\% of the modeled bay surface area. In critical (drought) years,
   almost no summer habitat was predicted to be available for juvenile
   Atlantic sturgeon. Value and size of nursery habitat was highly
   sensitive to climatic oscillations and anthropogenic interventions
   affecting freshwater inflow, water temperature and/or DO. Achieving EPA
   DO-criteria for the Chesapeake Bay was predicted to increase total
   suitable habitat by 13\% for an average year, while increasing water
   temperature by just 1 degrees C bay-wide would reduce suitable habitat
   by 65\%. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {First assessment of domestic and industrial effluents impact on
   intertidal zone of Safi coastline (west of Morocco): physicochemical
   characteristics and metallic trace contamination},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effects of urban and industrial
   effluents on the intertidal seawater and sediments quality of Safi
   coastline (western Morocco). This is a pioneer work carried out in the
   transition zone between seawater and wastewater. In addition, it sheds
   light on the destructive consequences of the aforementioned effluents on
   the biocenosis specific to this biotope. For this purpose, four sampling
   campaigns covering five critical stations were selected. We considered
   the seaside area as a reference station. All the indicators of the
   environmental health and metallic contamination used for this monitoring
   were measured at low tide: the mixing waters' physicochemical parameters
   (temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, and turbidity), the levels of
   four metallic trace elements (copper, zinc, lead, and cadmium) in both
   water and superficial marine sediments, the pollution indices that
   reflect the level of biotope healthiness, as well as the pollution load
   parameters (BOD5 and COD). The results indicated a great variability of
   physicochemical parameters measured at the seawater-wastewater mixing
   zone, with no significant difference observed between the reference
   station SO and the investigated stations S1, S2, S3 and S4. However,
   these last three stations revealed a much lower environmental quality.
   Furthermore, the effluents were found to be loaded with lead, cadmium
   and, to a lesser extent, copper. In fact, the pollution indices had
   confirmed that the analyzed seawater as well as the surficial sediments
   were heavily polluted with trace elements. The statistical analysis of
   wastewater revealed four distinct groups; (i) domestic; (ii) food
   industry; (iii) domestic-industry; and (iv) phosphate industry. These
   effluents are generally biodegradable except for station S5. This study
   provides a solid baseline for a future sustainable monitoring program to
   rehabilitate Safi coastline and safeguard its biocenosis.},

   spring cereals},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE \& HORTICULTURE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {257-274},
Abstract = {Partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA) was applied to analyse the
   relationship between weed species composition and agricultural
   management measures in organically cropped spring cereal fields. Density
   and dry weight of weed species were assessed in 30 fields situated in
   the coastal regions of Finland. The pRDA analysis included nine
   explanatory variables describing management (years since conversion to
   organic farming, crop rotation, crop, soil pH, fertilization, burial of
   manure, weed management, application of stubble cultivation and crop dry
   weight) and two not manipulable variables (location of the field and
   soil type). The only statistically significant variables appeared to be
   crop dry weight, years since conversion to organic farming and cropping
   of wheat. The abundances of Elymus repens and Cirsium arvense increased
   as a function of years since conversion to organic farming. There was no
   relationship between the ratio of non-nitrophilous to nitrophilous
   species and the duration of organic farming. The abundances of C.
   arvense and Sonchus arvensis as well as of most annual species were
   inversely related to crop dry weight and they were not associated with
   cropping of wheat. The shade-tolerant species Chenopodium spp., Fallopia
   convolvulus and Viola arvensis maintained their dry weight in conditions
   of increasing crop dry weight and cropping of wheat. Galium spp. were
   associated with cropping of wheat. Weed species associated with years
   since conversion to organic farming were only in a few cases identical
   with species associated with low crop dry weight, which emphasizes the
   importance of both short- and long-term agricultural management with
   regard to weed control in organic farming.},

Title = {Impact of submesoscale variability in estimating the air-sea CO2
   exchange: Results from a model study of the POMME experiment},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {23},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {A high-resolution ocean biogeochemical model is used to estimate oceanic
   pCO(2) and air-sea CO2 flux in the NE Atlantic. The model is validated
   against shipboard and Carioca drifting float data acquired during the
   POMME experiment. Between winter and spring, the seasonal variability is
   characterized by a rapid drawdown of pCO(2) of similar to 20 mu atm
   associated with the phytoplankton bloom driving CO2 uptake by the ocean.
   The model reveals that this uptake propagates northward in response to
   the northward propagation of the bloom. More remarkably, this study
   demonstrates intense variability of the carbon system at the
   submesoscale. Our model predicts filamentary structures of pCO(2) that
   show gradients of 25 mu atm over 20 km, consistent with observations
   from Carioca drifting floats. This submesoscale variability is similar
   in magnitude to the mean seasonal drawdown. Lagrangian diagnostics
   suggest that pCO(2) small-scale structures are shaped by horizontal
   stirring of large-scale gradients created by the bloom northward
   propagation. We compared air-sea flux derived from model pCO(2) and from
   observed pCO(2) and estimated the error due to data undersampling to
   similar to 15 to 30\%. Results from a simulation at coarser resolution
   showed that the impact of model resolution on air-sea CO2 flux is only
   similar to 5\%. This suggests that the submesoscale variability of
   pCO(2), although large in amplitude, accounts for small modulation of
   the net air-sea CO2 flux in this region. Citation:},

   Discrete samples included: chlorophyll a (Chl a), phytoplankton

Abstract = {Vertical flux of organic waste from a Norwegian salmon farm (which
   produced 2910 tonnes of fish in 19 months) located in 230-m-deep water
   was measured nine times in the course of 2 years by sediment traps along
   a transect stretching from the farm and 3 km out towards the sea. The
   chemical composition of the trapped material and the sediment below the
   traps were analyzed. The results showed that when the fish farm was
   empty, sedimentation rates of organic matter were similar all along the
   transect. Throughout the production cycle high and very variable
   sedimentation rates of particulate organic matter, particulate organic
   carbon and particulate organic nitrogen were measured within 250 m from
   the farm, while between 550 and 3000 m away from the farm sedimentation
   rates were lower and constant throughout the cycle. During the second
   year of production, the annual vertical flux of particulate organic
   carbon to the bottom adjacent to the farm was 365 g m(-2), nine times as
   high as what was found 3 km away from the farm. While the sedimentation
   rates showed that most of the waste matter settled within 250 m of the
   farm, the fatty acid composition and delta C-13 isotope ratio of the
   material in the bottom traps indicate that some components of the
   organic waste were transported as far as 550 to 900 m, probably due to
   resuspension of surface sediment. Despite the high sedimentation rates
   the content of sedimentary organic matter, total organic carbon and
   total organic nitrogen was not elevated in the sediment around the farm.
   However, phosphorus was found in higher concentrations in the sediments
   close to the farm, indicating that organic matter had settled on the
   sediment and been decomposed. The unchanged content of organic matter in
   the sediment during the production cycle showed that at this site the
   local resuspension and dispersal conditions and the decomposition
   capacity of the benthos were sufficient to prevent overloading of the
   locality. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evaluation of the seasonal formation of subsurface negative preformed
   nitrate anomalies in the subtropical North Pacific and North Atlantic},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Summertime mixed-layer drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon in the
   absence of measurable nutrients in the ocean's subtropical gyres and
   non-Redfieldian oxygen : nitrate relationships in the underlying
   subsurface waters are two biogeochemical phenomena that have thus far
   eluded complete description. Many processes are thought to contribute to
   one or both, including lateral nutrient transport, carbon
   overconsumption or non-Redfield C : N : P organic matter cycling,
   heterotrophic nutrient uptake, and the actions of vertically migrating
   phytoplankton. To obtain insight into the likely magnitude of potential
   contributing mechanisms that can remove nitrate from the nutricline
   while supporting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) drawdown tens of
   meters higher in the water column, we investigated the seasonal
   formation rates for negative preformed nitrate (preNO(3)) anomalies
   (oxygen consumption without stoichiometric nitrate release) in the
   subsurface and positive preformed nitrate anomalies (oxygen production
   without stoichiometric nitrate drawdown) in the euphotic zone at the
   subtropical ocean time series stations ALOHA (A Long-Term Oligotrophic
   Habitat Assessment) in the North Pacific and BATS (Bermuda Atlantic
   Time-series Study) in the North Atlantic. Non-Redfield -O-2 : N
   stoichiometry for dissolved organic matter (DOM) remineralization
   accounts for up to similar to 15 mmol Nm(-2) yr(-1) of negative preNO(3)
   anomaly formation at both stations. We present a new formulation for
   calculating preNO(3) (residual preNO(3)) that includes components
   resulting from non-Redfield DOM cycling. Residual negative preNO(3)
   anomalies in excess of that which can be accounted for by non-Redfield
   DOM cycling are found to accumulate at a rate of similar to 32-46 mmol
   Nm(-2) yr(-1) at Station ALOHA and similar to 46-87 mmol Nm(-2) yr(-1)
   at the BATS station. These negative anomaly formation rates are in
   approximate balance with residual positive preNO(3) anomaly formation
   rates from the euphotic zone located immediately above the nutricline in
   the water column. We evaluate three mechanisms to explain these
   anomalies, calculating that transparent exopolymer particle (TEP)
   cycling and heterotrophic nitrate uptake can contribute to the formation
   of both residual preNO(3) anomalies. However, a significant fraction,
   estimated at similar to 50\%-95\%, is unexplained by the sum of these
   processes. Vertically migrating phytoplankton possess the necessary
   distribution, nutrient acquisition strategy, and biogeochemical
   signature to simultaneously remove nitrate at depth and transport it
   above the nutricline. Reported transport rates by known migrators equal
   or exceed the residual preNO(3) anomaly formation rates and potentially
   explain both the negative and positive residual preNO(3) anomalies as
   well as the mixed-layer DIC drawdown at the stations ALOHA and BATS
   within the limits of scarce detailed abundance profiles. However, the
   three processes examined are not independent and mutually exclusive. The
   model Rhizosolenia mat system (and perhaps other migrators) produces
   TEPs, suggesting that migration could provide accelerated vertical
   transport of TEPs and provide labile carbon for heterotrophic nitrate
   uptake.
   These results based on geochemical distributions suggest that, in the
   absence of additional mechanisms and rates, phytoplankton vertical
   migrators, although rare and easily overlooked, play a larger role in
   subtropical ocean nutrient cycling and the biological pump than
   generally recognized.},

Title = {Utilization of GOCI data to evaluate the diurnal vertical migration of
   Microcystis aeruginosa and the underlying driving factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {310},

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms are one of the most severe ecological problems
   affecting lakes. The vertical migration of cyanobacteria in the water
   column increases the uncertainty in the formation and disappearance of
   blooms, which may be closely associated with light, temperature, and
   wind speed. However, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the
   influencing factors of cyanobacteria vertical movement in natural
   environment compared to the laboratory experimental environment.
   Besides, both field survey and laboratory experiment method have the
   difficulties in determining the diurnal vertical migration of
   cyanobacteria at the synoptic lake scale. In this study, based on the
   diurnal dynamics of cyanobacterial bloom intensity (CBI) observed by the
   Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) from 2011 to 2019, the daily
   variations, floating rate, and sinking rate of Microcystis aeruginosa
   were calculated in the natural environment. Then, the effects of light,
   temperature, and wind speed on the vertical migration of M. aeruginosa
   were analysed from the perspectives of day, night, and season. The
   results are as follows: the records of three typical patterns of diurnal
   CBI exhibited strong seasonal variability from the 9-year statistics; at
   night, the buoyancy recovery rate of cyanobacterial colonies increased
   with temperature, so that at temperature > 15 ? and wind speed < 3 m
   s(-1), CBI reached the maximum of the whole day at 08:16; the sinking
   rate of M. aeruginosa was positively correlated with the cumulated light
   energy at both synoptic and pixel scale; the upward migration speed of
   M. aeruginosa was positively correlated with the maximum wind speed of
   the day before cyanobacterial bloom. Therefore, the severer
   cyanobacterial blooms were often observed by satellite images after
   strong winds. The analysis of diurnal variation, floating rate, and
   sinking rate of M. aeruginosa will expand our knowledge for further
   understanding the formation mechanism of cyanobacterial blooms and for
   improving the accuracy of model simulation to predict the hourly changes
   in cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu.},

Abstract = {This research is focused on facies distribution, palaeoecology and
   palaeoenvironment of the Guri Member of the Mishan Formation in Kuh-e
   Shur and Kuh-e Kurdeh sections at the Lar area, Fars province. The Guri
   Member is composed of limestone, marly limestone and marl and the
   thickness at Kuh-e Shur and Kuh-e Kurdeh is about 72 and 110 meters,
   respectively. Based on petrographical studies of 120 thin sections, 8
   microfacies have been identified that are deposited in open shelf
   environment (inner and middle shelf). Palaeolatitudinal reconstructions
   based on skeletal grains suggests that carbonate sedimentation of Guri
   Member took place in tropical waters under oligotrophic conditions, a
   typical environment for photozoan assemblages. These biotic assemblages
   of the Guri Member belong to foralgal association and may be broadly
   defined as comprising heterozoan assemblages. An important factor
   controlling the spread of heterozoan assemblages during the Early
   Miocene in the study areas seem to be related to the palaeoecology and
   evolution of zooxanthellate corals.},

Abstract = {Climate change being in the verge of all discussions points most of its
   focus on the change in the snow cover area which leads to increase in
   sea surface level in the long term and sometimes flood like scenario in
   the short term. So monitoring the snow areas with respect to time is a
   must to understand the effects of climate change more closely. This work
   demonstrate the application of Feature Oriented Principal Component
   Analysis (FPCA), also called as ``Crosta technique{''} {[}1]. FPCA is a
   multivariate statistical technique used to transform the set of
   relatively correlated spectral bands of Landsat 8 to uncorrelated
   Principal Components. The statistical interpretation of the loadings of
   the SWIR wavelength band (sensitive to snow/glacier) in different PCs
   were used to generate a snow/glacier color composite image (Crosta

Title = {Management implications of including a climate-induced recruitment shift
   in the stock assessment for jackass morwong (Nemadactylus macropterus)
   in south-eastern Australia},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {142},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {47-55},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Fishery responses to climate change are occurring on time-scales
   relevant to the provision of short-term management advice. This is
   especially the case in climate change `hotspots' such as south-eastern
   Australia, where the rate of ocean-warming is 3-4 times the global
   average. The application of harvest strategies utilizing biological
   reference points that do not take into account the effect of the
   changing environment on fish productivity may lead to unsustainable
   catch recommendations. jackass morwong (Nemadactylus macropterus) is a
   moderately long-lived demersal species inhabiting continental shelf
   waters of the southern hemisphere. The most recent Stock Synthesis
   assessment for the species suggests that this stock has recently
   declined in abundance off south-eastern Australia. The stock assessment
   attributes the decline to mostly below average recruitment since 1985,
   but the recommended catch levels are based on an assumption of average
   recruitment from a stationary stock-recruitment relationship. The
   ability of Stock Synthesis to include an environmental variable to
   adjust the stock-recruitment relationship is used to model a regime
   shift on the average level of recruitment. Management strategy
   evaluation (MSE) is then used to examine the consequences of using the
   wrong recruitment assumption in the assessment used in the harvest
   strategy for setting the catches. The MSE shows that the consequences of
   mis-specifying the assessment model are greater if the assessment
   continues to assume that no shift in recruitment has occurred. Thus the
   more precautionary approach for management wishing to meet all the aims
   of the Australian government Harvest Strategy Policy is to assume that a
   shift in recruitment has occurred. A possible mechanism for how observed
   oceanic changes could be impacting jackass morwong recruitment is
   presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},

Volume = {84},

Abstract = {Following the UN adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
   in September 2015, the Government of Montenegro entered in the final
   phase of revising of National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD
   2030). Under the supervision of the National Council for Sustainable
   Development, Climate Change and Integrated Coastal Zone Management, an
   NSSD team of national and international experts was assembled under the
   coordination of the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism. To
   demonstrate commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda, Montenegro decided to
   center the NSSD 2030 on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
   targets and indicators. One of the first UN member countries to
   implement the UN 2030 Agenda within the national policy context,
   Montenegro adopted its NSSD 2030 on July 7, 2016. As members of the NSSD
   team, here we 1) describe how the UN 2030 Agenda has been implemented
   within the policy context of Montenegro's NSSD 2030, and 2) focus on the
   identification of the NSSD 2030 monitoring and reporting framework. Our
   key finding is that 26 institutions will be handling data for assessing
   137 out of the 241 (56.8\%) SDG indicators in the first reporting period
   scheduled for 2019. Although the paper deals with the implementation of
   the SDGs in Montenegro and its implications, we believe it will be
   useful in informing other countries in their process of national
   transposition and operationalization of the UN 2030 Agenda.},

Abstract = {We gathered total organic carbon (\%) and relative abundances of benthic
   foraminifera in intertidal areas and transitional waters from the
   English Channel/European Atlantic Coast (587 samples) and the
   Mediterranean Sea (301 samples) regions from published and unpublished
   datasets. This database allowed to calculate total organic carbon
   optimum and tolerance range of benthic foraminifera in order to assign
   them to ecological groups of sensitivity. Optima and tolerance range
   were obtained by mean of the weighted-averaging method. The data are
   related to the research article titled ``Indicative value of benthic
   foraminifera for biomonitoring: assignment to ecological groups of

Title = {Assessing Ocean Acidification Variability in the Pacific-Arctic Region
   as Part of the Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic},
Journal = {OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA) project
   provides a rare opportunity to study the Russian sector of the Pacific
   Arctic Region (PAR), which includes the Chukchi and East Siberian Seas.
   RUSALCA data from 2009 and 2012 allow fuller understanding of changes in
   ocean chemistry across this the region and, in particular, provide
   perspectives on the ocean carbon cycle, airsea CO2 gas exchange, and
   ocean acidification variability. Summertime surface waters of the
   western Chukchi Sea and East Siberian Sea mostly exhibited low pCO(2) (<
   100 to 400 mu atm) and high pH (8.0 to 8.4) conditions during sea ice
   retreat. As earlier studies of the adjacent eastern Chukchi Sea show,
   this area of the PAR had a strong potential for ocean uptake of
   atmospheric CO2, with saturation states for calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
   minerals such as calcite and aragonite (Ocalcite and Oaragonite,
   respectively) having values generally greater than two, thereby
   facilitating CaCO3 production. In contrast, fresher surface waters
   flowing into the Chukchi Sea from the East Siberian Sea and bottom
   waters on the PAR shelves exhibited high pCO(2) and low pH, Ocalcite,
   and Oaragonite conditions. Low Omega surface waters near the Russian
   coast and nearly 70\% of waters next to the seafloor were corrosive to
   CaCO3 minerals such as aragonite, with this change seemingly occurring
   at a more rapid rate than typical global open-ocean changes in ocean
   chemistry. The exposure of subsurface benthic communities and nearshore
   ecosystems near the Russian coast to potentially corrosive water is
   likely exacerbated by the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and gradual
   ocean acidification. The RUSALCA project also highlights the
   complexities and uncertainties in the physical and biogeochemical
   drivers of the ocean carbon cycle and ocean chemistry in this region of
   the Arctic.},

Title = {Projected SST trends across the Caribbean Sea based on PRECIS
   downscaling of ECHAM4, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {123},

Pages = {199-215},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Caribbean Sea and adjacent land areas are highly sensitive to the
   projected impacts of global climate change. The countries bordering the
   Caribbean Sea depend heavily on coastal and marine assets as a major
   source of livelihood support. Rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are
   known to be associated with coral bleaching, ocean acidification, and
   other phenomena that threaten livelihoods in the region. The paucity of
   SST systematic observations in both the Caribbean Sea and adjoining
   Western Atlantic waters is a limiting factor in the projection of future
   climate change impacts on the region's marine resources. Remote sensing
   of SST by satellites began only within the last three decades and
   although the data collected so far might be insufficient to provide
   conclusive definitions of long-term SST variations in the Caribbean
   waters, these data along with the output from climate model simulations
   provide a useful basis for gaining further insights into plausible SST
   futures under IPCC SRES scenarios. In this paper, we examine the recent
   SST records from the NESDIS AVHRR satellite data and NOAA Optimum
   Interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature V2 and provide a comparative
   analysis of projected SST changes for the Caribbean Sea up to the end of
   the twenty-first century, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios'
   simulations of the sea surface skin temperatures (SSsT) using the Hadley
   Centre's regional model, PRECIS. The implications of these projected SST
   changes for bleaching of coral reefs, one of the region's most valuable
   marine resource, and for rainfall are also discussed.},

Title = {Multi-objective optimization of hybrid renewable energy systems with
   urban building energy modeling for a prototypical coastal community},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-84},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many regions, such as coastal communities, are often located at the end
   of large transmission lines, leaving them susceptible to power outages
   and reliant on conventional fuels. We propose a multi-disciplinary,
   multi-objective optimization method to design a hybrid renewable energy
   system mix including solar, wind, and marine energy for these regions.
   The method first simulates demand for Eastport - a prototypical coastal
   community in Maine (USA) - using urban building energy modeling, and
   subsequently develops an hourly optimization and time series
   load-balancing approach to derive an optimal mix of renewable energy
   systems to meet the region's de-mand. Our results suggest that while
   different renewable energy system mixes can be viable, optimizing for
   cost, energy utilization, and power deficit can be increasingly
   challenging as higher annual demand hours (>90\%) are met. This suggests
   that the final percentages require a disproportionate effort to achieve,
   and it will be chal-lenging to meet 100\% renewable energy deployment
   for all demand hours across a year. The proposed method is scalable - it
   can be applied to other regions to help policymakers and city planners
   make informed, data-driven decisions for various energy and city
   planning policy analyses and interventions.},

Title = {Time-domain modeling of a fixed detached oscillating water column
   towards a floating multi-chamber device},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {65-74},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {A simplified time-domain model for a fixed detached Oscillating Water
   Column (OWC) device is presented as a first step towards modeling a
   floating multi-chamber OWC device. The motion of a floating body in the
   time-domain is expressed by Cummins integro-differential equation, and
   based on it, water mass motion inside the chamber has been modeled here
   as a piston-like motion. Radiation, hydrostatic, excitation and viscous
   forces have been considered, as well as the added mass of the water in
   the chamber and the effect of the air pressure inside it. The equation
   of the floating body in the time domain has been approximated by a
   state-space method, which comes from the extension of the state-space
   system corresponding to the convolution integral of the radiation force.
   Experimental data have been used for model calibration and validation.
   Furthermore, the model has also been validated with a widely used
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model (IH-2VOF). These show that the
   model presented is reliable and computationally efficient allowing for
   massive simulations for a statistical design or economic feasibility
   studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Discussion of Boretti, A., `Is there any support in the long term tide

Abstract = {Boretti (2012) claims that sea-level records show insufficient
   acceleration to support the projections of sea-level rise that are used
   worldwide for planning and policy-making. Unfortunately, his claim is
   based more on flawed qualitative reasoning than on quantitative
   analysis.
   We replicate Boretti's methodology of fitting quadratic functions to
   tide-gauge observations from Fremantle and Sydney, in order to estimate
   the sea-level acceleration. However, we also evaluate the uncertainty in
   these estimates (a crucial step, omitted by Boretti), and thereby show
   that the observed accelerations are statistically consistent with the
   projections of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change. Our finding is the same when we repeat this
   analysis using two data sets which have smaller uncertainties, one from
   satellite altimeters and the other from a sea-level reconstruction. We
   therefore conclude that Boretti's claim is without foundation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Swelling in polymeric membranes due to the humid feed is a major issue
   in gas separation applications at offshore conditions. To ensure the
   integrity of the polymeric membrane, a high capital cost dehydration
   system is typically installed together with the membrane system. Hence,
   to minimize the dehydration requirement, a swelling resistant membrane
   was developed by film casting of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) over
   polysulfone (PSF). The PSF/PDMS composite membrane exhibited higher
   contact angle as compared to PSF membrane. Performances of the developed
   membranes were evaluated with and without water in the feed gases at the
   pressure of 2-10 bar. Separation performance in the PSF membrane was
   affected by swelling in the membrane; however, the composite membrane
   with the PDMS film resisted the water swelling in membrane and CO2/CH4
   selectivity increased from 21.6 to 27.7 at 10 bar. Under wet feed
   conditions, the PSF/PDMS composite membrane exhibited stability for 24 h
   with stable permeance and selectivity. Based on the permeation results
   and the stable performance of a PSF/PDMS membrane, it can be concluded
   that the developed composite membrane demonstrates a potential to be
   used in an offshore membrane system with the minimum dehydration
   requirement for CO2/CH4 separation.},

Abstract = {Mercury is a poisonous heavy metal that causes deleterious effects on
   public health and the ecosystem, even with a trace level of
   contamination. Selective separation of mercury ions in an aqueous
   environment is a challenging task, while supported liquid membrane poses
   to be a promising tool. In this research work, the removal of mercury
   ions using a porous PTFE membrane with TBP as a carrier has been
   studied. Batch experiments were carried out in an SLM reactor with feed
   phase and strip phase solution on either side of the membrane. Maximum
   removal of 97\% of Hg2+ ions occurred under optimum conditions, namely,
   0.5 M of HCl (feed), 0.4 M NaOH (strip), 90\% of TBP, stirring speed at
   300 rpm and 3 h of reaction time. SEM analysis of the membrane confirmed
   the formation of a complex between TBP and Hg2+ ions. SLM was found to
   be stable for 18 h. The high selectivity of the SLM towards Hg2+ ions
   was unaltered in the presence of Cd2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ ions. The proposed
   SLM was used for the treatment of spiked seawater samples, wastewater
   from a thermal power plant, and contaminated lake water samples. The
   results indicated that the SLM system was highly efficient in removing
   Hg2+ ions from real contaminated samples.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of the feasibility of pressure retarded osmosis:
   Recent technological advances and industrial efforts towards
   commercialization},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {491},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) has been
   continuously investigated, based on its potential to harvest energy from
   a salinity gradient. However, recent negative reports on its fundamental
   feasibility and the closure of the largest industrial implementation
   have slowed its momentum, with regard to its commercialization. In this
   respect, this review provides insights into the current status of PRO
   technologies in membrane fabrication, module design, process
   optimization, and industrial movements for the commercialization of PRO.
   Notably, despite dramatic advancements in lab-scale PRO membrane
   performance, recent modeling studies have revealed advanced membrane
   properties have only a minor impact on PRO performance. In contrast,
   developing PRO module designs are deemed to have paramount importance,
   due to the drastically low module performance compared to lab-scale
   membrane performance, and high potential of design modification to
   resolve inefficient PRO module structures. Various simulation methods
   for optimizing PRO processes using the classic mass transfer model,
   thermodynamics, and machine learning optimizations are comparatively
   analyzed. Integrations of seawater reverse osmosis and PRO and other
   hybrid processes with PRO are discussed in terms of recent pilot-scale
   implementations and modeling results. Finally, small and large
   industrial movements and projects for PRO commercialization are analyzed
   in detail, based on their quantitative outcomes.},

Abstract = {A bilayer WO3 photoelectrode was obtained by radio frequency (RF) plasma
   sputtering in a reactive 40\% O-2/Ar atmosphere by depositing two
   successive WO3 coatings on a tungsten foil at two different total gas
   pressures (3 Pa and 1.7 Pa, respectively), followed by calcination at
   600 degrees C. Two monolayer samples deposited at each of the two
   pressures and a bilayer sample deposited at inverted pressures were also
   prepared. Their photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activity was evaluated by
   both Incident Photon-to-Current Efficiency (IPCE) measurements and
   separate evolution of H-2 and O-2 by water splitting in a
   two-compartment PEC cell. SEM analysis revealed that the photoanodes
   have a nanostructured porous double layer surmounting a columnar
   basement (Staffa-like morphology, after the name of the Scottish
   island). Mott-Schottky analysis showed that the single layer deposited
   at 3 Pa has a conduction flat band potential 0.1 V more positive than
   that deposited at 1.7 Pa. The equivalent n-n heterojunction at the
   interface of the double-layer creates a built-in electric field that
   facilitates the photopromoted electron transfer toward the lower lying
   conduction band material, while the columnar innermost layer introduces
   percolation paths for efficient electron transport toward the conductive
   tungsten foil. Both phenomena contribute to decrease the interfacial
   charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and lead up to a ca. 30\% increase in
   the PEC performance compared to the monolayer and the inverted bilayer
   coatings and to a 93\% faradaic efficiency, which is among the highest
   reported so far for WO3 photoanodes. Upon methanol addition an
   outstanding 4-fold photocurrent density increase up to 6.3 mA cm(-2) was
   attained over the bilayer WO3 photoanode, much larger than the usually
   observed current doubling effect.},

Abstract = {Fertilization experiments have established that seagrass growth in

   shoot density, biomass, growth, tissue nutrient content, amino acid
   concentrations and delta(15)N ratios) of Zostera capricorni Aschers. in
   Moreton Bay, close to and distant from nutrient sources, were compared.
   Z. capricorni at the four sites close to nutrient sources (sewage,
   septic or prawn-farm effluent, or river discharge), had physiological
   characteristics representative of high nutrient availability and at the
   five sites distant from nutrient sources had physiological
   characteristics representative of low nutrient availability. Differences
   in sediment nutrient concentrations (NH4+ and PO43-), seagrass
   morphology and growth were not related to proximity to nutrient sources.
   However, the nutrient content of the seagrasses and their amino acid
   concentrations were consistently higher at sites close to a nutrient
   source. The amino acids glutamine and asparagine were the most
   responsive to elevated nutrient availability, and delta(15)N values of
   seagrasses reflected the source of N rather than the nutrient load.
   These results demonstrate that physiological characteristics of
   seagrasses can be used to identify the nutrient load and source
   affecting marine ecosystems.},

Title = {Nanofiltration process efficiency in water desalination},
Journal = {SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION REVIEWS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {303-325},
Abstract = {Nanofiltration (NF) membranes have applications in several areas. One of
   the main applications has been in brackish and sea water treatment for
   drinking water production as well as for wastewater treatment. NF can
   either be used to treat all kinds of water including ground, surface,
   and wastewater or used as a pre treatment for desalination. The
   introduction of NF as a pre treatment is considered a breakthrough for
   the desalination process. NF membranes have the ability to remove
   turbidity, hardness, fluoride and nitrate as well as a significant
   fraction of dissolved salts. Desalination can be performed with a
   significantly lower operating pressure and becomes a much more
   energy-efficient process. NF membrane transport properties, process
   prediction and modeling are very important. The ability to predict the
   performance of NF processes will allow for a reduce number of
   experiments, saving money and helping to understand the NF separation

Title = {Exposure of Marine Turtle Nesting Grounds to Named Storms Along the
   Continental USA},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Named storms can cause substantial impacts on the habitat and
   reproductive output of threatened species, such as marine turtles. To
   determine the impacts of named storms on marine turtles and inform
   management, it is necessary to determine the exposure of marine turtle
   nesting grounds to recent storm activities. To address this, remote
   sensing information of named storm tracks coupled with nesting ground
   data were used to investigate the temporal and spatial overlap between
   nesting grounds for four species of marine turtles in the continental
   United States of America. All species of marine turtles were exposed to
   named storms, with variation in exposure driven by the spatial
   distribution of each population's nesting ground, the temporal overlap
   between the storms and reproductive events, and nest placement on the
   beach. Loggerhead turtles were the most exposed species to named storms,
   with the northern management unit having significantly higher exposure
   levels than all other loggerhead management units. Kemp's ridley
   turtles, in contrast, were found to be the least exposed species to
   named storms. This study establishes a valuable current baseline against
   which to measure and compare future impacts that result as climate
   change progresses and storms become more frequent and intense.
   Importantly, cumulative and synergetic effects from other climatic
   processes and anthropogenic stressors should be considered in future
   analysis.},

Abstract = {We consider a maritime inventory routing problem for Norway's largest
   salmon farmer both producing the feed at a production factory and being
   responsible for fish farms located along the Norwegian coast. The
   company has bought two new ships to transport the feed from the factory
   to the fish farms and is responsible for the routing and scheduling of
   the ships. In addition, the company has to ensure that the feed at the
   production factory as well as at the fish farms is within the inventory
   limits. A mathematical model of the problem is presented, and this model
   is reformulated to improve the efficiency of the branch-and-bound
   algorithm and tightened with valid inequalities. To derive good
   solutions quickly, several practical aspects of the problem are utilized
   and two matheuristics developed. Computational results are reported for
   instances based on the real problem of the salmon farmer.},

Abstract = {There exists a rich understanding of channel forms and processes for
   rivers with unidirectional flows, and for their estuarine components
   with bidirectional flows. On the other hand, complementary insight on
   the transitional reach linking these flows has not been well developed.
   This study highlights analyses of high-resolution, high-accuracy
   bathymetric surveys along a coastal plain river at 30-94 km upstream of
   the estuary mouth. The goal of this work was to identify geomorphic
   indicators of the fluvial-tidal transition channel. Trends with sharp
   breaks were detected in along-channel variations in depth, hydraulic
   radius, channel shape, bed elevation, and sinuosity, but cross-section
   area of flow provided the greatest insight. The transition channel is
   characterized as a reach with greater than 50\% decline in area of flow
   relative to the background values at the upstream and downstream ends.
   Further downstream, the river is a mixed bedrock-alluvium system, and a
   22 km reach of discontinuous bedrock outcrops has a marked influence on
   local channel metrics, and corresponding backwater effects on upstream
   metrics. Despite the confounding effects of bedrock on channel form, the
   transition channel linking estuarine and fluvial channel segments is
   apparent as a 13 km geomorphic discontinuity in flow area along a
   channel reach of relatively uniform width. Finally, it is proposed that
   bedrock outcrops enhance tidal energy dissipation and influence the
   position of the fluvial-tidal transition reach, and associated
   geomorphic and hydrodynamic features.},

Abstract = {Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are important components of many marine
   ecosystems. They aid in reef accretion and stabilization, create habitat
   for other organisms, contribute to carbon sequestration and are
   important settlement substrata for a number of marine invertebrates.
   Despite their ecological importance, little is known about the bacterial
   communities associated with CCA or whether differences in bacterial
   assemblages may have ecological implications. This study examined the
   bacterial communities on four different species of CCA collected in
   Belize using bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing of the
   V1-V3 region of the 16S rDNA. CCA were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria,
   Gammaproteobacteria and Actinomycetes. At the operational taxonomic unit
   (OTU) level, each CCA species had a unique bacterial community that was
   significantly different from all other CCA species. Hydrolithon
   boergesenii and Titanoderma prototypum, CCA species that facilitate
   larval settlement in multiple corals, had higher abundances of OTUs
   related to bacteria that inhibit the growth and/or biofilm formation of
   coral pathogens. Fewer coral larvae settle on the surfaces of
   Paragoniolithon solubile and Porolithon pachydermum. These CCA species
   had higher abundances of OTUs related to known coral pathogens and
   cyanobacteria. Coral larvae may be able to use the observed differences
   in bacterial community composition on CCA species to assess the
   suitability of these substrata for settlement and selectively settle on
   CCA species that contain beneficial bacteria.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a multi-agent robotic fish system used for
   mariculture monitoring. Autonomous robotic fish is designed to swim
   underwater to collect marine information such as water temperature and
   pollution level. Each robotic fish has 5 degrees of freedom for
   controlling its depth and speed by mimicking a sea carp. Its bionic body
   design enables it to have high swimming efficiency and less disturbance
   to the surrounding sea lives. Several onboard sensors are equipped for
   autonomous 3D navigation tasks such as path planning, obstacle avoidance
   and depth maintenance. A robotic buoy floating on the water surface is
   deployed as a control hub to communicate with individual robots, which
   in turn form a multi-agent system to monitor and cover a large scale sea
   coast cooperatively. Both laboratory experiments and field testing have
   been conducted to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed
   multi-agent system.},

Title = {Reactive transport modelling insights into CO2 migration through
   sub-vertical fluid flow structures},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {82-92},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sub-vertical geological structures that cut through the overburden,
   usually called chimneys or pipes, are common in sedimentary basins.
   Chimneys behave as conduits that hydraulically connect deep strata with
   the overburden and seabed. Hence, if stored CO2 migrates to a
   sufficiently high permeability chimney the risk of CO2 leakage at the
   seabed increases. Despite the possible negative effects these structures
   may have on the integrity of CO2 storage sites, little is known about
   (i) their effective permeability distribution, controlled by the
   combined role of fractures and matrix, and (ii) feedback mechanisms
   between porosity-permeability, CO2 reactivity and mineralogy within
   them. Reactive transport modelling is used to perform 2D axisymmetric
   radial simulations of geological systems containing chimneys. CO2
   saturations of 10\%, 30\% and 50\% are imposed on a cell located next to
   the symmetry axis at the base of the model. Under hydrostatic
   conditions, CO2 reaches the seabed, at 500 m above the injection point,
   in less than 100 yr using injected CO2 saturations at or above 30\% and
   with overburden isotropic permeabilities and chimney vertical
   permeabilities above 10(-14) m(2). Vertical fractures with apertures
   larger than 0.05 mm for volume fractions below 1\% are sufficient to
   sustain such high vertical permeabilities in the chimney with a
   relatively high cap rock matrix permeability of 10(-16) m(2). Over 100
   yr of CO2 injection, changes in porosity and permeability due to mineral
   precipitation/dissolution are negligible. For this time scale, in
   systems containing chimneys sufficiently far away from the injection
   well, the risk of CO2 leakage at the seabed is primarily controlled by
   the pre-existing hydrogeological state of the system.},

Title = {Verification studies for a z-coordinate primitive-equation model: Tidal
   conversion at a mid-ocean ridge},
Journal = {OCEAN MODELLING},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {257-278},
Abstract = {We document the accuracy and convergence of solutions for a z-coordinate
   primitive-equation model of internal tide generation and propagation.
   The model, which is based on MOM3 numerics, is linearized around a state
   of rest to facilitate comparison with analytic estimates of baroclinic
   generation at finite-amplitude topography in a channel forced by
   barotropic tidal flow at its boundaries. Unlike the analytical model,
   the numerical model includes mixing of both buoyancy and momentum, and
   several definitions of ``baroclinic conversion{''} are possible. These
   are clarified by writing out the energetics of the linearized equations
   in terms of barotropic kinetic energy, baroclinic kinetic energy, and
   available potential energy. The tidal conversion computed from the
   model, defined as the rate of conversion of barotropic kinetic energy
   into available potential energy, agrees well with analytical
   predictions. A comparison of different treatments of bottom topography
   (full-cells, partial-cells, and ghost-cells) indicates that the
   partial-cell treatment is the most accurate in this application.
   Convergence studies of flow over a smooth supercritical ridge show that
   the dissipation along tidal characteristics is, apparently, an
   integrable singularity. When the ocean bottom is not smooth, the
   accuracy and convergence of the model depend on the power spectrum of
   the topography. A numerical experiment suggests that the power spectrum
   of the resolved topography must roll off faster than k(-2) to obtain
   convergent results from a linear numerical model of this type. (c) 2006

Title = {Using eDNA to determine the source of organic carbon in seagrass meadows},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1254-1265},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Seagrasses sequester globally significant amounts of carbon (C), which
   is stored mainly in the sediment. Both C fixation by the seagrass
   (autochthonous) and the trapping of organic matter that is derived from
   outside the ecosystem (allochthonous) contribute to seagrass sediment
   organic C (OC). However, due to limitations in current methods we do not
   yet fully understand which sources of C are most important to blue C
   ecosystems. We used environmental-DNA (eDNA) to identify and estimate
   the contribution of floral sources to seagrass sediment OC sampled from
   three sites in Moreton Bay, Australia that differ in potential levels of
   autochthonous and allochthonous OC inputs. Using the plant barcode gene
   rbcL and a next-generation sequencing platform we identified 150 plant
   operational taxonomic units in the sediment samples. We found that
   seagrass DNA composed on average 88\% of the eDNA pool in the sediment
   samples. Allochtonous sources were primarily mangrove, salt-marsh, and
   freshwater marsh species, but the proportional contribution of other
   sources varied among meadows. Carbon and nitrogen (N) stable isotope
   mixing models suggested a lower autochthonous contribution than the eDNA
   data, but had high ambiguity due to indistinguishable isotopic values
   among some of the sources. Our study shows that eDNA can be an effective
   tool for identifying sources to sediment OC in blue C ecosystems and can
   be used in conjunction with stable isotope analysis to reduce ambiguity.
   Identifying the sources of OC to the sediments of blue C ecosystems is
   crucial for building robust and accurate C budgets for these systems.},

Title = {Review on Polysaccharides Used in Coatings for Food Packaging Papers},
Journal = {COATINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Paper and board show many advantages as packaging materials, but the
   current technologies employed to obtain adequate barrier properties for
   food packaging use synthetic polymers coating and lamination with
   plastic or aluminium foils-treatments which have a negative impact on
   packaging sustainability, poor recyclability and lack of
   biodegradability. Recently, biopolymers have attracted increased
   attention as paper coatings, which can provide new combinations in
   composite formulas to meet the requirements of food packaging. The
   number of studies on biopolymers for developing barrier properties of
   packaging materials is increasing, but only a few of them are addressed
   to food packaging paper. Polysaccharides are viewed as the main
   candidates to substitute oil-based polymers in food paper coating, due
   to their film forming ability, good affinity for paper substrate,
   appropriate barrier to gases and aroma, and positive effect on
   mechanical strength. Additionally, these biopolymers are biodegradable,
   non-toxic and act as a matrix for incorporation additives with specific
   functionalities for coated paper (i.e., active-antimicrobial
   properties). This paper presents an overview on the availability and
   application of polysaccharides from vegetal and marine biomass in
   coatings for foods packaging paper. The extraction methods, chemical
   modification and combination routes of these biopolymers in coatings for
   paper packaging are discussed.},

Title = {Preparation, Properties and Potential of Carrageenan-Based Hard Capsules
   for Replacing Gelatine: A Review},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Intense efforts to develop alternative materials for gelatine as a
   drug-delivery system are progressing at a high rate. Some of the
   materials developed are hard capsules made from alginate, carrageenan,
   hypromellose and cellulose. However, there are still some disadvantages
   that must be minimised or eliminated for future use in drug-delivery
   systems. This review attempts to review the preparation and potential of
   seaweed-based, specifically carrageenan, hard capsules, summarise their
   properties and highlight their potential as an optional main component
   of hard capsules in a drug-delivery system. The characterisation methods
   reviewed were dimensional analysis, water and ash content, microbial
   activity, viscosity analysis, mechanical analysis, scanning electron
   microscopy, swelling degree analysis, gel permeation chromatography,
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The
   release kinetics of the capsule is highlighted as well. This review is
   expected to provide insights for new researchers developing innovative
   products from carrageenan-based hard capsules, which will support the
   development goals of the industry.},

Title = {GEOGRAPHICAL, SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS OF AIR-SEA CO2

Abstract = {The fugacity, of CO2 (fCO(2)) in the surface seawater of the northeast
   (15 degrees N-45 degrees N) and southwest (25 degrees S-15 degrees S)
   subtropical Pacific Ocean from November 1983 to February 1988 were
   observed on Is cruises on the M/V Lillooet. The northeast Pacific within
   15 degrees N-45 degrees N was a net CO2 sink with a mean annual Delta
   fCO(2) of about -5 mu atm, as the average of -19 mu atm in the boreal
   winter and spring and 8 mu atm in the boreal summer and autumn. Our
   cruises also obtained the first set of austral winter and spring fCO(2)
   data for the southwest subtropical Pacific and thus provided a complete
   seasonal cycle of surface fCO(2) for this oceanic region. The southwest
   Pacific within 25 degrees S-15 degrees S, with a mean annual Delta
   fCO(2) of about -20 mu atm, was a CO2 sink year round except during the
   austral summer of the El Nino whence Delta fCO(2) had positive values.
   The observed sea-surface fCO(2) showed large variability. Between the
   summer and the winter months, the seasonal amplitudes of fCO(2)
   (normalized to the climatological annual mean SST) ranged from 1 mu atm
   to 63 mu atm. The surface waters of the subtropical and the northeast
   Pacific also displayed annual trends in the normalized fCO(2) values.
   From January 1984 to January 1987, there were decreases in the seasonal
   means of normalized fCO(2) of 4-11 mu atm yr(-1) within 25 degrees C-15
   degrees S, 15 degrees N-25 degrees N, and 25 degrees N-35 degrees N.
   These trends were within the uncertainty of the data and were not
   significant statistically. However, from summer 1985 to summer 1987, the
   normalized fCO(2), showed significant positive increase of 24 mu atm
   yr(-1) within 35 degrees N-45 degrees N. There was also an increase,
   though not significant statistically, of 13 mu atm yr(-1) within 25
   degrees N-35 degrees N. The cause of the slightly larger increase in
   fCO(2), in northern subtropical gyre could be the anomalous intrusions
   of the Oyashio Current during the period 1984-1986 along the North
   Pacific Current, which was the source of the California Current
   bifurcating into the waters of 25 degrees N-35 degrees N and 35 degrees
   N-45 degrees N. These intrusions in late spring usually followed an
   intensified and eastward shift of the Aleutian Low which was especially
   persistent during 1977-1988.},

Title = {Inhalation and dermal exposure of workers during timber impregnation
   with creosote and subsequent processing of impregnated wood},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {181},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: Coal tar creosote oils are used as highly effective wood
   protectants for, e.g., railway sleepers, utility poles and marine
   pilings. For impregnation of wood, the hot creosote oil is mostly
   applied in vacuum processes and by hot-and-cold dipping. From the
   perspective of an occupational hygienist, creosote tar oils are
   problematic because they have a number of hazardous properties,
   including carcinogenicity. We have studied inhalation and dermal
   exposure in six and four impregnation plants, respectively, in Germany.
   Some plants were visited repeatedly, for up to five measurement
   campaigns conducted over several years. Inhalation and dermal exposure
   resulting from vacuum impregnation and from hot-and-cold dipping, as
   well as secondary exposure resulting from assembly of impregnated
   railway sleepers have been measured. Accompanying, human biomonitoring
   of the employees has been performed.
   Methods: Inhalation exposure was measured using personal air samplers,
   collecting particles and vapours simultaneously. Dermal exposure was
   investigated by whole body dosimetry using disposable chemical
   protective coveralls and split leather gloves. 18 polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been determined separately by high performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS), respectively. For human biomonitoring 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP)
   in urine related to creatinine has been measured using HPLC. Both, pre-
   and post-shift values have been determined for this metabolite.
   Results: Dermal exposure towards pyrene and the sum of the determined 18
   PAHs as well as inhalation exposure to naphthalene, pyrene and the sum
   of the determined 18 PAHs are presented in this paper.
   The plants performing vacuum impregnation have employed different
   constructive, technical and organisational measures, and some measures
   have also changed between the different measurement campaigns. We have
   found that cooling the vacuum impregnation vessel before unloading can
   reduce inhalation exposure to about one-third. However, our data shows
   that installation of structural or technical risk management measures
   (RMM) did not always reduce the exposure as intended, and can even lead
   to increased exposure in adverse constellations. Dermal exposure was
   strongly affected by differences in the working procedures. Measurements
   performed during assembly of impregnated railway sleepers indicate that
   secondary exposure leads to lower inhalation, but similar dermal
   exposure compared to the impregnation processes. Also 1-0HP excretion
   rates are similar after impregnation process and after assembly of
   impregnated railway sleepers.
   Conclusion: Our recent data underlines that efficient reduction of the
   exposure resulting from impregnation with creosote requires
   sophisticated risk reduction strategies. Structural measures such as the
   enclosure of the loading area and technical measures like local exhaust
   ventilation shall be coordinated carefully with organisational measures
   and provision of personal protective equipment.
   The data presented here represents a broad bandwidth of current
   workplace situations in the creosote oil processing industry and is
   therefore suitable for risk assessment in related plants as well as
   under regulatory frameworks like the European Biocides Regulation.
   Each plant in this investigation was unique. Together they represent the
   whole width of this branch in Germany. Additionally, the number of
   plants and exposed workers is limited and relative low. Therefore, a
   comprehensive consideration and statistical analysis were not feasible.},

Abstract = {Widespread penetration of distributed generators (DGs) into the power
   system has aggravated the problem of temporary overvoltages (TOVs),
   which can inflict substantial damages on the DGs, equipment, and other
   customers. Through slight modifications to the power-electronic circuit
   and its control, this paper proposes a strategy for limiting the TOVs
   caused by single-stage grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) energy systems.
   This paper also proposes a reduced TOV mitigation strategy for
   applications where a somewhat less effective, but also less expensive,
   solution is acceptable. The effectiveness of the proposed TOV mitigation
   strategy is demonstrated through time-domain simulation studies
   conducted on a detailed switched model of a study PV system in the
   PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.},

Abstract = {The accurate estimation of extreme conditions, such as 100-yr return
   levels of significant wave height is an important aspect in the design
   of marine energy converters, offshore and coastal structures. This study
   investigates the different approaches for the estimation of extreme
   waves that have been applied in the past, and determines the 100-yr
   return levels using the high resolution ERA-Interim dataset produced by
   the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is
   demonstrated in the paper that fitting a Generalized Pareto Distribution
   to all exceedances over a high threshold is the most suitable approach.
   The estimates thus obtained are compared with previously computed
   estimates for buoys and offshore platforms. The effect of duration of
   data on the estimates is also investigated. Finally, a 100-yr return
   level map for the North Atlantic region is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Reliable ship detection plays an important role in both military and
   civil fields. However, it makes the task difficult with high-resolution
   remote sensing images with complex background and various types of ships
   with different poses, shapes and scales. Related works mostly used gray
   and shape features to detect ships, which obtain results with poor
   robustness and efficiency. To detect ships more automatically and
   robustly, we propose a novel ship detection method based on the
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called S-CNN, fed with
   specifically designed proposals extracted from the ship model combined
   with an improved saliency detection method. Firstly we creatively
   propose two ship models, the ``V{''} ship head model and the ``parallel
   to{''} ship body one, to localize the ship proposals from the line
   segments extracted from a test image. Next, for offshore ships with
   relatively small sizes, which cannot be efficiently picked out by the
   ship models due to the lack of reliable line segments, we propose an
   improved saliency detection method to find these proposals. Therefore,
   these two kinds of ship proposals are fed to the trained CNN for robust
   and efficient detection. Experimental results on a large amount of
   representative remote sensing images with different kinds of ships with
   varied poses, shapes and scales demonstrate the efficiency and
   robustness of our proposed S-CNN-Based ship detector.},

Abstract = {The biological sources and distribution of the aliphatic amines,
   monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA) and trimethylamine (TMA),
   were studied in the anoxic marine sediments of Flax Pond salt marsh,
   Long Island, New York. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that Spartina
   alterniflora releases amines, especially TMA, to salt marsh sediment
   during decomposition. Benthic animals and phytoplankton also contained
   high amine concentrations and could be sources of amines to salt marsh
   sediments either by direct release or during decomposition.
   MMA, DMA and TMA were present in FP sediment porewaters and solid phases
   throughout the year. Concentrations generally ranged from 10 nM to 1 mu
   M in porewaters and 1-100 nmol/g dry wt in the solid phase. DMA
   dominated the porewater profiles, TMA the exchangeable pool, and MMA the
   fixed pool of amines. Concentrations varied seasonally with highest
   concentrations found in the fall when S. alterniflora began to senesce.
   The C/N ratio of organic matter undergoing decomposition in the sediment
   was calculated to be 11-12 from the annual sulfate reduction and
   ammonium and Sigma CO2 production rates. This C/N ratio is higher than
   the Redfield ratio, again suggesting that S. alterniflora is a major
   organic matter source to the sediment.},

Abstract = {Planktic diatoms are the largest primary producers in marine and
   freshwater habitats. Their dry biomass accumulates up to 50\% of lipids
   and contains water-soluble beta-1,3-glucans as major storage products.
   Because of the world-wide abundance of these photosynthetic protists,
   beta-1,3-glucans may rival cellulose as the polysaccharide with the
   highest annual production on Earth. Here we show the feasibility of a
   simple and efficient process leading to bio-hydrogen by dark
   fermentation of microalgal biomass with the thermophilic bacterium
   Thermotoga neapolitana. Production of the biogas on minimum medium
   supplemented only with the extract of the diatom Thalassiosira
   weissflogii proved that algal biomass per se can serve as substrate for
   sustaining the biotechnological process with no requirement of any
   pretreatment and external integration of other nutrients. At the same
   time, lipids unused for the anaerobic production of the biogas, can be
   employed for production of bio-diesel, thus considerably increasing the
   economic potential of these renewable feedstocks. Copyright (C) 2012,

Abstract = {This research compared different sizing methods to improve the current
   autonomous hybrid system in the Galapagos Islands in 2031, analyzing the
   loss of power supply probability (LPSP). Firstly, the energy that will
   be consumed in islands in 2031 was obtained using artificial neural
   networks (ANN) with Matlab according to fundamental parameters in the
   design of a multilayer perceptron neural network model. Secondly,
   methods used for sizing the system were HOMER Pro and Simulink Design
   Optimization (SDO). The dynamic models of the different components of
   the hybrid system were created in MATLAB/Simulink. The proposed hybrid
   system was composed of photovoltaic (PV) and wind (WT), and lead-acid
   batteries, hydraulic pumping, and a diesel generator as the storage and
   support systems. Then, to design a sustainable system, a hybrid system
   was dimensioned with renewable energy sources of an appropriate size.
   The LPSP values obtained were below 0.09\% and 0.22\%, which showed that
   the system was optimally dimensioned. In addition, a cost analysis was
   carried out, and values obtained from NPC and COE according to HOMER Pro
   were \$183 810 067 and 0.26\$ per kW h, and \$233 385 656 and 0.25\$ per
   kW h and using SDO \$148 523 110 and 0.25\$ per kW h, \$189 576 556 and
   0.24\$ per kW h for strategies I and II, respectively, of the proposed
   hybrid system. The data obtained showed that the Latin hypercube
   algorithm of SDO achieved better optimization compared to HOMER Pro.},

Title = {Can heterotrophic uptake of dissolved organic carbon and zooplankton
   mitigate carbon budget deficits in annually bleached corals?},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {495-506},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Annual coral bleaching events due to increasing sea surface temperatures
   are predicted to occur globally by the mid-century and as early as 2025
   in the Caribbean, and severely impact coral reefs. We hypothesize that
   heterotrophic carbon (C) in the form of zooplankton and dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) is a significant source of C to bleached corals.
   Thus, the ability to utilize multiple pools of fixed carbon and/or
   increase the amount of fixed carbon acquired from one or more pools of
   fixed carbon (defined here as heterotrophic plasticity) could underlie
   coral acclimatization and persistence under future ocean-warming
   scenarios. Here, three species of Caribbean coral-Porites divaricata, P.
   astreoides, and Orbicella faveolata-were experimentally bleached for 2.5
   weeks in two successive years and allowed to recover in the field.
   Zooplankton feeding was assessed after single and repeat bleaching,
   while DOC fluxes and the contribution of DOC to the total C budget were
   determined after single bleaching, 11 months on the reef, and repeat
   bleaching. Zooplankton was a large C source for P. astreoides, but only
   following single bleaching. DOC was a source of C for single-bleached
   corals and accounted for 11-36 \% of daily metabolic demand (CHAR(DOC)),
   but represented a net loss of C in repeat-bleached corals. In
   repeat-bleached corals, DOC loss exacerbated the negative C budgets in
   all three species. Thus, the capacity for heterotrophic plasticity in
   corals is compromised under annual bleaching, and heterotrophic uptake
   of DOC and zooplankton does not mitigate C budget deficits in annually
   bleached corals. Overall, these findings suggest that some Caribbean
   corals may be more susceptible to repeat bleaching than to single
   bleaching due to a lack of heterotrophic plasticity, and coral
   persistence under increasing bleaching frequency may ultimately depend
   on other factors such as energy reserves and symbiont shuffling.},

Title = {Solar hydrogen production from seawater vapor electrolysis},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1725-1733},
Abstract = {Solar photovoltaic utilities require large land areas to produce power
   equivalent to a conventional fossil fuel utility, and also must be
   coupled to cost-effective energy storage to overcome the intermittency
   of sunlight and provide reliable, continuous energy generation. To
   target both of these disadvantages, a method was demonstrated to produce
   hydrogen fuel from solar energy by splitting seawater vapor from ambient
   humidity at near-surface ocean conditions. Using a proton exchange
   membrane electrolyzer with seawater-humidified air at 80\% relative
   humidity at the anode and dry N-2 at the cathode, sufficient
   electrolysis current density was maintained to operate near the maximum
   energy-conversion point when driven by a triple-junction amorphous Si
   solar cell of equivalent area. Fluctuations in atmospheric water content
   were demonstrated to have minimal effect on the solar-to-hydrogen
   efficiency, remaining similar to 6\% with relative humidity >= 30\%.
   Direct solar-driven H-2 production from seawater vapor was maintained at
   >4.5 mA cm(-2) for >90 hours. The calculated solar-to-hydrogen
   conversion efficiency before and after 50 h of operation changed from
   6.0\% to 6.3\% using an ambient seawater humidity feedstock as compared
   to a drop from 6.6\% to 0.5\% using liquid seawater feedstock.},

Title = {Three-dimensional modeling of coastal boulders using multi-view image

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Coarse clastic sediments (boulders) on coastlines have seen a
   groundswell in geomorphic research interest over recent years,
   associated in part with the potential of boulder evidence for
   interpreting characteristics of high-energy wave processes. Yet, the
   fundamental property of boulder volume is normally difficult to measure
   accurately owing to complex clast morphology and irregular surface
   texture. To tackle this problem, this paper concentrates on creating
   precise, measurable and textured three-dimensional (3D) models of
   coastal boulders without physical contact with the object, based on
   multi-view image measurement techniques. This method has several
   advantages over traditional measurements that are inaccurate or
   alternative solutions using costly techniques such as terrestrial laser
   scanning. Our methods propose the use of low-cost equipment (digital
   cameras) that can be used in various coastal environments to easily
   acquire numerous images of the object of interest. Initial results can
   be rapidly assessed in the field for immediate quality control.
   Resulting 3D models, built from overlapping multi-view digital
   photographs, allow the reconstruction of realistic-looking and textured
   boulder surfaces. A particular interest in this task is the family of
   algorithms known as structure from motion (SFM). The work presents
   analysis of SFM techniques by examining 3D models of boulders observed
   at a coastal field site on Lu Dao Island in south-eastern Taiwan.

Abstract = {Sedimentation of particulate carbon from the upper 200-300 m in the
   central Greenland Sea from August 1993 to June 1995 was less than 2 g C
   m(-2) yr(-1). Daily rates of sedimentation of particulate organic carbon
   reached highest values of about 18 mg m(-2) d(-1) in fall 1994, For
   total particulate material, maximum rates of sedimentation of about 250
   mg m(-2) d(-1) were recorded in spring and fall 1994. For chlorophyll
   equivalent, highest rates of sedimentation of about 140 mu g m(-2) d(-1)
   were recorded in spring 1994. As reported in related investigations, the
   transient accumulation of DOC in surface waters during summer, as well
   as respiration and mortality of deep overwintering zooplankton stocks,
   appeared to dominate the fate of photosynthetically fixed organic
   carbon. The above processes may account for roughly 43 g C m(-2) in the
   upper 200 m of the central Greenland Sea. For comparison, the seasonal
   deficit in dissolved inorganic carbon was reported to be about 23 g C
   m(-2) in the upper 20 m of surface water, and estimates for new annual
   production were reported to be about 57 g C m(-2). In our investigation,
   the biological carbon pump was not unusually effective in transporting
   carbon out of the productive surface layer. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Acoustic-gravity waves (hereafter AGWs) in ocean have received much
   attention recently, mainly with respect to early detection of tsunamis
   as they travel at near the speed of sound in water which makes them
   ideal candidates for early detection of tsunamis. While the generation
   mechanisms of AGWs have been studied from the perspective of vertical
   oscillations of seafloor and triad wave-wave interaction, in the current
   study, we are interested in their generation by wave-structure
   interaction with possible implication to the energy sector. Here, we
   develop two wavemaker theories to analyse different wave modes generated
   by impermeable (the classic Havelock's theory) and porous (porous
   wavemaker theory) plates in weakly compressible fluids. Slight
   modification has been made to the porous theory so that, unlike the
   previous theory, the new solution depends on the geometry of the plate.
   The expressions for three different types of plates (piston, flap, and
   delta-function) are introduced. Analytical solutions are also derived
   for the potential amplitudes of the gravity, acoustic-gravity,
   evanescent waves, as well as the surface elevation, velocity
   distribution, and pressure for AGWs. Both theories reduce to previous
   results for incompressible flow when the compressibility is neglected.
   We also show numerical examples for AGWs generated in a wave flume as
   well as in deep ocean. Our current study sets the theoretical background
   towards remote sensing by AGWs, for optimised deep ocean wave-power
   harnessing, among others.},

Abstract = {In order to intensify cattle utilization, embankments were constructed
   to avoid tidal ingressions in Samborombon Bay, Argentina, The objective
   of this study was to evaluate the effect of tidal suppression and
   cutting-frequency of a-salt marsh dominated-by Spartina densiflora
   Brongn. Two paddocks of-a commercial cow-calf operation farm, one
   prevented from tidal flooding and another exposed to overflow from
   natural tidal pattern (control), were the main plots of the nested
   design. The experiments were carried out during a dry (2008-2009) and a
   wet growing season (2012-2013). Two defoliation frequencies, simulating
   light and moderate grazing pressure, were performed in the subplots
   nested within each main plot. Soil organic matter and N content were
   lower and soil structural instability index was much higher in the
   embankment than in the control treatment. Soil salinity during the dry
   growing season was higher in the embankment than in the control
   treatment. Bare soil was higher under embankment treatment and high
   defoliation frequency exacerbated this response. Relative contribution
   of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment
   and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season.
   Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was
   almost 70\% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced
   ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation
   frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet
   season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by
   treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high
   frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was
   not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora
   saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively
   alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high
   importance for biodiversity conservation. (C) 2015 Society for Range

Title = {Complex Network Analysis of Transmission Mechanism for Sustainable
   Incentive Policies},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Existing research mainly focuses on the external impact of incentive
   policies of industrialized/manufactured construction (IMC). However, it
   is still unclear how the transmission mechanism among cities and regions
   of IMC incentive policies works in the process of formulation. To fill
   the knowledge gap, this study establishes a relationship matrix to
   propose the transmission-weighted complex network (TWCN). Degree
   distribution and clustering coefficient are used to calculate the
   transmission path and the transmission intensity of TWCN. The validation
   is based on data collected from 415 policy documents (2010-2018) and
   2923 items from 181 nodes of the TWCN for IMC policies. The findings
   show that transmission path of IMC incentive policies is from the
   eastern coast of China to the central, western and northern regions.
   Fiscal and taxation incentives have the greatest intensity of spatial
   agglomeration in the transmission process. The results of the TWCN are
   consistent and conform to the scientific and rational expectations of
   research. Overall, the research outcomes are applicable to studies on
   sustainability policies in different fields, including sustainable
   construction, renewable energy, etc. Policy makers can implement the
   TWCN to recognize the performance and functions of different incentives
   and propose effective strategies to achieve sustainability.},

Title = {Reexposure and advection of C-14-depleted organic carbon from old
   deposits at the upper continental slope},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {24},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Outcrops of old strata at the shelf edge resulting from erosive
   gravity-driven flows have been globally described on continental
   margins. The reexposure of old strata allows for the reintroduction of
   aged organic carbon (OC), sequestered in marine sediments for thousands
   of years, into the modern carbon cycle. This pool of reworked material
   represents an additional source of C-14-depleted organic carbon supplied
   to the ocean, in parallel with the weathering of fossil organic carbon
   delivered by rivers from land. To understand the dynamics and
   implications of this reexposure at the shelf edge, a biogeochemical
   study was carried out in the Gulf of Lions (Mediterranean Sea) where
   erosive processes, driven by shelf dense water cascading, are currently
   shaping the seafloor at the canyon heads. Mooring lines equipped with
   sediment traps and current meters were deployed during the cascading
   season in the southwestern canyon heads, whereas sediment cores were
   collected along the sediment dispersal system from the prodelta regions
   down to the canyon heads. Evidence from grain-size, X-radiographs and
   Pb-210 activity indicate the presence in the upper slope of a
   shelly-coarse surface stratum overlying a consolidated deposit. This
   erosive discontinuity was interpreted as being a result of dense water
   cascading that is able to generate sufficient shear stress at the canyon
   heads to mobilize the coarse surface layer, eroding the basal strata. As
   a result, a pool of aged organic carbon (Delta C-14 = -944.5 +/- 24.7\%;
   mean age 23,650 +/- 3,321 ybp) outcrops at the modern seafloor and is
   reexposed to the contemporary carbon cycle. This basal deposit was found
   to have relatively high terrigenous organic carbon (lignin = 1.48 +/-
   0.14 mg/100 mg OC), suggesting that this material was deposited during
   the last low sea-level stand. A few sediment trap samples showed
   anomalously depleted radiocarbon concentrations (Delta C-14 = -704.4 +/-
   62.5\%) relative to inner shelf (Delta C-14 = -293.4 +/- 134.0\%),
   mid-shelf (Delta C-14 = -366.6 +/- 51.1\%), and outer shelf (Delta C-14
   = -384 +/- 47.8\%) surface sediments. Therefore, although the major
   source of particulate material during the cascading season is
   resuspended shelf deposits, there is evidence that this aged pool of
   organic carbon can be eroded and laterally advected downslope.},

   secondary sources that contain water, wastewater, and slime/solid wastes
   originating from Turkey. Secondary sources were classified into five
   different categories as mining wastes (M), combustion residuals (C),
   sediments and sludges (S), e waste (E), and wastewater (WW). After
   pre-processing and acidic digestion of solid samples, elemental
   concentrations of wastewaters and acidic leachates were measured. The
   highest total REE (REEtotal) concentration was obtained in a combustion
   residue sample coded as C5 with 379 mg/kg. Besides, the highest critical
   REE (REEcritical) content was found in an e-waste sample including 346
   mg/kg total REE and 76\% critical REE. In addition, boron mine
   wastewater (W5) with a total REE concentration of 110 mu g/L was
   evaluated as a significant important secondary source in terms of
   yttrium. The association, between scandium and total REE concentrations
   of category M and S, was evaluated and correlation coefficients of 0.86
   and 0.69, respectively were calculated. E-waste and thermal power plant
   (TPP) ashes were evaluated as the secondary sources with the highest REE
   potential among the whole type of waste/wastewater. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Title = {Forms and profile distribution of soil Fe in the Sanjiang Plain of
   Northeast China as affected by land uses},

Abstract = {Since the mid-1950s, the wetlands in Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China
   have experienced greater changes in land use under which the mobility of
   soil Fe could be changed giving definite effects on the biomass
   production of adjacent regions. The aim of this work was to investigate
   the effects of land use change on the characteristics of soil Fe
   vertical distribution with a focus on evaluating the effects of
   cultivation on the soil Fe mobility in Sanjiang Plain.
   Twelve sites between two upper reaches of Amur River, i.e., Naoli River
   and Nongjiang River in the Sanjiang Plain, were selected as sampling
   sites, covering natural wetland, lowland rice field, and upland soybean
   field. Samples of different land use type soil were collected at the
   depths of 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-90, and 90-120 cm with their
   organic C, pH, total Fe (Fe-t), free Fe oxides (Fe-d), amorphous Fe
   oxides (Fe-o), Fe(II), and water-soluble Fe (Fe-w) determined.
   After the conversion of wetland into lowland rice field and upland
   soybean field, the organic carbon content in 0-10-cm soil layer
   decreased by 25.7\% (P < 0.05) and 48.0\% (P < 0.05), respectively, and
   the pH value at the soil depths below 40 cm in lowland rice field and
   upland soybean field was higher than that in natural wetland. Fe oxides
   concentration profiles suggested that a significant amount of Fe in
   wetland soil was moved downward to deeper layers while part of the Fe in
   farmland soils was deposited in subsurface layer where a good aeration
   occurred preventing its further leaching loss. Cultivation promoted the
   production of soil Fe-d and retarded the formation of Fe-o, Fe(II), and
   Fe-w with the sequence of soil Fe-o/Fe-d ratio, Fe(II), and Fe-w being
   wetland > lowland rice field > upland soybean field.
   The results supported the ideas that, in the Sanjiang Plain, the
   conversion of wetland into farmland, especially into upland, could
   change the soil Fe vertical distribution giving potential effects on the
   mobility of soil Fe. A quantitative study on the dissolved iron
   discharge from different land use type would be made to quantify the
   flux of dissolved iron from the Sanjiang Plain to the Amur River and the
   Sea of Okhotsk based on the high-resolution geographical distribution
   maps of land surfaces in the alluvial plain.},

Title = {Conventional vs. Innovative Protocols for the Extraction of
   Polysaccharides from Macroalgae},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Macroalgae are one of the most environmentally friendly resources, and
   their industrial by-products should also be sustainable. Algal
   polysaccharides represent valuable products, and the definition of new
   eco-sustainable extraction processes, ensuring a safe and high-quality
   product, is a new goal in the context of reducing the carbon footprint.
   The aim of the present work was to determine the influence of the
   extraction methodology on the properties and structure of the
   polysaccharides, comparing conventional and innovative
   microwave-assisted methods. We focused on extraction times, yield,
   chemical composition and, finally, biological activities of raw polymers
   from three macroalgal species of Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta and
   Phaeophyceae. The main objective was to design a sustainable process in
   terms of energy and time savings, with the aim of developing subsequent
   application at the industrial level. Extraction efficacy was likely
   dependent on the physico-chemical polysaccharide properties, while the
   use of the microwave did not affect their chemical structure. Obtained
   results indicate that the innovative method could be used as an
   alternative to the conventional one to achieve emulsifiers and bacterial
   antiadhesives for several applications. Natural populations of invasive
   algae were used rather than cultivated species in order to propose the
   valorization of unwanted biomasses, which are commonly treated as waste,
   converting them into a prized resource.},

Title = {Is colonization of sea ice by diatoms facilitated by increased surface
   roughness in growing ice crystals?},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {593-602},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Colonization by ice algae at the bottom of the sea ice is important
   ecologically as these algae are the major carbon source for zooplankton
   and the Polar food chains from early spring and until ice break-up
   several months later. At that time, ice algae can seed the water column
   promoting the pelagic production. We collected a time-series of ice
   growth, surface roughness, ice algae biomass (Chl-a), photosynthetic
   performance, primary production, irradiance, species composition, under
   ice ADCP data, nutrients, and ice algae spatial distribution in
   Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. A significant increase in biomass, primary
   production, and photosynthetic performance was observed at the bottom of
   the first-year sea ice. This colonization was not related to any change
   in light or nutrient availability, but instead occurred over a few days
   after which all parameters remained stable and constant. Colonization
   was concurrent with active ice growth associated with a period of very
   cold air temperatures as low as minus 35 A degrees C. This new ice
   growth featured ice crystals and dendrites that significantly increased
   the surface roughness of the bottom, which facilitated the colonization.
   The dendrites are about 0.5 mm high and with a similar distance between
   the crests. The species composition of ice algae was similar in the
   water below and at the ice bottom, though biomass remained significantly
   lower in the water, and was dominated by Fragilariopsis oceanica and
   Navicula vanhoeefi. It is concluded that the colonization of the bottom
   of the sea ice is solely related to the increase in surface roughness
   initiated in the growing ice.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen oxide (NOx) production by lightning in the tropics is estimated
   using tropospheric NOx amounts (LNOx{*}) over deep convective grid boxes
   derived from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
   slant columns and detection-efficiency-adjusted World Wide Lightning
   Location Network (WWLLN) flashes. The lightning NOx production
   efficiency (LNOx PE) in the tropics is determined for the austral and
   boreal summers of 2007 to 2011 by regressing regional mean daily values
   of LNOx{*} for individual seasons against daily flash totals during
   flash windows prior to the OMI overpass. LNOx PE is determined to be
   approximately two times larger over marine locations than over
   continental locations possibly because marine flashes are more
   energetic. Overall, the mean LNOx PE for the tropics is calculated to be
   170 +/- 100 mol per flash with values over the tropical Pacific (low
   flash rate region) being largest. The main contributors to uncertainties
   in PE are uncertainties in WWLLN flash detection efficiency, upper
   tropospheric NOx lifetime in the near field of convection, and air mass

Abstract = {The atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(CO2)) will almost
   certainly be double that of pre- industrial levels by 2100 and will be
   considerably higher than at any time during the past few million
   years(1). The oceans are a principal sink for anthropogenic CO2 where it
   is estimated to have caused a 30\% increase in the concentration of H+
   in ocean surface waters since the early 1900s and may lead to a drop in
   seawater pH of up to 0.5 units by 2100 ( refs 2, 3). Our understanding
   of how increased ocean acidity may affect marine ecosystems is at
   present very limited as almost all studies have been in vitro, short-
   term, rapid perturbation experiments on isolated elements of the
   ecosystem(4,5). Here we show the effects of acidification on benthic
   ecosystems at shallow coastal sites where volcanic CO2 vents lower the
   pH of the water column. Along gradients of normal pH ( 8.1 - 8.2) to
   lowered pH ( mean 7.8 - 7.9, minimum 7.4 - 7.5), typical rocky shore
   communities with abundant calcareous organisms shifted to communities
   lacking scleractinian corals with significant reductions in sea urchin
   and coralline algal abundance. To our knowledge, this is the first
   ecosystem- scale validation of predictions that these important groups
   of organisms are susceptible to elevated amounts of p(CO2). Sea- grass
   production was highest in an area at mean pH 7.6 ( 1,827 mu atm p(CO2))
   where coralline algal biomass was significantly reduced and gastropod
   shells were dissolving due to periods of carbonate sub- saturation. The
   species populating the vent sites comprise a suite of organisms that are
   resilient to naturally high concentrations of p(CO2) and indicate that
   ocean acidification may benefit highly invasive non- native algal
   species. Our results provide the first in situ insights into how shallow
   water marine communities might change when susceptible organisms are
   removed owing to ocean acidification.},

Abstract = {An efficient method for the determination of nanogram levels of heavy
   metals in honey is described. Honey samples obtained in the field from
   farms located along the coast of the province of Cap-Bon (North Tunisia)
   were analysed by hydride generation with an inductively coupled argon
   plasma polychromator after a previous treatment in a microwave acid
   bomb.
   An apparatus for the generation of volatile hydrides, interfaced with an
   inductively coupled argon plasma polychromator for simultaneous
   determination of As, Pb, Sb, Hg acid Sn, is used. The optimum conditions
   for generating and determining the compounds and the effect of different
   parameters are discussed. The parameters investigated include: the
   chemical nature, form and concentration of the reductant, acid
   concentration of the sample and the carrier gas flow rate. Detection
   limits range 0.05 ng/ml for Hg to 1.1 ng/ml for Sb and precision values
   at 10 ng/ml are less than 6\% of the relative standard deviation.
   Analytical protocols concerning analytical stages are exposed and

Abstract = {Tropical marine Islands are home to rich and highly endemic biodiversity
   because of their geographical seclusion. The geographical isolation
   supports the biodiversity against anthropogenic activities despite being
   vulnerable to natural disasters. Marine Islands hosts invaluable marine
   resources such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves and its
   associated fisheries which play an important role in livelihood of the
   coastal communities through tourism and fishing. It is important to
   judiciously protect and manage these islands to conserve the rich
   terrestrial and marine biodiversity it hosts. Andaman and Nicobar
   Islands (ANI), India is a strategically located linear chain of 572
   tropical Islands located in Bay of Bengal in close proximity to South
   East Asian (SEA) countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. This
   proximity attracts poachers from SEA countries for harvesting living
   marine resources in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of ANI posing
   significant threat to marine biodiversity and coastal security. Prudent
   approaches are required to address the issue of poaching by involving
   various stakeholders and a science-policy interface at regional level.
   Implementation of efficient and reliable monitoring-reporting systems
   could be worthy to address the issue of poaching. Mobile apps help
   lines, fishermen groups, aerial vehicles, Monitoring, Control and
   Surveillance (MCS) system and other satellite based tools can
   effectively deter poaching and illegal fishing. The importance of
   community participation and the ways through which the modern tools and
   community participation could compliment in curbing the incidences of
   poaching were discussed. Necessary precautionary approaches are
   essential at this point in ANI as it was understood through the review
   that poachers have gone down in recent years and this period could be
   effectively utilized towards planning and efficient management of such
   incidences in future. The status of poaching and its associated
   activities over these years and the possibilities on implementation of
   suitable monitoring and reporting systems in collaboration with
   stakeholders were discussed.},

Title = {Tide Gauge Records Show That the 18.61-Year Nodal Tidal Cycle Can Change
   High Water Levels by up to 30cm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The lunar nodal cycle, produced by the varying declination of the Moon
   over a period of 18.61years, drives changes in tidal amplitude globally.
   However, constraining the range of changes in tidal amplitude that can
   be expected over a nodal cycle from real observations is rarely
   considered for coastal hazard planning. In this study, we use hourly
   tide gauge observations with record lengths >19years from 574 stations
   distributed worldwide to examine the contribution of the nodal
   modulation to monthly high water levels. Our results show that the
   influence of the lunar nodal cycle on high water levels is largest at
   tide gauge stations located in the Gulf of Tonkin, English Channel, and
   Bristol Channel, amounting up to 30cm in range, suggesting that in the
   coming decades the impact of the nodal cycle on high water levels in
   those regions could be greater than that of global mean sea level rise,
   which is up to 17cm by 2030, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change fifth assessment report projections. We also examine the
   phase of nodal modulation and show that the estimated phases exhibit two
   clusters: one cluster (111 degrees +/- 10 degrees) corresponds with the
   locations having a diurnal form of tides, whereas the other cluster (-59
   degrees +/- 11 degrees) corresponds with the locations exhibiting a
   semidiurnal form of tides. Nodal modulation in the diurnal and
   semidiurnal locations will peak again in 2025 and 2034, respectively,
   resulting in enhanced potential for coastal hazard in the respective
   regions.
   Plain Language Summary Nodal modulation is slow variation of the
   amplitude of diurnal or semidiurnal ocean tides associated with relative
   motions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun over a period of 18.61 years. It is
   an important contributor to extreme sea levels and can increase the risk
   of coastal flooding at specific, forecastable times. We use hourly tide
   gauge observations from 574 stations distributed worldwide to estimate
   and map the contribution of the 18.61- year lunar nodal modulation to
   monthly high water levels. We find that nodal modulation has the largest
   influence on the monthly highest water levels at locations in the Gulf
   of Tonkin, in the Bristol Channel, and in the English Channel, amounting
   up to 30 cm in range, and the nodal modulation in the diurnal and
   semidiurnal locations will peak again in 2025 and 2034, respectively,
   with the potential for high levels of coastal hazard in the respective
   regions.},

Title = {Effects of Harmful Algal Blooms on Fish and Shellfish Species: A Case
   Study of New Zealand in a Changing Environment},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have wide-ranging environmental impacts,
   including on aquatic species of social and commercial importance. In New
   Zealand (NZ), strategic growth of the aquaculture industry could be
   adversely affected by the occurrence of HABs. This review examines HAB
   species which are known to bloom both globally and in NZ and their
   effects on commercially important shellfish and fish species. Blooms of
   Karenia spp. have frequently been associated with mortalities of both
   fish and shellfish in NZ and the sub-lethal effects of other genera,
   notably Alexandrium spp., on shellfish (which includes paralysis, a lack
   of byssus production, and reduced growth) are also of concern. Climate
   change and anthropogenic impacts may alter HAB population structure and
   dynamics, as well as the physiological responses of fish and shellfish,
   potentially further compromising aquatic species. Those HAB species
   which have been detected in NZ and have the potential to bloom and harm
   marine life in the future are also discussed. The use of environmental
   DNA (eDNA) and relevant bioassays are practical tools which enable early
   detection of novel, problem HAB species and rapid toxin/HAB screening,
   and new data from HAB monitoring of aquaculture production sites using
   eDNA are presented. As aquaculture grows to supply a sizable proportion
   of the world's protein, the effects of HABs in reducing productivity is
   of increasing significance. Research into the multiple stressor effects
   of climate change and HABs on cultured species and using local, recent,
   HAB strains is needed to accurately assess effects and inform stock
   management strategies.},

Abstract = {Long-term monitoring of marine ecosystems is critical to assessing how
   global processes such as natural environmental variation and climate
   change affect marine populations. Ichthyoplankton surveys provide one
   approach to such monitoring. We conducted weekly fish egg collections
   off the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Pier (La Jolla, CA,
   USA) for 3 yr (2014 to 2017) and added a second sampling site near the
   La Jolla kelp forest for 1 yr (2017). Fish eggs were identified using
   DNA barcoding and data were compared to previous work from SIO Pier
   surveys from 2012 to 2014. We documented large interannual variability
   in fish egg abundance associated with climatic fluctuations, including
   an El Nino event captured during our sampling years. Overall egg
   abundance was reduced by >50\% during periods of anomalously warm water
   in 2014 to 2016. Fish egg abundance rebounded in 2017 and was
   accompanied by a phenological shift of peak spawning activity. We found
   that interannual fish egg abundance may be linked with upwelling regimes
   and winter temperatures. Across the period of joint sampling, we found
   no distinct differences in community composition between the SIO Pier
   (soft bottom) and kelp forest habitat we sampled (2 km distant).
   Long-term monitoring of fish spawning can contribute to our
   understanding of how natural environmental variation, such as El Nino
   events, affects fish reproductive activity. This understanding may
   extend to trends in marine resource availability associated with climate
   and aid in evaluating the efficacy of existing management efforts.},

Abstract = {Sea ice algal communities are naturally exposed to very high
   concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which are likely to lead to
   increasing stress levels and declines in productivity. To test this
   hypothesis, cultures of Fragilariopsis cylindrus (Grun?) Hasle,
   Pseudo-nitzschia sp., Fragilariopsis curta (Van Heurch), Porosira
   glacialis (Grunow), and Entomoneis kjellmannii (Cleve) from Antarctic
   sea ice and Nitzschia frigida from Arctic sea ice were exposed to
   elevated dissolved oxygen levels, and their growth, maximum quantum
   yield, relative maximum electron transport rate, and photosynthetic
   efficiency were measured. At oxygen concentrations equivalent to
   approximately four times air saturation (89\% oxygen), the growth rate
   and maximum quantum yield were significantly reduced in all taxa. When
   the oxygen concentration was regularly allowed to drop, the effect on

Title = {Sea-level rise exponentially increases coastal flood frequency},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise will radically redefine the coastline of the 21(st)
   century. For many coastal regions, projections of global sea-level rise
   by the year 2100 (e.g., 0.5-2 meters) are comparable in magnitude to
   today's extreme but short-lived increases in water level due to storms.
   Thus, the 21(st) century will see significant changes to coastal
   flooding regimes (where present-day, extreme-but-rare events become
   common), which poses a major risk to the safety and sustainability of
   coastal communities worldwide. So far, estimates of future coastal
   flooding frequency focus on endpoint scenarios, such as the increase in
   flooding by 2050 or 2100. Here, we investigate the continuous shift in
   coastal flooding regimes by quantifying continuous rates of increase in
   the occurrence of extreme water-level events due to sea-level rise. We
   find that the odds of exceeding critical water-level thresholds
   increases exponentially with sea-level rise, meaning that fixed amounts
   of sea-level rise of only similar to 1-10cm in areas with a narrow range
   of present-day extreme water levels can double the odds of flooding.
   Combining these growth rates with established sea-level rise
   projections, we find that the odds of extreme flooding double
   approximately every 5 years into the future. Further, we find that the
   present-day 50-year extreme water level (i.e., 2\% annual chance of
   exceedance, based on historical records) will be exceeded annually
   before 2050 for most (i.e., 70\%) of the coastal regions in the United
   States. Looking even farther into the future, the present-day 50-year
   extreme water level will be exceeded almost every day during peak tide
   (i.e., daily mean higher high water) before the end of the 21(st)
   century for 90\% of the U.S. coast. Our findings underscore the need for
   immediate planning and adaptation to mitigate the societal impacts of
   future flooding.},

Title = {Molecular Signatures of Biogeochemical Transformations in Dissolved
   Organic Matter from Ten World Rivers},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Rivers carry large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the
   oceans thereby connecting terrestrial and marine element cycles.
   Photo-degradation in conjunction with microbial turnover is considered a
   major pathway by which terrigenous DOM is decomposed. To reveal globally
   relevant patterns behind this process, we performed photo-degradation
   experiments and year-long bio-assays on DOM from ten of the largest
   world rivers that collectively account for more than one-third of the
   fresh water discharge to the global ocean. We furthermore tested the
   hypothesis that the terrigenous component in deep-sea DOM may be far
   higher than biomarker studies suggest, because of the selective
   photochemical destruction of characteristic biomolecules from vascular
   plants. DOM was molecularly characterized by a combination of
   non-targeted ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and quantitative
   molecular tracer analyses. We show that the reactivity of DOM is
   globally related to broad catchment properties. Basins that are
   dominated by forest and grassland export more photo-degradable DOM than
   other rivers. Chromophoric compounds are mainly vascular plant-derived
   polyphenols, and partially carry a pyrogenic signature from vegetation
   fires. These forest and grassland dominated rivers lost up to 50\% of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during irradiation, and up to 85\% of DOC
   was lost in total if subsequently bio-incubated for 1 year. Basins
   covered by cropland, on the other hand, export DOM with a higher
   proportion of photo-resistant and bio-available DOM which is enriched in
   nitrogen. In these rivers, 30\% or less of DOC was photodegraded.
   Consistent with previous studies, we found that riverine DOM resembled
   marine DOM in its broad molecular composition after extensive
   degradation, mainly due to almost complete removal of aromatics. More
   detailed molecular fingerprinting analysis (based on the relative
   abundance of >4000 DOM molecular formulas), however, revealed clear
   differences between degraded riverine and deep-sea DOM (molecular
   Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of similar to 50\%). None of our experimental
   treatments enhanced the molecular similarity between the rivers and the
   deep ocean. We conclude that terrigenous DOM retains a specific
   molecular signature during photo-degradation on much longer time scales
   than previously assumed and that substantial, thus far unknown,
   molecular transformations occur prior to downward convection into the
   deep oceanic basins.},

Title = {Development and application of a mesoscale climate model for the
   tropics: Influence of sea surface temperature anomalies on the West
   African monsoon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {107},

Abstract = {{[}1] A mesoscale climate model (MCM) is developed from the Pennsylvania
   State University/ National Center for Atmospheric Research mesoscale
   model 5 to simulate the West African summer monsoon. Results from the
   MCM are compared to observations, a reanalysis, and global climate model
   (GCM) output to show that the MCM reasonably simulates the West African
   monsoon climate and its variability and improves on many shortcomings of
   the GCM simulations. The MCM's ability to capture correctly processes
   that cause interannual variability, and thereby allow us to improve our
   physical understanding of that variability, is investigated by examining
   the influence of Gulf of Guinea sea surface temperature anomalies
   (SSTAs) on the West African monsoon. Similar to observations,
   precipitation decreases over the Sahel and increases along the Guinean
   coast in response to warm SSTAs in the gulf. The increase in rainfall
   along the Guinean coast is associated with an increase in lower
   tropospheric water vapor content due to enhanced evaporation over the
   warm SSTAs and northward moisture advection in the monsoon flow. This
   stronger precipitation on the coast occurs despite a decrease in the
   land/sea temperature gradient, which is the fundamental driver of the
   monsoon. The decrease in rainfall over the southern Sahel is associated
   with lower tropospheric subsidence replacing rising vertical motions as
   the monsoon circulation is shifted equatorward. Dynamically, the
   subsidence over the southern Sahel is associated with shrinking of both
   planetary and relative vorticity. The former is related to the
   equatorward shift of the monsoon, which results in an expansion of the
   equatorward flow from the Sahel to the northern Guinean coast. The
   latter occurs because the equatorward flow over the southern Sahel
   occurs lower in the troposphere (i.e., 850 mbar) than in the control
   (i.e., 700 mbar), where the meridional relative vorticity gradient is
   opposite to the gradient at 700 mbar.},

Abstract = {The growth in global aquaculture production may address the lack of
   sustainability in wild fisheries, alleviate poverty in rural and coastal
   areas, and help meet the worldwide increase in demand for animal
   protein. However, there is an ongoing debate about the severity of the
   environmental impact of aquaculture production. Investing in new
   high-tech production systems can address both productivity growth and
   the environmental externalities, but high investment costs hinder
   adoption of high-tech production methods. We investigate the potential
   of a payment for environmental services program easing access to capital
   for producers to increase willingness-to-invest in more sustainable
   aquaculture practices in Vietnam. We conducted two discrete choice
   experiments to explore the supply and demand side of the policy. First,
   we elicited the public's willingness-to-pay to reduce the environmental
   impact of conventional shrimp aquaculture, and second, we elicited
   farmers willingness-to-accept a credit subsidy to invest in high-tech
   production methods. Our results show that the public care about reduced
   environmental impacts, while farmers strongly prefer increased
   productivity. Furthermore, the public's willingness-to-pay for reduced
   environmental impacts exceeds producer's willingness-to-accept a subsidy
   to invest under most scenarios. This implies a potential for more
   sustainable aquaculture production in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {The Agronomic Revolution implies a gradual sophistication of
   organism-substrate interactions and progressive colonization of shelf
   environments by vagile endobenthos in the late Ediacaran and Cambrian
   periods. These changes are impressively mirrored in a palaeontological
   record of ichnoassemblages in marine siliciclastic facies. In contrast,
   endobenthic communities in carbonate successions remained comparatively
   poor until a fundamental transformation during the Great Ordovician
   Biodiversification Event. Herein we report complex open burrows
   (Thalassinoides and Olenichnus) from the Sukharikha Formation exposed
   near the Plakhinskii Island (Yenisei River, Igarka Uplift). Lithological
   and chemostratigraphical correlation with the stratotype suggest the
   Terreneuvian age of the fossil-bearing strata accumulated in
   storm-agitated mid- to distal inner-ramp settings. Each of the ichnotaxa
   occurs in a specific deposit in the studied section: Olenichnus is
   localised exclusively in the background-sedimentation deposits, whereas
   Thalassinoides occurs in the storm-event beds. Our data support early
   reports suggesting that colonization of marine carbonate sediments by
   burrowing metazoans was initiated already in the Terreneuvian and became
   a solid basis for the following development of deep-tier bioturbation in
   carbonates in the Ordovician Period.},

Abstract = {Cold seep carbonates are remarkable fossil records of hydrocarbon
   seepage and related conduits. In the present research, we analysed the
   carbon and oxygen isotopes, rare earth element (REE) and trace element

   (values as low as - 40.3 parts per thousand) observed in both carbonate
   concretions and chimneys indicate that anaerobic oxidation of biogenic
   methane played a major role in the formation of these carbonates.
   Slightly higher delta C-13 values mostly found in the outer layers of
   the carbonate chimneys reflect a contribution of inorganic carbon from
   seawater. REE patterns reveal the carbonates formed under mostly anoxic
   pore water conditions. Combined REE and trace element data reveal the
   growth of chimneys occurred from the outside-in, with the outer chimney
   walls experiencing rapid growth. Excellent correlations between
   Ce/Ce{*}, REE contents, and La-N/Sm-N and Y/Ho ratios observed in the
   chimney walls provide additional evidence for the influence of seawater
   in the formation of the chimneys. Meanwhile, O isotopic compositions of
   the samples suggest an O-18-depleted fluid was involved in carbonate
   precipitation. This study has major implications for tracking fluid
   sources of seep carbonates and patterns of carbonate chimney growth.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology that allows the numerical simulation
   of realistic sea waves, called WaveMIMO methodology, which is based on
   the imposition of transient discrete data as prescribed velocity on a
   finite volume computational model developed in Fluent software. These
   transient data are obtained by using the spectral wave model TOMAWAC,
   where the wave spectrum is converted into a series of free surface
   elevations treated and processed as wave propagation velocities in the
   horizontal (x) and vertical (z) directions. The processed discrete
   transient data of wave propagation velocity are imposed as boundary
   conditions of a wave channel in Fluent, allowing the numerical
   simulation of irregular waves with realistic characteristics. From a
   case study that reproduces the sea state occurring on March 31st, 2014,
   in Ingleses Beach, in the city of Florianopolis, state of Santa
   Catarina, Brazil, it was concluded that the WaveMIMO methodology can
   properly reproduce realistic conditions of a sea state. In sequence, the
   proposed methodology was employed to numerically simulate the incidence
   of irregular realistic waves over an oscillating water column (OWC) wave
   energy converter (WEC). From these results, the WaveMIMO methodology has
   proved to be a promising technique to numerically analyze the
   fluid-dynamic behavior of WECs subjected to irregular waves of realistic
   sea state on any coastal region where the device can be installed.},

Title = {Fine-scale harbour seal usage for informed marine spatial planning},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {High-resolution distribution maps can help inform conservation measures
   for protected species; including where any impacts of proposed
   commercial developments overlap the range of focal species. Around
   Orkney, northern Scotland, UK, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina)
   population has decreased by 78\% over 20 years. Concern for the
   declining harbour seal population has led to constraints being placed on
   tidal energy generation developments. For this study area, telemetry
   data from 54 animals tagged between 2003 and 2015 were used to produce
   density estimation maps. Predictive habitat models using GAM-GEEs
   provided robust predictions in areas where telemetry data were absent,
   and were combined with density estimation maps, and then scaled to
   population levels using August terrestrial counts between 2008 and 2015,
   to produce harbour seal usage maps with confidence intervals around
   Orkney and the North coast of Scotland. The selected habitat model
   showed that distance from haul out, proportion of sand in seabed
   sediment, and annual mean power were important predictors of space use.
   Fine-scale usage maps can be used in consenting and licensing of
   anthropogenic developments to determine local abundance. When
   quantifying commercial impacts through changes to species distributions,
   usage maps can be spatially explicitly linked to individual-based models
   to inform predicted movement and behaviour.},

Abstract = {A study has been undertaken with an aim to isolate potent endophytic
   fungi from mangrove plant Lumnitzera racemosa Linn. Among the 10
   different fungal strains isolated, one potent strain with broad-spectrum
   antagonistic activity was found. Basing on the morphological, cultural
   and molecular characteristics, the potent fungal strain was identified
   as Cladosporium cladosporioides. Production of bioactive metabolites by
   the strain was high in Malt Extract Broth compared to other media
   tested. The culture utilized Mannitol and Beef extract as good carbon
   and Nitrogen sources for the elaboration of bioactive metabolites. The
   optimum pH and Temperature for bioactive metabolite production of the
   strain were recorded at 4.0 and 30 degrees C. The secondary metabolites
   produced by the strain grown under optimal conditions exhibited high
   antagonistic activity against gram-positive as well as Gram-negative
   bacteria and fungi. This is the first report of Cladosporium

Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1887-1911},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The aquaculture sector has been the key factor in meeting the growing
   demand for high-quality food by contributing significantly to the global
   fish production. The portion of fishmeal in aqua feeds has been
   decreased significantly in recent years, however, increased production
   in aquaculture still led to demands of fishmeal that cannot be covered
   by sustainably caught small pelagic fish. Hence, alternatives for
   fishmeal in aqua feeds are an inevitable necessity. Different plant
   proteins have been evaluated in the past and rapeseed proteins are
   considered valuable protein sources for fishmeal-free aqua feeds.
   Rapeseed is highly available on a global scale and provides one of the
   most balanced amino acid composition among plant-based protein sources.
   Additionally, rapeseed cultivation is characterised by low production
   costs, ecological and economic benefits in cereal-dominated agriculture
   and provision of two highly nutritive products. Subsequently, rapeseed
   proteins have been intensely investigated over the past decades and
   knowledge of the application of these proteins in diets for different
   species of fish has improved dramatically. However, there is no adequate
   complete review for the application of rapeseed proteins in aqua feeds.
   This review outlines and discusses the relevant factors influencing the
   inclusion of rapeseed proteins as fishmeal alternatives in fish diets
   and highlights provisional thresholds for anti-nutritive substances as
   well as future research needs.},

   Basin: Implications for uplift history of the South African Plateau},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {1-10},

Abstract = {In this study, data from 41 wells were used to quantify the evolution of
   the sedimentary budget in the Southern Mozambique passive margin basin,
   with a high temporal resolution for the Cenozoic period. We found that
   the drainage areas, which supplied sediments to the Southern Mozambique
   Basin, were eroded in two episodes. The first, of Mid-Late Cretaceous in
   age, is concordant with both thermochronological datation and
   sedimentary fluxes estimated by other studies in the Namibian and South
   African and Northern Mozambique margins. This erosion episode ended when
   the African surface, as defined by Burke and Gunnel (2008), had become
   flat and low-lying over most of the South African Plateau by similar to
   65 Ma. Carbonate sediment deposition became more important in the
   shallow waters of the Mozambique basin after that time. The second
   erosion episode began at similar to 23 Ma and is likely due to an uplift
   event of the North-eastern part of the South African Plateau. It seems
   that the Limpopo catchment and the whole area sourcing the studied basin
   have inherited their present relief from two epeirogenic uplift pulses
   of Late Cretaceous and Miocene ages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {An investigation of how stationary Rossby wave (SRW) propagation can
   change in response to the A2 climate change scenario is made using six
   coupled ocean-atmosphere general-circulation models (OAGCM). The
   simulation results for the present-day climate (1960-1990) are compared
   with the NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF ERA-40 re-analyses. The zonal wind, the SRW
   kinetic energy (KE) pattern along the waveguide and the stationary
   wave-number are used to analyse the changes in the SRW propagation for
   the winter season of each hemisphere. The main result shows that in
   future climate (2069-2099) the SRW propagation for longer distances is
   unfavourable for the main waveguides in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and
   Southern Hemisphere (SH), which is confirmed through the SRW KE
   decrease. A poleward shift of the subtropical jet stream in future
   climate is also shown by five models in the SH and by three in the NH.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, the tide of
   information has also brought huge impact on the field of education. The
   computer-aided teaching method is infiltrating into the classroom of
   colleges and universities at an unpredictable speed, bringing about
   changes for modern higher education. This paper mainly studies the
   application of computer aided instruction in taekwondo teaching. This
   paper first introduces the concept of computer-aided instruction, and
   makes clear the influence and function of computer-aided instruction in
   higher education. Then the computer aided technology is used to score
   taekwondo movements to improve the learning effect of students. It can
   be seen from the difference between the experimental class and the
   control class that the computer-aided teaching technology can make the
   teaching method more free, the learning atmosphere more relaxed and
   interesting, effectively improve students' academic performance,
   stimulate students' learning enthusiasm.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenically induced climate warming will not stop as long as
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions continue to increase. As positive
   feedback from the cryosphere can amplify climate warming in higher
   latitudes, adaptation to and mitigation of climate change in the
   cryosphere have become particularly important. In this study, we
   quantified the contributions of climate policies of the developed and
   developing worlds to moderating decreases in Northern Hemisphere sea ice
   and snow, using the Earth System Model of Beijing Normal University
   (BNU-ESM). The results indicate that the sea ice extent and snow cover
   would continue to shrink as CO2 concentrations continue to increase, and
   the combined efforts of the developed and developing worlds could
   successfully reduce losses of Arctic sea ice and snow. In the medium
   term (before 2060), contributions of the developing world to reducing
   the loss of Arctic sea ice extent are expected to be 65\% in JFM and
   60\% in JAS, while the corresponding contributions to reducing snow
   cover loss are 46 and 70\%. These contributions from the developed world
   are smaller: 44\% in JFM and 22\% in JAS for sea ice extent and 34\% in
   JFM and 20\% in JAS for snow cover. Over the long term (until 2100), the
   developing world is expected to contribute 71\% in JFM and 77\% in JAS
   to reducing the Arctic sea ice losses, and its contribution to reducing
   snow cover loss is 73 and 66\%. Similarly, the corresponding
   contribution for the developed world is also smaller: 36\% in JFM and
   24\% in JAS for sea ice extent and 32\% in JFM and 30\% in JAS for snow
   cover. However, the developed and developing world achieves a combined
   mitigation effect of more than 90\% in the near and long term.},

Title = {Water quality suitability and water use indices: Useful management tools
   in coastal aquaculture of Litopenaeus vannamei},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {485},
Pages = {210-219},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Attempts were made to study the effect of stocking density and water
   saving approach on water and sediment quality, growth and production
   performance of shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The experiment was carried
   out with three stocking density of post-larvae i.e. 400,000 per ha
   (T-1), 500,000 per ha (T-2) and 600,000 per ha (T-3).Water exchange was
   carried out depending on water quality parameters. Water quality
   suitability index (WQSI) was lower at higher stocking density as was
   evident in T-3 followed by T-2 and T-1. A very good WQSI (7.5-9.0) was
   recorded up to 13th, 12th and 9th week of culture in T-1, T-2 and T-3,
   respectively; which was ascribed to stocking density, smaller shrimp
   size and less initial feed input. In L. vannamei culture, optimum
   stocking density of 50 post-larvae per m(2) (T-2) led to total water use
   of 3.42 x10(4) m(3) and water exchange of 0.80 x 10(4) m(3). It was
   perceived as a way to improve shrimp productivity (10.31 t ha(-1) 120
   d(-1)), consumptive water use index (1.93 m(3) kg(-1) biomass), total
   water footprint (1426 m(3) t(-1) biomass), net consumptive water
   productivity (USD 1.13 m(-3)) and ratio of output value to the cost of
   cultivation (1.99). Further, farming systems with low to moderate water
   exchange as in T-2, helped maintain water quality suitable for the
   shrimp growth, improved water use efficiency (518 g biomass m(-3)
   water), minimized quantity of sediment load (41.7 m(3) t(-1) biomass)
   and effluent outputs (0.8 x10(4) m(3)). The knowledge derived from this
   study could provide the basis to optimize pond rearing efforts in shrimp
   culture and the water management strategies can be tailored to minimize
   production costs.
   Statement of relevance: This paper presents findings and analysis, from
   a methodologically rigorous investigation and provides insight regarding
   density-dependent optimum water use, its effect on pond water quality,
   sedimentation rate, growth performance, water productivity and water
   footprint. The knowledge derived from this study may be a basis to
   optimize pond rearing efforts in shrimp culture and the water management
   strategies can be tailored to prevent wasteful use of water and enhance
   water use efficiency and water productivity.},

Title = {Environmental and anthropogenic drivers of coniferous species

Journal = {FOLIA GEOBOTANICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {Understanding the influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors
   on the distribution of species is essential for developing management in
   endangered ecosystems. We studied the current abundance and distribution
   patterns of vegetation along environmental and anthropogenic gradients
   in North West Algeria. We focused on the four dominant coniferous
   species (Pinus halepensis, Tetraclinis articulata, Juniperus oxycedrus
   and Juniperus phoenicea). We compiled inventories of species
   composition, together with 12 environmental variables in 177 sampling
   plots throughout the study area. Multivariate (detrended correspondence
   analysis) and univariate (Huisman-Olf-Fresco models) analyses were
   applied to predict the presence of coniferous species and to explore
   species-environment relationships with ecological and anthropogenic
   variables. We found that species segregated along environmental
   gradients, mainly altitude and related climatic variables
   (temperatures). Anthropogenic variables, like fire frequency and
   overgrazing, were secondary, but also significant. Juniperus phoenicea
   was located exclusively in coastal areas. Tetraclinis articulata had a
   wide distribution and was linked to coastal and inland areas, but did
   not arrive at more continental areas (colder and drier), where it was
   replaced with J. oxycedrus. P. halepensis displayed the widest
   distribution and was practically present throughout the study area, but
   its maximum abundance was in continental areas. These results indicate a
   possible shift of species' potential distribution in future climatic
   change. Species like J. oxycedrus would be seriously threatened by niche
   narrowing, while Pinus halepensis and T. articulata could expand to a
   certain extent. Our results provide important inputs for optimizing the
   management plans of coniferous species by considering environmental
   factors key modulators of vegetation distribution.},

Pages = {222-235},
Abstract = {The Pacific shrimp fishery is the most economically important and
   ecologically impactful fishery in Mexico. Strong export markets have had
   a tremendous influence on the technological development and structure of
   this fishery. This article describes the historical development, current
   status, ecological impacts and management of the open ocean trawling
   component of the shrimp fishery in the Sonoran waters of the Gulf of
   California. We trace the economic factors influencing the development of
   the Mexican Pacific trawler-based shrimp fishery, with a focus on the
   port of Guaymas, Sonora, and summarize the events leading to the current
   overcapitalized and inefficient state of that fishery. The Sonoran
   shrimp fishery is characterized by high rates of by-catch and a decline
   in catch per boat trends. A review of economic factors indicates that
   the decision-making process in this fishery is driven by export markets
   and does not adequately consider the local ecosystems and fishing
   communities impacted by shrimp trawling. Management priorities for the
   fishery include fleet size reduction, habitat protection and alternative
   technology development. Successful management depends on the
   participation of powerful. export-import companies, along side
   producers, government. resource management agencies, NGOs and
   scientists. This paper describes recent efforts in collaborative
   management and calls for the expansion of these efforts. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Simple Summary Global warming and certain climate disasters (typhoon,
   tsunami, etc.) can lead to fluctuation in seawater salinity that causes
   salinity stress in fish. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   functional genes and relevant pathways in response to salinity stress in
   the yellow drum. Genes and pathways related to signal transduction,
   osmoregulation, and metabolism may be involved in the adaptive
   regulation to salinity in the yellow drum. Additionally, the genes under
   salinity stress were mainly divided into three expression trends. Our
   results provided novel insights into further study of the salinity
   adaptability of euryhaline fishes. The yellow drum (Nibea albiflora) is
   an important marine economic fish that is widely distributed in the
   coastal waters of the Northwest Pacific. In order to understand the
   molecular regulatory mechanism of the yellow drum under salinity stress,
   in the present study, transcriptome analysis was performed under
   gradients with six salinities (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 psu). Compared
   to 25 psu, 907, 1109, 1309, 18, and 243 differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs) were obtained under 10, 15, 20, 30, and 35 psu salinities,
   respectively. The differential gene expression was further validated by
   quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results of the tendency analysis
   showed that all DEGs of the yellow drum under salinity fluctuation were
   mainly divided into three expression trends. Gene Ontology (GO) and
   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment
   analysis showed that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling
   pathway as well as the glutathione metabolism and steroid biosynthesis
   pathways may be the key pathways for the salinity adaptive regulation
   mechanism of the yellow drum. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the
   solute carrier family (SLC), the transient receptor potential cation
   channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1),
   and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C-B (ALDOCB) may be the key genes in
   the response of the yellow drum to salinity stress. This study explored
   the transcriptional patterns of the yellow drum under salinity stress
   and provided fundamental information for the study of salinity
   adaptability in this species.},

Abstract = {Protea acaulos, a prostrate fynbos shrub, often experiences very low air
   humidity at leaf temperatures over 10 degrees C higher than mean air
   temperature. We determined to what degree this particular microclimate
   influenced photosynthet;ic performance, leaf conductance and water
   relations of non-irrigated and trickle-irrigated plants. Measurements
   were made at the end of the dry summer season in the sand plain lowland
   fynbos on the west coast of South Africa. Independent of water supply,
   plants showed a pronounced midday depression of gas exchange. While in
   non-irrigated plants leaf water potential dropped to -2.0 MPa around
   noon, it never fell below -1.0 MPa in irrigated plants. On the other
   hand minimum pressure potential was similar in irrigated and
   non-irrigated plants. The latter showed higher turgor after rain, due to
   osmotic acclimation, which resulted from a reduction in maximum water
   volume. The main osmoticum was 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol. Leaf temperature,
   directly or via the vapour pressure deficit between leaf and air (Delta
   w), rather than plant water status, was the determinant of the midday
   depression of gas exchange. High Delta w caused stomatal closure during
   times of saturating light, thus limiting photosynthetic CO2 uptake and
   availability and enhancing the susceptibility for photoinhibition. This,
   as well as high leaf temperature per se, decreased the efficiency of
   photochemistry of photosystem II. Initial fluorescence remained constant
   until temperatures exceeded 35 degrees C, above which changes in
   fluorescence indicated both photoinhibition and heat stress. Unlike
   other fynbos plants, Protea acaulos could not use the improved soil
   water supply to increase carbon gain under hot summer condition.},

Title = {Short-term results: The litmus test for success in China},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {76},
Number = {5},
Pages = {61+},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Despite concerns about the continuation of China's economic boom and the
   country's political future, multinationals are flocking to China. Why?
   Because China may soon be one of the world's most important economies.
   Companies that don't consider exploring this vast market may be
   overlooking a tremendous growth opportunity.
   Investing in China now to build sustainable long-term positions is a
   credible strategy. Some companies, however, have taken the long-term
   argument too far. They tolerate poor short-term results in the mistaken
   belief that such results are a trade-off for future profitability. But
   underperformance in the short term is a good indicator that a company's
   strategy or practices may not measure up over the long run.
   Drawing on the examples of multinationals already competing in China,
   the author finds that success is more a factor of managerial capability,
   critical mass scale, and product portfolio than it is length of stay.
   Although some early movers are market leaders, being number one requires
   more than longevity. Take Coca-Cola, for instance. To see it: as a
   passive player that ``waited it out{''} is to misunderstand the
   company's aggressive strategy: Coca-Cola planned carefully for success
   and executed a series of smart short-term moves to make it happen.
   In the final analysis, players that want to be around over the long run
   had better make the right moves today. One mistake won't seal a
   company's fate, but organizations need to learn from their mistakes
   quickly and use their new knowledge to build winning strategies.
   Companies that fail to adapt to the fast-paced market will never enjoy
   long-term success in China.},

Title = {Sponge invaders in Dutch coastal waters},

Abstract = {Continuous monitoring by scientists and volunteers of the Biological
   Working Group of the Dutch SubAqua Union and the `Anemoon' foundation
   over the past four years, yielded a surprising six new records of
   sponges for Dutch coastal waters. Oscarella lobularis, Celtodoryx
   girardae, Suberites virgultosus, Haliclona (Haliclona) simulans,
   Halisarca aff. dujardini, and a species identified as Leucosolenia
   somesii were unknown from Dutch coastal waters before 2000. The latter
   is a giant calcareous sponge, seemingly belonging to the common
   Leucosolenia variabilis, but here assumed to be an invader as well, as
   it has spicular characters well outside the variation found in the
   majority of Dutch L. variabilis specimens. It is likely a member of a
   `forgotten' species, L. somesii. Habit photographs, SEM images of the
   spicules, and for O. lobularis and H. aff. dujardini, photographs of
   histological sections are provided to substantiate these new records.
   With the exception of C girardae, most of the species resemble
   previously described widespread north-east Atlantic species, occurring
   in the area to the south and west of the Netherlands, so it is assumed
   pending future genetic research that at least several of the invaders
   comprise range extensions related to rising winter temperatures.
   Possibly, recent shellfish imports may be an additional causal agent. We
   also report the occurrence of unprecedented spicular deviations observed
   in three sponge species commonly occurring in Dutch waters, Halichondria
   (Halichondria) panicea, Hymeniacidon perlevis and Haliclona (Soestella)
   xena, which grew in small inland water bodies. Possibly, the limited
   space in these inland waters with possible stress factors for sponges
   such as reduced water exchange, and deviating chemistry, have caused the
   sponges to form stunted growth in spicules varying from rhabds with
   rounded endings to silica spheroids. We provide an updated list of
   sponges found in Dutch waters and a list of suspected or proven invaders
   of Dutch waters.},

Title = {Circulatory and Metabolic Physiology Disorder in Different Organs of the
   Subtropical Scallop Species Chlamys nobilis Under Thermal and Hypoxia
   Stress, Revealed by Doppler Ultrasonography Technique},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Extremely high temperature and hypoxia are mounting problems affecting
   the world's coastal waters under the global warming environment, with
   severe consequences for marine life. Scallop is one of the most fragile
   species to hypoxia stress for their high respiration rate and lack of
   self-protection ability such as long-time shell closing. Circulatory
   physiology rhythm is sensitive to environmental stress and is an
   important means for shellfish to quickly respond to environmental
   stress. Therefore, monitoring the circulatory physiology indexes of
   Chlamys nobilis under hypoxia and high temperature stress is helpful to
   quickly diagnose its stress state and reveal the response process of
   circulatory system to the stress. In this study, using real-time Doppler
   ultrasonography technique, we continuously monitored the circulatory
   physiological indexes {[}heart rate (HR), blood flow volume (FV), blood
   velocity (PS and ED), resistance index (RI) and S/D ratio) of the
   scallop organs (gill, mantle and adductor muscle) under hypoxia (mild 4
   mg/L DO, moderate 3 mg/L DO and severe 2 mg/L DO)] and fluctuating high
   temperature stress (29-31 degrees C). Important metabolic function
   indexes {[}adenosine triphosphate (ATP), pyruvate kinase (PK) and
   cytochrome C oxidase (COX)] of various tissues were measured
   simultaneously. The results show that scallops are very sensitive to the
   changes of temperature and dissolved oxygen. Both high temperature and
   hypoxia will increase the HR, and severe hypoxia will bring greater load
   to the heart of the scallop. Hypoxia stress mainly caused the changes of
   PS, and the RI and S/D of the gill gradually increased. At 2mg/L DO
   level, the total blood flow of the mantle and adductor muscle decreased,
   but the blood flow supply in the gill was stable. The scallop is very
   sensitive to the change of high temperature and can make adjustments
   immediately. High temperature increased blood flow in various organs and
   preferentially supplied to the gill. The RI and S/D of branchial vessels
   under high temperature were lower than those under hypoxia. The ATP
   content of the mantle was continuous accumulated under high temperature
   and was significantly higher than that of the gill and adductor muscle,
   indicating the specificity of tissue metabolism. The overall circulatory
   physiological indexes of the gill showed a more positive response to the
   stress environment than the mantle and adductor muscle. All the results
   proved that the gill has the best resistance to the hypoxia and high
   temperature stress. Our study revealed the circulatory physiology
   regulation mechanism of the noble scallop C. nobilis under environmental
   stress, and provide effective data and technique supports for the timely
   diagnose of stress condition of the species, so as to formulate
   necessary handling strategies for the scallop farm.},

Abstract = {Glass fibers are imparted as reinforcement material in polyester matrix
   and still it act as a preferred material for the marine industry.
   However, it is non-biodegradable material and involves high risk during

   an alternative material for glass fiber in the polyester matrix.
   Mechanical properties of these composite specimens such as tensile
   strength, flexural strength and impact resistance in accordance with
   ASTM, were evaluated. SEM images of various composites revealed the
   relations between the reinforced fish-net/glass fiber and woven roving
   with polyester matrix. The dynamic mechanical analysis of storage
   modulus, loss modulus and damping factor was carried out for the
   different composites, compatibility of these composites and its
   properties was studied. The results reveal that the fishnet based
   composites have appreciably higher mechanical properties. Furthermore,
   the glass fiber, woven roving and fishnet composite has more storage
   modulus and significant mechanical damping. A novel hybrid composite is
   recommended for large marine structures and it helps to sustain green

   porosity in clean down-depositional-dip marine carbonate, where repeated
   fracturing allows for hydrothermal fluid flow. Strata updip probably
   experienced repeated events of subaerial exposure, resulting in
   mineralogical stabilization and extensive calcite cementation that
   prevented extensive hydrothermal alteration. Clean, carbonate sediment
   deposited downdip was more prone to alteration by hydrothermal fluids.
   In the reservoir, cement stratigraphy shows regionally persistent zones
   closely associated with fracturing. Fluid inclusion data show high
   temperatures and repeated rises and falls, indicating tectonic valving
   in a hydrothermal system. Salinity data support this and indicate a late
   event of meteoric influx. Srand O-isotope data indicate higher
   temperature and less rock-water interaction in fault damage zones,
   evidence for intensified fluid flow in such areas. Formation of vugs and
   molds was associated with the hydrothermal fluid flow, which was driven
   by convection, probably initiated during 40-30 Ma intrusive activity and
   continuing after the onset of Basin and Range uplift and unroofing.},

Abstract = {The prospective uses of tree gum polysaccharides and their
   nanostructures in various aspects of food, water, energy, biotechnology,
   environment and medicine industries, have garnered a great deal of
   attention recently. In addition to extensive applications of tree gums
   in food, there are substantial non-food applications of these commercial
   gums, which have gained widespread attention due to their availability,
   structural diversity and remarkable properties as `green' bio-based
   renewable materials. Tree gums are obtainable as natural polysaccharides
   from various tree genera possessing exceptional properties, including
   their renewable, biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic nature and
   their ability to undergo easy chemical modifications. This review
   focuses on non-food applications of several important commercially
   available gums (arabic, karaya, tragacanth, ghatti and kondagogu) for
   the greener synthesis and stabilization of metal/metal oxide NPs,
   production of electrospun fibers, environmental bioremediation,
   bio-catalysis, biosensors, coordination complexes of metal hydrogels,
   and for antimicrobial and biomedical applications. Furthermore,
   polysaccharides acquired from botanical, seaweed, animal, and microbial
   origins are briefly compared with the characteristics of tree gum
   exudates.},

Abstract = {A detailed record of benthic foraminifera carbon isotopes from the
   intermediate-depth South East Atlantic margin shows little
   glacial-interglacial variability between MIS-12 to MIS-10, suggesting
   that Northern Atlantic deep-waters consistently penetrated to at least
   30 degrees S. Millennial-scale increases in either the mass or flux of
   northern-sourced deepwaters over the core site occurred alongside
   reductions in Lower North Atlantic Deep Water recorded in North Atlantic
   sediment cores and show that the lower and intermediate limb of the
   Atlantic deepwater convective cell oscillated in anti-phase during
   previous glacial periods. In addition, a 500 yr resolution record of the
   Cape Basin intermediate-deep delta C-13 gradient shows that a reduction
   in deep Southern Ocean ventilation at the end of MIS-11 was consistent
   with a modelled CO2 drawdown of similar to 21-30 ppm. Further increases
   in the Southern Ocean chemical divide during the transition into MIS-10
   were completed before minimum CO2 levels were reached, suggesting that
   other mechanisms such as alkalinity changes were responsible for the
   remaining similar to 45 ppm drawdown.},

Abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with atmospheric
   pressure chemical ionization is an excellent technique for analysis of
   organophosphorus pesticides which are not gas chromatography amenable or
   pose problems with the use of diode array detection or an iomspray
   interface. This study was directed to evaluate the effect of the probe
   temperature and extraction voltage on sensitivity and fragmentation of
   several organophosphorus pesticides. Five different temperatures,
   varying from 100 to 500 degrees C and five extraction voltages, from 10
   to 60 V were applied. In first instance, all the studied compounds were
   characterized at 3-5 different ions under each experimental condition.
   From this qualitative information, together with the relative abundances
   of each ion, the theory of information was applied to objectively
   distinguish the condition(s) that gave more structural information. For
   pesticides of the parathion group, an intense fragmentation was observed
   at all extraction voltages, while sensitivity decreased with increasing
   extraction voltage. In general, higher structural information was
   obtained when increasing the extraction voltage, compared to an increase
   of temperature. However, temperatures of 400-500 degrees C produced the
   highest sensitivity for the majority of the pesticides. Extraction
   voltages of 40 to 60 V produced ions at low m/z, which could not be used
   for identification purposes. The optimum conditions, with regard to best
   sensitivity and structural information were used to calculate the
   recoveries of the studied pesticides. Two solid-phase extraction phases,
   LiChrolut EN and Isolute ENV, were used to preconcentrate 200 ml of
   groundwater spiked at levels of 0.2 mu g/l. Problems arose during
   attempts to recover those compounds which exhibit high vapor pressure.

Volume = {110},

Abstract = {A major goal of ocean color observations from space is the determination
   of phytoplankton primary productivity (PP) and hence oceanic carbon
   uptake. Results of a PP model implemented to use satellite-derived
   fields of chlorophyll, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) and
   sea-surface temperature (SST) are presented. The model gave a global
   estimate of PP of around 57 Gt C yr(-1) and gives a low RMS (0.16) when
   compared with in situ data. However, as the model's in-water light field
   parameterization only considers attenuation by pure water and
   chlorophyll, PP is overestimated in case II waters where other optically
   important constituents such as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   and suspended particulate matter (SPM) are also present. This paper
   develops a novel technique to determine PP by coupling a radiative
   transfer code, which allows the inclusion of CDOM and SPM, to the
   original photosynthesis model. For the global calculations, a look-up
   table has been generated using chlorophyll, CDOM, SST, PAR and day
   length as inputs. The resultant 364,500 element look-up table has been
   applied to data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS)
   and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). PP retrievals
   are improved in case II waters and global estimates are reduced to
   between 52 and 55 Gt C yr(-1).},

Abstract = {Coastal wetlands as the potential ecosystems, provide a wide range of
   benefits counting from ecosystem services to livelihood opportunities.
   Wetlands are continuously being degraded throughout the world especially
   in coastal ecosystems due to intensifying pressure on these resources
   and changing global climatic patterns. The wetlands in Sundarban
   Biosphere Reserve (SBR) are unique in character as these are surrounded
   by numerous rivers, creaks and mangrove forest. The present work is a
   concerted attempt to assess the health conditions of coastal wetland
   ecosystem in the SBR, India. Coastal wetlands of SBR were delineated
   during 1989-2017. Geospatial layers of site-specific indicators were
   prepared and were applied to the PSR model to examine the health of the
   wetland ecosystem. The model was also utilized to examine the impact of
   anthropogenic activities on wetland ecosystem and to ascertain the
   relationship among ecological pressure-state-response of ecosystem. The
   findings revealed that area under agriculture has been transformed into
   aquaculture. The shortage of fresh water supply for agriculture and
   increased salinity transformed many croplands to seasonal wetlands
   throughout the SBR. The overall ecosystem health of Sundarban has been
   decreased during the last two decades due to anthropogenic pressure and
   climate change issues. The result also indicated that the ecosystem
   fragmentation and human interference rate are two main dominating
   factors for declining wetland health in SBR. The findings of the study
   may help in formulating policy for the management of coastal wetland
   ecosystem.},

Title = {Monitoring and Projecting Land Use/Land Cover Changes of Eleven Large

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Wetlands are areas of high biodiversity and provide many ecosystem
   services of high value. However, they are under constant threat from
   intense anthropogenic pressures, mainly agriculture intensification,
   urbanization, pollution, and climate change. The temporal and spatial
   patterns of land use/land cover (LULC) changes within eleven large
   wetlands in Greece were analyzed based on thematic maps generated from
   aerial orthophotos taken in 1945, 1975, and 2007. Socio-economic
   developments and the consequent need for more arable land and
   utilization of water resources are among the factors that mainly
   determine their evolution. In 2007, LULC classes related to wetland
   vegetation were reduced to one third as compared to 1945 and they were
   mainly replaced with croplands and urban infrastructures. Each of the
   different sub-periods that was considered (1945-1975 and 1975-2007) was
   distinguished by characteristic patterns of change. Agricultural land
   increased up to 42\% from 1945 to 1975 and became the dominant LULC
   class in all deltaic areas but Evros. A considerable stability was
   observed for the period 1975-2007 for all LULC classed but it is
   remarkable the extent of urban areas that doubled. There is a tendency
   of landscape simplification and homogenization among the deltaic areas
   and the output of Markov chain analysis indicates that future
   composition of deltaic landscapes will be similar to the current one if
   the main driving forces remain constant. Changes in LULC composition and
   structure are also combined with coastal erosion in all deltaic areas.
   This is attributed to the modification of sedimentary deposits due to
   dam construction. The results summarize the change trajectories of the
   major deltaic areas in Greece from 1945 to 2007 thus offering a great
   outlook of changes that allows managers to understand how policies and
   socio-economic requirements affect the deltaic ecosystems and what
   decisions should be made to protect and enhance them.},

Title = {Effects of polar ice sheets on global sea level in high-resolution
   greenhouse scenarios},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {108},
Number = {D5},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Projections of future global sea level critically depend on reliable
   estimates of mass balance changes on the polar ice sheets. The most
   sophisticated tools allowing for such estimates are General Circulation
   Models (GCM). A major impediment until recently has been their coarse
   grid resolution (3degrees-6degrees) causing substantial uncertainties in
   the mass balance calculations on the poorly resolved ice sheets. The
   present study is based on a climate change experiment of highest
   resolution currently feasible (T106, 1.1degrees). The precipitation
   distribution significantly benefits from the more realistic orographic
   forcing in the high-resolution experiment and is very accurately
   reproduced. A greenhouse warming experiment with doubled carbon-dioxide
   concentration based on the same high-resolution model suggests an
   increase in accumulation on both Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. On
   the other hand, even a T106 resolution is still too coarse for the
   simulation of ablation on the narrow ice sheet margins, where most of
   the melting takes place. A simple method is presented to improve
   ablation diagnostics from GCMs, based on the interpolation of the
   reference temperature and temperature anomaly fields onto a fine mesh
   topography of 2 km horizontal resolution. The increase in ablation on
   Greenland in the greenhouse scenario is thereby smaller than the
   increase directly inferred from the GCM grid. As for Antarctica, it is
   still too cold at the time of doubled carbon-dioxide concentration for
   significant ablation. The results from the greenhouse experiment with
   doubled carbon-dioxide concentration thus suggest not only a mass gain
   in Antarctica due to the increase in accumulation, but also a mass gain
   in Greenland, since the enhanced ablation in the warmer climate does not
   fully compensate for the increased accumulation. In terms of global sea
   level change, these mass balance shifts correspond to a net sea level
   decrease of 1.2 mm y(-1) at the time of doubled carbon-dioxide. This may
   compensate for a substantial fraction of the melt-induced sea level rise
   from smaller glaciers and ice caps, leaving thermal expansion as the
   dominant factor for sea level rise over the coming decades. The
   compensating effect, however, could fade if carbon-dioxide
   concentrations in the atmosphere cannot be stabilized and continue to
   rise above double the present values, since the associated greenhouse
   warming could then become large enough to induce significant melting
   also on the Antarctic ice sheet.},

Abstract = {Conventional line frequency transformers are commonly used for wind
   turbines to step up the low-level voltage of the generators to reduce
   the transmission losses. However, they are not well suited for offshore
   wind turbines in terms of size, mass, cost of maintenance and the
   complexity of the wind turbine structure. Alternatively, to overcome
   these issues, modular high-frequency high-power transformers (HFHPTs)
   for modular DC-DC converters are introduced in this paper. Modular
   annular HFHPTs are also scalable in terms of size and power rating. The
   design method, design results and simulation results for a modular
   ferrite core transformer and a modular amorphous alloy core transformer
   are presented in this paper. A scaled-down isolation transformer is
   tested for the proof of concept.},

Title = {Technical note: Uncovering the influence of methodological variations on
   the extractability of iron-bound organic carbon},

Abstract = {Association of organic carbon (OC) with reactive iron (FeR) represents
   an important mechanism by which OC is protected against remineralisation
   in soils and marine sediments. Recent studies indicate that the
   molecular structure of organic compounds and/or the identity of
   associated FeR phases exert a control on the ability of an OC-FeR
   complex to be extracted by the citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CBD)
   method. However, many variations of the CBD extraction are used, and
   these are often uncalibrated to each other, rendering comparisons of
   OC-FeR values extracted via the different methods impossible. Here, we
   created synthetic ferrihydrite samples coprecipitated with simple
   organic structures and subjected these to modifications of the most
   common CBD method. We altered some of the method parameters (reagent
   concentration, time of the extraction and sample preparation methods)
   and measured FeR recovery to determine which (if any) modifications
   affected the release of FeR from the synthetic sample. We provide an
   assessment of the reducing capacity of Na dithionite in the CBD method
   (the amount of Fe reduced by a fixed amount of dithionite) and find that
   the concentration of dithionite deployed can limit OC-FeR extractability
   for sediments with a high FeR content. Additionally, we show that
   extending the length of any CBD extraction offers no benefit in removing
   FeR. Moreover, we demonstrate that for synthetic OC-FeR samples
   dominated by ferrihydrite, freeze-drying samples can significantly
   reduce OC-FeR extractability; this appears to be less of an issue for
   natural marine sediments where natural ageing mechanisms may mimic the
   freeze-drying process for more stable Fe phases. While our study is not
   an all-inclusive method comparison and is not aimed at delivering the
   ``perfect{''} extraction setup, our findings provide a collected summary
   of critical factors which influence the efficiency of the CBD extraction
   for OC-FeR. As such, we provide a platform from which OC-FeR values
   obtained under different methods can be interpreted and future studies
   of sediment carbon cycling can build upon.},

Abstract = {Using acoustic telemetry on migratory striped bass Morone saxatilis in
   Plum Island Estuary (PIE), Massachusetts, we found that striped bass
   (335-634 mm total length) tagged in the spring and summer of 2005 (n =
   14) and 2006 (n = 46) stayed in the estuary for an average of 66.0 d in
   2005 and 72.2 d in 2006. Striped bass spent the most time in two
   specific reaches: middle Plum Island Sound and lower Rowley River. In
   both years, three different use-groups of striped bass were observed in
   PIE. Short-term visitors (n = 24) stayed in the estuary only briefly
   (range = 5-20 d). Two groups of seasonal residents stayed for more than
   30 d, either in the Rowley River (n = 14) or in Plum Island Sound (n =
   22). Within PIE, the two seasonal-resident use-groups may be foraging
   contingents that learn how to feed efficiently in specific parts of the
   estuary. These distinct within-estuary use patterns could have different
   implications for striped bass condition and prey impact.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Accretion and surface elevation change were measured in riverine, marine
   and impounded wetland habitats of the Rhone Delta from 1992 to 1996
   using a sedimentation-erosion table (SET) and marker horizons. Riverine
   habitat accreted at a significantly greater rate than the other habitats
   throughout the period of study, averaging 13.4 +/- 7.0 mm yr(-1)
   compared to 1.1 +/- 0.1 and 1.2 +/- 0.5 mm yr(-1) for impounded and
   marine habitats, respectively. Elevation change was similar to accretion
   in the riverine habitat (11.3 +/- 6.1 mm yr(-1)), reflecting an average
   16\% compaction and consolidation of recent, primarily mineral deposits.
   Over time, elevation change and accretion became more linearly
   correlated, showing that variation between these two processes decreases
   with time. Accretion and elevation change in impounded and marine
   habitats were less than current rates of relative sea-level rise, a
   result of isolation from riverine flooding and the lack of marine storms
   during the study period. There was more than 30 mm of accretion in the
   riverine habitat deposited during the 50 and 90-year floods in the Rhone
   in 1993 and 1994. Impounded and marine habitats gave no record of these
   events. Wetlands connected to the Rhone River can therefore accrete
   rapidly from sediments deposited during floods. Impoundments, the most
   common ``natural areas{''} left in the delta, are not keeping pace with
   relative sea-level rise and may become vulnerable to increased sea-level
   rise if current management practices are continued.},

Title = {Tidally influenced alongshore circulation at an inlet-adjacent shoreline},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {26-38},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The contribution of tidal forcing to alongshore circulation inside the
   surfzone is investigated at a 7 km long sandy beach adjacent to a large
   tidal inlet. Ocean Beach in San Francisco, CA (USA) is onshore of a
   similar to 150 km(2) ebb-tidal delta and directly south of the Golden
   Gate, the sole entrance to San Francisco Bay. Using a coupled flow-wave
   numerical model, we find that the tides modulate, and in some cases can
   reverse the direction of, surfzone alongshore flows through two separate
   mechanisms. First, tidal flow through the inlet results in a barotropic
   tidal pressure gradient that, when integrated across the surfzone,
   represents an important contribution to the surfzone alongshore force
   balance. Even during energetic wave conditions, the tidal pressure
   gradient can account for more than 30\% of the total alongshore pressure
   gradient (wave and tidal components) and up to 55\% during small waves.
   The wave driven component of the alongshore pressure gradient results
   from alongshore wave height and corresponding setup gradients induced by
   refraction over the ebb-tidal delta. Second, wave refraction patterns
   over the inner shelf are tidally modulated as a result of both tidal
   water depth changes and strong tidal flows (similar to 1 m/s), with the
   effect from currents being larger. These tidally induced changes in wave
   refraction result in corresponding variability of the alongshore
   radiation stress and pressure gradients within the surfzone. Our results
   indicate that tidal contributions to the surfzone force balance can be
   significant and important in determining the direction and magnitude of
   alongshore flow. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Nanoporous graphene is considered the next-generation material for
   reverse osmosis water desalination providing both high water
   permeability and almost complete salt rejection. The main problem with
   graphene is the difficulty of synthesizing membranes with a consistent
   subnanometer pore size distribution. A recently proposed solution
   involves processing as-grown graphene oxide (GO) monolayers via a mild
   temperature annealing pre-treatment causing GO functional groups to
   cluster into small oxidized islands. A following harsh thermal reduction
   process creates pores only in the small oxidized regions. However, a
   suitable relationship between the area of the GO islands and the pore
   dimension is still missing. Here, we study in detail the effects of such
   a thermal reduction process on the graphene oxide sheet by means of
   molecular dynamics simulations, particularly highlighting and analysing
   the process parameters affecting the final pore area. Besides proving
   that epoxides represent the most suitable functional group to induce
   carbon removal and, thus, pore generation in reduced GO, we find a
   twofold way to achieve control over the pore size: tuning the dimension
   and shape of the initial clustered GO areas or changing the harsh
   reduction process temperature. An accurate balance of these parameters
   consistently gives rise to targeted pore dimensions in graphene
   membranes.},

Abstract = {The abundance of consistent high strength winds off the world's
   coastlines and the close proximity to dense population centers has led
   to development of innovative marine structures to support wind turbines
   to capture this energy resource. Off the US coast, 60\% of the offshore
   wind lies in deep water (greater than 60m) where the development of
   Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) hull technology will likely be
   required in lieu of fixed bottom technology such as jacket structures.
   The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the
   offshore wind community commonly refer to 60m as the transition point
   between fixed bottom structures and floating structures due to economic
   reasons. Floating wind turbines deployed in the harsh offshore marine
   environment require the use of materials that are cost-effective,
   corrosion resistant, require little maintenance and are highly durable.
   This has led the University of Maine to develop a concrete hull
   technology called VolturnUS for full-scale 6MW FOWTs. In this work,
   experimental testing was conducted to verify the performance of the
   concrete under operational, serviceability, and extreme loading
   conditions as required by the American Bureau of Shipping Guide for
   Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines. The testing
   included structural testing sub-components of the hull and served as
   experimental verification of American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) concrete
   design methodology which is currently approved and being used to design
   the first commercial scale FOWTs in the United States. Two 6MW wind
   turbines supported on VolturnUS concrete hulls will be used for the New
   England Aqua Ventus I project. The project is planned to be deployed and
   connected to the grid by 2019 in the Northeast U.S. and is funded by the
   US Department of Energy.},

Abstract = {Analysis of daily solar irradiation variability and predictability in
   space and time is important for energy resources planning, development,
   and management. The natural variability of solar irradiation is being
   complicated by atmospheric conditions (in particular cloudiness) and
   orography, which introduce additional complexity into the
   phenomenological records. To address this question for daily solar
   irradiation data recorded during the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 at 11
   stations measuring solar irradiance on La Reunion French tropical Indian
   Ocean Island, we use a set of novel quantitative tools: Kolmogorov
   complexity (KC) with its derivative associated measures and Hamming
   distance (HAM) and their combination to assess complexity and
   corresponding predictability. We find that all half-day (from sunrise to
   sunset) solar irradiation series exhibit high complexity. However, all
   of them can be classified into three groups strongly influenced by trade
   winds that circulate in a flow around regime: the windward side (trade
   winds slow down), the leeward side (diurnal thermally-induced
   circulations dominate) and the coast parallel to trade winds (winds are
   accelerated due to Venturi effect). We introduce Kolmogorov time (KT)
   that quantifies the time span beyond which randomness significantly
   influences predictability.},

Abstract = {Aqueous core colloidosomes encapsulating the enzyme amylase were
   manufactured with a shell comprising polymer latex particles of diameter
   153 nm. The colloidosomes were sealed with calcium carbonate by
   precipitation between an inner phase of Na2CO3 and an outer phase of
   CaCl2. This seal allowed the retention of small molecules, such as dyes,
   as well as larger enzyme molecules, for several months. The encapsulated
   material could be released by dissolution of the CaCO3 with acid, upon a
   large dilution in water, or by applying a sufficient shear. The degree
   of release could be controlled since the greater the mass of CaCO3
   precipitated onto the colloidosome shell, the greater the dilution or
   shear required to achieve release. The calcium carbonate seal protected
   encapsulated amylase from the detrimental effects of components in a
   liquid laundry detergent for several months so that, on triggered
   release, the enzyme retained its high activity.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {36},
Number = {21},
Pages = {4547-4552},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Riparian zones have been found to function as ``sinks{''} for, nitrate
   (NO3-), the most common groundwater pollutant in the U. S., in many
   areas. The vast majority of riparian research, however, has focused on
   agricultural watersheds. There has been little analysis of riparian
   zones in urban watersheds, despite the fact that urban areas are
   important sources of NO3- to nitrogen (N)-sensitive coastal waters in
   many locations. In this study, we measured stream incision, water table
   depths, and pools, production (mineralization, nitrification), and
   consumption (denitrification) of NO3- in urban soils. Samples were taken
   from soil profiles (0100 cm) of three forested urban and suburban zones
   and one forested reference riparian zone in the Baltimore, Maryland
   metropolitan area. Our objectives were to determine (1) if stream
   incision associated with urbanization results in lower riparian water
   tables, and (2) if pools, production, and consumption of NO3- vary
   systematically with stream incision and riparian water table levels. Two
   of the three urban and suburban streams were more incised and all three
   had lower water tables in their riparian zones than the forested
   reference stream. Urban and suburban riparian zones had higher NO3-
   pools and nitrification rates than the forested reference riparian zone,
   which was likely due to more aerobic soil profiles, lower levels of
   available soil carbon, and greater N enrichment in the urban and
   suburban sites. At all sites, denitrification potential decreased
   markedly with depth in the soil profile. Lower water tables in-the urban
   and suburban,riparian zones thus inhibit interaction of
   groundwater-borne NO3- with near surface soils that have the highest
   denitrification potential. These results suggest that urban hydrologic,
   factors can increase the production and reduce the consumption of NO3-
   in riparian,zones, reducing their ability to function as sinks for NO3-
   in the landscape.},

Abstract = {Technologies are considered tools to increase the number of ``available

   Even in situations where integrated management is attempted, the role of
   technologies that might be deployed on the coastal zone to satisfy other
   societal needs or to provide a solution to specific problem, is not
   always adequately considered. True integration requires an understanding

   Journal of Coastal Research, 29(1), 105-117. Coconut Creek (Florida),
   ISSN 0749-0208. Distichlis spicata (C. Linnaeus) E. Greene is a New
   World temperate-, subtropical-, and tropical-zone rhizomatous, dioecious
   grass. It is an important species in coastal salt marshes, brackish
   marshes, and tidal wetlands, where it is often a dominant species.
   Inland ecotypes of this taxon occur in wet alkaline sites throughout
   temperate regions of the United States, Mexico, and South America.
   Distichlis spicata often occurs in wetlands, where total soluble salts
   seasonally range from about 20 to 43 ppt and where the pH varies from 5
   to 7. Higher salinities in the rhizome-root matrix reduce shoot growth
   more than root growth. Also known as salt grass, D. spicata is a clonal
   stress tolerator that spreads laterally into disturbed sites in the
   upper marsh, and it recovers quickly from burial by wrack debris after
   storms. A typical water level range for salt grass is from 10 to 15 cm
   below to 5 cm above the marsh surface, but it can tolerate tidal
   amplitudes ranging from 1.36 to 1.74 m for 1 hour on some coastlines.
   Pistillate plants typically dominate lower elevations in tidal marshes,
   whereas higher elevations in marshes support populations dominated by
   male plants. Herein, we present a review of the biology of this
   important species.},

Abstract = {Cardona et al. proposed a two-stage RO system. As reported, this
   two-stage RO system presents about 20\% energy saving compared with
   conventional single-stage RO system when pressure exchanger is excluded
   from consideration. Since two mixing steps occur in this two-stage RO
   system, will it still show advantages from the point of the second law
   of thermodynamics? This paper makes an exergetic discussion on this
   two-stage RO system and a conventional single-stage RO system. It is
   found that input pressure exergy accounts for a large proportion of
   total input exergy in RO systems. Two-stage RO system presents about
   42\% of rise in input pressure exergy and 33\% of rise in total exergy
   destruction compared with single-stage system. The blending exergy
   destruction is much smaller than the total exergy loss. Therefore, the
   key points that improve the exergetic efficiency of this two-stage RO
   system lie in other ways. Increasing the product flow by heating feed is
   an effective method. Because of the higher investment, solar collector
   is not appropriate for application. Solar pond can also provide heat for
   feed water. Because the salt for the solar pond can be supplied by the
   brine exiting the first stage in this two-stage RO system, the main
   investment comes only from the construction of the solar pond. It is
   possible that within the life range of the solar pond, the increased
   investment can be offset by the increased product.},

Abstract = {Systematic morphological changes of the coastline of the outer Yangtze
   River mouth in response to storms versus calm weather were documented by
   daily surveys of tidal marshes and flats between April 1999 and May 2001
   and by boat surveys offshore during this and earlier periods. The
   largest single event during 1999 to 2001 was Typhoon Paibaian, which
   eroded the unvegetated tidal flat and lower marsh and led to accretion
   on the middle-to-upper marsh and in the subtidal channel. The greatest
   erosion of 21 cm occurred at the border between the marsh and the
   unvegetated flat due to the landward retreat of the marsh edge during
   the storm. Strong waves on the flats increased suspended sediment
   concentration by 10-20 times. On the upper marsh, where the frequency of
   submergence by astronomical tides is only 3\%, Typhoon Paibian led to 4
   cm of accretion, accounting for 57\% of the net accretion observed over
   the 2-yr study. Typhoon Paibian and other large storms in the 1990s
   caused over 50 cm of accretion along the deep axis of the river mouth
   outlet channel. During calm weather, when hydrodynamic energy was
   dominated by tides, deposition was centered on the unvegetated flats and
   lower marsh with little deposition on the high marsh and erosion in the
   subtidal channel. Depositional recovery of the tidal flat from
   typhoon-induced erosion took only several days, whereas recovery of the
   subtidal channel by erosion took several weeks. A conceptual model for
   the morphological responses of tidal marshes, flats, and subtidal
   channels to storms and calm weather is proposed such that sediment
   continually moves from regions of highest near-bed energy towards areas
   of lower energy.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Interdisciplinary data fuel fisheries oceanography research and the
   ecosystem-based approaches to management and sustainable development it
   informs. Underlying this is a distributed ocean observing framework that
   is integrated, interoperable, interactive, and accessible. In
   recognition of the 30th anniversary of Fisheries Oceanography the
   journal, this paper reviews the evolution of observing instruments and
   platforms used in contemporary fisheries oceanography the science.
   Illustrated with personal anecdotes, past efforts to create or adopt
   observing technologies, and examples of their use in research, this
   highlights the spectrum of instruments, systems, and programs used to
   survey and monitor ocean ecosystems. Modern ocean observing systems are
   complex and varied, reflecting the range and diversity of data required
   by fisheries oceanographers. These systems require a large and ongoing
   investment and an interdisciplinary community of scientists, engineers,
   and technicians to design, build, install, operate, and maintain them.
   Common themes emerge from a review of past successful instrument R\&D
   and deployments. It is a highly collaborative, integrative, and
   iterative process. Most systems are the result of vision, planning, and
   perseverance, backed by careful calibration and intercomparison.
   Long-term support is essential; public-private partnerships that
   leverage funding, technology, and infrastructure are critical.
   Sustaining long time series for monitoring population and ecosystem
   change and to support fisheries oceanography research is a priority.
   Future areas of focus include continuously innovating and updating
   technologies, implementing a backbone of core observations, and
   maintaining a nimble infrastructure and R\&D capacity to seize new
   opportunities and address emerging challenges.},

Abstract = {Antarctic surface oceans are well-studied during summer when irradiance
   levels are high, sea ice is melting and primary productivity is at a
   maximum. Coincident with this timing, the bacterioplankton respond with
   significant increases in secondary productivity. Little is known about
   bacterioplankton in winter when darkness and sea-ice cover inhibit
   photoautotrophic primary production. We report here an environmental
   genomic and small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) analysis of winter
   and summer Antarctic Peninsula coastal seawater bacterioplankton.
   Intense inter-seasonal differences were reflected through shifts in
   community composition and functional capacities encoded in winter and
   summer environmental genomes with significantly higher phylogenetic and
   functional diversity in winter. In general, inferred metabolisms of
   summer bacterioplankton were characterized by chemoheterotrophy,
   photoheterotrophy and aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis while the winter
   community included the capacity for bacterial and archaeal
   chemolithoautotrophy. Chemolithoautotrophic pathways were dominant in
   winter and were similar to those recently reported in global `dark
   ocean' mesopelagic waters. If chemolithoautotrophy is widespread in the
   Southern Ocean in winter, this process may be a previously unaccounted
   carbon sink and may help account for the unexplained anomalies in
   surface inorganic nitrogen content. The ISME Journal (2012) 6,

Title = {Minor Sea Turtle Nesting Areas May Remain Unnoticed without Specific
   Monitoring: The Case of the Largest Mediterranean Island (Sicily, Italy)},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Before protecting sea turtles' nesting sites from coastal
   development, these sites must be identified and evaluated. This is
   particularly difficult with minor nesting sites distributed over large
   areas. We report on the case of Sicily, the largest Mediterranean island
   with 464 km of sandy shores, where sea turtle nesting activity was
   basically unknown until recent years when specific projects focused on
   this topic. This may be the case for many other areas. A total of 323
   nests have been reported in the 1944-2021 period (mostly in the last
   decade). However, the real number of nests occurring annually is still
   unknown and more research and monitoring is needed. In sea turtles, sex
   is determined by the incubation temperature, with high temperatures
   producing more females, and with global warming the scarcity of males
   may become a problem. Nests in Sicily seem to produce more males and
   therefore this area may be important for the species' conservation in
   the future. Identifying coastal tracts suitable for sea turtle
   reproduction is crucial for sea turtle conservation in a context of fast
   coastal development and climate change. In contrast to nesting
   aggregations, diffuse nesting is elusive and assessing nesting levels is
   challenging. A total of 323 nesting events by the loggerhead sea turtle
   Caretta caretta have been reported in Sicily, the largest Mediterranean
   island, in the 1944-2021 period, mostly in the last decade. Specific
   monitoring efforts are the most likely explanation for such an increase
   and shows that sea turtle nesting may be underestimated or completely
   ignored in many areas with scattered nesting. The real nesting level
   along the 464 km sandy shores of Sicily is still unknown and more
   research is needed. The observed incubation period was relatively long
   (57 d) suggesting that a majority of males are produced in Sicily, in
   contrast to the typical female-biased sex ratio of sea turtles. In a
   context of climate warming producing sex ratios more skewed towards
   females, the potential of Sicily as a male-producing area should be
   further investigated. Other reproductive parameters are provided, such
   as clutch size and hatching and emergence success. A negative effect of
   relocation on the latter two was observed.},

Abstract = {Accurate forecasting of renewable energy sources plays a key role in
   their integration into the grid. This study proposes machine learning
   algorithms to predict the hourly solar irradiance. Forecasting models
   were developed based two types of the input data. The first one uses
   local time, temperature, pressure, wind speed, and relative humidity as
   input variables of the models (N-1); the second one is the time series
   prediction of solar irradiance (N-2) (forecasting models only use from
   past time-series solar radiation values to estimate the future values).
   For this purpose, multilayer feed-forward neural network (MLFFNN),
   radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), support vector regression
   (SVR), fuzzy inference system (FIS) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
   system (ANFIS) are developed. The results demonstrated that for the N-1,
   SVR and MLFFNN models have the maximum performance to predict the solar
   irradiance with R = 0.9999 and 0.9795, respectively. For the N-2, SVR,
   MLFFNN and ANFIS models have reported the correlation coefficient more
   than 0.95 for the testing dataset. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {We documented relative growth rates (RGRs) and activities of
   extracellular hydrolytic enzymes (EHEs) of one marine-derived tropical
   strain of Fusarium equiseti originally isolated from Malaysia and two
   polar strains of Pseudogymnoascus spp. from the Arctic and Antarctic
   under various temperatures and different nutrient conditions. RGRs and
   relative enzyme activities (RAs) of protease, amylase and cellulase were
   screened in seawater nutrient assay plates augmented with either skim
   milk, soluble starch or carboxymethylcellulose with trypan blue,
   respectively, across culture temperatures between 5 degrees C and 40
   degrees C. Measures of RGR were fitted into third-degree polynomial and
   Briere-2 temperature-dependent models to estimate optimum temperatures
   for growth (T-opt) and maximum growth rates (RGR(max)), and were used to
   calculate temperature coefficients (Q(10)) and activation energies (E-a)
   for growth. All studied strains showed highest RGR and RA when grown
   using a skim milk nutrient assay. T-opt for growth was 25 degrees C in
   F. equiseti and 20 degrees C in Pseudogymnoascus spp. Only F. equiseti
   showed cellulase activity. These data suggest a preference for
   protein-based substrates over plant-derived substrates for metabolism in
   these fungal strains. The tropical F. equiseti could utilise higher
   levels of thermal energy for growth than the polar strains of
   Pseudogymnoascus spp., implying adaptation of these fungi to different
   bioclimatic regions.},

Title = {Experimental field study of floater motion effects on a main bearing in
   a full-scale spar floating wind turbine},
Journal = {MARINE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper we present a full-scale experimental field study of the
   effects of floater motion on a main bearing in a 6 MW turbine on a
   spar-type floating substructure. Floating wind turbines are necessary to
   access the full offshore wind power potential, but the characteristics
   of their operation leave a gap with respect to the rapidly developing
   empirical knowledge on operation of bottom-fixed turbines. Larger wind
   turbines are one of the most important contributions to reducing cost of
   energy, but challenge established drivetrain layouts, component size
   envelopes and analysis methods. We have used fibre optic strain sensor
   arrays to measure circumferential strain in the stationary ring in a
   main bearing. Strain data have been analysed in the time domain and the
   frequency domain and compared with data on environmental loads, floating
   turbine motion and turbine operation. The results show that the
   contribution to fluctuating strain from in-plane bending strain is two
   orders of magnitude larger than that from membrane strain. The
   fluctuating in-plane bending strain is the result of cyclic differences
   between blade bending moments, both in and out of the rotor plane, and
   is driven by wind loads and turbine rotation. The fluctuating membrane
   strain appears to be the result of both axial load from thrust, because
   of the bearing and roller geometry, and radial loads on the rotating
   bearing ring from total out-of-plane bending moments in the three
   blades. The membrane strain shows a contribution from slow-varying wind
   forces and floating turbine pitch motion. However, as the total
   fluctuating strain is dominated by the intrinsic effects of blade
   bending moments in these turbines, the relative effect of floater motion
   is very small. Mostly relevant for the intrinsic membrane strain, sum
   and difference frequencies appear in the measured responses as the
   result of nonlinear system behaviour. This is an important result with
   respect to turbine modelling and simulation, where global structural
   analyses and local drivetrain analyses are frequently decoupled.},

Title = {Investigating Space Radiation Environment Effects on Communication of
   Razaksat-1},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {This study attempted to identify whether space radiation sources could
   have affected the communication on RazakSAT-1 that was orbiting in a Low
   Earth Orbit-Near Equatorial (LEO-NEqO). Data on galactic cosmic rays
   (GCR), trapped protons, trapped electrons, and solar energetic particles
   (SEPs) obtained from Space Environment Information System (SPENVIS) are
   considered. The effects of these radiation sources are analyzed using
   the linear energy transfer (LET), total ionizing dose (TID), and solar
   cell degradation. Flux data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) 15, 16, and 17 satellites, and the geomagnetic
   conditions during the time when RazakSAT-1's missing is also analyzed.
   Another two satellites, Satelite de Coleta de Dados (SCD-2) and Advanced
   Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), are compared with the performance of
   RazakSAT-1. Results showed that GCR dominated at a high energy range of
   10(3) MeV and above in the LEO-NEqO, whereas the energies of the trapped
   protons and trapped electrons are less than 400 MeV and 4 MeV,
   respectively. There are no SEPs estimated during the mission period
   (2009 - 2011). Based on the SPENVIS, SCD-2 and ALOS are more exposed to
   higher radiation damage than RazakSAT-1. Thus, an analysis of space
   radiation environment effects on the RazakSAT-1 communication lost after
   one year of operation will be discussed further, as a platform to find
   the best strategy for future missions.},

Abstract = {The development of the giant oil fields of Albacora, Marlim, and
   Barracuda,, in Campos Basin, Brazil, discovered in the late 80's.
   represented an enormous challenge for Petrobras, Considering that the
   existing pipeline network in Campos Basin was already at maximum
   capacity, the use of FPSOs showed to be the most attractive floating
   production concept for the development of these fields.
   Petrobras experience with such units began back in 1979 with an FPSO
   moored to a Tower-Yoke system in shallow water Garoupa Field. Petrobras
   has Installed, since then, seven FPSOs/FSOs, By June of 2000 four more
   units will be in operation and two more are planned to be installed by
   the end of 2001.
   In this paper some operational aspects of these FPSO's will be
   discussed, such as global efficiency, production loss causes and process
   plant uptime, This paper will also address the definition of the
   environmental design criteria for the various activities usually carried
   out in an FPSO, such as plant operation, production riser's pull-in and
   offloading manoeuvres.
   The importance of the experience acquired in the last twenty years for
   the improvement of the new FPSO units will be also pointed out, as well
   as the experience gathered in recent years with the new turret moored
   FPSOs.},

Title = {Physical Drivers of Biogeochemical Variability in the Polar Front
   Meander},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Southern Ocean plays a vital role in global ocean circulation, and
   the Polar Front (PF) is one of its most important physical features. The
   PF meander south of Tasmania, around 153 degrees E, 55 degrees S, is a
   very dynamic region which spawns mesoscale eddies, and influences local
   biogeochemistry and sea-air interaction. By using voyage and ancillary
   data, we investigated the unusually strong spring bloom in the vicinity
   of the PF meander in 2018. We infer that the upwelling of deep water at
   the front and in eddies, brings macronutrients and dissolved iron (dFe)
   to the surface. Chlorophyll concentration peaked at over 0.6 mg m(-3),
   which is anomalously high for this area. With reduced iron limitation,
   the physiological characteristics of phytoplankton in the northern,
   downstream part of the study area also changed. The photochemical
   efficiency was improved and released this area from its usual
   high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) status. This was mainly indicated
   by the increase in the dawn Fv/Fm maximum (indictor of photochemical
   efficiency) from 0.2 to over 0.5. With the biomass increase and
   healthier community status, we observed consumption of surface dissolved
   inorganic carbon and increased particulate organic carbon production to
   about 40 mu mol L-1, forming a weak local carbon sink. Through the
   investigation of multiple years, a weak positive correlation between
   mixed layer depth shoaling and phytoplankton growth was found, but there
   was significant interannual variability in this relationship, likely
   caused by variable eddy conditions and dFe delivery.},

Abstract = {Understanding bacterioplankton community dynamics in coastal hypoxic
   environments is relevant to global biogeochemistry because coastal
   hypoxia is increasing worldwide. The temporal dynamics of
   bacterioplankton communities were analysed throughout the illuminated
   water column of Devil's Hole, Bermuda during the 6-week annual
   transition from a strongly stratified water column with suboxic and
   high-pCO(2) bottom waters to a fully mixed and ventilated state during
   2008. A suite of culture-independent methods provided a quantitative
   spatiotemporal characterization of bacterioplankton community changes,
   including both direct counts and rRNA gene sequencing. During
   stratification, the surface waters were dominated by the SAR11 clade of
   Alphaproteobacteria and the cyanobacterium Synechococcus. In the suboxic
   bottom waters, cells from the order Chlorobiales prevailed, with gene
   sequences indicating members of the genera Chlorobium and
   Prosthecochloris - anoxygenic photoautotrophs that utilize sulfide as a
   source of electrons for photosynthesis. Transitional zones of hypoxia
   also exhibited elevated levels of methane- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria
   relative to the overlying waters. The abundance of both Thaumarcheota
   and Euryarcheota were elevated in the suboxic bottom waters (>10(9)
   cells l(-1)). Following convective mixing, the entire water column
   returned to a community typical of oxygenated waters, with Euryarcheota
   only averaging 5\% of cells, and Chlorobiales and Thaumarcheota absent.},

Abstract = {The following paper provides an overview of a novel wind turbine concept
   known as the X-Rotor Offshore Wind Turbine. The X-Rotor is a new wind
   turbine concept that aims to reduce the cost of energy from offshore
   wind. Cost reductions are achieved through reduced capital costs and
   reduced maintenance costs. The following paper includes results from an
   early feasibility study completed on the concept. In the feasibility
   study exemplary designs were created and structural analyses were
   carried out. Turbine capital costs and maintenance cost of the X-Rotor
   concept were then roughly estimated. X-Rotor turbine costs and O\&M
   costs were compared to four existing wind turbine types to investigate
   potential cost savings from the X-Rotor concept. Results show that the
   X-Rotor has potential to reduce O\&M costs by up to 55\% and capital
   costs by up to 32\%. The combination of the capital cost and O\&M cost
   savings show potential to reduce the CoE by up to 26\%.},

Title = {Estimating spatial effects of anthropogenic heat emissions upon the
   urban thermal environment in an urban agglomeration area in East China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Various anthropogenic heat (AH) emissions that are mainly confined to
   urban areas have already changed the variability of urban climate. As a
   major human impact on our global environment, there is a lack of
   understanding regarding quantification, temporal, and geospatial impacts
   of AH over large areas. In this study, by using various remote sensing
   and socioeconomic data, we firstly attempt to quantify the spatial
   patterns of AH in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) agglomeration of East
   China. After that, we organized the agglomeration area into four types
   (city centre, developed areas, suburbs, and rural areas). We then
   analyse the temporal and spatial impacts on the urban thermal
   environment. The results show that: (1) The total amount of AH emissions
   in the YRD reached 8.19 x 10(18) J per year, with an uneven spatial
   distribution. There are profound differences in AH total and heat
   components for each city due to different socioeconomic backgrounds. (2)
   The correlation between AH distribution and the thermal environment are
   examined, and higher correlations are observed in the cities that
   generated large AH emissions. Seasonally, higher correlation exists in
   summer, while it is lower in winter. (3) The correlation between AH flux
   types and the thermal environment also varied for different human
   activity types. In the city centre, the thermal environment is related
   closely to AH fluxes from vehicular traffic; in developed areas there is
   a close relation to AH fluxes from life and tertiary industry; and in
   the suburbs it relates closely to AH emissions by industrial activity.
   Finally, we discussed the important regulatory effects of precipitation,
   vegetation and water bodies on AH fluxes. Overall, this study proved
   that the environmental impact of AH sections included herein clearly
   varies temporally and spatially, and suggest specific strategies for
   reducing the heat risk due to further urbanization.},

Abstract = {Underground coal gasification (UCG) using boreholes drilled from the
   surface has been feasible for almost a century, but is only now being
   implemented in market economies. Good analogues for the hydrogeological
   effects of UCG are provided by longwall mining. Careful planning of UCG
   void locations and dimensions can result in minimal disturbance of
   overlying aquifers as close as 40 m above the burn zone. Moreover,
   development of a pressure arch above the zone of net strata extension
   can provide a hydraulic seal to prevent vertical fluid migration.
   Injection of CO2 into former UCG voids ought to be possible where these
   are present at depths in excess of a parts per thousand 800 m. Analogies
   to longwall mining suggest that extensional deformation immediately
   above the burn zone will render sufficient pore space accessible to
   accommodate all of the CO2 arising from gasification. In the absence of
   adequate engineering, the boreholes used in the UCG-CCS processes
   represent the most likely leakage pathways for injected CO2. Hence
   high-quality borehole engineering will be required, taking full account
   of thermal performance of casing and grout, and geophysical testing of
   borehole integrity. An agenda for management of groundwater issues at
   all stages in the life-cycle of UCG and UCG-CCS has been developed, as
   an aide memoire for future developments.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the results of the design, fabrication,
   installation, and operation of a 20-kW OTEC (ocean thermal energy
   conversion) pilot plant. The results can be used as basic data for the
   design of commercial plants with capacities in excess of 40 MW. To
   perform an experiment on the 20 kW OTEC, a closed OTEC cycle was
   designed and fabricated at the Ocean Water Plant Research Center. The
   cycle utilizes surface ocean water as its heat source and deep ocean
   water as its heat sink. R32 (Difluoromethane, CH2F2) was used as the
   working fluid, and the temperature of the heat source and heat sink were
   26 degrees C and 5 degrees C, respectively. A semi-welded-type heat
   exchanger was used as the evaporator and condenser, and the OTEC cycle
   was designed for a gross power of 20 kW. The advantages of the
   semi-welded-type heat exchanger include easy maintenance of the
   gasket-type heat exchanger and the rare leakage of the welded-type heat
   exchanger. The plate arrangement of the semi-welded-type heat exchanger
   comprised one welded channel for the working fluid and another
   gasket-type channel. The gross power of the turbine was determined to be
   20.49 kW. The evaporating capacity was calculated as 1,020 kW, and the
   cycle efficiency was determined to be about 2.00\%.},

Abstract = {While performing various steps for exploration and exploitation of
   geothermal resources, the applications of geochemical methods are
   pivotal for reservoir characteristics evaluation. It is used
   concurrently with geological and hydro-geological appraisals to
   supplement available information regarding the prospectively of the
   region of investigation at the relatively low cost compared to
   geophysical methods or drilling. Temperature range of 40 degrees C to 47
   degrees C is demonstrated by the study area comprising of several
   thermal water manifestations. Studies from existing wells and surveys
   have suggested the presence of a sizable low enthalpy geothermal
   resource in the field. One of the most prominent uses of geochemical
   sampling is the determination of subsurface temperatures using
   Geothermometry. In this study, commonly accepted concepts of cationic
   and Silica Geothermometry have been applied to understand conditions in
   the reservoir. Interpretation of the data has given us some input on the
   reservoir characteristics like reservoir temperature, mixing process and
   multiple fluid origins. In Dholera geothermal field for determination of
   variation in hydrochemical facies and understanding of the advancement
   of the hydrochemical forms, the current research additionally imagines
   the significance of graphical portrayals like Piper chart, Scholler and
   so forth individually. The seawater intrudes the composition of water
   shows the reservoir. The physio-chemical properties of the water also
   influence exploitation strategies. Copyright (C) 2021, Guangzhou

Abstract = {The fouling of water side surfaces decreases the thermal effectiveness
   of the condenser and it is always one of operational focuses in
   coal-fired power plants. This study presents a comprehensive approach to
   realize the on-line fouling monitoring for the condenser in thermal
   power plants. Based on the operational mechanism and the coupling
   property, an all-condition mechanism model (ACMM) of coal-fired power
   plants is proposed to simulate coupling operating characters of systems.
   The simulation results of a 600 MW/16.7 MPa/560 degrees C/560 degrees C
   supercritical coal-fired power plant indicate that the model is of
   sufficient accuracy for performance calculations under different
   off-design conditions. An on-line fouling model of the condenser is
   presented according to simulation results of ACMM and on-line monitoring
   parameters from SIS system. For the fouling model, a correction as a
   function of the non-condensable gas is implemented to improve the
   accuracy of the condensation heat transfer resistance in the steam side
   of the condenser. The results of the on-line fouling monitoring in the
   field reveal that the fouling of the condenser increased with time and
   the fouling growth rates kept relative stable. Furthermore, this study
   also provided an alarm for the leakage fault in the condenser according
   to the abnormal fouling resistance tend. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Oriental Honey Buzzards (OHBs, Pernis ptilorhynchus) are migratory
   raptor that has been satellite-tracked since 2003. Some islands in
   Indonesia which are used for wintering habitat are Flores and Borneo.
   However, both islands have different characteristics of climate and land
   cover. The objectives of this research were to analyze the landscape
   characteristic of the OHBs wintering habitat in western Flores, and to
   subsequently compare landscape characteristic of the OHBs wintering
   habitat in Borneo. Landscape habitat characteristics were analyzed using
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with GIS and then compared
   to the previous study in Borneo Island. The result showed that the first
   of six principal components explained 79.14\% and 77.59\% of the
   observed variation in landscape characteristics of both core and edge
   habitats, subsequently. Habitat selection by OHBs at wintering site was
   influenced by the availability of thermal wind and food. Savannah was
   identified as the main landscape characteristic that was different
   between wintering habitat in Flores and Borneo. Savannah is well-known
   as a habitat for many species of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals
   so that it can be a hunting area that provide alternative feed for OHBs.},

Abstract = {Experimental and numerical studies on pressure drop in Reverse
   electrodialysis (RED) were performed. In this study, a module with 200
   unit cells is considered for the demonstration of bench-scale RED module
   and two different unit cell configurations are utilized. Pressure drop
   through the module is measured by varying flow rates. For evaluating the
   hydrodynamic characteristics in the unit cell, a numerical simulation is
   also conducted and the simplified method using a porous media model is
   employed to simulate the channel filled with spacer. Due to the
   insertion of spacer and narrow channel, great pressure loss occurs along
   the unit cell. Based on estimated pressure data, high pressure
   difference between seawater and fresh water channel takes place locally
   in the unit cell configuration with crossflow direction, leading to a
   leakage problem through the membrane and finally degradation in the
   output power. Consequently, it is confirmed that the unit cell
   configuration is one of the important design parameters in a RED module.},

Abstract = {A geochemical study of Cryogenian (late Neoproterozoic) limestones from
   western Mongolia is presented, including delta(13)C (carbonate and
   kerogen), delta(18)O, Sr-87/Sr-86 and rare earth element data. Carbon
   isotope compositions confirm the existence of anomalously high
   delta(13)C in Cryogenian seawater with delta(13)C(carb)>+10 parts per
   thousand. Positive delta(13)C excursions are explained conventionally by
   elevated rates of organic carbon burial. However, four additional
   factors appear likely to have contributed to delta(13)C excursions
   during the Cryogenian: (1) increased delta(13)C of carbon input
   (delta(i)) due to the exposure and weathering of carbonate platforms
   during sea-level falls, (2) increased carbon isotopic discrimination
   between carbonates and organic carbon (Deltadelta(13)C) due to microbial
   reworking of primary organic matter, (3) locally elevated delta(13)C in
   restricted basins and (4) enhanced vertical gradients in seawater
   delta(13)C due to redox stratification. All four factors may have
   contributed to similar positive delta(13)C excursions at other times,
   and may help to explain the almost ubiquitous association of custatic
   regression, and cooling, with high delta(13)C during the late
   Neoproterozoic and early Palaeozoic. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {With morphodynamic-numerical models the development of estuarine systems
   can be simulated for a period of several years. In areas exposed to high
   waves the effects from waves on the sediment dynamics can not be
   neglected. Especially if there are also currents acting on the
   sediments. In order to simulate these effects the
   hydrodynamic-morphodynamic-numerical-model TIMOR3 (TidalMorphodynamics)
   was coupled to the spectral wave model WWM (WindWaveModel). This
   coupling procedure enables calculations in both models on the same
   unstructured grid, which allows extremely efficient simulations.
   The coupled model is used in an estuarine system in southern Brazil. The
   outer navigation channel which leads to the port of Paranagua requires
   frequent maintenance dredging to guarantee safe navigational depths. The
   long shore tidal and wave induced currents in the area in conjunction
   with near shore high wave energy conditions cause turbulences that lead
   to a sediment transport along the beach and to permanent sedimentations
   in the navigation channel This complex system is simulated with the
   coupled model. The results as water levels, flow velocities and grain
   size distribution match well with measured values, nevertheless
   additional adjustments can be done to achieve even better results.
   With the coupled model it is possible to optimize the dredging and
   dumping process and to investigate the efficiency of building measures
   in the area.},

Abstract = {In 2010 Bryden, Ingram and Wallace applied to the UK Engineering and
   Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for funding to construct the
   all waters combined current and wave test facility. Funding was awarded
   and over the next three years the FloWave TT facility was constructed.
   At its heart is a 25m diameter, circular basin, equipped with 168 force
   feedback wave makers, 28 bidirectional impellers and a liftable floor.
   The 2m deep test section is designed to generate currents (at 0.8m/s)
   and 700mm high, 2s period, waves from any relative directions. Allowing
   a model to be subjected to scale tests over the full tidal ellipse
   simultaneously with multi-directional waves.
   Construction of the facility was completed in November 2013, and
   calibration is currently in progress. Initial work has shown that
   maximum flows of 2ms 1 can be achieved across the test section, while
   the circular wave maker array allows very large focused waves to be
   created.
   This paper describes the FloWave facility, its construction and
   commissioning and presents some preliminary results.},

Title = {The significance of ultra-refracted surface gravity waves on sheltered
   coasts, with application to San Francisco Bay},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {129-136},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Ocean surface gravity waves propagating over shallow bathymetry undergo
   spatial modification of propagation direction and energy density,
   commonly due to refraction and shoaling. If the bathymetric variations
   are significant the waves can undergo changes in their direction of
   propagation (relative to deepwater) greater than 90 degrees over
   relatively short spatial scales. We refer to this phenomenon as
   ultra-refraction. Ultra-refracted swell waves can have a powerful
   influence on coastal areas that otherwise appear to be sheltered from
   ocean waves. Through a numerical modeling investigation it is shown that
   San Francisco Bay, one of the earth's largest and most protected natural
   harbors, is vulnerable to ultra-refracted ocean waves, particularly
   southwest incident swell. The flux of wave energy into San Francisco Bay
   results from wave transformation due to the bathymetry and orientation
   of the large ebb tidal delta, and deep, narrow channel through the
   Golden Gate. For example, ultra-refracted swell waves play a critical
   role in the intermittent closure of the entrance to Crissy Field Marsh,
   a small restored tidal wetland located on the sheltered north-facing
   coast approximately 1.5 km east of the Golden Gate Bridge. (C) 2013

Abstract = {The mapping of faults provides essential information on many aspects of
   seismic exploration, characterisation of reservoirs for
   compartmentalisation and cap-rock integrity. However, manual
   interpretation of faults from seismic data is time-consuming and
   challenging due to limited resolution and seismic noise. In this study,
   we apply a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic seismic
   data with planar fault shapes to improve fault mapping in the Lower and
   Upper Cretaceous sections of the Valdemar Field in the Danish North Sea.
   Our objective is to evaluate the performance of the neural network model
   on post-stack seismic data from the Valdemar Field. Comparison with
   variance and ant-tracking attributes and a manual fault interpretation
   shows that the neural network predicts faults with more details that may
   improve the overall geological and tectonic understanding of the study
   area and add information on potential compartmentalisation that was
   previously overlooked. However, the neural network is sensitive to
   seismic noise, which can distort the fault predictions. Therefore, the
   proposed model should be treated as an additional fault interpretation
   tool. Nonetheless, the method represents a state-of-the-art fault
   mapping tool that can be useful for hydrocarbon exploration and CO2
   storage site evaluations.},

Abstract = {Fishing remains one of the largest factors modifying marine ecosystems.
   Because fisheries constitute only one of many anthropogenic effects,
   management is shifting from single-species approaches toward
   ecosystem-based management. Interaction webs are a Critical nexus to
   understand linkages, to model ecosystem change, and to apply management
   directives. Ecosystem-based management requires consideration of both
   direct and indirect effects of commercial fisheries. But it must also
   include impacts of bycatch, recreational fisheries, artisanal fisheries,
   and environmental change that can be large but unanticipated.
   Synergistic effects of fishing, environmental variation, and climate
   change increasingly threaten marine ecosystems and complicate
   management. Here we review the global effects of fisheries and propose
   an integrated framework for man aging biophysical processes and human
   ecology. To incorporate the multitude of effects, this emerging approach
   focuses on the dynamics of interaction webs in a spatially explicit or
   place-based framework.},

Abstract = {Background
   During a LIFE research project aiming at the implementation of the
   conservation of the habitats and restoration of coastal wetland areas of
   Praia da Vitoria (Terceira, Azores, Portugal), there was the opportunity
   undertake a systematic record of several groups of arthropods in three
   wetland areas: Paul da Praia da Vitoria (PPV), Paul do Belo Jardim (PBJ)
   and Paul da Pedreira do Cabo da Praia (PPCP). The objective of the study
   was to perform a rapid biodiversity assessment, comparing the three
   sites in two different years, before and after the implementation of
   several conservation measures. This project also contributed to improve
   the knowledge of Azorean arthropod diversity at both local and regional
   scales, including new taxa for Terceira island and new records for
   Azores. Taking into consideration those aims, a set of standardised
   sampling methods were performed, inspired by the COBRA protocol
   originally developed for spiders.
   New information
   A total of 15,810 specimens belonging to 216 arthropod species and
   subspecies were collected. Beetles (Insecta, Coleoptera) and spiders
   (Araneae) dominated, with 81 and 51 taxa, respectively. Two beetle
   families dominated, Staphylinidae and Curculionidae with, respectively,
   22 and 17 species and subspecies. Exotic species were also dominant (132
   species and subspecies), the Azorean endemics being restricted to only
   eight taxa. The remaining 76 species and subspecies are native
   non-endemic. Two rare endemic species were found with relatively
   sustainable populations, the Azores Cone-head Conocephalus chavesi
   (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae) and the true weevil Drouetius oceanicus
   oceanicus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae). A total of six species are novel
   for the Azores, five exotic (Bledius unicornis, Carpelimus zealandicus,
   Oenopia doublieri, Sitona hispidulus, Trichiusa immigrata) and one
   possibly native (Pyrrhocoris apterus). An additional 15 taxa are novel
   for Terceira island, ten exotic (Cheiracanthium mildei, Cylindroiulus
   latestriatus, Eumodicogryllus bordigalensis, Nemobius sylvestris,
   Pissodes castaneus, Psyllipsocus ramburi, Trachyzelotes lyonneti,
   Trigonnidium cicindeloides, Tychius cuprifer, Zelotes tenuis) and five
   native (Aegialia arenaria, Oxypoda lurida, Platycleis sabulosa,
   Plinthisus brevipennis, Tachyura diabrachys).},

Title = {Sub-inertial modulation of semi-diurnal currents over the continental

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Observations were made over the continental slope in the Faeroe-Shetland
   Channel with the purpose of studying motions in the semidiurnal tidal
   frequency band and their interaction with background conditions.
   Specifically, the study focused on internal (baroclinic) tidal motions
   associated with internal gravity waves. In the internal tide (IT) source
   region, kinetic energy spectra reveal a fall-off rate with frequency of
   sigma(-2) which is associated with the passage of strongly non-linear
   fronts at the sea-bed. At a distance of 10 kin off shore from the source
   region spectra from both the permanent pycnocline and weakly stratified
   interior exhibit a fall-off rate of sigma(-3), indicative of a regime in
   which internal waves are dominated by higher harmonics of the M,
   semidiurnal tidal frequency as a result of non-linear advection. The
   bandwidth, Delta sigma = 0.23-0.3 cycles per day (cpd) of the
   semidiurnal band determined from the distribution of baroclinic energy
   outside the deterministic tidal frequencies, implies a modulation period
   of 3.3-4.3 days and which is observed as pulses of semidiurnal energy
   that are not related to the spring-neap cycle. The period of modulation
   is related to changes in the background stratification and the
   low-frequency vorticity. Variations in stratification are sufficient to
   modify the IT path by > 150 m in the vertical over a horizontal distance
   of 10 km. The cross-slope gradient of the low-frequency (sigma < 0.75
   cpd) long-slope velocity, partial derivative V/partial derivative x,
   which represents one component of the vorticity varies with a
   periodicity of 3-4 days and has a magnitude sufficient to increase the
   effective Coriolis frequency to a value larger than M-2, so that the IT
   is unable to propagate as a free internal gravity wave. The source of
   the subinertial variability in the background conditions is attributed
   to meteorologically forced continental shelf waves which respond in two
   ways to prevailing winds and which perturb the preexisting geostrophic
   balance that exists over the slope; oscillatory, clockwise rotating
   currents with a frequency of 0.7 x f where f is the Coriolis frequency,
   result from short impulsive winds whilst a quasi-steady long-slope flow
   persists as long as stronger winds of longer duration prevail. The
   impact of the observed subinertial variability in low-frequency
   vorticity and stratification raises doubts as to whether an `attractor',
   along which internal wave energy is found following repeated reflections
   within a confined basin, may be observed in such a dynamic environment.

Abstract = {Durability and ecological effects of the stainless steel reinforced
   coral waste concrete were compared with those of the carbon steel
   reinforced ordinary concrete. The results showed that the corrosion
   current densities of the stainless steel in the coral waste concrete
   were less than one-tenth of those of the carbon steel in the same grade

   concrete maintained passivation even after more than two years of
   immersion in 3.5\% NaCl solution, while the carbon steel counterparts in
   the ordinary concrete were seriously corroded under the same condition.
   Simultaneously, the corrosion current density of the stainless steel
   reinforcement decreased slightly with the strength grade of the coral
   waste concrete. The ecological evaluation indicated that the
   non-renewable energy consumption and CO2 emission of per cubic meter of
   the newly constructed stainless steel reinforced coral waste concrete
   were 23.72\% and 1.419\% less than those of the carbon steel reinforced
   ordinary concrete with the same grade, while the aforementioned two

Title = {Impacts of coastal realignment on biodiversity. A systematic review and
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {48-62},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the context of climate change and sea-level rise, several types of
   management are employed, including coastal realignment, which consists
   in reopening polders to marine intrusions. This intervention induces
   changes in biodiversity. A systematic review, including a meta-analysis,
   was carried out to assess the impact of coastal realignment on
   biodiversity. 4 476 references of published and gray literature were
   collected from two publication databases, Google Scholar and specialist
   websites. After a screening process, a database of 255 relevant articles
   corresponding to 866 studies (one taxon in one site) was constructed.
   Qualitative data were extracted in order to identify knowledge gaps and
   clusters. Focusing on the 190 studies with a Before
   After-Reference-Intervention experimental design, the risk of bias in
   studies was assessed. Excluding studies with a high level of bias or
   with non-extractable data, quantitative data related to abundance and
   species richness were analyzed from 19 and 24 studies respectively.
   Study sites are mostly in the USA and the UK, but also in Canada and
   other European countries. Plants are the main group of taxa studied
   while mammals, amphibians and reptiles are rarely considered. Similarly,
   studies focus mainly on species richness and abundance but much less on
   structural and functional parameters. The species richness of
   invertebrates and the abundance of fishes and shorebirds seem to
   increase after realignment, whereas the species richness of plants
   decreases. No changes in the species richness of birds, fishes and
   macrocrustaceans, and in the abundance of birds, invertebrates,
   macrocrustaceans and plants, were found. More research on lesser studied
   taxa and parameters is encouraged to obtain a broad view on the subject
   and help with decision-making in coastal-realignment operations by
   providing them with comprehensive ecological arguments. In order to
   enhance the reliability and reusability of research in other synthesis
   projects, it is important that data reporting be improved. (C) 2022 The

Abstract = {Subject. Mortality rates remain high for the acute respiratory distress
   syndrome (ARDS) despite standardised treatment algorithms. Little is
   known about prognostic factors and exclusion criteria for advanced
   treatment including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
   Methods. In an observational study design a cohort of 93 patients with
   severe ARDS admitted to a referral centre were analysed according to
   ventilatory and vital parameters.
   Results. Overall survival rate was 70\% and in patients who received
   ECMO treatment it was 67\%. In patients exhibiting relevant co-morbidity
   the odds ratio for fatal outcome increased to 4:7 (95\% CI: 3.3-24.9),
   and patients with multiple organ failure had a 7.5-fold increase (95\%
   CI: 2.3-25.2) for risk of death. Survivors demonstrated a more
   pronounced improvement in oxygenation (p<0.05) and CO2 removal (p<0.05)
   than non-survivors.
   Conclusions. Advanced treatment of ARDS including ECMO represents a
   therapeutic option if none of the currently considered contraindications
   are present. An improvement in gas exchange parameters, but not a
   defined value per se may be useful as a prognostic factor for favourable
   outcome.},

Abstract = {Organic matter destruction in marine bottom sediments in the zone of the
   Congo River discharge (6 degrees south latitude) was studied during the

   Microbiological and biochemical investigations revealed the influence of
   the Congo River on decomposition processes both in littoral and deep-sea
   regions as far as the continental slope foot. Active anaerobic
   decomposition of organic matter was observed in reduced sediments of the
   shelf. Maximal rates of sulfate reduction (0.39 - 3.34 mg S/kg/day) and
   methane generation (0.15 - 0.58 x 10(-3) ml CH4/kg/day) were observed in
   the upper (0 - 20 cm) horizons of the sediments of this zone. Annual
   organic carbon consumption for sulfate reduction in this region was 49 x

Title = {Fast Cloud Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Networks},

Abstract = {Information about clouds is important for observing and predicting
   weather and climate as well as for generating and distributing solar
   power. Most existing approaches extract cloud information from satellite
   data by classifying individual pixels instead of using closely
   integrated spatial information, ignoring the fact that clouds are highly
   dynamic, spatially continuous entities. This paper proposes a novel
   cloud classification method based on deep learning. Relying on a
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image segmentation,
   the presented Cloud Segmentation CNN (CS-CNN), classifies all pixels of
   a scene simultaneously rather than individually. We show that CS-CNN can
   successfully process multispectral satellite data to classify continuous
   phenomena such as highly dynamic clouds. The proposed approach produces
   excellent results on Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite data in
   terms of quality, robustness, and runtime compared to other machine
   learning methods such as random forests. In particular, comparing CS-CNN
   with the CLAAS-2 cloud mask derived from MSG data shows high accuracy
   (0.94) and Heidke Skill Score (0.90) values. In contrast to a random
   forest, CS-CNN produces robust results and is insensitive to challenges
   created by coast lines and bright (sand) surface areas. Using GPU
   acceleration, CS-CNN requires only 25 ms of computation time for
   classification of images of Europe with 508 x 508 pixels.},

Title = {Variations in terrigenous dilution in western Mediterranean Sea pelagic

Abstract = {Hemipelagic intervals in four giant Calypso piston cores from the
   Balearic Abyssal Plain (western Mediterranean Sea) were studied in order
   to determine fluctuations in the supply of terrigenous sediments to the
   basin during the last 130,000 years and possible climatic modulation of
   terrigenous sediment and particle flux. Carbonate records from
   hemipelagic intervals in these cores display distinct `Atlantic' type
   cycles, where glacial periods show, on average, 20\% lower calcium
   carbonate contents than interglacial period equivalents. The decrease in
   calcium carbonate seen during glacials may be the result of increased
   dilution by terrigenous (aeolian and fluvial) particles derived from
   aeolian and/or fluvial sources. Higher glacial aeolian particle fluxes
   to the western Mediterranean Sea may have been caused by changes in the
   prevailing atmospheric conditions, resulting in drier and colder
   climatic conditions in the source areas and more frequent and intense
   outbreaks of dust transport. The colder and drier climatic conditions in
   combination with a lowered sea level would allow rivers to dump their
   sediment load closer to the shelf edge, promoting enhanced fluvial input
   into the basin. Besides significant calcium carbonate variations that
   correlate with glacial/interglacial cycles, several short-term abrupt
   changes in the calcium carbonate content are recorded, which appear
   coincident with enhanced magnetic susceptibility values, especially the
   events within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The timing of these
   short-term events may be linked with cooling events in the North
   Atlantic, particularly Heinrich Events and cold events within MIS 5.
   These short-term trends may possibly be explained by increased
   terrigenous particle transport, due to drier and colder climate in the
   Mediterranean borderlands. Our results further show that about 90\% of
   the sedimentary sequence of the Balearic Abyssal Plain consists of
   turbidites. Generally, these appear not to have caused significant
   erosion, and an almost complete continuous time stratigraphy is present
   in the intercalated hemipelagic intervals. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {MISSISSIPPIAN PELMATOZOAN COMMUNITY REORGANIZATION - A
   PREDATION-MEDIATED FAUNAL CHANGE},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {400-410},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Crinoid genera of the subclass Camerata generally dominated Late
   Silurian through Middle Mississippian pelmatozoan echinoderm
   assemblages.  This dominance reached a peak during the early and middle
   Mississippian (Kinderhookian-Meramecian), but abruptly ended at the
   close of the Genevievian Stage (= lowermost Chesterian) in eastern North
   America.  During the Genevievian Stage, crinoids of the subclass
   Inadunata became taxonomically more diverse but a few camerates,
   especially Platycrinites and Batocrinus, continued to be numerically
   dominant in many pelmatozoan assemblages.  In eastern North America,
   platycrinids and batocrinids were reduced drastically near the
   Genevievian-Gasperian boundary.  So obvious is this faunal change that,
   until recently, the Meramecian-Chesterian Series boundary was recognized
   as the last occurrence of Platycrinites penicillus.  The sudden and
   drastic decline of numerically dominant platycrinids and batocrinids in
   eastern North America suggests a mass extinction, but is better
   interpreted as a range contraction and loss of dominance.  Platycrinids,
   in particular, continued to be significant components of pelmatozoan
   assemblages in Europe and Asia long after the end of the Genevievian
   Stage.  We infer that this reorganization of pelmatozoan assemblages in
   eastern North America was a product of predation, siliciclastic
   tolerance, and current-energy preference, with predation playing a major
   role.  Reorganization resulted in post-Genevievian dominance by (1)
   cladid crinoids, (2) camerate crinoids that were cladid homeomorphs, and
   (3) the blastoid Pentremites.  Foraminifera, conodonts, corals,
   brachiopods, bryozoans, and other echinoderm groups were affected
   little, if any, during this same time.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of seaweed extract (SWE) made from
   the brown algae Durvillaea potatorum and Ascophyllum nodosum on plants
   and soil. The application of SWE to soil growing tomato plants showed
   dual effects. SWE comprehensively improved tomato plant growth (flower
   clusters, flower number, fruit number, root length, root and shoot dry
   weight, SPAD) and increased plant productivity (yield and quality).
   Similarly, SWE application effected soil biology at the soil root zone
   by increasing total bacterial count and available soil nitrogen and
   impacting bacterial community diversity with an increase in certain
   bacterial families linked to soil health. A broader understanding of the
   effects of SWE on the plant-soil ecosystem may offer breakthrough
   approaches for sustainable food production.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the heave-plate effects on the behavior
   of a multi-unit floating offshore wind turbine (MUFOWT). The global
   performance of the large-scale, square-shape, semi-submersible floating
   platform equipped with 4 wind turbines at each corner, and 24 wave
   energy converters on frames along near-waterline is numerically
   simulated in time domain by using the in-house turbine floater-mooring
   fully-coupled dynamic analysis program, MUFOWT. Cases with and without
   heave plates are systematically compared to identify the role of heave
   plates. For verification, an independent 1/50-scaled experiment was
   conducted by authors in the Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean
   Engineering's (KRISO) 3D wave basin. The numerical results with heave
   plates are extensively compared against the physical model-test results.
   Finally, the global performance results under survival-storm conditions,
   in which the WECs and blades of wind turbines are fixed, with and
   without heave plates are systematically investigated. The findings
   indicate that the heave plates are effective in reducing heave and pitch
   motions, and shift their natural frequencies with a minimal increase of
   mass. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the worsening of the global environment and the strengthening of
   people's awareness of environmental protection, the air pollution caused
   by the exhaust emissions of marine diesel engines has attracted
   extensive attention from the international community. Because the
   exhaust post-treatment technology does not need to be reformed for
   diesel engine, and the quality requirement of fuel is relatively low,
   domestic and foreign research and development institutions all attach
   great importance to the research of exhaust post-treatment technology.
   By analyzing the mechanism and main chemical reaction of SCR reaction,
   the overall design scheme of marine diesel engine exhaust intelligent
   emission reduction control system was completed in order to reduce the
   nitrogen oxides and solid particles in the exhaust of marine diesel
   engine. According to TierIII emission regulation and marine diesel
   engine exhaust, the hardware structure design and model selection of
   marine diesel engine exhaust intelligent emission control system are
   completed. In order to ensure that the emission of the control system
   can meet the requirements of nitrogen oxide conversion rate and ammonia
   gas escape quantity at the same time, the corresponding model prediction
   algorithm is designed in this paper. Through the analysis of
   experimental results, it is proved that the control system established
   in this paper can well meet the emission requirements of TierIII
   regulations. The research content of this paper can be applied in the
   field of shipping to meet the requirements of TierIII regulations and
   prepare for more stringent emission regulations.},

Title = {Design of a new point absorber with a fully submerged toroidal shape},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {191},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {A new point absorber, equipped with a fully submerged toroidal shape, is
   designed to increase the power production of the WEC device, by properly
   matching the heave natural period of the floating buoy with the
   prevailing sea states at the deployment site. A non-linear time-domain
   model is developed and applied to assess the Annualised Energy
   Production and perform the strength check of the tensioned line,
   connecting the floating buoy to the Power Take-Off unit, lying on the
   seabed. Two candidate deployment sites, located in the Mediterranean Sea
   and in the Atlantic Ocean, are chosen for the possible deployment of a
   wave farm and the toroidal shape main dimensions are selected
   accordingly. Hence, a comparative analysis between a reference point
   absorber, consisting of a floating hemispherical buoy, and the new WEC
   device is performed to investigate the incidence of the proposed layout
   on the Annualised Energy Production. Finally, both Ultimate and Fatigue
   Limit State criteria are embodied for the strength check of the
   connection line. The new layout allows properly tuning the device heave
   natural period and increasing up to 60\% the Annualised Energy
   Production, as regards the reference configuration, so making the marine
   energy more competitive on the international market.},

Title = {The role of predictive model data in designing mangrove forest carbon
   programs},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Estimating baseline carbon stocks is a key step in designing forest
   carbon programs. While field inventories are resource-demanding,
   advances in predictive modeling are now providing globally coterminous
   datasets of carbon stocks at high spatial resolutions that may meet this
   data need. However, it remains unknown how well baseline carbon stock
   estimates derived from model data compare against conventional
   estimation approaches such as field inventories. Furthermore, it is
   unclear whether site-level management actions can be designed using
   predictive model data in place of field measurements. We examined these
   issues for the case of mangroves, which are among the most carbon dense
   ecosystems globally and are popular candidates for forest carbon
   programs. We compared baseline carbon stock estimates derived from
   predictive model outputs against estimates produced using the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) three-tier
   methodological guidelines. We found that the predictive model estimates
   out-performed the IPCC's Tier 1 estimation approaches but were
   significantly different from estimates based on field inventories. Our
   findings help inform the use of predictive model data for designing
   mangrove forest policy and management actions.},

Abstract = {This work reviews hydrodynamic analysis models developed for the design
   of Darrieus-type vertical axis marine current turbines, with particular
   emphasis on the prediction of hydrodynamic rotor performance, as well as
   their suitability for aiding the optimization process, either directly,
   or as a fast filter of potential blade profiles.
   In order to improve the performance of a marine current turbine it is
   necessary accurately to model the flow passing the turbine's blades.
   Several types of models exist for Darrieus-type turbines, from
   momentum-based streamtube models to complex computational fluids
   dynamics (CFD) simulations. With continuously varying large angles of
   attack on the blades, the main issue is accurate prediction of the flow
   field around the rotor and thus its loads and torque. This is further
   complicated by the significant inherent unsteady hydrodynamic
   characteristics and potential for dynamic stall. Comparisons of the
   analytical results with experimental data are presented to compare these
   different models and thus illustrate their areas of suitability in this
   context. In conclusion, vertical axis machines have the potential of
   high power capture compared with that of their horizontal counterparts
   but this will depend on blade profile and design configuration,
   solidity, and tip speed ratio. None of the existing theoretical methods
   really captures the actual performance of the machines except for
   detailed CFD simulations, which are inevitably computational time
   intensive.},

Title = {Increasing fluctuations of soil salinity affect seedling growth
   performances and physiology in three Neotropical mangrove species},
Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {380},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {399-413},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Micro-tidal wetlands are subject to strong seasonal variations of soil
   salinity that are likely to increase in amplitude according to climate
   model predictions for the Caribbean. Whereas the effects of constant
   salinity levels on the physiology of mangrove species have been widely
   tested, little is known about acclimation to fluctuations in salinity.
   The aim of this experiment was to characterize the consequences of the
   rate of increase in salinity (slow versus fast) and salinity
   fluctuations over time versus constant salt level. Seedling mortality,
   growth, and leaf gas exchange of three mangrove species, Avicennia
   germinans, Laguncularia racemosa, and Rhizophora mangle were
   investigated in semicontrolled conditions at different salt levels (0,
   685, 1025, and 1370 mM NaCl).
   Slow salinity increase up to 685 mM induced acclimation, improving the
   salt tolerance of A. germinans and L. racemosa, but had no effect on R.
   mangle. During fluctuations between 0 and 685 mM, A. germinans and R.
   mangle were not affected by a salinity drop to zero, whereas L. racemosa
   took advantage of the brief freshwater episode as shown by the durable
   improvement of photosynthesis and biomass production.
   This study provides new insights into physiological resistance and
   acclimation to salt stress. We show that seasonal variations of salinity
   may affect mangrove seedlings' morphology and physiology as much as
   annual mean salinity. Moreover, more severe dry seasons due to climate
   change may impact tree stature and species composition in mangroves
   through higher mortality rates and physiological disturbance at the
   seedling stage.},

Title = {Methane Hydrate in Marine Sands: Its Reservoir Properties, Gas
   Production Behaviors, and Enhanced Recovery Methods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},

Pages = {113-122},
Abstract = {Since the discovery of methane hydrate in marine sands in 1999, our
   understanding of methane-hydrate-bearing sediments has progressed
   rapidly. Comprehensive studies of methane hydrate deposits in the Nankai
   Trough have made a great contribution to this research. Reservoir
   evaluation combining geophysical logging with pressure core analysis has
   become the standard protocol for exploring methane-hydrate-bearing
   sands, revealing that the effective permeability of
   methane-hydrate-bearing sands lies in the range of 1-100 md, even if the
   hydrate saturation reaches high value of 50-80 \% in pores. Numerical
   and experimental studies of gas production have demonstrated that fluid
   flow and heat transfer are key rate-determining factors for field-scale
   depressurization-induced gas production. In that sense, the high
   permeability of methane-hydrate-bearing sands indicates the
   applicability of depressurization as a primary gas production method;
   however, a lack of heat limits hydrate dissociation and thus the
   recovery factor cannot exceed approximately 40 \%. Thus, enhanced
   recovery methods are necessary to increase viability of
   commercialization. Experimental and numerical studies have shown that
   hydraulic fracturing enhances production rate, and that cyclic
   depressurization assisted by geothermal and deep depressurization using
   the latent heat of ice formation are possible means by which the
   enhancement of the recovery factor can be achieved while maintaining
   energy efficient production.},

Abstract = {This review paper selects key result, from electromagnetic induction
   studies of a variety of distinctive tectonic phenomena in the top 200 km

   for an understanding of tectonism involving partial melting, recycling
   of large volumes of fluids (CO2 and H2O) and underthrusting of
   metasedimentary rocks. The wide variety of tectonic regimes in which
   these processes are known to be important is reflected in the choice of
   case studies. A discussion of conductivity models for young oceanic
   lithosphere and asthenosphere is followed by results from induction
   studies across the S.E. Australian passive margin. The North American
   active margin, the Ryukyu Island-Arc and the Oregon Cascades continental
   arc. The importance of partial melting and free fluid movement i
   apparent in these regions. Terrain accretion and/or continent-continent
   collisions recorded at palaeosuture zones in Ireland. Germany and
   Scandinavia have left distinctive conductivity structures. These are
   often associated with grain-boundary graphite either in
   weakly-metamorphosed black shales in underthrust sedimentary basins or
   precipitated from CO2-rich fluids. They are discussed in the context of
   the evolution of mature continental crust. All of the case studies are
   based on experiments published since 1989 in which the electromagnetic
   results have been central to an integrated geophysical and geological

Abstract = {Combustion experiment for pellets of sewage sludge and woody biomass
   blend was conducted in a pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed combustor
   (CFBC) consisting of the riser, two hot cyclones and a loop-seal to
   reduce pollutant emission in exhausted flue gas. To achieve them, the
   effect of the oxidant variations, such as superficial velocity,
   equivalence ratio(ER: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4) and combustion atmosphere
   (air-fired and oxy-fired) was evaluated. As pollutant emissions in flue
   gas, SO2, NO, CO, CO2, HCl, odor contaminants and leaching behavior of
   heavy metals were analyzed. As a result, to stably operate combustion of
   pellet mixed with sewage sludge and woody biomass as alternative
   renewable fuel in a CFBC system, the superficial velocity in the riser
   had to be kept under 6 m/s and the equivalence ratio was proper around
   1.3-1.4. All odor contaminants formed at these operating conditions met
   the domestic air pollutant standards. Heavy metals in fly ash met the
   environment ministry's standard. Additionally, compared to air-firing,
   SO2, NO and CO as precursors of fine particles during oxy-firing were
   reduced by 70.8, 77.1 and 38.2\%, respectively.},

Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Hibiscus hamabo Sieb.et Zucc, a deciduous shrub or tree, is an important
   semi-mangrove plant with golden yellow flowers. The plant is also
   cultivated for its fiber and grown as an ornamental. It is halophytic
   and considered one of the best afforestation trees used in reclamation
   programs in urban and coastal areas high in salt content. However, very
   little work has been done on its genetics; therefore, this study was
   undertaken to determine the genome size, the chromosome numbers, and
   rDNA (18S rDNA and 5S rDNA) loci in H. hamabo using flow cytometry,
   protoplast spread technique, and oligonucleotide fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH), respectively. H. hamabo was found to have a
   2C-value of 4.06 +/- 0.08 pg (3973.08 +/- 78.90 Mbp) and a chromosome
   number of 2n = 92. We observed four 18S loci and one 5S rDNA locus on
   five different pairs of homologous chromosomes. The observed FISH signal
   intensities for the 18S rDNA varied from chromosome to chromosome,

Title = {Local ecological knowledge of recreational fishers reveals different

Abstract = {Marine recreational fishers accumulate a vast amount of local ecological
   knowledge (LEK) during their fishing activity that can be of paramount
   importance for monitoring how climate change affects fish assemblages.
   We assessed LEK of recreational fishers to investigate the increase in
   the abundance of 5 northward-expanding indigenous thermophilic fish
   species in 2 Mediterranean subregions. We accessed LEK through an online
   survey completed by 794 recreational fishers (386 from the
   Adriatic/Ionian subregion and 408 from the Tyrrhenian/Ligurian
   subregion). The species perceived to have increased most in abundance
   were Pomatomus saltatrix (71\% of replies) followed by Sphyraena
   viridensis (58\%). The remaining species (Sparisoma cretense, Balistes
   capriscus and Coryphaena hippurus) ranged between 17 and 25\%.
   Recreational fishers have a stable system of beliefs about
   meridionalization, which is perceived homogeneously between recreational
   anglers and recreational spearfishers. Our results indicate that
   latitude is negatively correlated with meridionalization in the
   Adriatic/Ionian, but not in the Tyrrhenian/Ligurian Seas, suggesting
   that meridionalization of the Adriatic/Ionian Seas could be a process
   that has temporally lagged with respect to the Tyrrhenian/Ligurian Seas.
   Our study demonstrates that LEK of recreational fishers can be easily
   accessed on a large geographical scale and can be useful to monitor
   changes in the distributions of data-limited species such as those
   studied here.},

Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Pages = {394-413},
Abstract = {The open coast of Victoria, Australia, is one of the highest wave energy
   coastlines globally. Despite this, a lack of permanently deployed wave
   buoys has limited prior analysis of wave conditions. In this study, the
   wave climate of Victoria was analysed using 31 years of directional data
   hindcast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
   WaveWatch-III model (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis hindcasts). An
   eastward decrease in wave height and period occurs from Portland to
   Wilson's Promontory. This trend then reverses on the east coast. Across
   the west and central coasts, wave direction is dominated by south-west
   swells as influenced by strong westerly winds and mid-latitude
   low-pressure systems. On the east coast, wave direction becomes more
   variable, with added southerly, south-east and easterly components. The
   Southern Annular Mode influences wave climate variability on the west
   coast and is negatively correlated with storm frequency and wave
   direction. On the east coast, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation showed a
   strong positive correlation with wave height and a negative correlation
   with direction. This work provides a benchmark to compare to future
   changes. It will inform a higher-resolution analysis of the spatial
   correlation of wave conditions with climate processes to predict
   shoreline response.},

Note = {International Sandy Beach Symposium, Ilhabela, BRAZIL, SEP 07, 2015},
Abstract = {Sandy beaches are dynamic ecosystems with strong interaction of
   sediments, waves and tidal energy, with marked effects on benthic
   assemblages. Although there are numerous efforts in understanding
   spatial-temporal variation of benthic macrofauna on sandy beaches along
   the southern and southeastern Marine Ecoregions in Brazil, there is poor
   sampling along beaches of the Eastern Marine Ecoregion (EME). Here we
   examined spatial and temporal scales of variability in benthic
   macrofauna (> 500 mu m) through a hierarchical sampling of two
   dissipative sandy beaches within the EME between two seasons (winter
   2011 and summer 2012). We tested the hypothesis that spatial changes
   (i.e., meters to hundreds of meters scales) in the structure of benthic
   assemblages will be more pronounced compared to the weak seasonal
   fluctuations at this tropical region. We found weak temporal and spatial
   changes in sediment grain size and beach slope, but differences in
   macrofaunal assemblages were evident. Contrary to our hypothesis,
   hierarchical sampling indicated significant changes in macrofaunal
   composition and density at multiple local scales (meters to hundreds of
   meters) and on seasonal scales. The macrofauna density and composition
   was directly related to changes on the sediment organic matter and grain
   size.},

Title = {Periplatform ooze in a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system - Vaca
   Muerta Formation, Argentina},
Journal = {SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {396},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Thick carbonate mud successions and marl/limestone alternations are
   often found in periplatform environments. The sources of these
   fine-grained sediments and the processes that govern their accumulation
   and distribution in the basin are frequently a matter of debate. This
   case study from a mixed silicidastic-carbonate succession in the Neuquen
   Basin, Argentina, relates the origin of the carbonate-dominated
   intervals to shelfal carbonate production. The Tithonian-early
   Valanginian basinal strata (Vaca Muerta Formation) contains several
   carbonate-rich intervals at different stratigraphic levels. The thickest
   of these intervals is the mid-late Tithonian Los Catutos Member in
   Sierra de la Vaca Muerta. This wedge-shaped package of micritic
   limestones and intercalated marls thins basinwards. Proximal-distal
   variations and cyclic partitioning in fades and geochemical proxies
   indicate highstand shedding and a periplatform origin for the Los
   Catutos Member. The proposed source is a coeval 20 m-thick pure
   carbonate interval located 50 km south of the Sierra de la Vaca Muerta
   within the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate shelf fades of the Picun Leufu
   Formation. Younger carbonate-rich intervals in the center of the basin
   (Puerta Curaco area) show similar characteristics to the distal portion
   of the Los Catutos Member and are also interpreted as periplatform
   deposits but sourced from carbonate shelves farther east. The high
   sedimentation rates of the Los Catutos Member require an efficient
   mechanism, other than tides and winds, to deliver significant amounts of
   fine-grained carbonate sediment to the basin. This mechanism is
   envisioned to be sediment-charged hyperpycnal flows cascading from the
   platform to the basin, analogous to what is observed in modern carbonate
   systems. The occurrence of periplatform ooze in different stratigraphic
   levels of the siliciclastic-dominated Vaca Muerta Formation demonstrates
   that off-shelf transport and distribution of carbonate mud in the basin
   are also common processes in mixed clastic-carbonate environments. (C)

Abstract = {The identification of species-rich areas and their prognosticated
   turnover under climate change are crucial for the conservation of
   endemic taxa. This study aims to identify areas of reptile endemicity
   richness in a global biodiversity hot spot (Morocco) under current and
   future climatic conditions and to investigate the role of protected
   areas in biodiversity conservation under climate change. Species
   distribution models (SDM) were performed over the distribution of 21
   endemic reptiles, combined to estimate current species richness at 1 x 1
   km resolution and projected to years 2050 and 2080 according to distinct
   story lines and ensemble global circulation models, assuming unlimited
   and null dispersion ability. Generalized additive models were performed
   between species richness and geographic characteristics of 43 protected
   areas. SDM found precipitation as the most important factor related to
   current species distributions. Important reductions in future suitable
   areas were predicted for 50 \% of species, and four species were
   identified as highly vulnerable to extinction. Drastic reductions in
   species-rich areas were predicted for the future, with considerable
   variability between years and dispersal scenarios. High turnover rates
   of species composition were predicted for eastern Morocco, whereas low
   values were forecasted for the Northern Atlantic coast and mountains.
   Species richness for current and future conditions was significantly
   related to the altitude and latitude of protected areas. Protected areas
   located in mountains and/or in the Northern Atlantic coast were
   identified as refugia, where population monitoring and conservation
   management is needed.},

   in the plant-herbivore literature, but relatively little consideration
   has been given to avoidances external to the plant. We develop a
   conceptual framework of external plant avoidances of herbivory based on
   foraging selection impedances (associational avoidances), behavioral
   impedances (indirect avoidances), and physical impedances (refuges)
   organized along axes of efficiency, degree of protection, and necessity
   of tolerance characteristics. Associational avoidances are uncommon for
   terrestrial mammalian herbivores compared to plant-insect or marine
   situations. Indirect avoidances mediated through herbivore
   territoriality, predator avoidance, and other behaviors independent of
   foraging decisions are probably common in nature. but few have been
   formally documented. Biotic and geologic refuges providing a physical
   impedance are the only avoidances shown to have implications for plant
   biodiversity. This is particularly true for geologic refuges, where
   there is not a tradeoff between competition and the refuge effect. Small
   geologic refuges (rock outcrops, cliffs, etc.) are more likely to also
   positively or negatively alter associated plant microenvironments than
   large geologic refuges (mesas, islands, etc.). In a survey. 86\% of
   small refuge studies reported positive effects on plant diversity
   compared to 50\% for large refuges. Geologic refuges in more productive
   environments were more important in protecting diversity than refuges in
   less productive, semiarid environments. and the effects of protection
   were greater in communities with short compared to long evolutionary
   histories of grazing. Other characteristics of refuges such as extent
   across the landscape and the manner they alter or ameliorate the
   environment, as well as characteristics of the herbivore such as small
   or large, generalist or specialist may also determine the effectiveness
   of refuges, but there are too few Studies to assess these factors.},

Title = {Plant growth of Atriplex portulacoides affected by irrigation amount and
   substrate type in an extensive green roof system},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {165},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Extensive green roofs in coastal areas planted with halophytes can
   contribute to the species preservation of local salt marshes that are
   being destroyed and threatened by urban development and enhance the
   local landscape character of coastal areas. Additional, benefits of
   halophytes include drought tolerance and the ability to withstand saline
   conditions in coastal areas. Herein the plant growth of A. portulacoides
   a native Mediterranean halophyte established on an extensive green roof
   system that received the effects of two irrigation water amounts (100\%
   ET0 and 75\% ET0) defined by substrate hydraulic properties and three
   substrate types are presented. The duration of the experiment was 285
   days. The substrates contained soil (S), pumice (Pum), pure sphagnum
   peat (P) and/or grape marc compost (C) in different volume ratios
   (15S:70Pum:15P, 15S:70Pum:15C and 15S:70Pum:7.5C:7.5P). The height,
   shoot canopy diameter, growth index, and ground cover percentage of
   plants were measured at regular intervals, and at the end of the
   experiment, both shoot and root dry weights were also measured. It was
   found that irrespective of substrate type, plant growth of A.
   portulacoides was healthy and similar in size for both irrigation
   treatments therefore with an aim to conserve water, the use of the 75\%
   ET0 irrigation treatment is proposed. The use of grape marc compost in
   the substrate (15S:70Pum:15C) is also proposed as it improved the
   substrate?s nutrient content increasing most of the measured plant
   growth parameters of A. portulacoides. The use of grape marc compost as
   an alternative organic material to peat in green roof substrates would
   also contribute to the preservation of wetlands.},

Title = {Using Radiocarbon to Assess the Abundance, Distribution, and Nature of
   Labile Organic Carbon in Marine Sediments},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Positive C-14 gradients have recently been observed within the surface
   mixed layer of several continental-margin sediments. The best
   explanation for these positive C-14 gradients is the occurrence and
   rapid degradation of labile organic carbon (LOC) in the upper 5-10 cm of
   the seabed. Based on a two-component model for sedimentary organic
   matter (i.e., a planktonic labile component and an older refractory
   component), bulk (14)Corg data were used to determine the abundances of
   LOC within the surface mixed layers of three cores from the West
   Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) shelf and one core from San Clemente Basin
   (California Borderland). LOC contents in surface samples from the four
   stations varied from 0.5 to 1.1 mg/cm(3), comprising 20\% (San Clemente
   Basin) to 80\% (WAP, Sta. G) of the total organic carbon. By
   incorporating a steady state diagenetic model and particle-mixing
   bioturbation coefficients, the LOC profiles were used to determine LOC
   turnover times (LOC tau) and LOC e-folding depths. The LOC tau values
   for the West Antarctic Peninsula sediments varied from 0.09 to 0.59
   years, whereas the LOC tau value from the San Clemente Basin core was 63
   years. The LOC e-folding depths for the WAP stations varied from 0.8 to
   3.4 cm, in contrast to the LOC e-folding depth in San Clemente Basin,
   which was 4.0 cm. LOC characteristics from the four cores examined in
   this study were compared to LOC data in the literature as a means of
   substantiating the overall C-14(org)-based approach and justifying model
   assumptions.},

Title = {Glacial water mass structure and rapid delta O-18 and delta C-13 changes

Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {456},
Pages = {87-97},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Changes in ocean circulation are thought to have contributed to lowering
   glacial atmospheric CO2 levels by enhancing deep ocean sequestration of
   carbon that was returned to the atmosphere during glacial terminations.
   High-resolution benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 and delta O-18 records
   from a depth transect of cores in the Southwest Pacific Ocean presented
   here provide evidence that both wind- and thermohaline-driven
   circulation drove CO2 from the ocean during the last deglaciation.
   Shallow geochemical stratification in the glacial Southern Ocean was
   followed by a short pulse of rapid delta C-13 enrichment to intermediate
   water depths during Heinrich Stadial 1, indicative of better-ventilated
   intermediate waters co-occurring with documented wind-driven upwelling
   in the Southern Ocean. Intermediate depth delta C-13 enrichment paused
   at the start of the Antarctic Cold Reversal (similar to 14.7 ka),
   implying a brief shallow restratification, while deeper layers were
   progressively flushed of delta C-13-depleted and delta O-18-enriched
   waters, likely caused by the increasing influence of deep waters sourced
   from the North Atlantic. The coincidence of atmospheric CO2 increases
   with these geochemical shifts in both shallow and deep cores suggests
   that shifts in both atmospheric and oceanic circulation contributed to
   the deglacial rise of CO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Between 1937 and 1995 a complex of more than 100 interdunal wetlands
   disappeared from Great Sand Dunes National Monument, Colorado. We
   investigated three hypotheses that could explain Welland disappearance:
   (1) dune movement during a severe drought in the 1950s buried the
   wetlands, (2) agriculture related ground water pumping lowered the
   regional water table, and (3) changes in local hydrologic processes led
   to wetland loss. We used regional stream flow records, ground water
   level measurements, natural stable isotope analyses, soil stratigraphy,
   buried seed banks, and ground water modeling to address these
   hypotheses.
   Hydrologic data and stable isotope analyses illustrated the interaction
   between Sand Creek, a nearby stream, and the unconfined aquifer in the
   area where wetlands occurred. When the intermittent Sand Creek flows,
   seepage through its bed creates a large ground water mound under the
   creek. The seasonal development and dispersion of this mound propagates
   pressure waves through the aquifer that influence ground water levels up
   to 2 km from Sand Creek. Our data suggest the primary factors
   contributing to wetland disappearance were recent climatic fluctuations
   and incision of the Sand Creek channel. Below average stream flow
   between 1950 and 1980 reduced the duration of Sand Creek flow across the
   dune complex, minimizing ground water mound development. Consequently,
   the water table in the unconfined aquifer dropped similar to 1.0 m and
   interdunal wetlands dried up. Twentieth Century incision of Sand Creek's
   channel reduced ground water mound height similar to 2.5 m, decreasing
   seasonal water table fluctuations at interdunal wetlands and
   contributing to the overall water table decline. Longterm wet and dry
   cycles affect the water table elevation more than channel incision,
   leading us to conclude that many interdunal wetlands are ephemeral
   features. Wetland area is maximized during consecutive years of above
   average Sand Creek discharge and minimized as the water table drops
   during dry periods. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to design a solar power boat with the
   aim to determine the size of photovoltaic (PV) system with minimum cost.
   Two stages optimization procedures have been proposed. First stage is a
   simplified ship size optimization based on the existing ship design for
   obtaining minimum propulsion power by using Golden search section
   algorithm. Second stage is optimization of PV system size for obtaining
   the number of photovoltaic (PV) module and battery with minimum cost by
   using Simplex algorithm. A leisure passenger catamaran boat operated in
   Taiwan with 42 person capacity is chosen as a case study. The service
   speed of the boat is 5 knots with total duration of cruising around 5
   hours. 280 watt Multi-crystalline PV module and 12 volt 90 Ah Lead-Acid
   Battery is chosen for this case. From the simulation, it is obtained
   that the optimal ship has 32 PV modules (8.96 kW), 32 batteries (34.56
   kWh), 14.44 meter length of water line, 4.37 meter breadth, 0.852 meter
   draught, and 16.258 ton of total displacement with the PV system annual
   capital cost around USD3,557. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Although ethnography has played an important role in the development of
   archaeological theory and method, it is limited by the short time-scales
   employed and the lack of attention to material culture. Historical
   studies of museum collections can help overcome these difficulties. By
   monitoring changes in the efficiency of production of Admiralty Island
   spears and daggers over the past 120 years, one can observe the effects
   of economic transformation from noncommercial, reciprocal exchange
   through to modern day market trading. Contrary to predictions, changes
   in raw material inputs, craftsmanship, simplification and
   standardization are not all unidirectional. The results of the
   case-study indicate that efficiency is a good indicator of exchange
   type, but archaeologists also need to understand the specific cultural
   contexts that shape the particular consumer demands.},

Title = {Metals in sediments and their accumulation in Zostera japonica in
   different sediment habitats of the Yellow River estuary},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Purpose This research aims to study the ecological risk of metals to
   Zostera japonica and focuses on two typical sediment environments in the
   Yellow River estuary, namely, sediment erosion and deposition areas.
   Materials and methods Two different sediment habitats of Z. japonica
   were selected in this research from southern and northern sites in the
   Yellow River estuary. The plant growth and nutrient and metal
   concentrations in the sediments and Z. japonica tissue were investigated
   in the growth period of Z. japonica from April to October 2019. The
   shoot height of Z. japonica was measured with a centimetre-scale
   measuring stick, and the dry shoot weight was obtained after drying at
   70 degrees C for 24 h. The total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN)
   concentrations in the Z. japonica tissue and sediment were determined
   with an elemental analyser (Vario Macro Cube, Elementar Company,
   Germany). The total phosphorus (TP), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper
   (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and cadmium (Cd) contents in
   the digested solutions were measured by high-resolution inductively
   coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (HR-ICP-AES, Spectro
   Company, Germany). Results and discussion The growth of Z. japonica was
   different at the two study sites, with a higher biomass at the southern
   site than that at the northern site due to higher sediment nutrient
   concentrations at the southern site. The Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Cd
   concentrations in the sediments at the southern site were 25.1 mu g
   g(-1), 74.2 mu g g(-1), 21.4 mu g g(-1), 65.4 mu g g(-1) and 0.32 mu g
   g(-1), respectively, which were higher than the levels at the northern
   site of 13 mu g g(-1), 47.6 mu g g(-1), 12.4 mu g g(-1), 46.4 mu g g(-1)
   and 0.17 mu g g(-1), respectively. However, among the metals, only Cd
   was bioconcentrated in the Z. japonica tissue, with bioconcentration
   factor (BCF) values of 5.59 and 10.85 at the southern and northern
   sites, respectively. Conclusions The sediments at the southern site in
   the estuary are composed of clays enriched in nutrients, thus supporting
   more sustainable growth and higher biomass than the coarse-particle
   sediments at the northern site in the estuary. Moreover, the sediments
   at the southern site were also enriched in metals, resulting in high
   levels of metals in the Z. japonica tissue. Overall, the ecological risk
   was low except for Cd, which should be considered because of its
   potential impacts on this seagrass and its related food webs in the
   estuary ecosystem.},

Title = {Comparing methods of modeling depth-induced breaking of irregular waves
   with a fully nonlinear potential flow approach},

Abstract = {The modeling of wave-breaking dissipation in coastal areas is
   investigated with a fully nonlinear and dispersive wave model. The wave
   propagation model is based on potential flow theory, which initially
   assumes non-overturning waves. Including the impacts of wave-breaking
   dissipation is, however, possible by implementing a wave breaking
   initiation criterion and dissipation mechanism. Three criteria from the
   literature, including a geometric, kinematic, and dynamic-type
   criterion, are tested to determine the optimal criterion predicting the
   onset of wave breaking. Three wave-breaking energy dissipation methods
   are also tested: the first two are based on the analogy of a breaking
   wave with a hydraulic jump, and the third one applies an eddy viscosity
   dissipative term. Numerical simulations are performed using combinations
   of the three breaking onset criteria and three dissipation methods. The
   simulation results are compared to observations from four laboratory
   experiments of regular and irregular waves breaking over a submerged
   bar, irregular waves breaking on a beach, and irregular waves breaking
   over a submerged slope. The different breaking approaches provide
   similar results after proper calibration. The wave transformation
   observed in the experiments is reproduced well, with better results for
   the case of regular waves than irregular waves. Moreover, the wave
   statistics and wave spectra are predicted well in general, and in
   particular for regular waves. Some differences are observed for
   irregular wave cases, in particular in the low-frequency range. This is
   attributed to incomplete absorption of the long waves in the numerical
   model. Otherwise, the wave spectra in the range {[}0.5fp,5fp] are
   reproduced well before, within, and after the breaking zone for the
   three irregular wave experiments.},

Title = {Boring worms (Sipuncula and Annelida: Polychaeta): their early impact on
   Eastern Tropical Pacific coral reefs},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {641},

Abstract = {The form, condition, and survival of coral reefs depends on the balance
   between construction and destruction. Natural processes such as
   bioerosion can cause this balance to lean towards destruction,
   threatening these ecosystems. Polychaetes and sipunculids are members of
   the boring community; however, knowledge of their identity and role in
   the bioerosive process and their capacity to remove calcium carbonate
   (CaCO3) in the coral reefs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is
   scarce. To tackle this problem, 5 experimental units of Pocillopora spp.
   branches were deployed in 4 reef zones (back-reef, reef-flat,
   reef-front, reef-slope) at 2 reefs (La Azufrada, Playa Blanca) for 2
   time periods (P1: 6 mo, P2: 9 mo; n = 80) in Gorgona National Natural
   Park, Colombia. All worms (polychaetes and sipunculids) were identified
   and net removal and bioerosion rate were determined. In total, 137 worms
   were found: 64.2\% in La Azufrada and 35.8\% in Playa Blanca. There were
   no significant effects of reef, reef-zone, or duration of exposure (6
   vs. 9 mo) for either net removal of CaCO3 or bioerosion rate.
   Irrespective of reef or exposure duration, average net removal was 0.022
   and 0.027 g during P1 and P2, and 0.032 and 0.018 g at La Azufrada and
   Playa Blanca, respectively. Average bioerosion rate, also irrespective
   of reef or exposure duration, was 2.553 and 2.011 g kg(-1) yr(-1) for P1
   and P2, and 2.839 and 1.807 g kg(-1) yr(-1) at La Azufrada and Playa
   Blanca, respectively. The trend between periods was opposite for net
   removal and bioerosion rate, which indicates a decelerating impact of
   worms on the coral substrate as time passes. We suggest that, regardless
   of the small size of the boring worms, their role in CaCO3 removal is
   very important. The information provided here-species involved and
   amounts removed -is key in understanding the bioerosion process in ETP
   coral reefs.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With the rising population, environmental pollution, and social
   development, potable water is reducing and being contaminated day by day
   continually. Thus, several researchers have focused their studies on
   seas and oceans in order to get potable fresh water by desalination of
   their saltwater. Solar still of basin type is one of the available
   technologies to purify water because of free solar energy. The
   computational fluid dynamic CFD model of the solar still can
   significantly improve means for optimization of the solar still
   structure because it reduces the need for conducting large amount of
   experiments. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is presenting a
   multi-phase, three-dimensional CFD model, which predicts the performance
   of the solar still without using any experimental measurements,
   depending on the CFD solar radiation model. Simulated results are
   compared with experimental values of water and glass cover temperatures
   and yield of fresh water in climate conditions of Sheben El-Kom, Egypt
   (latitude 30.5 degrees N and longitude 31.01 degrees E). The simulation
   results were found to be in acceptable agreement with the experimental
   measured data. The results indicated that the daily simulated and
   experimental accumulated productivities of the single-slope solar still
   were found to be 1.982 and 1.785 L/m(2) at a water depth of 2 cm. In
   addition, the simulated and experimental daily efficiency were around
   16.79\% and 15.5\%, respectively, for the tested water depth.},

Abstract = {Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) can potentially improve the fuel
   quality of low-value biomass resources that are otherwise unsuitable for
   use in industrial heat and power applications. The effect of HTC
   pretreatment on the combustion and gasification behavior of two
   agricultural residues (grape marc and sugar cane bagasse) and a
   freshwater species of macroalgae was investigated, with an emphasis on
   devolatilization behavior and char reactivity. HTC was carried out in a
   custom-built, laboratory-scale, batch reactor at three temperatures,
   180, 220, and 260 degrees C, with a slurry density of 15\% w/w dry
   biomass in water. The volatile release behavior of the collected
   products (hydrochars) and untreated biomass feedstocks were
   characterized by dynamic thermogravimetric analysis. Char reactivity was
   characterized by isothermal gasification of samples of the hydrochars
   and untreated biomass in a thermobalance in carbon dioxide, following
   fast pyrolysis of the samples in a separate fixed-bed batch reactor.
   Hydrochars were more energy-dense and contained lower concentrations of
   catalytic metals, particularly K and Na, than the untreated biomass
   feedstocks. HTC caused a significant reduction in the total release of
   volatiles and an increase in the yield of char during devolatilization.
   The bulk of the volatile matter was released at higher devolatilization
   temperatures for the hydrochars. These trends became more pronounced
   with increasing HTC temperature from 180 to 260 degrees C. The char
   components of grape marc and macroalgae became substantially less
   reactive following HTC. The char component of bagasse became more
   reactive following HTC at 180 degrees C but became less reactive
   following HTC at 220 and 260 degrees C. Activation energies for char
   gasification of HTC-treated (220 degrees C) grape marc, bagasse, and
   macroalgae in CO2, were 177, 247, and 282 kJ mol(-1), respectively.
   These values are 92\%, 10\%, and 52\% greater than the values for the
   untreated biomass.},

Abstract = {Parallel speciation can occur when traits determining reproductive
   isolation evolve independently in different populations that experience
   a similar range of environments. However, a common problem in studies of
   parallel evolution is to distinguish this hypothesis from an alternative
   one in which different ecotypes arose only once in allopatry and now
   share a sympatric scenario with substantial gene flow between them. Here
   we show that the combination of a phylogenetic approach with
   life-history data is able to disentangle both hypotheses in the case of
   the intertidal marine snail Littorina saxatilis on the rocky shores of
   Galicia in northwestern Spain. In this system, numerous phenotypic and
   genetic differences have evolved between two sympatric ecotypes spanning
   a sharp ecological gradient, and as aside effect of the former have
   produced partial reproductive isolation. A mitochondrial phylogeny of
   these populations strongly suggests that the two sympatric ecotypes have
   originated independently several times. Building upon earlier work
   demonstrating size-based assortative mating as the main contributor to
   reproductive isolation among ecotypes, our analysis provides strong
   evidence that divergent selection across a sharp ecological gradient
   promoted the parallel divergence of body size and shape between two
   sympatric ecotypes. Thus, divergent selection occurring independently in
   different populations has produced the marine equivalent of host races,
   which may represent the first step in speciation.},

Title = {Effect of Reimpacting Debris on the Solidification of the Lunar Magma
   Ocean},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Anorthosites that comprise the bulk of the lunar crust are believed to
   have formed during solidification of a lunar magma ocean (LMO) in which
   these rocks would have floated to the surface. This early flotation
   crust would have formed a thermal blanket over the remaining LMO,
   prolonging solidification. Geochronology of lunar anorthosites indicates
   a long timescale of LMO cooling, or remelting and recrystallization in
   one or more late events. To better interpret this geochronology, we
   model LMO solidification in a scenario where the Moon is being
   continuously bombarded by returning projectiles released from the
   Moon-forming giant impact. More than one lunar mass of material escaped
   the Earth-Moon system onto heliocentric orbits following the giant
   impact, much of it to come back on returning orbits for a period of
   100Myr. If large enough, these projectiles would have punctured holes in
   the nascent floatation crust of the Moon, exposing the LMO to space and
   causing more rapid cooling. We model these scenarios using a thermal
   evolution model of the Moon that allows for production (by cratering)
   and evolution (solidification and infill) of holes in the flotation
   crust that insulates the LMO. For effective hole production,
   solidification of the magma ocean can be significantly expedited,
   decreasing the cooling time by more than a factor of 5. If hole
   production is inefficient, but shock conversion of projectile kinetic
   energy to thermal energy is efficient, then LMO solidification can be
   somewhat prolonged, lengthening the cooling time by 50\% or more.
   Plain Language Summary The Moon is widely believed to have begun in a
   hot state with a deep ocean of liquid rock (magma). The Moon we see
   today however is a mostly solid object, so sometime between now and when
   it formed 4.5 billion years ago the Moon must have solidified. How long
   did that process take? Previous estimates based on ages of lunar rock
   samples and on computer models of a solidifying ocean of magma have
   ranged from 10 to 300 million years. An important component that has not
   been considered in previous computer models however is that while it was
   cooling the Moon would have been struck by very large numbers of smaller
   bodies. We have developed a new computer model to explore how the
   effects of these impacts could speed up or slow down the solidification
   process to improve our understanding of the early history of the Moon.},

Abstract = {Aqueous solutions of humic substances (HSs) and pure monomeric aromatics
   were irradiated to investigate the chemical controls upon carbon
   monoxide (CO) photoproduction from dissolved organic matter (DOM). HSs
   were isolated from lakes, rivers, marsh, and ocean. Inclusion of
   humic,fulvic, hydrophobic organic, and hydrophilic organic acid
   fractions from these environments provided samples diverse in source and
   isolation protocol. In spite of these major differences, HS absorption
   coefficients (a) and photo re activities (a bleaching and CO production)
   were strongly dependent upon HS aromaticity (r(2) > 0.90; n = 11),
   implying aromatic moieties are the principal chromophores and
   photoreactants within HSs, and by extension, DOM. Carbonyl carbon and CO
   photoproduction were not correlated, implying that carbonyl moieties are
   not quantitatively important in CO photo production. CO photoproduction
   efficiency of aqueous solutions of monomeric aromatic compounds that are
   common constituents of organic matter varied with the nature of ring
   substituents. Specifically, electron donating groups increased, while
   electron withdrawing groups decreased CO photoproductivity, supporting
   our conclusion that carbonyl substituents are not quantitatively
   important in CO photo production. Significantly, aromatic CO
   photoproduction efficiency spanned 3 orders of magnitude, indicating
   that variations in the CO apparent quantum yields of natural DOM may be
   related to variations in aromatic DOM substituent group chemistry.},

Abstract = {Shifting suitable range limits under global warming will threaten many
   species. Modeling and mapping these potential range shifts is important
   for conservation. As global warming will introduce new sets of abiotic
   conditions, predictive empirical niche models may not perform well and
   the best method to model a specie's projected range shifts may be to
   model their fundamental niche with a biophysical mechanistic niche
   model. However, this class of model requires many physiological
   parameters that are difficult to measure for species not easily kept in
   captivity. It is also difficult to estimate these parameters for marine
   species given the interactions among their in-water motion, metabolism,
   and heat transfer. To surmount these difficulties, we use our previously
   verified novel technique combining 3D digital design, computational
   fluid dynamics, and finite volume heat transfer modeling to find animal
   core temperatures. We then use this method to build a fundamental niche
   map for internesting and nesting leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys
   coriacea). With these niche maps we analyze three main nesting areas. We
   show that global warming poses a large overheating risk to leatherbacks
   in Southeast Asia, a slight risk to leatherbacks in the West Atlantic
   and a low risk to leatherbacks in the East Atlantic. We also show that
   the impact may be less on leatherbacks that shift their nesting location
   or who are smaller. Methods such these are important to produce
   efficiently and economically accurate maps of regions that will become
   inhospitable to species under global warming conditions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Male bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) use vocal displays to attract
   females and to compete with other males during the mating season. This
   makes it possible to monitor breeding populations of this species using
   passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). This study analysed year-round
   acoustic data records from AURAL instruments in Svalbard (Norway) to
   investigate seasonal variation in the acoustic presence of male bearded
   seals and the phenology of different call types (long, step and sweep
   trills) at three sites representing a variety of habitats with varied
   ice conditions. Male bearded seals vocalized for an extended period at a
   drift-ice site (Atwain; January-July) north of Spitsbergen, while the
   vocal season was shorter at a High Arctic land-fast-ice site
   (Rijpfjorden; February-June) and shorter yet again at a west-coast site
   that has undergone dramatic reductions in sea ice cover over the last
   1.5 decades (Kongsfjorden; April-June). Generalized Additive Models
   showed marked seasonal segregation in the use of different trill types
   at Atwain, where call rates reached 400 per h, with long trills being
   the most numerous call type. Modest segregation of trill types was seen
   at Rijpfjorden, where call rates reached 300 per h, and no segregation
   occurred in Kongsfjorden (peak call rate 80 per h). Sea ice cover was
   available throughout the vocal season at Atwain and Rijpfjorden, while
   at Kongsfjorden peak vocal activity (May-June) occurred after the sea
   ice disappeared. Ongoing climate warming and sea ice reductions will
   likely increase the incidence of such mismatches and reduce breeding
   habitat for bearded seals.},

Title = {Valuation and cost reduction of behind-the-meter hydrogen production in
   Hawaii},
Journal = {MRS ENERGY \& SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {A 250kW hydrogen electrolysis facility was recently installed at the
   Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority's (NELHA's) campus. This
   facility that will begin operation in 2020 to produce hydrogen for fuel
   cell buses on the island to demonstrate of the application of hydrogen
   to decarbonize transportation. Given the size of the electrolysis
   station, it has the potential to significantly increase electricity
   costs for the campus, which is subject to energy and peak demand charges
   from the local utility.In this paper, we analyze the cost of hydrogen
   production at NELHA given the rate structure options available from the
   utility. Production costs are estimated using optimal versus constant
   scheduling of the facility to meet the buses' demand. A model of the
   electrolysis station is used to capture changes in production efficiency
   over the power range in the optimization routine. The effects of
   combining the station and campus load versus standalone operation and
   increasing solar generation are also explored. The analyses surrounding
   this scenario show the importance of multiple factors on the potential
   profitability of hydrogen production in behind-the-meter applications
   and show trends that could have implications for other similar
   installations.},

Title = {In situ exhumation from bedrock of large rounded boulders at the Giant's
   Causeway, Northern Ireland: An alternative genesis for large shore
   boulders (mega-clasts)},

Abstract = {Very large boulders (mega-clasts) are found on some coasts. The size and
   position of the boulders has been used to suggest that contemporary
   marine processes, acting within their normal spatial and energy range,
   are unlikely to have moved them. Explanations for the presence of such
   boulders include transport by infrequent very high-energy marine
   processes (storms or tsunamis), mass movement from backing cliffs,
   transport by ice, or exhumation from glacial deposits. This paper
   advances an alternative explanation which does not involve transport by
   any of the marine or glacial processes, or gravity. It is proposed that,
   in a very specific geological and topographic setting, large boulders
   are exhumed in situ by storm waves acting on heavily weathered jointed
   basalts. Eventually wave action liberates residual blocks from the
   deeply weathered matrix. These liberated boulders will be mobile only if
   they lie within wave competence, and the larger ones will remain as
   stationary residuals. The same in situ weathering processes, followed by
   removal of the friable matrix material debris by wave action, also
   progressively round the boulders. Consequently, despite their appearance
   of being tansport-rounded, the larger boulders have not transported at
   all. In specific locations, the assumption that the presence, and
   rounding, of such large clasts in the shore zone can be attributed to
   marine transport can lead to erroneous interpretations of very
   high-energy storm wave (or tsunami) activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   Glider with Multi-locomotion Modes},

Abstract = {Most of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) can only perform
   single-locomotion mode, such as propeller-driven, gliding, paddling and
   so on. So it is difficult for these vehicles to deal with complicated
   missions at a fixed-point or in sonic limited and dangerous spaces.
   Additionally, energy supply is one of the important factors that
   seriously affects the detection range and endurance of the UUVs which
   are not capable to obtain power-importing from outside. As a result of
   these concerns, we propose a new solar-powered bionic underwater glider
   with multi-locomotion modes (SBUG). Based on the sea turtles hydrofoil
   motion and the fish body and/or caudal fin (BCF) locomotion, the bionic
   structure design of the SBUG includes basically two main parts, a
   pectoral fin actuation and a caudal actuation. The
   three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) pectoral fin actuation and the 2DOF
   caudal actuation ensure that the SBUG can easily change locomotion modes
   between gliding, paddling, flapping, tail wagging and walking for
   various tasks. The flexible solar arrays are attached on the upper
   curved surface shell and wings of the SBUG so as to provide energy
   support to increase the voyage time. The basic concept, mechanical
   design and development of the SBUG are presented in this paper.
   Moreover, the movement performance of the mechanical prototype is
   confirmed through in-water trials.},

Title = {Techno-economic analysis of a 2.1 kW rooftop photovoltaic-grid-tied

Abstract = {As more attention is being focus on the development of renewable energy
   resources globally, technical and economic assessments of these
   resources are crucial to ascertain their viability. These assessments
   can be more meaningful, if they are based on field and actual
   performance of the renewable energy conversion systems. This study
   presents the economic analysis of a rooftop 2.07 kW grid-connected
   photovoltaic energy system installation located in As (59.65 degrees N
   and longitude 10.76 degrees E, and about 105 m above sea level), Norway.
   Both the annual and monthly costs of energy produced by the system are
   determined. In addition, the feed-in tariff that can give internal rate
   of return of about 7.5\% on investment on this installation was
   examined. Based on assumptions used in this study, feed-in-tariff of
   US\$0.356/kW h is estimated for a project with economic life of 25 years
   with no other financial support. This translates to US\$0.110/kW h
   premium over the levelized cost of energy of US\$0.246/kW h generated by
   the system. However, if the financial support is more than 45\% of the
   initial investment cost, no further premium fee is necessary to support
   this type of system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this research, the effect of wave steepness on the hydrodynamic
   efficiency of an oscillating water column is examined at different
   chamber lengths and bottom slope angles. Results show that the best
   device efficiency for low wave frequencies is obtained at high chamber
   length and for high wave frequencies, the best device performance is
   achieved at low chamber length. Numerical findings reveal that for high
   wave steepness, the change in the chamber length has a negligible effect
   on the device efficiency at low wave frequencies and at high wave
   frequencies, the best device performance is attained at low chamber
   length. Results indicate that for the shoreline oscillating water
   column, the change in the bottom slope angle away from the resonance
   condition has a negligible effect on the device efficiency and at
   resonance condition, high bottom slope angle is preferred in order to
   obtain the best device efficiency. It is found that at high wave
   steepness, the device efficiency decreases and no specific resonance
   condition could be observed. It is also shown that the sensitivity of
   the device efficiency around the optimal device performance to the
   damping produced by power take-off device decreases as the wave
   steepness increases. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In situ amendment of sediments with highly sorbent materials like
   activated carbon (AC) is an increasingly viable strategy to reduce the
   bioavailability of persistent, sediment-associated contaminants to
   benthic communities. Because in situ sediment remediation is an emerging
   strategy, much remains to be learned about the field conditions under
   which amendments can be effective, the resilience of amendment materials
   toward extreme weather conditions, and the optimal design of engineered
   applications. We report the results of a multiyear, pilot-scale field
   investigation designed to measure the persistence and efficacy of AC
   amendments to reduce the bioavailability of polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs) in an intertidal Phragmites marsh. The amendments tested were
   granular AC (GAC), GAC with a layer of sand, and a pelletized fine AC.
   Key metrics presented include vertically resolved black carbon
   concentrations in sediment and PCB concentrations in sediment,
   porewater, and several invertebrate species. The results demonstrate
   that all 3 amendments withstood Hurricane Sandy and remained in place
   for the duration of the study, successfully reducing porewater PCB
   concentrations by 34 to 97\%. Reductions in invertebrate bioaccumulation
   were observed in all amendment scenarios, with pelletized fine AC
   producing the most pronounced effect. The present findings support the
   use of engineered AC amendments in intertidal marshes and can be used to
   inform amendment design, delivery, and monitoring at other contaminated
   sediment sites. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2496-2505. (c) 2018 SETAC},

Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Long-term wave conditions drive and control the variations in beach
   morphology, shoreline dynamics and coastal stability. However, the fact
   that longer-term measured or regional-scale wave data are not available
   shows that it is difficult to understand general mechanism controlling
   beach morphology along the west Guangdong coastline in China. Thus, this
   paper studied wave variability of representative parameters using a
   39-year Interim reanalysis wave data and their potential impacts on ten
   embayed sandy beaches in the west Guangdong. The results indicate that a
   modal wave height of less than 1 m and a modal wave period of about 6 s
   occur, showing the study area being in a relative low-energy wave
   conditions. The variations of wave conditions are dominated by monsoon
   weather systems and accidental typhoon events. The potential impacts of
   wave conditions on short-term beach remarkable morphological variation,
   beach morphodynamic types and sediment distribution, and coastal
   long-term planform were further explored. The associated results reveal
   some general mechanisms driving the possible variation in beach
   morphologies, which probably guide future field observations and beach
   morphodynamic studies in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {110},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The restinga comprises coastal vegetation formations which dominate the
   Atlantic seaboard of Brazil. Exposed sand ridges and associated lagoon
   systems have poorly developed soils subject to pronounced water
   deficits. Distinct vegetation zones support a high diversity of life
   forms, and a comparative study has been undertaken to investigate
   interactions between degree of exposure, nutrient supply and
   photosynthetic pathway (C-3, or CAM) in selected species across the
   restinga. A number of species occurring throughout the restinga were
   chosen as representative species of different life forms, comprising C-3
   pioneer shrubs (Eugenic rotundifolia and Erythroxylum ovalifolium),
   impounding (tank) terrestrial bromeliad (Neoregelia cruenta: CAM) and
   the atmospheric epiphyte (Tillandsia stricta: CAM). Comparisons of plant
   and soil nutrient composition, and airborne deposition were conducted
   for each zone. Soil nutrient content and organic matter were closely
   related, reaching a maximum in zone 4, the seaward face of the inner
   dune. Salt concentration in leaves was independent of atmospheric
   deposition for the terrestrial species, in contrast to the atmospheric
   epiphyte T. stricta. In the slack area, vegetation formed characteristic
   `'islands'' with the soil beneath enriched in nutrients, suggesting a
   complex interplay between plants and soil during the development of
   vegetation succession. Here, two additional trees were investigated, C-3
   and CAM members of the Clusiaceae, respectively Clusia lanceolata and C,
   fluminensis. Stable isotope composition of nitrogen (delta(15)N) was
   generally more negative (depleted in N-15) in plants with low total
   nitrogen content. This was exemplified by the atmospheric bromeliad, T.
   stricta, with an N content of 2.91 g/kg and delta(15)N Of -12.3 per mil.
   Stable isotopes of carbon (delta(13)C) were used to identify the
   distribution of photosynthetic pathways, and while the majority of
   bromeliads and orchids were CAM, analysis of the soil organic matter
   suggested that C-3 plants made the major contribution in each zone of
   the restinga. Since delta(13)C of plant material also suggested that
   water supply was optimal in zone 4, we conclude that succession and high
   diversity in the restinga is dependent on exposure, edaphic factors, and
   perhaps a critical mass of vegetation required to stabilize nutrient
   relations of the system.},

Abstract = {Tides are changing worldwide at rates not explained by astronomical
   forcing. Rather, the observed evolution of tides and other long waves,
   such as storm surges, is influenced by shelf processes and changes to
   the roughness, depth, width, and length of embayments, estuaries, and
   tidal rivers. In this review, we focus on processes in estuaries and
   tidal rivers, because that is where the largest changes to tidal
   properties are occurring. Recent literature shows that changes in tidal
   amplitude have been ubiquitous worldwide over the past century, often in
   response to wetland reclamation, channel dredging, and other
   environmental changes. While tidal amplitude changes are sometimes
   slight (<1\%) or even negative, we identify two types of systems that
   are particularly prone to tidal amplification: (a) shallow, strongly
   damped systems, in which a small increase in depth produces a large
   decrease in effective friction, and (b) systems in which wave reflection
   and resonance are strongly influenced by changes to depth, friction, and
   convergence. The largest changes in amplitude occur inland, some
   distance from the coast, and can sometimes be measured in meters. Tide
   changes are a leading indicator that the dynamics of storm surges and
   river flood waves have also changed and are often associated with shifts
   in sediment transport, salinity intrusion, and ecosystem properties.
   Therefore, the dynamics of tidal evolution have major implications for
   coastal management, particularly for systems that are sensitive to
   changes in geometry induced by sea-level rise and anthropogenic
   development.},

Abstract = {Silver hake, or whiting, populations appear to be declining in the
   Middle Atlantic Bight off the east coast of the United States as judged
   from Government research vessel data, recorded landings and anecdotal
   evidence provided by the commercial fishing fleet. There is some
   evidence that this may be due to overfishing. If true, it may
   necessitate additional governmental regulation of this fishery. However,
   with a migratory species such as silver hake, an alternative
   interpretation of the declining landings may be that the stocks have
   relocated from traditional fishing areas in the Middle Atlantic Bight in
   response to changing environmental factors such as changes in bottom
   temperatures and others. Moreover, since little is known of the
   population structure of the silver hake stock, it is difficult to
   analyze if the overall stock is in decline or only certain populations.
   Such information will be needed to develop effective management
   strategies.
   We are currently investigating the decline of silver hake populations by
   reviewing National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) research data
   collected from the 1960's-1990's looking for correlations between
   changes in the environment and declines in catch. Such correlations may
   favor relocation of the stock, as opposed to overfishing, to explain the
   recorded declines in landings.
   In addition, we are collecting blood samples from the Gulf of Maine
   southward to the Middle Atlantic Bight in order to prepare DNA for
   microsatellite DNA analysis to determine the silver hake population
   structure. We believe that the population structure as determined by
   microsatellite DNA analysis, together with correlations between catch
   and environmental factors, will provide valuable information for the
   development of effective fisheries management plans for the silver hake
   stock.
   Preliminary microsatellite DNA data analyses suggest that there may be
   more than one silver hake population. Also, preliminary analysis of
   bottom water temperatures in the Middle Atlantic Bight appears to
   indicate an average rise in temperature over the three decades
   investigated.},

Abstract = {Solar-C is the third generation solar observatory led by JAXA. The
   accepted `Plan-B' payload calls for a radiation-hard solar-staring

   advantages over CCDs for such an application such as increased radiation
   hardness and high frame rate (instrument target of 1000 fps). Looking
   towards the solution of a bespoke CMOS APS, this paper reports the x-ray
   spectroscopy performance, concentrating on charge collection efficiency
   and split event analysis, of two baseline e2v CMOS APSs not designed for
   x-ray performance, the EV76C454 and the Ocean Colour Imager (OCI) test
   array. The EV76C454 is an industrial 5T APS designed for machine vision,
   available back and front illuminated. The OCI test arrays have varying
   pixel design across the chips, but are 4T, back illuminated and have
   thin low-resistivity and thick high-resistivity variants. The OCI test
   arrays' pixel variants allow understanding of how pixel design can

Abstract = {The emergy methodology was used to evaluate aggregate supply from marine
   sand extraction at an offshore site in the exclusive economic zone in
   the South Sea of Korea for use in the construction of the Pusan New
   Port. The marine sand from the offshore site had an emergy yield of 2.87
   E22 sej, with 97.5\% from the offshore sediments and 2.5\% from the
   economy. The emergy yield ratio of the marine sand extraction was 40.7,
   implying that the process contributed a net benefit to the Korean
   society beyond the economic inputs required for it. The environmental
   loading ratio of the sand production was, however, very high at 3,422,
   indicating the great environmental stress of the extraction process to
   the marine ecosystem. The emergy sustainability index, therefore, was
   very low at 0.012. This study revealed that the marine sand extraction
   could be a viable option in terms of yield, but measures to reduce
   environmental impacts of the extraction are needed to increase the
   sustainability of the process. Further emergy evaluations on other
   aggregate production alternatives are required to provide better insight
   in determining policy priorities regarding the aggregate supply for the
   construction sector of Korea.},

Title = {The Impact of a Barrier Island Loss on Extreme Events in the Tampa Bay},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Barrier islands characterize up to an eighth of the global coastlines.
   They buffer the mainland coastal areas from storm surge and wave energy
   from the open ocean. Changes in their shape or disappearance due to
   erosion may lead to an increased impact of sea level extremes on the
   mainland. A barrier island threatened by erosion is Egmont Key which is
   located in the mouth of the Tampa Bay estuary at the west-central coast
   of Florida. In this sensitivity study we investigate the impact a loss
   of Egmont Key would have on storm surge water levels and wind waves
   along the coastline of Tampa Bay. We first simulate still water levels
   in a control run over the years 1948-2010 using present-day bathymetry
   and then in a scenario run covering the same period with identical
   boundary conditions but with Egmont Key removed from the bathymetry.
   Return water levels are assessed for the control and the scenario runs
   using the Peak-over-threshold method along the entire Tampa Bay
   coastline. Egmont Key is found to have a significant influence on the
   return water levels in the Bay, especially in the northern, furthest
   inland parts where water levels associated with the 100-year return
   period increase between 5 and 15 cm. Additionally, wind wave simulations
   considering all 99.5th percentile threshold exceedances in the years
   1980-2013 were conducted with the same control and scenario
   bathymetries. Assessing changes in return levels of significant wave
   heights due to the loss of Egmont Key revealed an increase of
   significant wave heights around today's location of the island.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This review highlights the ubiquity of black carbon (BC) produced by
   incomplete combustion of plant material and fossil fuels in peats,
   soils, and lacustrine and marine sediments. We examine various
   definitions and analytical approaches and seek to provide a common
   language. BC represents a continuum from partly charred material to
   graphite and soot particles, with no general agreement on clear-cut
   boundaries. Formation of BC can occur in two fundamentally different
   ways. Volatiles recondense to highly graphitized soot-BC, whereas the
   solid residues form char-BC. Both forms of BC are relatively inert and
   are distributed globally by water and wind via fluvial and atmospheric
   transport. We summarize, chronologically, the ubiquity of BC in soils
   and sediments since Devonian times, differentiating between BC from
   vegetation fires and from fossil fuel combustion. BC has important
   implications for various biological, geochemical and environmental
   processes. As examples, BC may represent a significant sink in the
   global carbon cycle, affect the Earth's radiative heat balance, be a
   useful tracer for Earth's fire history, build up a significant fraction
   of carbon buried in soils and sediments, and carry organic pollutants.
   On land, BC seems to be abundant in dark-colored soils, affected by
   frequent vegetation burning and fossil fuel combustion, thus probably
   contributing to the highly stable aromatic components of soil organic
   matter. We discuss challenges for future research. Despite the great
   importance of BC, only limited progress has been made in calibrating
   analytical techniques. Progress in the quantification of BC is likely to
   come from systematic intercomparison using BCs from different sources
   and in different natural matrices. BC identification could benefit from
   isotopic and spectroscopic techniques applied at the bulk and molecular
   levels. The key to estimating BC stocks in soils and sediments is an
   understanding of the processes involved in BC degradation on a molecular
   level. A promising approach would be the combination of short-term
   laboratory experiments and long-term field trials.},

Abstract = {The Oligocene-Miocene of East Java is characterized by multiple stages
   of isolated carbonate mound growth surrounded by deeper marine off-mound
   sediments or by shallow-marine siliciclastics. Three stratigraphic
   intervals are recognized: Kujung (carbonate mound and off-mound), Tuban
   (mixed carbonate-siliciclastic), and Ngrayong (siliciclastic). Exposures
   of the Kujung unit (\&SIM; 28-22 Ma) are limited to a few isolated
   outcrops. At the base, the Kujung is represented by a high-energy,
   extensive, shallow-marine carbonate facies that grades laterally into
   deep-marine off-mound sediments of calcareous mudstone and chalk (lower
   Kujung). In other locations, shallow-water carbonate deposition was
   restricted to faulted topographic highs in the middle-upper Kujung. The
   shallow-marine sediments of the lower Kujung were covered by thick chalk
   and marl sediments of the middle-upper Kujung. The Tuban unit (\&SIM;
   22-15 Ma) consists of widely exposed shallow-marine mixed carbonate and
   siliciclastic and poorly exposed open-marine shale and chalk facies. The
   Tuban consists of at least six stacked cycles that reflect deltaic
   deposition with episodes of shallow-marine carbonate mound growth. The
   Ngrayong unit (\&SIM; 15-12 Ma) represents a period of regional
   siliciclastic influx and progradation of tidally influenced deltas and
   grades into turbidites, basinal shale, mudstone, and chalk. Ngrayong
   beds are truncated by Bulu carbonates (Serravallian-Tortonian). This is

Abstract = {As in many other semi-arid regions, the Plio-quaternary aquifer of the
   eastern coast of Cap Bon peninsula (NE Tunisia) shows a parallel
   increase in overexploitation and mineralization of groundwater resources
   and so the water quality is deteriorating. Different methods using
   geochemistry (ions Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Br-) and stable isotopes (O-18,
   H-2) are compared with the hydrodynamic information for identifying the
   main processes involved in the increase of salinization. Along the
   coast, intrusion of seawater resulting from groundwater overexploitation
   is identified, but is not the only cause of qualitative degradation: the
   development of irrigation that induces soil leaching and transfer of
   fertilizers to groundwater over the whole aquifer extent is another
   major reason for the increase in salinization. A total of 48 groundwater
   wells were sampled to obtain additional information on the hydrochemical
   characteristics of the groundwater defined in previous studies.},

Abstract = {Ca Mau Cape is a part of Ngoc Hien district and is the southernmost tip
   of inland Vietnam. The district is highly vulnerable to coastal
   processes induced by natural and human factors that play important role
   in shaping and controlling the coastline. This study investigated the
   coastline change over 20 years, 1990-2010, in relation to meteorological
   conditions and human interventions using the land-use map (Landsat TM)
   and questionnaire survey. During this period, Ngoc Hien lost 2206 ha of
   coastal zone due to erosion. Most of the erosion occurred in the
   communes located in the east coast side. Remarkable changes in
   land-use/land-cover patterns were observed with a substantial reduction
   in the forest and increase in the aquaculture farming land. The results
   of the technical data analysis and questionnaire survey showed that both
   meteorological conditions and human interventions were interacted to
   cause the changes. Although the impacts of individual factors could not
   be readily quantified, the most important factors causing the coastline
   changes were forest area loss, river dredging, aquaculture and
   infrastructure development. The scientific information obtained in this
   study can be used to develop sustainable coastal management strategies
   for the study area.},

Abstract = {Previous investigations of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects have
   highlighted the long-term negative impacts of urban street canyons on
   surroundings temperatures that indirectly contribute to global warming.
   Studies on road pavement solar collector (RPSC) system have shown the
   potential of reducing the heat' rom the pavement surface by absorbing
   the heat from the pavement and harnessing the thermal energy. This study
   expands the investigation of optimising the RPSC system based on four
   tested parameters (pipe diameter, pipe depth, water velocity and water
   temperature) comparing the system performance in terms of Delta T of
   inlet-outlet, potential thermal collection (PTC) and surface temperature
   reduction (STR). Two types of external environmental conditions were
   considered: (i) urban domain resembling a street canyon (ii) flat
   surface resembling a low density or rural area. `De-coupled' CFD method
   was employed based on previously author's published work by simulating
   the effect of external environment (macro domain) onto RPSC system
   (micro domain) in two separate CFD modelling. Initially, both domains
   were validated with numerical and experimental data from previously
   published works. In comparing the RPSC application in urban domain and
   flat/rural domain; it was found that the system adjustment based on high
   and low conditions of water velocity provided the best performance
   improvement with average 28\% higher in terms of PTC and STR as compared
   to other simulated parameters. Yet, insignificant Delta T (less than 5
   K) was obtained with values over 0.02 m in the pipe diameter and in the
   0.25 m/s water velocity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modelling Beach Litter Accumulation on Mediterranean Coastal Landscapes:
   An Integrative Framework Using Species Distribution Models},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Beach litter accumulation patterns are influenced by biotic and abiotic
   factors, as well as by the distribution of anthropogenic sources.
   Although the importance of comprehensive approaches to deal with
   anthropogenic litter pollution is acknowledged, integrated studies
   including geomorphologic, biotic, and anthropic factors in relation to
   beach debris accumulation are still needed. In this perspective, Species
   Distribution Models (SDMs) might represent an appropriate tool to
   predict litter accumulation probability in relation to environmental
   conditions. In this context, we explored the applicability of a SDM-type
   modelling approach (a Litter Distribution Model; LDM) to map litter
   accumulation in coastal sand dunes. Starting from 180 litter sampling
   plots combined with fine-resolution variables, we calibrated LDMs from
   litter items classified either by their material type or origin. We also
   mapped litter accumulation hotspots. LDMs achieved fair-to-good
   predictive performance, with LDMs for litter classified by material type
   performing significantly better than models for litter classified by
   origin. Accumulation hotspots were mostly localized along the beach, by
   beach accesses, and at river mouths. In light of the promising results
   achieved by LDMs in this study, we conclude that this tool can be
   successfully applied within a coastal litter management context.},

Abstract = {The marine piers of the new Benicia-Martinez Bridge are supported on 8
   or 9 Cast-in-Drilled-Hole (CIDH) concrete piles with 2.5 in diameter
   permanent steel casings and 2.2 in diameter rock sockets to a depth of
   approximately 75 in. A Menck MHU-500 hammer was used to drive the
   casings up to 15 in into bedrock. The noise generated in the surrounding
   water unexpectedly killed fish. To resolve the environmental problem an
   affordable bubble curtain system was developed to reduce the sound wave
   energy by as much as 90 percent. Although pile driving monitoring did
   not detect any overstressing at refusal, some of the steel casings were
   found to be damaged. The damaged portions of the casings were removed
   and rock socket lengths were revised accordingly. Major caving occurred
   at Pier 8 during drilling of the rock sockets. Consolidation grouting
   was applied in an attempt to improve rock stability and to diminish
   caving potential. However, subsequent continuous coring around the caved
   shaft could not confirm the effectiveness of grouting. The rotator
   drilling method was selected to construct the rock sockets. A pile load
   test (Osterberg Method) was performed to confirm the geotechnical pile
   capacities of the rotator-drilled shafts. affected by mud generated from
   rotating teeth. These factors tend to lower side shear capacity of the
   rock socket, which needs to be considered in the design phase when
   calculating rock socket capacities and when preparing piling
   specifications for the project. Pile load testing is strongly
   recommended.},

Abstract = {The potential impacts of underwater noise on marine mammals are widely
   recognised, but uncertainty over variability in baseline noise levels
   often constrains efforts to manage these impacts. This paper
   characterises natural and anthropogenic contributors to underwater noise
   at two sites in the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation, an
   important marine mammal habitat that may be exposed to increased
   shipping activity from proposed offshore energy developments. We aimed
   to establish a pre-development baseline, and to develop ship noise
   monitoring methods using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and
   time-lapse video to record trends in noise levels and shipping activity.
   Our results detail the noise levels currently experienced by a locally
   protected bottlenose dolphin population, explore the relationship
   between broadband sound exposure levels and the indicators proposed in
   response to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and provide a
   ship noise assessment toolkit which can be applied in other coastal
   marine environments. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This study assessed the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and
   neutral genetic variation and structure in two percid species, perch
   Perca fluviatilis and zander Sander lucioperca, in a unique brackish
   ecosystem, the Baltic Sea. In addition, to assess the importance of MHC
   diversity to disease susceptibility in these populations, comparisons
   were made to an introduced, disease susceptible, P. fluviatilis
   population in Australia. Eighty-three MHC class II B exon 2 variants
   were amplified: 71 variants from 92 P. fluviatilis samples, and 12
   variants from 82 S. lucioperca samples. Microsatellite and MHC data
   revealed strong spatial genetic structure in S. lucioperca, but not P.
   fluviatilis, across the Baltic Sea. Both microsatellite and MHC data
   showed higher levels of genetic diversity in P. fluviatilis from the
   Baltic Sea compared to Australia, which may have facilitated the spread
   of an endemic virus, EHNV in the Australian population. The relatively
   high levels of genetic variation in the Baltic Sea populations, together
   with spatial genetic structure, however, suggest that there currently
   seems to be little risk of disease epidemics in this system. To ensure
   this remains the case in the face of ongoing environmental changes,
   fisheries and habitat disturbance, the conservation of local-scale
   genetic variation is recommended. (C) 2016 The Fisheries Society of the

Abstract = {A tillage study was conducted in Prince Edward Island with winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) over two seasons on a Gowanbrae light fine sandy
   loam, a Humo-Ferric Podzol. One-pass mouldboard ploughing, shallow
   tillage using a rotary harrow, and direct drilling were evaluated for
   their effects on crop productivity and soil physical properties. Direct
   drilling increased plant survival but not grain yield in the first year
   compared to the other tillage systems. Leaf diseases significantly
   reduced crop performance under shallow tillage and direct drilling in
   the second year. None of the tillage systems had adverse effects on soil
   strength at field capacity over the 0- to 350-mm soil profile depth, as
   penetrometer resistance values were < 1.5 MPa. Differences in soil
   macro-aggregation and organic carbon distribution between tillage
   systems were noted in the Ap horizon. Sequential measurements on soil
   cores equilibrated at 6 kPa tension for macropore volume, air
   permeability at low air pressure (0.25 kPa), oxygen diffusion rate (ODR)
   at 0.65 mV, and shear strength indicated that the soil physical
   condition was within the optimum range for root growth, over the 0- to
   240-mm depth, in each tillage system. In addition, relative compaction
   was maintained at a low level in all systems. The quotient of air
   permeability and macropore volume, as an index of pore continuity,
   indicated that the relatively large macropore volumes under mouldboard
   ploughing were less efficient in conducting air than the macropores
   under direct drilling. These differences in pore continuity were most
   prevalent at the lower soil depth.},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {The full spectrum of volatile sulfur compounds was detected in the water
   column of the permanently stratified meromictic Lake Cadagno. Besides
   hydrogen sulfide it included methanethiol, carbonyl sulfide, dimethyl
   sulfide, carbon disulfide, and dimethyl disulfide. Their distribution in
   the water column suggests that these compounds are of biogenic origin.
   Except for carbon disulfide which is present in all layers of Lake
   Cadagno, these volatile organic sulfur compounds are restricted to the
   anoxic part of the lake. For methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and carbon
   disulfide maximum concentrations were observed in the redox transition
   zone and in the sediment porewater. Carbon disulfide is the most
   abundant volatile organic sulfur compound with concentrations of up to
   60 mu mol L-1. The concentrations of the methylated sulfides are in the
   nmolar range. Although their concentrations varied during the summer
   months, seasonal trends of the concentrations of volatile organic sulfur
   compounds did not follow a consistent pattern. The restriction of most
   sulfur species to the anoxic layers of the lake indicates that their
   production originates from anaerobic microbial degradation of biomass
   and not from its release from a specific precursor like
   dimethylsulfoniumpropionate as in marine environments.},

Abstract = {The physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment-water
   interface greatly influence distributions of the bottom-feeding amphipod
   Pontoporeia hoyi which is a major component of the Great Lakes aquatic
   food-webs. Sediment-water interface samples from the Great Lakes
   indicate that Pontoporeia densities are positively correlated with
   sediment concentrations of organic carbon, particularly in the upper
   depth range of the species. Pontoporeia is not found in anoxic
   sediments. Growth rates and production of Pontoporeia are influenced by
   the quality of food supplies and there appears to be a seasonal response
   to the down-flux of plankton detritus. Comparisons of numerations and
   distribution patterns also revealed an apparent positive relationship
   between Pontoporeia and sediment-associated bacteria. Interlake
   comparisons of population densities provide no clear evidence of any
   large scale impact by contaminated sediment on this species. Depending
   upon the extent to which organic carbon (OC) is assimilated in the water
   column, bottom sediments may store and buffer the quantity of OC
   available to Pontoporeia. Thus, if the annual down-flux of OC remains
   generally constant, populations of Pontoporeia should also remain
   constant unless influenced by changes in predation intensity.
   Numerations of Pontoporeia revealed that populations of this amphipod
   are much larger in Lake Michigan than in Lake Ontario. We suggest that
   much of this difference can be accounted for by different forms of
   predator-prey interaction near the base of the benthic food-web.
   Commercial fisheries data tend to support this idea. We also speculate
   that differences in the concentration of dissolved silica may figure
   prominantly among factors that affect Pontoporeia population densities.},

Abstract = {Consumer's demand for strawberry has increased during the last decades,
   partly because it is a very attractive fruit from an organoleptic and
   human health point of view, with high C vitamin content. Nowadays, 90\%
   of the strawberry production in Spain is located in the province of
   Huelva; its implantation in Almeria involves growing extra-early
   production cycles that are starting to be covered by third countries
   with similar climate conditions to Almeria (low relative humidity and
   high solar radiation).
   In this work, the effect on precocity of a strawberry cv `Festival' crop
   by means of planting date advance has been evaluated. Besides, yield and
   quality of other three strawberry cultivars ({''}Festival{''}, ``El
   Dorado{''} and ``Magdalena{''}) have also been studied, to assess their
   potential as possible candidates for their implantation in the
   Andalusian coastal areas. Results have shown that an advance of a week
   in the transplant date of the ``Festival{''} variety involves a 15 days
   advance in precocity, advancing the first harvest from December 18th to
   December 3rd. ``Festival{''} and ``El Dorado{''} were more productive
   (6.8 and 6.4 kg m(-2) respectively) than ``Magdalena{''} (5.9 kg m(-2)).
   Regarding fruit quality ``Magdalena{''} had more sugar content (degrees
   Brix) and similar acidity than the other two varieties. The results
   obtained indicate the feasibility of considering strawberry as an
   alternative to the traditional protected crops of the Andalusian coastal
   areas.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyzed the influence of future climate change on
   wind energy potential in the Republic of Serbia. We used climate
   projections from two regional climate models: the coupled regional
   climate model Eta Belgrade University-Princeton Ocean Model (EBU-POM)
   and the Nonhydrostatic Multiscale Model on the B grid (NMMB). First, the
   daily wind speed at 10 m above ground that was simulated with both
   models was verified against observed data at 13 meteorological stations
   in the reference period, 1971-2000. Then, the wind speed at 10 m above
   ground was bias corrected and extrapolated to 70 m above ground, and the
   wind energy density was calculated at the same height. Next, the wind
   speed and wind density energy in a future period, 2071-2100, were
   calculated and compared with the reference period. Based on the analyzed
   results, the annual wind speed from the EBU-POM model underestimates the
   observed values at all stations, while the annual wind speed from NMMB
   model overestimates the observed values at all stations. In comparison
   with the reference period, the annual wind speed in the future will
   decrease in Serbia. These changes are small but statistically
   significant. On the other hand, analyses for different seasons revealed
   that seasonal changes in wind speed will be in the range of +/- 5\%
   relative to the reference period.},

Abstract = {S-wave amplitude variation with offset (AVO) analysis is sensitive to
   the presence of fractures and can provide a high-resolution
   seismic-based fracture characterization as compared with traditionally
   used travel-time- based methods. To determine viable attributes for
   estimation of properties such as spatial density and fluid fill of
   fractures, S-wave AVO modeling and analysis is carried out in the
   Wellington Field, Kansas, where 9C-2D seismic data have been acquired.
   Analysis is performed on the Ordovician fractured-carbonate interval
   called the Arbuckle Group, which is being considered for CO2
   sequestration. AVO modeling of the Arbuckle interval indicates that
   differences in AVO intercepts of different S-wave polarizations can
   estimate S-wave anisotropy parameter gamma, which gives an estimate of
   fracture density. In addition, modeling suggests that AVO gradients of
   S-V and S-H waves can be used to derive a seismic attribute to
   discriminate fluid fill in fractures, provided good-quality S-wave
   gathers are available. The intercept anisotropy (IA) attribute obtained
   from AVO intercepts of S-waves provides fracture density estimates
   within the Arbuckle Group. These estimates are consistent with the
   field-wide, low-frequency observations from seismic velocities and
   spatially limited, high-frequency estimates obtained from drill cores
   and sonic and borehole-image logs. The IA attribute highlights possible
   high-permeability zones in the Upper and Lower Arbuckle suitable for CO2
   injection. The Middle Arbuckle indicates low fracture density,
   potentially acting as a baffle to vertical flow and providing a seal for
   the Lower Arbuckle. The gradient anisotropy attribute obtained from the
   AVO gradient of S-waves suggests that most fractures in the Arbuckle are
   brine saturated. This attribute has a potential application in
   monitoring the movement of a CO2 plume in the Arbuckle Group when
   time-lapse data become available. These results demonstrate that S-wave
   AVO attributes can supplement the P-wave derived subsurface properties
   and significantly reduce uncertainties in subsurface fracture
   characterization.},

Abstract = {The dry belt of Nigeria lies within the sudano-sahelian savannah of West
   Africa with the most sensitive and delicately balanced ecological
   systems in the world. With the increased pressure of desertification,
   prolonged drought and human activities, the need for intervention for
   the sustainable land use involves maximizing the net benefits of
   economic development subject to maintaining or enhancing the services
   and quality of natural resources overtime. In the sahel of west Africa,
   the issue is not that of economics of profitability but rather that of
   maintaining self sufficiency in food production and survival. The paper
   presents a synopsis of interventions by government, non-governmental
   organizations and international agencies. Among the interventions for
   sustainable land use of Nigeria's dry belts are: afforestation
   programme, seedling production project, forest reserve development,
   forest shelterbelt project fuelwood poles and small timber supply
   project, rural tree planting programme, village woodlot scheme, tannin
   industrial project, gum Arabic production project and protective
   plantation of water catchment and dam areas. Others are land reclamation
   and road side planting, adaptive forest research, second forestry
   programme, urban forestry, fauna preservation protection and control
   projects. Others intervention activities are ECWA community based
   development, Northeast arid zone development programme, agricultural
   development project, hadejia-Ngure wetlands conservation projects, farm
   forestry, sand dune fixation, annual tree planting campaign, community
   awareness and mass mobilization, environmental education and training,
   and community fish pond. The lessons and limitations of these programmes
   and projects for sustainable land use in the semi and and and areas of
   Nigeria were explored in the paper.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with part of the first results of three years
   investigation activities, carried on in the Dar Es Salaam coastal plain
   (Tanzania) by the ACC-DAR project, a cofoundend research project,
   granted by the European Union, leaded by the Sapienza, University of
   Rome, in cooperation with Ardhi University of Dar Es Salaam, Here they
   are presented the effects of precipitations of groundwater salinization.
   As a matter of fact, in the last fifteen years the Dar Es Salaam coastal
   plan has been involved in a hard increasing of groundwater exploitation,
   due to population growing up, and, as a consequence of it, it has been
   registered a sensitive increasing in seawater intrusion, partly due also
   to climate change effect. The project, mentioned above, faced many
   aspects related to the adaptation to climate change by Dar Es Salaam
   people. In the framework of the project they were carried on 5
   groundwater monitoring campaigns, involving about 80 boreholes spread
   all over Dar Es Salaam municipality. In the following they are presented
   the results of the elaboration of chemical analysis data, coming from
   two different monitoring campaigns, driven in June 2012 and in November
   2012. The interpretation of these elaborations, carried on by the
   application of Stuyfzand classification method (6), let us to evidence
   that seawater intrusion on groundwater quality is affected by the
   precipitation rate of the area, which is strictly related to climatic
   conditions and their modifications},

Abstract = {We analysed mixed-layer seasonal and interannual variability in
   phytoplankton biomass and macronutrient (NO3 and Si(OH)(4))
   concentrations from three decades of observations, and nitrogen uptake
   rates from the 1990s along Line P in the NE subarctic Pacific.
   Chlorophyll a concentrations near 0.35 mg m(-3) were observed year-round
   along Line P except at the nearshore station (P4) where chlorophyll a
   concentrations in spring were on average 2.4 times the winter values. In
   contrast, the temporal variability in carbon-to-chlorophyll ratios at
   the two main end members of Line P (P4 and OSP) was high. Large seasonal
   and interannual variability in NO3 and Si(OH)(4) concentration were
   observed along Line P. Highest upper mixed-layer (top 15 m) nutrient
   concentrations occurred on the continental shelf in late summer and
   early fall due to seasonal coastal upwelling. Beyond the shelf, maximum
   nutrient concentrations increased gradually offshore, and were highest
   in late winter and early spring due to mixing by winter storms.
   Interannual variations in upper mixed-layer nutrient concentrations
   beyond the shelf (> 128 degrees W) were correlated with E-W winds and
   the PDO since 1988 but were not correlated with either climate index
   between 1973 and 1981. Despite differences in nutrient concentration,
   nutrient utilization (Delta NO3 and ASi(OH)(4)) during the growing
   season were about 7.5 mu M at all offshore stations. Variations in Delta
   NO3 were correlated with those of ASi(OH)(4). The annual cycle of
   absolute NO3 uptake (pNO(3)) and NH4 uptake (pNH(4)) rates by
   phytoplankton in the upper mixed-layer showed a weak increasing trend
   from winter to spring/summer for the period 1992-1997. Rates were more
   variable at the nearshore station (P4). Rates of pNO(3) were low along
   the entire line despite abundant NO3 and low iron (Fe), at the offshore
   portion of Line P and sufficient Fe at the nearshore station (N). As a
   result, new production contributed on average to only 32 +/- 15\% of the
   total nitrogen (N) uptake along Line P. NO3 Utilization in the NE
   subarctic Pacific is probably controlled by a combination of
   environmental variables, including Fe, light and ambient NH4 levels.
   Elevated ambient NH4 Concentrations seem to decrease the rates of new
   production (andf-ratios) in surface waters of the oceanic subarctic NE
   Pacific. Contrary to expectation, phytoplankton biomass, nutrient
   utilization (Delta NO3 and ASi(OH)(4)), and nitrogen uptake
   (pNO(3)+pNH(4)) varied relatively little along Line P, despite
   significant differences in the factors controlling phytoplankton
   composition assemblages and production. Future studies would benefit
   from including other variables, especially light limitation, to improve
   our understanding of the seasonal and interannual variability in
   phytoplankton biomass and nutrients in this region. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {FSO (Floating Storage and Offloading) Vessel is type of vessel used in
   upstream oil and gas industry to store and deliver crude oil or
   condensate from subsea well to trading tanker or pipeline. FSO Kakap
   Natuna owned by Government of Indonesia used in Natuna Sea, operates
   diesel engine for supplying its electrical demand. The vessel has
   constant operation as well as its electrical load with daily average is
   11.18 MWh/day. The consideration of installing photovoltaic in this
   vessel are: solar radiation in that area ranging from 4.21 5.00
   kWh/m(2)/day, wide surface deck with less facilities, and the cost
   efficiency especially related to Cost Recovery of upstream oil and gas
   industries. The calculation gained the usage of 6,903 m(2) area in
   vessel's deck and 3,551 unit of solar panel that generates up to 5.6
   MWh/day. Feasibility study of this installation come up with yearly cost
   reduction of US\$ 829,687 and 4 year return period of investment. This
   beneficiary may lead into further policies of having such installation
   on FSO owned by Government that operates in prolonged period or lease

Title = {Combined longshore and cross-shore shoreline model for closed embayed
   beaches},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {158},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This research focuses on the development of a simple and efficient
   transect based long-term shoreline model. The new modeling tool is a
   combination of a model for the shoreline changes due to the gradients in
   longshore drift and a heuristic cross-shore shoreline model. The
   cross-shore part of the model uses an up-to-date semi-empirical
   shoreline evolution model based on the equilibrium beach state
   assumption. A physics-based longshore shoreline model is developed on
   the same premises as the one-line type approach based on the longshore
   sand budget and assumes no loss of sediment of the embayed system. The
   derivation of the longshore part of the model explicitly decouples the
   average shoreline position from its fluctuating components. An important
   result is that the equilibrium shoreline orientation is shown to depend
   on the time correlation between the incoming wave power and the
   difference between the instantaneous and the time average wave
   incidence. As a test case, the combined shoreline model is calibrated
   with the wave and shoreline data of the embayed beach of Narrabeen,
   Australia. A separate analysis of each contribution reveals that the
   long-term trend is mostly a longshore drift contribution and
   surprisingly, part of seasonal shoreline variability is attributed to
   longshore drift processes.},

Title = {Evolution of Self-Assembled Au NPs by Controlling Annealing Temperature
   and Dwelling Time on Sapphire (0001)},
Journal = {NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {Au nanoparticles (NPs) have been utilized in a wide range of device
   applications as well as catalysts for the fabrication of nanopores and
   nanowires, in which the performance of the associated devices and
   morphology of nanopores and nanowires are strongly dependent on the
   size, density, and configuration of the Au NPs. In this paper, the
   evolution of the self-assembled Au nanostructures and NPs on sapphire
   (0001) is systematically investigated with the variation of annealing
   temperature (AT) and dwelling time (DT). At the low-temperature range
   between 300 and 600 degrees C, three distinct regimes of the Au
   nanostructure configuration are observed, i.e., the vermiform-like Au
   piles, irregular Au nano-mounds, and Au islands. Subsequently, being
   provided with relatively high thermal energy between 700 and 900 degrees
   C, the round dome-shaped Au NPs are fabricated based on the Volmer-Weber
   growth model. With the increased AT, the size of the Au NPs is gradually
   increased due to a more favorable surface diffusion while the density is
   gradually decreased as a compensation. On the other hand, with the
   increased DT, the size and density of Au NPs decrease due to the
   evaporation of Au at relatively high annealing temperature at 950
   degrees C.},

Title = {A temperature-based model for global solar irradiance and its

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH},

Volume = {35},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {A new model for collectable solar energy estimation via air temperature
   data is proposed. The model (to be called SEAT) runs in the standard
   way: first global solar irradiance is computed, and then a cloud cover
   correction is applied, to end with the summing up of the results for
   daily global solar irradiation. To address the issue that air
   temperature-based models are sensitive to their origin location, an
   adaptive algorithm is reported. Comparison of SEAT forecast with
   measured data from 15 European stations, located between 40 and 501
   northern latitudes and altitudes lower than 500 m, shows an acceptable
   level of accuracy of the new model. The relative root mean square of
   monthly mean of daily global solar irradiation has been found between
   0.055 and 0.112 for continental sites and between 0.064 and 0.156 for
   seacoast sites. The way of embedding cloudiness into the solar
   irradiance procedure calculation and the method of relating daily mean
   cloudiness with daily air temperature extremes are the main novelty
   features of SEAT. The approach for SEAT is described en detail to guide
   potential users either to further develop more complex similar models or
   to simplify them by particularization. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Title = {A new Permian bivalve-dominated assemblage in the Rio do Rasto
   Formation, Parana Basin, Brazil: Faunal turnover driven by
   regional-scale environmental changes in a vast epeiric sea},

Abstract = {The basal portion of the Permian Rio do Rasto Formation (Serrinha
   Member), Passa Dois Group, Parana Basin, Brazil, records an entirely new
   bivalve fauna intercalated between the underlying Pinzonella neotropica
   assemblage (uppermost portion of the Teresina Formation) and the
   overlying Leinzia similis assemblage (Rio do Rasto Formation). Mollusks
   of these assemblages lived in marginal shallow-water habitats of an
   immense epeiric sea and were dominated by endemic bivalve species.
   Taxonomic analysis revealed the presence of Terraia curvata (60.61\%),
   Astartellopsis prosoclina (19.70\%), Cowperesia emerita (10.61\%),
   Leinzia curta (4.55\%), Terraia bipleura (3.03\%) and Beurlenella
   elongatella (1.52\%), which are associated with conchostracans and plant
   remains. Species composition, abundance, and dominance in this novel
   assemblage differ notably from the preceding ones, suggesting a
   substantial evolutionary turnover. Regional-scale environmental changes
   recognized based on taphonomy, facies analysis, and geochemical data
   consist of progressive freshening of the marginal habitats of the Parana
   Basin and taxic changes that include the following: (a) loss of genera,
   (b) decrease in bivalve abundance and ecological guilds, (c)
   disappearance of the dominant bivalve group (Pinzonellinae) and (d)
   diversification of Terrainae bivalves. The ecological signature also
   changed notably because only infaunal suspension-feeding bivalves are
   present, indicating a significant loss of functional diversity at the
   regional scale. Likely stressor factors (among others) are tied to
   freshening events, suggesting profound changes in (a) salinity, (b)
   primary productivity and (c) a lack of coarse, stable substrates coupled
   with high bioturbation rates. Hence, our regional example could offer
   valuable clues to benthic (bivalve) community responses in a habitat
   subjected to (a) rapid climate changes and (b) freshening events in
   shallow-water settings. Finally, the stratigraphic range of the dominant
   species (T curvata) appears to be restricted to the basal portion of the
   Rio do Rasto Formation. Based on the presence of this species and of C.
   emerita, the novel assemblage is tentatively correlated with that of the
   Permian Gal-As Formation in the Huab region of Namibia, thus supporting
   previous assumptions of a seaway connecting both basins during the
   Guadalupian Epoch. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Upper Ocean and Subsurface Variability in the Bay of Bengal During

Abstract = {In this study, the upper ocean and subsurface variability during the
   different phases of the cyclonic storm ROANU along the western Bay of
   Bengal (BoB) in May 2016 are investigated by using the moored buoys,
   Argos, HF radar and satellite datasets in the proximity of the cyclone
   track. The moored buoy observations recorded a decrease of sea surface
   temperature (SST) by similar to 1 degrees C all over the track, whereas
   increase in salinity by similar to 1.5 PSU was detected along with the
   highest wind speed of 16ms(-1), pressure drop of 14hPa and air
   temperature drop of 4 degrees C. The cooling at the cyclone centers from
   the satellite data indicated higher (lower) SST drops when translation
   speed of the cyclone was low (high) and took more (less) time to recover
   to its pre-cyclone state in southern (northern) BoB. Mostly, higher SST
   drop was observed along the right side of the cyclone track.
   Interestingly, the opposite phenomenon occurred before landfall, where
   SST drop was higher on the left due to upwelling in the head bay as
   observed both from wave rider buoy (WRB) at Digha and satellite SST. The
   WRB near Vizag showed the maximum increase in significant wave heights
   by similar to 2.4m during the passage of cyclone. Argos also captured
   cyclone-induced drop in temperature due to upwelling and entrainment
   reasonably well. In the southwestern bay, significant upwelling was
   observed from the Argos with drop in temperature and increase in
   salinity in the upper layers. However, a strong stratification was
   observed from Argos in the northwestern BoB due to lesser salinity and
   higher precipitation. The currents from in situ as well as HF radar
   datasets measured the increase in current magnitude during the passage
   of ROANU. Rotary spectral analysis showed strong inertial currents with
   frequency similar to 2.1days at BD11 location, with higher amplitudes of
   the clockwise component during the cyclone period.},

Abstract = {The scarcity of fossil fuels affects the efficiency of established modes
   of cargo transport within the transportation industry. Extensive
   research is being carried out on improving the efficiency of existing
   modes of cargo transport, as well as developing alternative means of
   transporting goods. One such alternative method is using energy
   contained within fluid flowing in pipelines to transfer goods from one
   place to another. The present study focuses on the use of advanced
   numerical modelling tools to simulate the flow within hydraulic capsule
   pipelines (HCPs) transporting spherical capsules with an aim of
   developing design equations. Hydraulic capsule pipeline refers to the
   transport of goods in hollow containers (capsules), typically spherical
   or cylindrical in shape, which are carried along the pipeline by water.
   HCPs are used in mineral industries and have potential for use in oil
   and gas sectors. A novel modelling technique was employed to investigate
   various geometric and flow conditions within HCPs. Both qualitative and
   quantitative flow analyses were carried out on the flow of spherical
   capsules in an HCP for both onshore and offshore applications.
   Furthermore, based on the least-cost principle, an optimization
   methodology was developed for the design of single-stage HCPs. The input
   to the optimization model is the solid throughput required from the
   system, and the outputs are the optimal diameter of the HCPs and the
   pumping requirements for the capsule transporting system.},

Abstract = {Untreated wastewaters have been a great concern and can cause major
   pollution problems for environment. Conventional approaches for treating
   wastewater involve tremendous capital cost, have major short comings and
   are not sustainable. Microalgae culture offers an interesting step for
   wastewater treatment. Microalgae serve the dual purpose of
   phycoremediation along with the production of potentially valuable
   biomass, which can be used for several purposes. The ability of
   microalgae to accumulate nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals and other
   toxic compounds can be integrated with wastewater treatment system to
   offer an elegant solution towards tertiary and quaternary treatment. The
   current review explores possible role of microalgal based wastewater
   treatment and explores the current progress, key challenges, limitations
   and future prospects with special emphasis on strategies involved in

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {In order to examine the potential interactive pressures of local
   pollution and global climate change, we exposed corals and crustose
   coralline algae (CCA) to three agricultural photosystem II (PSII)
   herbicides at four temperatures (26-32 degrees C). The coral Acropora
   millepora was 3- to 10-fold more sensitive to the three herbicides than
   the CCA Neogoniolithon fosliei. While the photosynthesis of CCA was not
   affected by the herbicide concentrations used (< 1 mu g L-1),
   temperatures of 31 degrees C and 32 degrees C alone significantly
   inhibited photosynthetic efficiency (Delta F: F-m') and caused chronic
   photoinhibition (reduced F-v : F-m) and substantial bleaching.
   Environmentally relevant concentrations of each herbicide increased the
   negative effects of thermal stress on coral at 31 degrees C and 32
   degrees C. Mixed model analyses of variance showed that the effects of
   elevated sea surface temperatures (SST) and herbicide on photosynthetic
   efficiency of coral symbionts were additive. Furthermore, the effect of
   either diuron or atrazine in combination with higher SST (31 degrees C
   and 32 degrees C) on chronic photoinhibition was distinctly greater than
   additive (synergistic). Reducing the herbicide concentration by 1 mu g
   L-1 diuron above 30 degrees C would protect photosynthetic efficiency by
   the equivalent of 1.8 degrees C and reduce chronic photoinhibition by
   the equivalent of a 1 degrees C reduction. Reduced water quality
   increases the vulnerability of corals to elevated SSTs, and effective
   management of local water quality can reduce negative effects of global
   stressors such as elevated SST.},

Abstract = {The Kuh e Dena sedimentary section in Iran developed on the southwestern
   margin of the Neotethys Ocean. The fossil-and bioturbation-lean Early
   Triassic section (Late Dienerian to Early Smithian) is typified by
   finely laminated calcareous shales that are interbedded with laterally
   extending carbonate beds, which are mostly composed of calyx-shaped
   carbonate crystal fans. The calyxes consist of fibrous crystals that
   apparently formed within the subseafloor in soft, water-saturated
   sediment by displacive growth. Rare earth element and yttrium patterns
   indicate that calyx-shaped crystals precipitated from anoxic pore
   waters. Biomarker patterns of the carbonate beds reveal major input of
   lipids from prokaryotes that typically occur within layered benthic
   microbial mats (i.e., cyanobacteria, anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria,
   sulphate-reducing bacteria, and methanogenic archaea). Along their
   length, the fibrous crystals of the calyxes reveal a trend of increasing
   delta C-13(carb) values (from 2.7 to 33 parts per thousand.), suggesting
   that archaeal methanogenesis affected the carbonate pool. Apart from the
   putative benthic prokaryotes, molecular fossils of halophilic, most
   likely planktic, archaea were detected in the carbonate beds. Low
   pristane to phytane ratios (<= 0.8) and the presence of halophilic
   archaea are in accord with the lack of bioclasts and bioturbation, which
   likely reflects increased salinities. The former presence of a benthic
   microbial mat with cyanobacteria underlain by anoxygenic phototrophic
   bacteria, sulphate-reducing bacteria, and methanogenic archaea is in
   accordance with studies on living microbial mats in hypersaline,
   low-oxygen marine environments. The Early Triassic subseafloor seems to
   have been a sink for carbon, driven by biologically-induced formation of
   secondary, diagenetic carbonate. (C) 2013 International Association for

Abstract = {Subterranean mammals show lower than-allometrically expected-basal
   metabolic rates (BMR), and several competing hypotheses were suggested
   to explain how physical microenvironmental conditions and underground
   life affect subterranean mammalian energetics. Two of these are the
   thermal-stress and the cost-of-burrowing hypotheses. The thermal-stress
   hypothesis posits that a lower mass-independent BMR reduces overheating
   in burrows where convective and evaporative heat loss is low, whereas
   the cost-of-burrowing hypothesis states that a lower mass-independent
   BMR may compensate for the extremely high energy expenditure of digging
   during foraging activity. In this paper we tested both hypotheses at an
   intraspecific level. We compared seven populations of the subterranean
   rodent Spalacopus cyanus or cururo from different geographic localities
   with contrasting habitat conditions. We measured BMR and digging
   metabolic rate (DMR) through open flow respirometry. Our results support
   neither the thermal-stress nor the cost-of-burrowing hypothesis. Cururos
   from habitats with contrasting climatic and soil conditions exhibited
   similar BMR and DMR when measured under similar semi-natural conditions.
   It is possible that S. cyanus originated in Andean locations where it
   adapted to relatively hard soils. Later, when populations moved into
   coastal areas characterized by softer soils, they may have retained the
   original adaptation without further phenotypic changes. (c) 2005

Title = {Resilient forest faunal communities in South Africa: a legacy of
   palaeoclimatic change and extinction filtering?},

Abstract = {Aim To examine the influence of climatic extinction filtering during the
   last glacial maximum (LGM; c. 18,000 yr BP) and of the subsequent
   recolonization of forest faunas on contemporary assemblage composition
   in southern African forests.
   Location South Africa, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zimbabwe.
   Methods Data comprised presence/absence by quarter-degree grid cell for
   forest- dependent and forest- associated birds, non-volant mammals and
   frogs. Twenty-one forest subregions were assigned to one of three
   previously identified forest types: Afrotemperate, scarp, and Indian
   Ocean coastal belt. Differences among forest types were examined through
   patterns and gradients of species richness and endemism, assemblage
   similarity, species turnover, and coefficients of species dispersal
   direction. The influence of contemporary environment on assemblage
   composition was investigated using partial canonical correspondence
   analysis. Several alternative biogeographical hypotheses for the
   recolonization of forest faunas were tested.
   Results Afrotemperate faunas are relatively species-poor, have low
   species turnover, and are unsaturated and infiltrated by generalist
   species. In northern and central regions, communities are supplemented
   by recolonization from scarp forest refugia, and among frogs by
   autochthanous speciation in localized refugia. Scarp faunas are
   relatively species-rich, contain many forest- dependent species, have
   high species turnover, and overlap with coastal and Afrotemperate
   faunas. Coastal forests are relatively species-rich with high species
   turnover.
   Main conclusions Afrotemperate communities were affected most by
   climatic extinction filtering events. Scarp forests were Afrotemperate
   refugia during the LGM and are a contemporary overlap zone between
   Afrotemperate and coastal forest. Coastal faunas derive from post-LGM
   colonization along the eastern seaboard from tropical East African
   refugia. The greatest diversity is achieved in scarp and coastal forest
   faunas in northern KwaZulu-Natal province. This historical centre of
   diversity has influenced the faunal diversity of nearly all other
   forests in South Africa. The response of vertebrate taxa to large-scale,
   historical processes is dependent on their relative mobility: forest
   birds best illustrate patterns resulting from post-glacial faunal
   dispersal, while among mammals and frogs the legacy of climatic
   extinction filtering remains stronger.},

Abstract = {Downslope winds and lee gravity waves are common features of mountainous
   environments. A similar weather type at Mt. Parnassos in Arachova,
   Greece is known as ``Katevatos{''} and has devastating results for the
   population and visitors at the local touristic resorts. In this study,
   we analyze three incidents of this atmospheric pattern at local scale
   resolution (1 x 1 km) with WRF model. This is the first study of this
   local weather hazard, and the following key factors are identified. (I)
   The main synoptic forcing is the propagation of an upper-level trough
   from central Europe towards the Balkans. (II) The associated generation
   of a surface low-pressure system over the Aegean Sea results in a
   northeast flow in the lower troposphere that is perpendicular to the
   main topographic ridge of Mt. Parnassos. (III) Generation of gravity
   waves and downward reflection of wave energy at the critical level
   between the upper level flow and the undercutting northeast current
   result in the formation of ``Katevatos{''} downslope wind at the lee
   side of the mountain. This hurricane-scale wind is accompanied with
   horizontal transport of frozen rain and snow from the mountain tops
   towards the village of Arachova. This wind pattern appeared also during
   the battle of Arachova in November 1826 between the Greek and Ottoman
   forces resulting in enormous casualties due to the adverse weather
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Biogeochemical reactions within intertidal zones of coastal aquifers
   have been shown to alter the concentrations of terrestrial solutes prior
   to their discharge to surface waters. In organic-poor sandy aquifers,
   the input of marine organic matter from infiltrating seawater supports
   active biogeochemical reactions within the sediments. However, while the
   seasonality of surface water organic carbon concentrations (primary
   production) and groundwater mixing have been documented, there is
   limited understanding of the transience of various organic carbon pools
   (pore water particulate, dissolved, sedimentary) within the aquifer and
   how these relate to the location and magnitudes of biogeochemical
   reactions over time. To understand the relationship between changes in
   groundwater flow and the seasonal migration of geochemical patterns,
   beach pore water and sediment samples were collected and analyzed from
   six field sampling events spanning 2 years. While the seasonally dynamic
   patterns of aerobic respiration closely followed those of salinity,
   redox conditions and nutrient characteristics (distributions of N and P,
   denitrification rates) were unrelated to contemporaneous salinity
   patterns. This divergence was attributed to the spatial variations of
   reactive particulate organic carbon distributions, unrelated to salinity
   patterns, likely due to filtration, retardation, and immobilization
   dynamics during transport within the sediments. Results support a
   ``carbon memory{''} effect within the beach, with the evolution and
   migration of reaction patterns relating to the distribution of these
   scattered carbon pools as more mobile solutes move over less mobile
   pools during changes in hydrologic conditions. This holds important
   implications for the prediction and quantification of biogeochemical
   reactions within beach systems.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the drivers of beach morphodynamics on the
   highly modified fetch-limited beaches of the urbanised north-eastern
   coast of Port Phillip Bay in south-eastern Australia. Repetitive beach
   profiling, sediment characterization, and aerial photo analysis were
   conducted to quantify morphodynamic change across six distinct beach
   systems on a seasonal to annual-decadal scale. The observed morphologies
   contained features similar to those found on open-ocean wave-dominated
   and tide-dominated beaches, and included reflective unbarred beaches and
   intermediate beaches with low-tide terraces or transverse bar-rip
   systems. Sediment typically ranged from medium to coarse or very coarse
   in size. The consistency of wave energy across the study sites suggests
   that sediment size is the primary determinant of beach morphodynamic
   state, and the relatively low energy of Port Phillip Bay suggests that
   only storm conditions are energetic enough to mobilise sediment and
   alter beach morphology. On a seasonal scale, alongshore sediment
   transport is a major driver of beach change, and groynes and other
   coastal modifications have considerable influence on planform beach
   morphology. Over the medium term it appears that these beaches are
   eroding towards a landward position of equilibrium. With current
   projections of sea level rise it is expected that rates of beach erosion
   and sediment loss will accelerate over the coming decades, leading to an
   increased necessity for beach renourishment or other management
   interventions if wide beach profiles are to be maintained.},

Title = {The geochemistry of the 2.75 Ga-old Helen Iron Formation, Wawa, Ontario
   - Insights into iron formation deposition from carbon isotopes and rare
   earth elements},

Abstract = {A high resolution stratigraphically controlled rare earth element and
   carbon isotope study of the 2.75 Ga old Algoma-type Helen Iron Formation
   has provided new insights into the chemistry of late Archean seawater.
   The Helen Iron Formation passes from a sediment dominated by rhyolitic
   detrital material in the first 20 m of the section into a purely
   chemical sediment reflecting the chemistry of the seawater from which it
   precipitated. An overprint of a hydrothermal signature, seen in the
   development of a positive europium anomaly, increasing in magnitude
   upsection is in good accordance with field observations indicating a
   deepening of the Helen basin through time. The lack of a cerium anomaly
   along with the predominance of Fe2+ over Fe3+ indicates that oxygen
   played a minor role in the deposition of the Helen Iron Formation.
   Carbon isotope data are unusual for iron formation as they cluster
   around 0 parts per thousand (VPDB) and indicate direct precipitation
   from seawater. However, highly negative carbon isotope excursions
   suggest two episodes of dissimilatory iron reduction in sediments rich
   in organic matter, the negative carbon isotope signatures being
   inherited from the oxidation of this organic matter. These excursions
   have high magnitudes of 3 and 10.5 parts per thousand, respectively.
   These results indicate that the Helen Iron Formation was deposited in a
   restricted basin with high input of Fe2+ from distal hydrothermal
   sources and high levels of CO2, explained by submarine volcanic activity
   in the Helen Basin. We suggest that CO2 and Fe oversaturation led to the

Abstract = {Marine sponges in the genus Ircinia are known to be good sources of
   secondary metabolites with biological activities. A major obstacle in
   the development of sponge-derived metabolites is the difficulty in
   ensuring an economic, sustainable supply of the metabolites. A promising
   strategy is the ex situ culture of sponges in closed or semiclosed
   aquaculture systems. In this study, the marine sponge Ircinia strobilina
   (order Dictyoceratida: family Irciniidae) was collected from the wild
   and maintained for a year in a recirculating aquaculture system.
   Microbiological and molecular community analyses were performed on
   freshly collected sponges and sponges maintained in aquaculture for 3
   months and 9 months. Chemical analyses were performed on wild collected.
   sponges and individuals maintained in aquaculture for 3 months and I
   year. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to assess the
   complexity of and to monitor changes in the microbial communities
   associated with L strobilina. Culture-based and molecular techniques
   showed an increase in the Bacteroidetes and Alpha- and
   Gaminaproteobacteria components of the bacterial community in
   aquaculture. Populations affiliated with Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria,
   Clostridia, and Planctomycetes emerged in sponges maintained in
   aquaculture. The diversity of bacterial communities increased upon
   transfer into aquaculture.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Unusually hot weather is a major concern to public health as well as
   other systems (e.g., ecological, economical, energy). This study
   utilized spatially continuous and homogenized observational surface
   climate data to examine changes in the regularity of heat waves in the
   continental United States. This included the examination of heat waves
   according only to daytime temperatures, nighttime temperatures, and both
   daytime and nighttime temperatures. Results confirmed a strong increase
   in the prevalence of heat waves between the mid-1970s and the dataset
   end (2015), and that increase was preceded by a mild decrease since the
   dataset beginning (1948). Results were unclear whether the prevalence of
   nighttime or simultaneous daytime-nighttime heat waves increased the
   most, but it was clear that increases were largest in the summer. The
   largest gains occurred in the West and Southwest, and a warming hole was
   most conspicuous in the northern Great plains. The changes in heat wave
   prevalence were similar to changes in the mean temperatures, and more so
   in the daytime heat waves. Daytime and nighttime heat waves coincided
   with one another more frequently in recent years than they did in the
   1970s. Some parts of the United States (West Coast) were more likely
   than other parts to experience daytime and nighttime heat waves
   simultaneously. While linear trends were not sensitive to the climate
   dataset, trend estimation method, or heat wave definition, they were
   mildly sensitive to the start and end dates and extremely sensitive to
   the climate base period method (fixed in time or directly preceding any
   given heat wave).},

Title = {A generic framework for power system flexibility analysis using
   cooperative game theory},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {212},
Pages = {223-232},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Electricity grid infrastructures provides valuable flexibility in power
   systems with high shares of variable supply due to its ability to
   distribute low-cost supply to load centers (spatial), in addition to
   interlinking a variety of supply and demand characteristics that
   potentially offset each others negative impact on system balance
   (temporal). In this paper, we present a framework to investigate the
   benefits of alternative flexibility providers, such as fast-ramping gas
   turbines, hydropower and demand side management, by using a generation
   and transmission capacity expansion planning model. We demonstrate our
   findings with a multinational case study of the North Sea Offshore Grid
   with an infrastructure typology from year 2016 and operational data for
   year 2030 considering a range of renewable capacity levels spanning from
   0\% to 100\%. First, we show how different flexibility providers are
   allocated geographically by the model. Second, operational cost savings
   are quantified per incremental unit of flexible capacity. Finally, we
   present a way to rank different flexibility providers by considering
   their marginal contribution to aggregate cost savings, reduced CO2
   emissions, and increased utilization of renewable energy sources in the
   system. The Shapley Value from cooperative game theory allows us to
   assess the latter benefits accounting for all possible sequences of
   technology deployment, in contrast to traditional approaches. The
   presented framework could help to gain insights for energy policy
   designs or risk assessments.},

Title = {Mapping salt-marsh vegetation by multispectral and hyperspectral remote

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {105},
Number = {1},

Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Tidal marshes are characterized by complex patterns both in their
   geomorphic and ecological features. Such patterns arise through the
   elaboration of a network structure driven by the tidal forcing and
   through the interaction between hydrodynamical, geophysical and
   ecological components (chiefly vegetation). Intertidal morphological and
   ecological structures possess characteristic extent (order of
   kilometers) and small-scale features (down to tens of centimeters) which
   are not simultaneously accessible through field observations, thus
   making remote sensing a necessary observation tool. This paper describes
   a set of remote sensing observations from several satellite and airborne
   platforms, the collection of concurrent ground reference data and the
   vegetation distributions that may be inferred from them, with specific
   application to the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). The data set comprises
   ROSIS, CASI, MIVIS, IKONOS and QuickBird acquisitions, which cover a
   wide range of spatial and spectral resolutions. We show that
   spatially-detailed and quantitatively reliable vegetation maps may be
   derived from remote sensing in tidal environments through unsupervised
   (K-means) and supervised algorithms (Maximum Likelihood and Spectral
   Angle Mapper). We find that, for the objective of intertidal vegetation
   classification, hyperspectral data contain largely redundant
   information. This in particular implies that a reduction of the spectral
   features is required for the application of the Maximum Likelihood
   classifier. A large number of experiments with different feature
   extraction/selection algorithms show that the use of four bands derived
   from Maximum Noise Fraction transforms and four RGBI broad bands
   obtained by spectral averaging yield very similar classification
   performances. The classifications from hyperspectral data are somewhat
   superior to those from multispectral data, but the close performance and
   the results of the features reduction experiments show that spatial
   resolution affects classification accuracy much more importantly than
   spectral resolution. Monitoring schemes of tidal environment vegetation
   may thus be based on high-resolution satellite acquisitions accompanied
   by systematic ancillary field observations at a relatively limited
   number of reference sites, with practical consequences of some
   relevance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Dissolved and particulate thorium-234, particulate organic carbon in the
   upper 150 in of water columns from five stations in the Prydz Bay, the
   Southern Ocean were determined during the 22nd Chinese National
   Antarctic Research Expedition (from November 2005 to March 2006). The
   disequilibria between thorium-234 and its parent uranium-238 in upper
   layer was used to derive the averaged residence time of thorium-234,
   which decreased along with the latitude to the south and a minimum
   value, 1 similar to 8 d for particulate thorium-234 and 29 similar to 48
   d for dissolved thorium-234, appeared at the medium latitude station,
   and the export fluxes of thorium-234 were calculated too and a maximum
   value, 0.35 similar to 0.63 Bq/(m(3) . d) for the particulate
   thorium-234 and 0. 44 similar to 0. 65 Bq/(m(3) . d) for the dissolved
   thorium-234, appeared at the same station. The export fluxes of
   particulate organic carbon at different water columns were derived by
   two methods with irreversible scavenging model, and the averaged values
   were 104.7 mmol/ (m(2) . d) (E method) and 120.6 mmol/(m(2) . d) (B
   method), respectively, indicating that a relatively high new production
   would exist in summer in the Prydz Bay where it will play a potential
   significant role in sequestering the absorption CO2 to deeper ocean.},

Title = {Optimal heterogeneity in a simplified highly renewable European
   electricity system},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {913-928},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The resource quality and the temporal generation pattern of variable
   renewable energy sources vary significantly across Europe. In this paper
   spatial distributions of renewable assets are explored which exploit
   this heterogeneity to lower the total system costs for a high level of
   renewable electricity in Europe. Several intuitive heuristic algorithms,
   optimal portfolio theory and a local search algorithm are used to find
   optimal distributions of renewable generation capacities that minimise
   the total costs of backup, transmission and renewable capacity
   simultaneously. Using current cost projections, an optimal heterogeneous
   distribution favours onshore wind, particularly in countries bordering
   the North Sea, which results in average electricity costs that are up to
   11\% lower than for a homogeneous reference distribution of renewables
   proportional to each country's mean load. The reduction becomes even
   larger, namely 18\%, once the transmission capacities are put to zero in
   the homogeneous reference distribution. Heuristic algorithms to
   distribute renewable capacity based on each country's wind and solar
   capacity factors are shown to provide a satisfactory approximation to
   fully optimised renewable distributions, while maintaining the benefits
   of transparency and comprehensibility. The sensitivities of the results
   to changing costs of solar generation and gas supply as well as to the
   possible cross-sectoral usage of unavoidable curtailment energy are also
   examined. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This work focuses on the control of the pitch angle of wind turbines.
   This is not an easy task due to the nonlinearity, the complex dynamics,
   and the coupling between the variables of these renewable energy
   systems. This control is even harder for floating offshore wind
   turbines, as they are subjected to extreme weather conditions and the
   disturbances of the waves. To solve it, we propose a hybrid system that
   combines fuzzy logic and deep learning. Deep learning techniques are
   used to estimate the current wind and to forecast the future wind.
   Estimation and forecasting are combined to obtain the effective wind
   which feeds the fuzzy controller. Simulation results show how including
   the effective wind improves the performance of the intelligent
   controller for different disturbances. For low and medium wind speeds,
   an improvement of 21\% is obtained respect to the PID controller, and
   7\% respect to the standard fuzzy controller. In addition, an intensive
   analysis has been carried out on the influence of the deep learning
   configuration parameters in the training of the hybrid control system.
   It is shown how increasing the number of hidden units improves the
   training. However, increasing the number of cells while keeping the
   total number of hidden units decelerates the training.},

Abstract = {High-resolution marine palynological records from the northern South
   China Sea (SCS) provide new information concerning the regional history
   of vegetation and climate conditions during the last glaciation (-70-19
   cal ka BP). The preservation of rich pollen from tropical and
   subtropical broadleaf trees (largely composed of evergreen Quercus,
   Castanopsis, and Euphorbiaceae) suggests that a southern subtropical
   climate prevailed during the last glaciation, including the period of
   the Last Glacial Maximum. Relatively higher percentages of such pollen
   taxa occurred during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, when Phyllocladus
   pollen from the south also increased, indicating a warmer terrestrial
   climate and a strengthened East Asian summer monsoon comparing to MIS 4
   and 2. Moreover, the maximum percentages of such pollen occurred during
   the early MIS 3, implying that an optimal climate prevailed in this
   period. The reconstructed terrestrial climate corresponds well to marine
   evidence such as 6180 values from planktonic foraminifer shell and
   records of sea surface temperature. This study confirmed that the
   regional terrestrial climate could be linked closely to changes in both
   global ice volume and the East Asian monsoon attributable to variations
   of the earth's orbital parameters. Modern palynological investigations
   and statistical analyses of the pollen percentages in the profiles
   indicate that Pinus pollen and spores are easily transported by water
   flow in the northern SCS. Therefore, their relative abundance peaks
   suggest that several wet intervals occurred during the last glaciation.

Abstract = {Marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices are currently being considered for the
   generation of electrical power in marine tidal regions. Turbulence
   generated in the boundary layers of these channels interacts with a
   turbine to excite the blades into low-to mid-frequency vibration.
   Additionally, the self-generated turbulent boundary layer on the turbine
   blade excites its trailing edge into vibration. Both of these
   hydrodynamic sources generate radiated noise. Being installed in a
   marine ecosystem, the noise generated by these MHK devices may affect
   the fish and marine mammal well-being. Since this MHK technology is
   relatively new, much of the design practice follows that from
   conventional horizontal axis wind turbines. In contrast to other
   underwater turbomachines like conventional merchant ships that have
   solid blades, wind turbine blades are made of hollow fiberglass
   composites. This paper systematically investigates the contrast of this
   design detail on the blade vibration and radiated noise for a particular
   MHK turbine design.},

Abstract = {The upper Yangtze region began to experience in large-scale
   transgression and forming a relatively stable carbonate platform in
   Permian. Understanding the sedimentary-filling pattern and the tectonic
   characteristic of the prototype basin is the key to reveal the formation
   mechanism of the Sichuan Basin, and may also help to better understand
   evolution process of the typical Sichuan multicycle and superimposed
   basin. On the basis of predecessors' research results, we reconstruct
   the tectonic and palaeogeographic framework of the prototype basin and
   analyze the tectonic-sedimentary evolution process during Liangshan and
   Qixia deposition stages by comprehensively making use of borehole and
   outcrop data. Mainly controlled by the ancient land form of high in the
   central and low in the east and west from Late Carboniferous and the
   large scale transgression, the Liangshan stage was characterized by the
   tidal flat and shore face sedimentary system; and subsequently
   transitioned to an relatively stable carbonate platform sedimentary
   environmental during the early stage of Qixia deposition, influenced by
   extending action, the sea level rises relatively and characterized by
   open platform sedimentary environmental; and during the later stage of
   Qixia deposition, the sea level falls relatively and characterized by
   restricted platform, platform-margin beach sedimentary environmental.
   Thus, it reveals that the Sichuan basin and its adjacent areas mainly
   influenced by extending action and could be recognized as a typical
   intracratonic depression with edge rift basin. The cyclical change of
   the sea level and differential settlement of the basin play an important
   role in the evolution of the sedimentary-filling pattern and
   palaeogeographic framework.},

Abstract = {The mathematical and statistical description of waves on the sea surface
   has evolved over more than two centuries starting with Laplace (1776),
   Gerstner (1802), Airy (1845), Stokes (1847), Kelvin (1887), and
   Helmholtz (1888), Most of the major developments in this century are
   summarized by Apel {[}1] who has derived an improved model for the ocean
   surface wave vector spectrum of equilibrium sea states, Part of the
   motivation for this paper is Apel's observation that ``... in spite;of
   the incorporation of an anisotropic angular distribution of wave energy,
   the observed azimuthal variation of radar scatter is not captured...{''}
   The data set analysis summarized in this paper show that wave group
   processes are responsible for directionally organized sea surface radar
   back scattering patterns, which are long lived and consequently extend
   over large areas, This includes crosswind traveling wave systems. A
   property of wave group process structure is the steepening of waves as
   they pass through the center of the group, The mid-group sharpening of
   the waves, which can include crest spilling or breaking, significantly
   increases the radar scattering cross section observable with
   low-grazing-angle radars, usually most noticeable with horizontal (HH)
   polarization, Therefore, low grazing angle (LGA) radar provides a vastly
   improved means of seeing wavegroup phenomena over conventional
   oceanographic methods.},

Abstract = {Climate model emulators have a crucial role in assessing warming levels
   of many emission scenarios from probabilistic climate projections based
   on new insights into Earth system response to CO2 and other forcing
   factors. This article describes one such tool, MCE, from model
   formulation to application examples associated with a recent model
   intercomparison study. The MCE is based on impulse response functions
   and parameterized physics of effective radiative forcing and carbon
   uptake over ocean and land. Perturbed model parameters for probabilistic
   projections are generated from statistical models and constrained with a
   Metropolis-Hastings independence sampler. Some of the model parameters
   associated with CO2-induced warming have a covariance structure, as
   diagnosed from complex climate models of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Perturbed ensembles can cover the
   diversity of CMIP models effectively, and they can be constrained to
   agree with several climate indicators such as historical warming. The
   model's simplicity and resulting successful calibration imply that a
   method with less complicated structures and fewer control parameters
   offers advantages when building reasonable perturbed ensembles in a
   transparent way. Experimental results for future scenarios show distinct
   differences between CMIP-consistent and observation-consistent
   ensembles, suggesting that perturbed ensembles for scenario assessment
   need to be properly constrained with new insights into forced response
   over historical periods.},

Abstract = {Developments in the maritime industry, such as the increasing size of
   container and cruise ships, and the automated/autonomous ship concepts,
   yield technical and operational challenges throughout the life-cycle of
   ships. New interactions increase complexity, resulting in unforeseeable
   system states and risk fluctuations. Despite the development of
   approaches that address some of the limitations of current risk
   management, the sub-systems of the ship are mostly treated separately
   with only partial consideration of interactions between risk factors.
   The main goal of this paper is to introduce a novel framework for
   managing life-cycle risk in the maritime domain, where the ship is
   viewed as an integrated complex system that is subject to change
   throughout its life-cycle. The focus is on enhancing the adaptive
   capability of the system to respond to evolving dynamics and deal with
   unknown and emerging safety threats. In addition, to avoid potential
   problem shifting between life-cycle stages, interactions between risk
   factors and risk propagation are considered. In this context, a change
   in perspective for maritime safety is also proposed, based on the
   concept of biomimicry, considering that biological systems typically
   adapt in a dynamic environment to deal with emerging threats.},

Abstract = {The planning process for California's Marine Life Protection Act in
   north central California represents a case study in the design of a
   regional component of a statewide network of marine protected areas
   (MPAs) for improved ecosystem protection. We describe enabling factors,
   such as a legislative mandate, political will, and adequate capacity and
   funding that fostered a successful planning process. We identify
   strategic principles that guided the design of a transparent public
   planning process that delivered regional MPA network proposals, which
   both met science guidelines and achieved a high level of support among
   stakeholders. We also describe key decision support elements (spatial
   data, planning tools, and scientific evaluation) that were essential for
   designing, evaluating, and refining alternative MPA network proposals
   and for informing decision-makers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Competition for marine space: modelling the Baltic Sea fisheries and

Abstract = {Maritime spatial planning (MSP) and fishery management may generate
   extra costs for fisheries by constraining fishers activity with
   conservation areas and new utilizations of the sea. More
   energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing
   patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to
   vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries
   should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into
   account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector
   conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool
   (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing
   activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The
   assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling
   the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels (> 12 m) in the
   international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the
   underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery
   resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative
   scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating
   the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various
   constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of
   vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which
   compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release
   pressure on the fish stocks. The effort is further redirected away from
   sensitive benthic habitats, enhancing the ecological positive effects.
   The energy efficiency of some of the vessels, however, is strongly
   reduced with the new zonation, and some of the vessels suffer decreased
   profits. The DISPLACE model serves as a spatially explicit bioeconomic
   benchmark tool for management strategy evaluations for capturing
   tactical decision-making in reaction to MSP.},

Title = {Failure analysis of vessel propeller bolts under fastening stress and
   cathode protection environment},
Journal = {ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {129-136},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper describes the failure analysis of propeller blade fastening
   bolts made from martensitic stainless steel 0Cr16Ni5Mo, which was
   ruptured under service of cathode protection for 5 years. The general
   crack pattern of the bolts, fractographic features, hydrogen content
   determination and slow tensile test results are all exhibiting the
   characteristics of hydrogen embrittlement. Accordingly, hydrogen
   diffusion driven by hydrogen concentration gradient and stress
   concentration was identified by experiment and finite element analysis
   (FEA). The morphology of the crack was intergranular of initiation from
   bolt cap root surface, and quasi-cleavage of propagation. The hydrogen
   distribution indicated that the hydrogen concentration in the bolt was
   in gradient distribution, and the region farther away from the sea water
   contains less hydrogen content. This revealed that hydrogen entered the
   bolt top surface through sea water under cathodic protection, and
   diffused from top to cap. The hydrogen content of the cap where crack
   initiated was 7.0 ppm, which was much higher than that in bolt shaft
   with normal content of 1.1 ppm. Results of low tensile test together
   with fractographic observation showed that the brittleness of the bolt
   was enhanced by the effect of hydrogen. Stress distribution calculated
   by FEA analysis indicated that the maximal stress of the bolt was about
   1016 MPa, located at cap root surface which was consistent with crack
   initiation sites. The stress drove hydrogen to accumulate at root
   surface until cracking occurred. In a sum, the failure was attributed to
   the hydrogen diffusion, local high stress, and the martensitic
   microstructure susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Remedial measures
   such as avoiding over protection potential, that increase tempering
   temperature were suggested. Methods to optimize stress distribution of
   the bolt were also suggested based on FEA calculation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Integrating environmental variability to broaden the research on coral
   responses to future ocean conditions},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {21},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Our understanding of the response of reef-building corals to changes in
   their physical environment is largely based on laboratory experiments,
   analysis of long-term field data, and model projections. Experimental
   data provide unique insights into how organisms respond to variation of
   environmental drivers. However, an assessment of how well experimental
   conditions cover the breadth of environmental conditions and variability
   where corals live successfully is missing. Here, we compiled and
   analyzed a globally distributed dataset of in-situ seasonal and diurnal
   variability of key environmental drivers (temperature, pCO(2), and O-2)
   critical for the growth and livelihood of reef-building corals. Using a
   meta-analysis approach, we compared the variability of environmental
   conditions assayed in coral experimental studies to current and
   projected conditions in their natural habitats. We found that annual
   temperature profiles projected for the end of the 21st century were
   characterized by distributional shifts in temperatures with warmer
   winters and longer warm periods in the summer, not just peak
   temperatures. Furthermore, short-term hourly fluctuations of temperature
   and pCO(2) may regularly expose corals to conditions beyond the
   projected average increases for the end of the 21st century. Coral reef
   sites varied in the degree of coupling between temperature, pCO(2), and
   dissolved O-2, which warrants site-specific, differentiated experimental
   approaches depending on the local hydrography and influence of
   biological processes on the carbonate system and O-2 availability. Our
   analysis highlights that a large portion of the natural environmental
   variability at short and long timescales is underexplored in
   experimental designs, which may provide a path to extend our
   understanding on the response of corals to global climate change.},

Title = {Reduction of tropical land region precipitation variability via
   transpiration},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Tropical rainforests are known to exhibit low intraseasonal
   precipitation variability compared with oceanic areas with similar mean
   precipitation in observations and models. In the present study, the
   potential role of transpiration for this difference in precipitation
   variability is investigated using the National Center for Atmospheric
   Research (NCAR) atmospheric general circulation model. Comparing model
   results with and without transpiration shows that in the absence of
   transpiration, mean precipitation decreases as may be expected. However
   the incidence of both higher daily total column water and more intense
   precipitation increases without transpiration; consequently the
   variability of precipitation increases substantially. These results can
   be understood in terms of the complex interplay of local near-surface
   and remote moist dynamical processes with both local positive
   (boundary-layer drying) and large-scale negative (increased large-scale
   convergence) feedbacks when transpiration is disabled in the model. It
   is also shown that surface turbulent fluxes over tropical rainforests
   are highly correlated with incoming solar energy but only weakly
   correlated with wind speed, possibly decoupling land precipitation from
   large-scale disturbances like the Madden-Julian Oscillation. Citation:

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems provide many services and benefits that directly or
   indirectly affect human welfare, and designating an marine protected
   area (MPA) is one of the management strategies for conserving marine
   ecosystem services. In Taiwan, 28 fishery resource conservation zones
   (FRCZs, one type of Taiwanese MPA) have been established since 1976, and
   two FRCZs in Yilan were selected as case studies for this research.
   Interviews and questionnaires were used to collect primary data, and
   then we employed factor analysis to determine what elements influence
   the perception of ecosystem services, and we also evaluated the
   respondents' willingness to pay (WTP). The empirical results indicated
   that supporting services are the most important to the people in the
   study sites, followed by provisioning services. Ecosystem services can
   be divided into four major categories including ecological and
   educational services, provisioning services, regulating services and
   recreational services, and in this study, ecological and educational
   services accounted for the largest proportion of the perceived benefits.
   The perception of and WTP for ecosystem services are significantly
   different across socio-economic backgrounds. According to the findings
   of this research, government agencies need to adopt the ecosystem
   service concept; invest in improving the efficiency of management
   measures, such as ecological and environmental monitoring; develop
   eco-tourism and conduct environmental education and outreach; and
   establish an FRCZ fund to enhance financial sustainability.},

Title = {A Novel SUHI Referenced Estimation Method for Multicenters Urban
   Agglomeration using DMSP/OLS Nighttime Light Data},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The surface urban heat island (SUHI) of urban agglomeration has always
   been an important topic in the studies of urban heat island, especially
   with the development of satellite-based land surface temperature (LST)
   products. However, most studies are limited to the perspective of a
   single city, ignoring the impact of urban agglomeration and the changes
   of LST at day and night on the reference LST (RLST) (e.g., rural areas).
   Consequently, this article proposed a novel method about SUHI intensity
   estimation for the multicenters (mcSUHII) of urban agglomeration in
   Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHMBay) using nighttime
   light (NTL) data (i.e., DMSP/OLS) obtained in October, 2010. The mcSUHII
   method considered the RLST of SUHII estimation based on multicenter
   structure, and was more flexible to adapt the impact of human activity
   intensity. The study showed that compared with other RLSTs, such as
   suburban and forest, mcSUHII mitigates the underestimation bias caused
   by ignoring the multicenter structure. Importantly, the change in SUHII
   for urban agglomerations is greater than for a single city. Moreover, it
   was illustrated that the variation of SUHII presented an obvious
   inverted U-shape along the gradient from the inland to the coastal
   cities. The highest SUHIIs in the delta cities at day and night are
   similar to 7.27 +/- 1.71 degrees C and similar to 4.46 +/- 1.42 degrees
   C, respectively. Additionally, NTL served as the dominator together with
   other factors that were capable of explaining more than 90\% of the
   spatial variation in SUHII in GHMBay. Therefore, considering
   multicenters more in estimation of SUHII of urban agglomeration for the
   sustainable development.},

Abstract = {In order to build a large-scale island microgrid with 100\% penetration
   intermittent photovoltaic power generation as the only power source, a
   structure with multiple role battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is
   proposed in this paper based on the analysis of energy storage demand in
   the island microgrid and performance comparison of two types of
   batteries. The storage system in the proposed structure is composed of
   three types of functional BESSs. In detail, the master control units
   (MCUs) with LiFePO4 batteries are responsible for the voltage and
   frequency stability and instantaneous power balance, slave storage units
   (SSUs) with lead-acid batteries are responsible for daily energy
   storage, and multi-function units (MFUs) with LiFePO4 batteries are used
   for short-time energy regulation. A hierarchical control structure is
   adopted in the system. At the local level, the converters of the MCUs
   are controlled as the voltage sources in paralleled mode as grid-forming
   units, and those of SSUs and MFUs are controlled in the current source
   mode as grid-feeding units. At the system level, a real-time power
   balance coordinated control strategy is proposed, which has the
   capability of efficient and orderly operation of different types of
   BESSs. Simulation and practical operation analysis of the Qumalai
   7.023MW microgrid demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the
   research methods of the island microgrid. (c) 2017 Institute of

Abstract = {Marine oxygen-deficient environments with high sedimentation rates and
   high primary productivity can provide relevant information regarding
   variations of ocean-climatic conditions in the past. In the Humboldt
   current ecosystem, which now hosts huge populations of pelagic fishes
   (mainly anchovy and sardine), fish scale abundance in the sedimentary
   record may be useful indicators of environmental change. Here we assess
   such a proxy record in a 42 cm-long sedimentary core collected from 80
   min Mejillones Bay (23 degrees S, northern Chile). We also analyse fish
   remains in surface sediment sampled along a bathymetric transect (from
   10 to 110 to water depth) in the same bay. In the core-top record, the
   fluctuations of sardine and anchovy scale deposition rates (SDR) agreed
   with those of industrial catches for these two species in northern
   Chile, tending to validate the SDR as a proxy of local fish biomass when
   bottom anoxic conditions prevail. However, apparent SDR for records
   prior to 1820 have probably been influenced by dissolution processes
   linked to the oxygenation of the bottom environment of Mejillones Bay,
   as suggested by other proxy records. After 1820, the fluctuations in the
   relative abundance of sardine and anchovy scales point to alternating
   warm and cold conditions during about 30 years and then a progressively
   cooler period. Since ca. 1870, marked fluctuations of SDR of both
   species are observed, probably as a consequence of the onset of a
   different oceanographic regime characterized by intensified upwelling,
   stronger subsurface oxygen deficiency, higher primary productivity, and
   enhanced ``ENSO-like{''} interdecadal variability. While anchovy SDR
   fluctuated in periods of 25-40 years, only two peak periods of sardine
   SDR occurred (late 19th century and late 20th century), suggesting that
   sardine abundance depends on other ocean-climatic factors. (C) 2008

Title = {Oceanographic drivers of winter habitat use in Cassin's Auklets},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Reduced prey abundance and severe weather can lead to a greater risk of
   mortality for seabirds during the non-breeding winter months. Resource
   patterns in some regions are shifting and becoming more variable in
   relation to past conditions, potentially further impacting survival and
   carryover to the breeding season. As animal tracking technologies and
   methods to analyze movement data have advanced, it has become
   increasingly feasible to draw fine-scale inference about how
   environmental variation affects foraging behavior and habitat use of
   seabirds during this critical period. Here, we used archival
   light-sensing tags to evaluate how interannual variation in oceanography
   affected the winter distribution of Cassin's Auklets from Southeast
   Farallon Island, California. Thirty-five out of 93 geolocators deployed
   from 2015 to 2017 were recovered and successfully recorded light-level
   data, from which geographic positions were estimated. Step-selection
   functions were applied to identify environmental covariates that best
   explained winter movement decisions and habitat use, revealing Cassin's
   Auklets dispersed farther from the colony during a winter with warm SST
   anomalies, but remained more centralized near the breeding colony during
   two average winters. Movement patterns were driven by avoidance of areas
   with higher sea surface temperatures and possible limits of dispersal
   from the breeding colony, and selection for areas with well-defined
   mesoscale fronts and cooler surface waters. Through multiple years of
   tagging and the application of step-selection functions, a robust and
   widely applied approach for analyzing animal movement in terrestrial
   species, we show how interannual differences in the movement patterns of
   a small seabird are driven by oceanographic variability across years.
   Understanding the winter habitat use of seabirds can help inform changes
   in population structure and measures of reproductive success, aiding
   managers in determining potential causes of breeding failures.},

Abstract = {Due to the projected climate change, the living territory of wild
   animals may be reshaped in the future, some of the species may even
   suffer extinction. The aim of this research is to make a comparative
   case study for the future predictions of the European terrestrial
   mammals' vulnerability to the climate change, by using their current
   range area maps (on the basis of The Atlas of the European Mammals). To
   characterize the climate indicators of the animals, we use the annual
   means and/or extremes of four climatic parameters (daily mean
   temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily maximum temperature, daily
   precipitation sum) based on the gridded E-OBS dataset for 1961-1990.
   Then, we determine specific percentiles of the climatic parameters for
   given species. The range area within the specific climatic intervals
   formed by the selected percentile pairs are mapped for the recent past
   (19611990), and also for the middle (2021-2050) and the end (2071-2100)
   of the 21st century using the RACMO (Regional Atmospheric Climate Model)
   simulation for the SRES A1B scenario. Our results suggest that, the
   optimal climatic requirements of the Pipistrellus pipistrellus may
   decrease and shift northward until the end of the 21st century.
   Moreover, this anaysis based on the climate indicator profile technique
   suggests a remarkable change in the habitats of all studied European bat
   species, and their northward migration in order to find their optimal
   conditions. As a result, from the recent past time period of 1961-1990,
   63\% of the studied European bat species will probably suffer habitat
   decrease, while 30\% are likely to experience habitat increase, and 7\%
   is projected to disappear by the end of the 21st century. Due to the
   projected regional climate change in Europe, habitat loss and
   degradation are the greatest threats to the studied bat species.},

Title = {Estimation of the significant wave height in the nearshore using
   prediction equations based on the Response Surface Method},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {143-153},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Response Surface Method (RSM) is introduced to develop prediction
   equations in order to estimate nearshore wave height from offshore wave
   data when the nearshore measurement data were not available or
   sufficient. The main idea of introducing RSM and developing such
   prediction equations is to gain a practical and fast estimation of
   nearshore wave height for a specific region as a substitute for the
   time-consuming and sophisticated numerical wave model in the case of
   long-term wave estimation or frequent wave forecasts. A numerical wave
   model and a semi-analytic fit model derived from the wave energy flux
   conservation equation were used to fit the response surface of nearshore
   wave height and develop the prediction equations. The Haitan Strait
   located in the nearshore area of China East Sea was selected as the
   studying area. A series of measured wave data obtained from an offshore
   buoy and 2 nearshore ultrasonic wave gauges from 30th October 2015 to
   28th March 2016 were taken as an example. The predictions given by the
   proposed equations have correlation coefficients of more than 0.85 and
   root mean square errors of less than 0.19m which are very reasonable
   when the equations are considered to be concise, efficient and
   practical.},

Title = {PRED treatment mediated stable and efficient water oxidation performance
   of the Fe2O3 nano-coral structure},
Journal = {NANOSCALE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {36},
Pages = {14906-14913},
Abstract = {Herein, we demonstrate that an electrochemical surface treatment of Fe
   foil with simple pulse reverse electrodeposition (PRED) prior to thermal
   oxidation can substantially enhance the photoelectrochemical (PEC)
   stability and water splitting performance of Fe2O3/Fe photoanodes.
   Comprehensive structural (XRD, FESEM, and HRTEM), compositional (XPS
   depth profiling), and electrochemical (EIS and Mott-Schottky) analyses
   were performed to understand the effect of PRED treatment on the PEC
   performance of fabricated photoanodes. It is revealed that air-exposed
   Fe foil is prone to formation of a loosely bound surface oxide layer
   that, upon annealing at 800 degrees C, results in an unstable Fe2O3
   nano-flake (2-3 mu m long) morphology. In contrast, when such Fe foil is
   pre-treated with PRED to etch the loosely bound oxide layer, adherent
   inverse-opal-like nano-coral structures (60-100 nm thin) are formed. In
   addition to stability improvement, PRED-treatment also assists in
   exposing the photocatalytically active high index {[}104] facet sites of
   hematite. Thin hematite nano-coral structures with high index {[}104]
   facet sites significantly improved the separation of photo-generated
   charge carriers and oxygen evolution kinetics, resulting in performance
   enhancement with excellent photocurrent stability for extended duration
   in a 1 M NaOH solution under one sun illumination. The net photocurrent
   density for nano-coral morphology was 0.813 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE,
   which is the highest reported value for pristine hematite photoanodes
   fabricated from Fe foil.},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Nanofluidic hybrid membranes integrated with asymmetrical surface
   charge, chemical composition, and geometric configuration exhibit
   unprecedented advantages in capturing the osmotic energy between river
   water and seawater. However, the output power is very restricted by the
   inefficient interfacial ion transport of the permselective membranes
   caused by the low-density pores and mismatch of the pore alignment. In
   this work, we developed a nanofluidic hybrid membrane constructed by
   ultrahigh pore-density covalent organic frameworks COF-LZU1 (Lan Zhou
   University-1) with the carbon nanotube/cellulose nanofiber (CNT-CNF)
   membrane. The COF-LZU1 layer possesses well-ordered and high-density
   pores, ensuring abundant selective ion transport. The CNT-CNF membrane
   functions as a robust support and also offers 3D charged space for the
   enhanced ion transport. The hybridization of the two layers dramatically
   increases the interfacial ion transport efficiency. Employing the
   COF-LZU1@CNT-CNF nanofluidic hybrid membrane to capture the osmotic
   energy stored between natural sea water and river water, a considerably
   high power density of 4.26 W m(-2) is attained. This delicate design
   strategy offers ideas for the application of COF membranes in osmotic
   energy conversion.},

Title = {A Modeling Study of the Impacts of Mississippi River Diversion and
   Sea-Level Rise on Water Quality of a Deltaic Estuary},
Journal = {ESTUARIES AND COASTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Freshwater and sediment management in estuaries affects water quality,
   particularly in deltaic estuaries. Furthermore, climate change-induced
   sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence also affect estuarine water
   quality by changing salinity, circulation, stratification,
   sedimentation, erosion, residence time, and other physical and
   ecological processes. However, little is known about how the magnitudes
   and spatial and temporal patterns in estuarine water quality variables
   will change in response to freshwater and sediment management in the
   context of future SLR. In this study, we applied the Delft3D model that
   couples hydrodynamics and water quality processes to examine the spatial
   and temporal variations of salinity, total suspended solids, and
   chlorophyll-alpha concentration in response to small (142 m(3) s(-1))
   and large (7080 m(3) s(-1)) Mississippi River (MR) diversions under low
   (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative SLR (RSLR = eustatic SLR +
   subsidence) scenarios in the Breton Sound Estuary, Louisiana, USA. The
   hydrodynamics and water quality model were calibrated and validated via
   field observations at multiple stations across the estuary. Model
   results indicate that the large MR diversion would significantly affect
   the magnitude and spatial and temporal patterns of the studied water
   quality variables across the entire estuary, whereas the small diversion
   tends to influence water quality only in small areas near the diversion.
   RSLR would also play a significant role on the spatial heterogeneity in
   estuary water quality by acting as an opposite force to river
   diversions; however, RSLR plays a greater role than the small-scale
   diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of the water quality
   parameters in this deltaic estuary.},

Title = {The redox budget of the Mariana subduction zone},
Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {528},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Assessing the efficiency of material recycling at convergent margins is
   critical to constraining the impact of plate tectonic processes on the
   composition of surface and deep mantle reservoirs on geologic
   timescales. In particular, oceanic lithosphere bearing oxidized phases
   such as Fe-oxy-hydroxides, Fe-oxides, serpentine, carbonate, and sulfate
   minerals, subduct at convergent margins and the infiltration of aqueous
   fluids and sediment melts from the subducting slab into the mantle
   beneath arc volcanoes may thus carry oxidized forms of multi-valent
   elements (e.g., S, Fe, C) and lead to the generation of primitive arc
   melts that record elevated oxygen fugacities relative to mid-ocean ridge
   primitive melts. It is unclear, however, how efficiently aqueous fluids
   and silicate melts transport the oxidized signatures of any given
   subducting slab into the mantle wedge in a single subduction zone, and
   how much, if any, of these oxidized phases may be recycled into the
   deeper mantle. We present a mass balance of Fe3+, S2-, S6+, and C4+, as
   well as the O-2 associated with these species, through the Mariana
   subduction zone to assess the efficiency of recycling oxidized materials
   in an end-member type subduction zone, where old oceanic lithosphere and
   a thick sediment package is subducted. To do this, we report Fe3+/Sigma
   Fe ratios of bulk sediments and altered oceanic crust recovered from ODP
   Site 801 in the western Pacific in order to constrain the bulk
   Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratio of the Pacific plate prior to subduction in the
   Mariana convergent margin. Site 801 sediments have Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios
   >0.69 and the altered oceanic crust (801 Super Composite) has Fe3+/Sigma
   Fe of 0.51. Bulk Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios of altered oceanic crust at Site
   801 increase from 0.14 (pristine Jurassic-aged MORB glass) to 0.78 with
   increasing extent of alteration. We find that 68-95\% of the O-2 added
   to the subducting crust by sedimentation, in situ alteration of basaltic
   crust on the seafloor, and serpentinization of the mantle lithosphere is
   not output by Mariana arc or back-arc magmas. This result demonstrates
   that significant amounts of oxidized materials from Earth's surface are
   transported into the deeper mantle beyond subduction zones, despite the
   production of oxidized arc and back-arc basalts, and may contribute to
   elevated oxygen fugacities recorded by ocean island lavas such as
   Iceland and Hawaii. This oxygen cycle is likely to have been operating
   at least for the past 400-800 million years, and potentially for the
   duration of plate tectonics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exploration of using thermally responsive polyionic liquid hydrogels as

Abstract = {Thermally responsive hydrogels based on ionic liquid monomers of
   tetrabutylphosphonium p-styrenesulfonate (P4444 SS) and
   tributylhexylphosphonium p-styrenesulfonate (P4446 SS) were prepared by
   bulk polymerization in the presence of a crosslinker, and explored as
   draw agents in forward osmosis for the first time. Unlike traditional
   copolymer hydrogels from N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and sodium
   acrylate (SA) or sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonate (AMPS),
   the combination of thermo-sensitivity and the ionic nature in the
   hydrogel was achieved by subtle structure design of the ionic liquid
   monomers. These polyionic liquid hydrogels were proved to be able to
   generate a reasonable water flux from brackish water, and effectively
   release the desalinated water at temperatures above their Lower Critical
   Solution Temperature (LCST). In addition, a set of rational criteria for
   assessing responsive hydrogel draw agents was proposed, for the first
   time, to improve the hydrogels' comprehensive performance. Our studies
   revealed that, both intrinsic factors including hydrogel structure,
   membrane structure and hydrogel particle-particle contact conditions as
   well as extrinsic parameters such as the hydrogel's area density on the
   membrane and FO-regeneration cycle duration, would have a profound
   impact on the desalination efficacy using hydrogels.},

   Lucaogou Formation, Jimusaer Sag, Junggar Basin},

Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {The Permian Lucaogou Formation (P(2)l) in the Jimusaer Sag, Junggar
   Basin is an essential source rock and a tight oil-producing layer in
   China. The source rock of the Lucaogou Formation is characterized by
   mixed sedimentation of siliciclastics, carbonates, and tuffaceous
   materials, and the formation of mixed source rocks is different from
   that of conventional source rocks (e.g., mudstones or carbonates). Our
   petrological observation and X-ray diffraction mineralogical analysis
   suggest that the mixed source rocks are divided into three types:
   terrigenous-dominated mixed rocks (Td-mixed rocks), carbonate-dominated
   mixed rocks (Cd-mixed rocks), and tuffaceous-dominated mixed rocks
   (Tuf-mixed rocks). Compared with the upper section, more Td- and
   Tuf-mixed rocks, as well as less Cd-mixed rocks, developed in the lower
   section. Integrated organic geochemical and molecular geochemical
   analyses indicate that the Lucaogou mixed source rock is abundant in
   organic matter (OM) (TOC = 3.12 wt \%), which is at the thermally low
   mature to mature stage. The sources of OM mainly originate from the
   mixture of planktonic organisms, bacteria, and terrigenous higher
   plants. Comparatively, some geochemical parameters (e.g., TOC, S-1 +
   S-2, and hydrogen index) of the upper section of P(2)l show slightly
   higher values than those of the lower section both before and after
   extraction, indicating a higher hydrocarbon generation potential of the
   source rocks in the upper section. Besides, more finely disseminated
   bacterial and planktonic organics are present in the upper section,
   whereas the lower section is more enriched in terrestrial OM. The mixed
   source rocks of the lower section were deposited in a deeper,
   anoxic-dysoxic, and brackish environment, whereas those of the upper
   section were deposited in a shallow, suboxic, saline, and evaporative
   environment. Moreover, we found that the lacustrine basin evolved from a
   more balanced-filled scenario with moderate productivity during the
   lower section deposition to an under-filled lake basin with higher
   productivity during the upper section deposition, in response to the
   climatic change from warm humid to hot semiarid conditions. Accordingly,
   the corresponding depositional models of mixed source rocks in the upper
   and lower sections of the Lucaogou Formation are proposed. Overall, the
   mixed rocks of the Lucaogou Formation can be regarded as good source
   rocks, which could offer favorable targets and resource potential for
   tight oil exploration.},

Abstract = {In this paper we use sea surface height (SSH) derived from satellite
   altimetry and an analytical linear equatorial wave model to interpret
   the evolution of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in the framework of
   recharge oscillator theory. The specific question we address is whether
   heat content in the equatorial band, for which SSH is a proxy, is a
   predictor of IOD development as it is for El Nio and the Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific. We find that, as in the Pacific,
   there are zonally coherent changes in heat content along the equator
   prior to the onset of IOD events. These changes in heat content are
   modulated by wind-forced westward propagating Rossby waves in the
   latitude band 5A degrees-10A degrees S, which at the western boundary
   reflect into Kelvin waves trapped to the equator. The biennial character
   of the IOD is affected by this cycling of wave energy between 5A degrees
   and 10A degrees S and the equator. Heat content changes are a weaker
   leading indicator of IOD sea surface temperature anomaly development
   than is the case for ENSO in the Pacific though because other factors
   are at work in generating IOD variability, one of which is ENSO forcing
   itself through changes in the Walker Circulation.},

Abstract = {Foraminifera from the coral-reef lagoons of two atolls are used to
   investigate the distribution and diversity of assemblages in the central
   Indian Ocean. Eight assemblages and 270 species of foraminifera are
   identified. Three assemblages are reefal and dominated by Amphistegina
   and Calcarina. Only one lagoon assemblage is present in both atolls,
   which is characterized by abundant Ammonia sp. 1 and smaller miliolid
   foraminifera. In An Atoll, abundant Amphistegina sp. 1, Operculina
   ammonoides, Amphistegina radiata and Nummulites venosa characterize one
   lagoon assemblage and abundant Neoeponides bradyi and Textularia cf. T.
   cushmani characterize the other. In Rasdhoo Atoll, abundant Textularia
   gr. foliacea and Spiroloculina nummiformis characterize one lagoon
   assemblage and abundant Textularia cf. T. cushmani and Textularia sp. 5
   characterize the other. The assemblages compare well with
   sedimentological characteristics, which is also reflected in their
   distributions. Species diversity in the Maldives appears to be higher
   than the western Indian Ocean region due to the stronger influence of
   central Indo-Pacific faunas. It is not however, as high as the central
   Indo-Pacific region, which may be due to lower habitat diversity. (C)

Abstract = {Acquisition of high resolution data regarding the stratigraphy and
   internal structure of coastal sedimentary sequences is becoming
   increasingly important in many sedimentological, geomorphological and
   geomorphological studies. Such information is usually obtained from the
   logging of field exposures, shallow trenches and cores. However,
   ground-penetrating radar (GPR), a relatively new and rapidly developing
   non-invasive geophysical technique, may also aid such investigations in
   certain coastal settings, providing additional, complimentary and often
   unique data sets. The technique is based on the transmission, reflection
   and reception of high frequency electromagnetic (radar) waves, with
   reflections occurring in the subsurface due to the varying electrical
   properties of the sediments. Such reflections can occur due the presence
   of primary sedimentary structures, lithological/material changes or
   water content changes. Examples presented from the UK indicate that the
   technique can accurately delineate the stratigraphy and internal
   sedimentary structure of coastal barriers. spits and strandplains, both
   above and below a fresh groundwater table. Sand and/or gravel-dominated
   beach-dune systems on moderate to high wave energy, macrotidal coasts
   appear to provide optimum settings for GPR deployment. In addition, the
   technique also has the potential to locate, map and provide
   stratigraphic context for a wide range of archaeological features that
   are commonly found in such coastal environments.},

Abstract = {The systematic study of background radiation and the distribution of
   radionuclides in the environment of coastal Karnataka, South India, has
   been initiated with an objective of establishing reliable baseline data
   on the background radiation level of the region for future assessment of
   the impact of nuclear and thermal power stations that are being set up
   in the region. The ambient gamma radiation survey in the environment of
   Mangalore, a major industrial city of coastal Karnataka, revealed
   significantly high gamma dose in air in certain locations of the
   Mangalore beach area. Thermoluminescent dosimetric studies indicated
   conspicuously high gamma dose in air in these places. Gamma
   spectrometric analyses of the soil and sand samples of this high
   background area have been carried out. The measured gamma dose in air in
   high background area is in the range 44-2102 nGy h-1. The average
   activity of Th-232, U-238, and K-40 in soil samples is 2,971 Bq kg-1,
   546 Bq kg-1, and 268 Bq kg-1, respectively. In sand samples, the
   respective activities are 1,842 Bq kg-1, 374 Bq kg-1, and 158 Bq kg-1.
   Results of these systematic investigations which establish the existence
   of new patches of monazite in the Mangalore beach area, on the southwest
   coast of India, are presented in this paper.},

Abstract = {Transparent and flexible supercapacitors (TFSCs) are viable power
   sources for next-generation wearable electronics. The ingenious design
   of the transparent electrode determines the performance of TFSCs. A
   percolating film of a pillared graphene layer integrated with a silver
   nanowire network as the transparent electrode was prepared, by which
   TFSC devices exhibit a significantly improved performance contrastively.
   Under the condition of the same transmittance, about 27-72\% improvement
   in the areal capacitance can be achieved. On the one hand, the pillars
   of carbon nanotube (CNT) were distributed in the graphene layer
   uniformly, enlarging the inner distance of adjacent graphene layers and
   providing an open structure for extra ion transport and storage of
   TFSCs. On the other hand, the introduced CNT could facilitate the
   electron transport at the direction perpendicular to the graphene basal
   plane, enhancing the electronic conductivity of the graphene layer. More
   importantly, the formed percolating film ensures an efficient transport
   of electron along with the silver nanowire when it encounters the
   obstacle within the graphene layer, resulting in a highly conductive
   electrode. The TFSC device with a good compatibility indicates a
   reliable practicability, which provides a facile route toward the design
   of high-performance TFSCs.},

Title = {Efficient recovery of CO2 from flue gas by clathrate hydrate formation

Number = {7},
Pages = {2315-2319},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Thermodynamic measurements and NMR spectroscopic analysis were used to
   show that it is possible to recover CO2 from flue gas by forming a mixed
   hydrate that removes CO2 preferentially from CO2/N-2 gas mixtures using
   water dispersed in the pores of silica gel. Kinetic studies with H-1 NMR
   microimaging showed that the dispersed water in the silica gel pore
   system reacts readily with the gas, thus obviating the need for a
   stirred reactor and excess water. Hydrate phase equilibria for the
   ternary CO2-N-2-water system in silica gel pores were measured, which
   show that the three-phase hydrate-water-rich liquid-vapor equilibrium
   curves were shifted to higher pressures at a specific temperature when
   the concentration of CO2 in the vapor phase decreased. C-13
   cross-polarization NMR spectral analysis and direct measurement of the
   CO2 content in the hydrate phase suggested that the mixed hydrate is
   structure 1 at gas compositions of more than 10 mol \% CO2, and that the
   CO2 molecules occupy mainly the more abundant 5(12)6(2) cages. This
   makes it possible to achieve concentrations of more than 96 mol \% CO2
   gas in the product after three cycles of hydrate formation and
   dissociation. H-1 NMR Microimaging showed that hydrate yields of better
   than 85\%, based on the amount of water, could be obtained in 1 h when a
   steady state was reached, although similar to 90\% of this yield was
   achieved after similar to 20 min of reaction time.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a decentralized power flow control scheme for an
   islanded microgrid which comprises multiple PV/Battery hybrid sources.
   Conventional droop control with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is
   employed to track maximum power of Photovoltaic (PV) module, regulate
   voltage at DC bus and manage the power among hybrid sources. Moreover,
   by applying optimum switching sequence to battery converter can control
   the State-of-Charge (SoC) of batteries. In the proposed control method
   higher SoC of battery delivers more power than that with lower SoC.
   Finally, Load power sharing between distributed generator with energy
   storage hybrid systems is presented in order to validate the proposed
   control strategy.},

Abstract = {Routine regulatory monitoring of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST)
   commonly employs oxidative derivitisation and complex liquid
   chromatography fluorescence detection methods (LC-FL). The pre-column
   oxidation LC-FL method is currently implemented in New Zealand and the
   United Kingdom. When using this method positive samples are fractionated
   and two different oxidations are required to confirm the identity and
   quantity of each PST analogue present. There is a need for alternative
   methods that are simpler, provide faster turnaround times and have
   improved detection limits. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
   (HILIC) HPLC-MS/MS analysis of PST has been used for research purposes,
   but high detection limits and substantial sample matrix issues have
   prevented it from becoming a viable alternative for routine monitoring
   purposes. We have developed a HILIC UPLC-MS/MS method for paralytic
   shellfish toxins with an optimised desalting clean-up procedure on
   inexpensive carbon solid phase extraction cartridges for reduction of
   matrix interferences. This represents a major technical breakthrough and
   allows sensitive, selective and rapid analysis of paralytic shellfish
   toxins from a variety of sample types, including many commercially
   produced bivalve molluscan shellfish species. Additionally, this
   analytical approach avoids the need for complex calculations to
   determine sample toxicity, as unlike other methods each PST analogue is
   able to be quantified as a single resolved peak. This article presents
   the method development and optimisation information. A thorough single
   laboratory validation study has subsequently been performed and this
   data will be presented elsewhere. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   The annual flux of dissolved organic carbon is 178,3 10(3) g m-2 yr-1,
   while that of particulate organic carbon is less than half this amount:
   71,4 10(3) g m-2 yr-1. Organic carbon with a detrital origin accounts
   for 84\% of particulate organic carbon.
   Organic accumulation is 0,1 10(3) g m-2 yr-1 in the control zones; in
   the oyster cultivation areas, the accumulation is six times higher (0,6
   10(3) g m-2 yr-1).
   Resuspension can be important, with release of dissolved organic carbon
   and redistribution of particulate organic carbon in the water column.
   An enrichment of humic acids in the sediment is linked with phytobenthic
   biomasses, increased by the presence of oysters.},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Variation in macrofaunal composition in relation to sediment and water
   variables was analysed in nine regions of the western Canadian Arctic on
   the Beaufort Shelf and in Amundsen Gulf. We hypothesized that benthic
   community composition was distinctive (1) in a recurrent polynya in
   Amundsen Gulf and (2) in upwelling regions (Cape Bathurst and Mackenzie
   Canyon) and (3) changed in a linear gradient across the Beaufort Shelf.
   Analysis was based on 497 taxa >0.4 mm from 134 samples at 52 stations
   sampled over 2002-4 in 11-1000 m water depth. Abundance ranged from
   490.7 m(-2) in eastern Amundsen Gulf to 17,950 m(-2) off Cape Bathurst.
   (1) Community composition in Amundsen Gulf was not significantly
   different from the Beaufort Shelf at similar depth, indicating a lack of
   benthic effect of the polynya in Amundsen Gulf. (2) The Mackenzie Canyon
   macrofauna, although abundant and diverse, were similarly indistinct
   from the shelf community at similar depth. However, there was a 10-fold
   increase in inshore abundance in the upwelling region of Cape Bathurst
   due to large numbers of the amphipod Ampelisca macrocephala and the
   polychaete Barantolla americana, species that were not abundant
   elsewhere. (3) In the inshore fast ice and flaw lead regions of the
   Beaufort Shelf, under the influence of ice scour, storm effects, coastal
   erosion and the Mackenzie River, the macrofauna were dominated by the
   bivalve Portlandia arctica and the polychaete Micronephthys minuta.
   Offshore, where these influences were less and upwelling of deep
   Atlantic water occurred, the polychaete Maldane sarsi dominated. Faunal
   distribution across the Beaufort Shelf correlated with depth, water and
   sediment changes but was not significantly linear. Crown Copyright (C)

Title = {Brachiopod-dominated communities and depositional environment of the
   Guanshan Konservat-Lagerstatte, eastern Yunnan, China},

Abstract = {The Guanshan Biota is an unusual early Cambrian Konservat-Lagerstatte
   from China and is distinguished from all other exceptionally preserved
   Cambrian biotas by the dominance of brachiopods and a relatively shallow
   depositional environment. However, the faunal composition, overturn and
   sedimentology associated with the Guanshan Biota are poorly understood.
   This study, based on collections through the best-exposed succession of
   the basal Wulongqing Formation at the Shijiangjun section, Wuding
   County, eastern Yunnan, China recovered six major animal groups with
   soft tissue preservation; brachiopods vastly outnumbered all other
   groups. Brachiopods quickly replace arthropods as the dominant fauna
   following a transgression at the base of the Wulongqing Formation. A
   transition from a botsfordiid-, eoobolid- and acrotretid- to an
   acrotheloid-dominated brachiopod assemblage occurs up-section. Four
   episodically repeated lithofacies reveal a relatively low-energy,
   offshore to lower shoreface sedimentary environment at the Shijiangjun
   section, which is very different from the Wulongqing Formation in the
   Malong and Kunming areas. Multiple event flows and rapid obrution are
   responsible for faunal overturn and fluctuation through the section. A
   detailed lithofacies and palaeontological investigation of this section
   provides a better understanding of the processes and drivers of faunal
   overturn during the later phase of the Cambrian Explosion. Supplementary

Title = {Measurements of Enhanced Near-Surface Turbulence under Windrows},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {197-215},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Observations of waves, winds, turbulence, and the geometry and
   circulation of windrows were made in a shallow bay in the winter of 2018
   outside of Rimouski, Quebec. Water velocities measured from a
   forward-looking pulse-coherent ADCP mounted on a small zodiac show
   spanwise (cross-windrow) convergence, streamwise (downwind) velocity
   enhancement, and downwelling in the windrows, consistent with the view
   that windrows are the result of counterrotating pairs of wind-aligned
   vortices. The spacing of windrows, measured with acoustic backscatter
   and with surface imagery, was measured to be approximately twice the
   water depth, which suggests an aspect ratio of 1. The magnitude and
   vertical distribution of turbulence measured from the ADCP are
   consistent with a previous scaling and observations of near-surface
   turbulence under breaking waves, with dissipation rates larger and
   decaying faster vertically than what is expected from a shear-driven
   boundary layer. Measurements of dissipation rate are partitioned to
   within, and outside of the windrow convergence zones, and measurements
   inside the convergence zones are found to be nearly an order of
   magnitude larger than those outside with similar vertical structure. A
   ratio of time scales suggests that turbulence likely dissipates before
   it can be advected horizontally into convergences, but the advection of
   wave energy into convergences may elevate the surface flux of TKE and
   could explain the elevated turbulence in the windrows. These results add
   to a limited number of conflicting observations of turbulence
   variability due to windrows, which may modify gas flux, and heat and
   momentum transport in the surface boundary layer.},

Title = {A new strategy to study pond soil chemistry in intensive and extensive
   cultures of Litopenaeus vannamei: A case study in Brazil},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {549},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Improvements in the sampling of pond soil and bioremediation techniques
   can increase the efficiency of soil treatments by emphasizing zones of
   greater nutrient deposition. This work evaluated the relative deposition
   of nutrients and their statistical correlation in pond soils in
   intensive and extensive Litopenaeus vannamei farming. Soil samples were
   collected (n: 150) in six ponds at two marine shrimp farms (one
   intensive and one extensive) after being drained and harvesting the
   shrimp. The ponds were divided into 5 zones -Water Inlet (WI), Water
   Outlet (WO), Plateau (P), Ditch (D) and Feeder (F), of which five
   samples were collected in each zone. Soil texture, Total Carbon (TC),
   Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, Total
   Phosphorus (TP), Available Phosphorus (AP), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca),
   magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) and pH (H2O) were analyzed. All variables
   were submitted to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene test to verify
   normality and homoscedasticity, respectively. Variables that met the
   requirements were compared by one-way ANOVA analysis of variance, and
   Tukey test or Student's t-test. The correlation of nutrient
   concentration was performed using linear regression. Soil from intensive
   and extensive cultivation ponds were classified as sandy loam and sandy,
   respectively. The deficiency of carbon and potassium, and excess of
   phosphorus in the pond soil of both farms was verified. The soil from
   the ponds of the intensive cultivation farm showed high relative
   deposition for TC, TOC, TN and AP near the Feeder (F) and the Water
   Outlet (WO), which infers that these zones (16.32\% of the total pond
   area) may need higher treatment frequencies or different treatment from
   the other zones studied (WI, P and D). In the soil of the extensive
   cultivation ponds, the highest values for TC, TOC, TN and AP were found
   in the Water Inlet (WI), Ditches (D) and Feeder (F) (2.68\% of the total
   pond area). This also indicates the need for higher treatment
   frequencies or different treatment from the other zones studied (WO and
   P). In addition, results suggest that phosphorus is the nutrient with
   the greatest potential for accumulation in the soil, either organically
   or inorganically, due to its high adsorption potential, occurring mainly
   in areas of organic matter decomposition regardless of the cultivation
   system, while nitrogen was mainly organic due to its low adsorption
   potential. Therefore, based on this study it is recommended that as part
   of their soil management strategy, shrimp farmers treat the pond areas
   in a differentiated manner giving special attention to areas of organic
   matter decomposition with the goal of avoiding waste and increasing
   production efficiency, potentially saving up to 97\% in probiotic
   products.},

Title = {Banded Iron Travertines at the Ilia Hot Spring (Greece): An interplay of
   biotic and abiotic factors leading to a modern Banded Iron Formation
   analogue?},
Journal = {DEPOSITIONAL RECORD},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A hot spring at Ilia in the Greek Island of Euboea precipitates
   iron-rich travertine at an ore-grade concentration (up to 35.3 wt\% Fe).
   This hydrothermal chemical sediment system deposits bands of iron
   oxyhydroxides (ferrihydrite), millimetres to centimetres thick,
   alternating with calcium carbonate-dominated layers, creating ``Banded
   Iron Travertine{''} (BIT). The ferrihydrite laminae display a dendritic
   texture formed of spherical nodules often covering filaments identified
   as bacterial stalks of Zetaproteobacteria. These microaerophilic
   iron-oxidizing bacteria were identified by their 16S rRNA gene sequences
   in ferrihydrite-enriched samples from areas under high water flow. They
   were missing in the aragonite/calcite-dominated samples exhibiting
   features of aerial exposure and cyanobacteria instead. These
   characteristics, and the relative depletion in Fe-rich layers of
   redox-sensitive elements like Mn and Ce, as well as the presence of
   halite in Ca-rich layers, suggest that the bands form by successive
   changes in hydrothermal flow. This allowed microaerophilic iron
   oxidation to form Fe-rich layers, while Ca-rich bands precipitated when
   the hydrothermal water had time to equilibrate with the atmosphere. This
   sea water-dominated hydrothermal system is enriched in reduced iron and
   rapidly precipitating carbonates and ferrihydrite in the form of bands,
   having similarities to ``Banded Iron Formation{''} (BIF). BIF represents
   archives of Earth's primitive biogeochemistry although the combined
   abiotic and biotic processes that have likely led to their formation are
   not fully resolved. Diagenesis and metamorphism have a strong imprint on
   BIF. Thus, continuous efforts are pursued to identify modern analogues
   that could help unravel their formation. Although carbonate is not a
   common feature of BIFs, Ilia system provides an interesting analogue for
   their depositional processes and potential microbial-mineral
   associations they may have hosted. It also presents pre-diagenesis
   facies association and mineralogy that could bring new clues for
   unravelling BIF modes of formation and the salient biogeochemical
   conditions characteristic of their original depositional environment.},

Abstract = {This work aims to raise the discussion about the experience of coastal
   planning and management for the seashore of Galinhos municipality, a
   town located in the Northern coast of the State of Rio Grande do Norte,
   by applying the methodology proposed for the Seashore Integrated
   Management (SIM), and complementary tools for strategic and
   participative planning, such as the Brazilian Coastal Modeling System
   (SMC - Brazil), remote sensing and image survey by unmanned aerial
   vehicle. These tools associated with participative workshops as proposed
   by the Seashore Project made possible to locate coastal line
   modifications and the spatial expansion of land uses in strictly
   use-controlled territorial areas which are subject to natural geodynamic
   processes. The modeling indicated an intense wave of energy reaching the
   peninsula, with an annual average flow of 366,43 J/m.s, and with the
   transportation of 185.839 m3/per year of beach sediments, with a
   tendency of opening a canal and isolating the sands-pit. Estimation of
   the plan-shape equilibrium of Galinhos and Galos districts bays
   indicates a trend of shoreline transgression of around 80 m and 120m in
   their direction, respectively. The SIM review also served to collect
   data that will be useful for devising the Participative Land Use Master
   Plan of the Municipality (PIP, in Portuguese). Such tools and
   technologies are indispensable, therefore, in the process towards an
   integrated management planning of the coast. They allow for a better
   understanding of the coastal dynamics by locals, by local managers and
   by other key actors in charge of undertaking the SIM and PDP, among
   other instruments of territorial and environmental management of areas
   located near the coastline.},

Journal = {BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {176},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-123},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A semi-empirical approach based on surface-renewal theory for estimating
   the friction velocity is tested for measurements taken in the inertial
   sublayer. For unstable cases, the input requirements are the mean wind
   speed and the high-frequency trace (10 or 20 Hz) of the air or sonic
   temperature. The method has been extended to traces of water vapour
   (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. For stable cases, the
   stability parameter must also be considered. The method's performance,
   taking the direct friction velocity measured by sonic anemometry as a
   reference, was tested over a growing cotton field that included bare
   soil with some crop residues at the beginning of the season. In general,
   the proposed friction-velocity estimates are reliable. For unstable
   cases, the method shows the potential to outperform the wind
   logarithmic-law computation. Discarding cases with low wind speeds
   (e.g., < 0.3 m s(-1) and mean wind shear < 1 Hz), the proposed approach
   may be recommended as an alternative method to estimating the friction
   velocity. There is the potential, based on the input requirements, that

Title = {Effects of intense storm events on dolphin occurrence and foraging
   behavior},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {As storms become increasingly intense and frequent due to climate
   change, we must better understand how they alter environmental
   conditions and impact species. However, storms are ephemeral and provide
   logistical challenges that prevent visual surveys commonly used to
   understand marine mammal ecology. Thus, relatively little is known about
   top predators' responses to such environmental disturbances. In this
   study, we utilized passive acoustic monitoring to characterize the
   response of bottlenose dolphins to intense storms offshore Maryland, USA
   between 2015 and 2017. During and following four autumnal storms,
   dolphins were detected less frequently and for shorter periods of time.
   However, dolphins spent a significantly higher percentage of their
   encounters feeding after the storm than they did before or during. This
   change in foraging may have resulted from altered distributions and
   behavior of their prey species, which are prone to responding to
   environmental changes, such as varied sea surface temperatures caused by
   storms. It is increasingly vital to determine how these intense storms
   alter oceanography, prey movements, and the behavior of top predators.},

Title = {Dynamics of the Largest Carbon Isotope Excursion During the Early
   Triassic Biotic Recovery},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {The dynamics of the carbon cycle across different timescales is crucial
   for understanding past and present global climate changes. Following the
   Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction (PTBME), the carbon cycle
   changed profoundly during the following 5.4 Myr, with magnitudes of
   changes comparable to those of the Precambrian. In pace with the
   successive cycles of the carbon budget, the recovery of the marine
   nekton underwent several evolutionary diversification and extinction
   cycles accompanied by eustatic sea-level changes and profound ecological
   reorganization of land plants, all indicative of climatic changes.
   Additional eruptive bursts of the Siberian Large Igneous Province (SLIP)
   are traditionally called upon as a plausible trigger for these climatic
   oscillations but firm evidence for coeval SLIP volcanism is still
   lacking. Based on new precise and accurate U-Pb zircon ages, we
   establish a high-resolution temporal calibration of the biggest positive
   carbon isotope excursion (CIE) spanning about 600 kyr in the late
   Smithian. The age of the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SSB) is established
   between 249.29 +/- 0.06 and 249.11 +/- 0.09 Ma. Our oldest U-Pb zircon
   ages indicate no overlap in time between the middle Smithian onset of
   the thermal maximum and the youngest available U-Pb zircon ages from
   SLIP volcanism. The constructed time line also indicates a duration of
   the global unconformity at the SSB that is compatible with
   glacio-eustatism. Potential cooling mechanisms such as a volcanic
   winter, the biological pump and the cessation of volcanism are discussed
   in the light of this new time line. In the low latitudes, the onset of
   the positive CIE remarkably predates the temperature drop by some 100 to
   125 kyr. However, as long as the magnitude of such offset - if any - is
   unknown for the high latitudes, relations between the CIE and the
   cooling will remain an open question associated with largest Triassic
   extinction of the nekton.},

Title = {A SNP resource for Douglas-fir: de novo transcriptome assembly and SNP
   detection and validation},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Background: Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), one of the most
   economically and ecologically important tree species in the world, also
   has one of the largest tree breeding programs. Although the coastal and
   interior varieties of Douglas-fir (vars. menziesii and glauca) are
   native to North America, the coastal variety is also widely planted for
   timber production in Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Chile. Our main
   goal was to develop a SNP resource large enough to facilitate genomic
   selection in Douglas-fir breeding programs. To accomplish this, we
   developed a 454-based reference transcriptome for coastal Douglas-fir,
   annotated and evaluated the quality of the reference, identified
   putative SNPs, and then validated a sample of those SNPs using the
   Illumina Infinium genotyping platform.
   Results: We assembled a reference transcriptome consisting of 25,002
   isogroups (unique gene models) and 102,623 singletons from 2.76 million
   454 and Sanger cDNA sequences from coastal Douglas-fir. We identified
   278,979 unique SNPs by mapping the 454 and Sanger sequences to the
   reference, and by mapping four datasets of Illumina cDNA sequences from
   multiple seed sources, genotypes, and tissues. The Illumina datasets
   represented coastal Douglas-fir (64.00 and 13.41 million reads),
   interior Douglas-fir (80.45 million reads), and a Yakima population
   similar to interior Douglas-fir (8.99 million reads). We assayed 8067
   SNPs on 260 trees using an Illumina Infinium SNP genotyping array. Of
   these SNPs, 5847 (72.5\%) were called successfully and were polymorphic.
   Conclusions: Based on our validation efficiency, our SNP database may
   contain as many as similar to 200,000 true SNPs, and as many as similar
   to 69,000 SNPs that could be genotyped at similar to 20,000 gene loci
   using an Infinium II array-more SNPs than are needed to use genomic
   selection in tree breeding programs. Ultimately, these genomic resources
   will enhance Douglas-fir breeding and allow us to better understand
   landscape-scale patterns of genetic variation and potential responses to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {A small collection of fossil pteropods, including some unidentified
   species, provisionally referable to the families Limacinidae, Creseidae,
   and Clioidae (?) is reported from the late Middle Eocene-Late Eocene
   beds of the Upper Disang Formation exposed near the town of Pfutsero,
   Phek District, South Central Nagaland (Assam-Arakan Basin, northeastern
   India). This is the first record of fossil pteropods from this part of
   India. Although based exclusively on juvenile or incompletely preserved
   adult shells, documentation of this collection is important from the
   viewpoint of biostratigraphy as well as palaeoecology. The occurrence of
   pteropods in the Upper Disang Formation indicates deposition in an open
   marine basin above the aragonite compensation depth. The combined
   assemblages of pteropods and previously reported uvigerinid for
   aminifers from the Upper Disang Formation indicate a palaeobathymetry of
   similar to 500 m, i.e. upper bathyal zone, and a tropical-subtropical

Abstract = {All sea turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, a
   process in which the incubation temperature of the nest determines the
   sex of the offspring. Given the potential effects of climate change
   worldwide, monitoring sea turtle population sex ratios has become a
   priority, especially for these threatened or endangered species. In this
   study, we examined the sex ratio of an aggregation of juvenile Hawksbill
   Turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), a critically endangered species, at a
   coral reef in southern Florida, USA. This is the most northerly juvenile
   Hawksbill aggregation in the Atlantic Ocean for which this type of study
   has been completed, and the first one within the continental USA. We
   hand-captured turtles and collected blood samples from 69 individuals
   over a period of two years for sex determination using a testosterone
   radioimmunoassay (RIA). The RIA was calibrated with serum samples from
   juvenile Hawksbills whose sex was confirmed by laparoscopy, from Mona
   Island, Puerto Rico and Caribbean Panama. Our results indicate a
   significant female bias in this population (2.37:1), which has also been
   observed in several previous studies of juvenile Hawksbill turtle sex
   ratios.},

Title = {Effects of sea-level rise on physiological ecology of populations of a
   ground-dwelling ant},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {Introduction
   Sea-level rise is a consequence of climate change that can impact the
   ecological and physiological changes of coastal, ground-dwelling
   species. Sea-level rise has a potential to inundate birds, rodents,
   spiders, and insects that live on the ground in coastal areas. Yet,
   there is still much to be learned concerning the specifics of these
   impacts. The red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta (Buren) excavates
   soil for its home and is capable of surviving flooding. Because of their
   ground-dwelling life history and rapid reproduction, fire ants make an
   ideal model for discovery and prediction of changes that may be due to
   sea-level rise. There are up to 500,000 individuals in a colony, and
   these invasive ants naturally have a painful sting. However,
   observations suggest that colonies of fire ants that dwell in
   tidally-influenced areas are more aggressive with more frequent stings
   and more venom injected per sting (behavioral and physiological changes)
   than those located inland. This may be an adaption to sea-level rise.
   Therefore, the objective of this study is to elucidate differences in
   inland and coastal defensiveness via micro-dissection and comparison of
   head width, head length, stinger length, and venom sac volume. But first
   because fire ants' ability to raft on brackish tidal water is unknown,
   it had to be determined if fire ants could indeed raft in brackish water
   and examine the behavior differences between those flooded with
   freshwater vs. saltwater.
   Methods
   To test the coastal-aggression hypothesis, inland colonies and coastal
   colonies, which experience relatively greater amounts of flooding,
   specifically regular tidal and windblown water and oscillations (i.e. El
   Nino Southern Oscillation) from the Gulf of Mexico, were collected. To
   mimic sea-level rise, the colonies were flooded in salinities that
   correspond to both their collection site and conditions found in a
   variety of locales and situations (such as storm surge from a tropical
   storm). Individual ants were immediately taken from each colony for
   dissection before flooding, 1-hour into flooding, and 24-hours into
   flooding.
   Results and discussion
   Fire ants use their venom to defend themselves and to communicate alarm
   or aggression. Dissections and measurement of heads, venom sacs, and
   stingers revealed both coastal and inland colonies experience an
   increase in venom sac volume after 24 hours; in fact coastal colonies
   increased their venom volume by 75\% after 24 h of flooding Whether this
   venom sac enlargement is due to diffusion of water or venom sac
   production is unknown. These ground-dwelling ants exhibit physiological
   and behavioral adaptations to ongoing sea-level rise possibly indicating
   that they are responding to increased flooding. Fire ants will raft on
   high-salinity water; and sea-level rise may cause stings by flooded ants
   to be more severe because of increased venom volume.},

Abstract = {Electrical geophysical imaging is a widely used noninvasive technology
   for visualizing porous media at scales larger than individual pores.
   Originally developed for medical applications, the technology has been
   applied to investigate flow and transport properties/processes in a wide
   range of fields including earth sciences, civil and environmental
   engineering, agricultural sciences and biology. Conventional electrical
   imaging measures electrical conduction processes occurring through the
   fluids filling the interconnected pores and within the electrical double
   layer at the solid-fluid interface. Complex electrical imaging, an
   extension of the methodology, also measures electrical polarization
   processes within the electric double layer and in the presence of
   metals. Electrical imaging has been used to determine the spatial
   distribution of physical properties controlling flow/transport in porous
   media, image fluid dynamics, observe solute transport phenomena and
   capture matrix transformations. The method has been applied to
   investigate porous media processes in soils, rocks, concrete, engineered
   barriers, wastewater filters and living trees. Advances in the
   technology will result from (1) improving the understanding of the
   relationship of complex conductivity measurements to more processes
   occurring in porous media and (2) developing new instrumentation that
   will support longer-term autonomous electrical monitoring.},

Title = {The influence of humidity fluxes on offshore wind speed profiles},
Journal = {ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1043-1052},
Abstract = {Wind energy developments offshore focus on larger turbines to keep the
   relative cost of the foundation per MW of installed capacity low. Hence
   typical wind turbine hub-heights are extending to 100 m and potentially
   beyond. However, measurements to these heights are not usually
   available, requiring extrapolation from lower measurements. With humid
   conditions and low mechanical turbulence offshore, deviations from the
   traditional logarithmic wind speed profile become significant and
   stability corrections are required. This research focuses on quantifying
   the effect of humidity fluxes on stability corrected wind speed
   profiles. The effect on wind speed profiles is found to be important in
   stable conditions where including humidity fluxes forces conditions
   towards neutral. Our results show that excluding humidity fluxes leads
   to average predicted wind speeds at 150 m from 10 m which are up to 4\%
   higher than if humidity fluxes are included, and the results are not
   very sensitive to the method selected to estimate humidity fluxes.},

Abstract = {The study investigates the role of the air-sea interface using numerical
   simulations of Hurricane Arthur (2014) in the Atlantic. More
   specifically, the present study aims to discern the role ocean surface
   waves and sea spray play in modulating the intensity and structure of a
   tropical cyclone (TC). To investigate the effects of ocean surface waves
   and sea spray, numerical simulations were carried out using a coupled
   atmosphere-wave model, whereby a sea spray microphysical model was
   incorporated within the coupled model. Furthermore, this study also
   explores how sea spray generation can be modelled using wave energy
   dissipation due to whitecaps; whitecaps are considered as the primary
   mode of spray droplets generation at hurricane intensity wind speeds.
   Three different numerical simulations including the sea-state-dependent
   momentum flux, the sea-spray-mediated heat flux, and a combination of
   the former two processes with the sea-spray-mediated momentum flux were
   conducted. The foregoing numerical simulations were evaluated against
   the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy and satellite altimeter
   measurements as well as a control simulation using an uncoupled
   atmosphere model. The results indicate that the model simulations were
   able to capture the storm track and intensity: the surface wave coupling
   results in a stronger TC. Moreover, it is also noted that when only
   spray-mediated heat fluxes are applied in conjunction with the
   sea-state-dependent momentum flux, they result in a slightly weaker TC,
   albeit stronger compared to the control simulation. However, when a
   spray-mediated momentum flux is applied together with spray heat fluxes,
   it results in a comparably stronger TC. The results presented here
   allude to the role surface friction plays in the intensification of a
   TC.},

Title = {Analysis of wave climate and trends in a semi-enclosed basin (Persian
   Gulf) using a validated SWAN model},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Results from a spectral wave model of the Persian Gulf for a long-term
   period (32-year) are used to describe and quantify the seasonal wave
   climate and trends. The model is forced by a wind reanalysis dataset and
   validated against a set of field measurements and altimeter data from
   various satellite missions. The results revealed the existence of a more
   energetic wave (higher H-mo and larger T-p) zone located at the southern
   regions of the Gulf that is linked to the predominant and stronger
   north-westerly winds. The wave heights and periods are intensified in
   winter (H-m0>2.7m and T-p > 8s for the 99th percentile) followed by
   spring. The waves conditions are milder in autumn. The analysis of wave
   climate trends throughout the region clearly show an overall slight
   positive trend (0-0.2\%/year) in mean H m o, which is associated with
   long-term positive trends in wind speed. There is generally a positive
   trend in the mean significant wave height during winter (0-0.8\%/year),
   spring (0-0.6\%/year) and autumn (0-1.0\%/year), and negative during
   summer (0-0.8\%/year). The results indicate that the more statistically
   significant results are at the areas with larger magnitude of trends.},

Title = {Identification and degradation characterization of hexachlorobutadiene
   degrading strain Serratia marcescens HL1},
Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {99},
Number = {15},

Abstract = {A bacterium (strain HL1) capable of growing with hexachlorobutadiene
   (HCBD) as sole carbon and energy sources was isolated from a mixture of
   soil contaminated with HCBD and activated sludge obtained from
   petrochemical plant wastewater treatment plant by using enrichment
   culture. Biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic analysis based on
   16S rDNA sequence indicate that strain HL1 clearly belongs to Serratia
   marcescens sp. Resting cells of strain HL1 were found to remove HCBD
   from culture fluids with the concomitant release of chloride ion under
   aerobic conditions. The ranges of pH value and temperature for
   satisfactory growth of strain HL1 cells were from 7.0 to 8.0 and 25 to
   30 degrees C, respectively. Capability of resting cells to degrade HCBD
   was induced by HCBD in the culture fluids. HCBD (20 mg/l) was removed
   from culture fluids by resting cells in 4 d without lag phase, but for
   50 mg/l and 80 mg/l HCBD 7 days were needed with lag phase. Growth of
   strain HL1 cells was inhibited by HCBD at the concentration up to 160
   mg/l. First order kinetics could be fitted to the biodegradation of HCBD
   by HL1 cells after lag phase at initial concentrations of 20, 50, and 80
   mg/l. Strain HL1 also showed strong capacity to degrade chloroprene,
   trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and vinyl chloride at solely
   initial concentration of 50 mg/l. Results could offer useful information
   for the application of strain HL1 in bioremediation or control of
   HCBD-polluted environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present study integrated the electrokinetic (EK) with bioremediation
   (Bioelectrokinetic -BEK) of diesel hydrocarbon by Staphylococcus
   epidermidis EVR4. It was identified as efficient biosurfactant producing
   bacteria and growth parameters was optimized using response surface
   methodology. Upon degradation, there is a complete disappearance of
   peaks from nonane (C-9) to tricosane (C-23) and 85\%, 47\% of
   degradation of pentacosane and octacosane respectively. Marine bacterial
   strain, EVR4 was found to be potential to degrade the diesel with a
   maximum degradation efficiency of 96\% within 4 d, which was due to its
   synergistic role of biosurfactant and catabolic enzymes (dehydrogenase,
   catalase and cytochrome C). The application of integrated BEK was an
   effective insitu method for the remediation of diesel contaminated soil
   by BEK (84\%) than EK (67\%). EVR4 as an effective strain can be
   employed for BIO-EK method to clean the diesel hydrocarbon polluted

Abstract = {Climate change provides new challenges to Nordic forestry. Use of
   non-native species, such as Douglas fir, can be a means of mitigating
   the effects of climate change and meeting the growing demand for
   biomass. When Douglas fir is grown in Sweden, it is several degrees of
   latitude north of its normal range, which can affect timing of growth
   cessation, hardening of seedlings, and seedling storability. The
   objective of this study was to investigate tolerance to freezing and
   sub-zero storability of seven Douglas fir provenances and make
   comparisons with the native Norway spruce. Freezing tolerance and
   storability were evaluated by measuring the electrolytic leakage of
   shoots and roots after freezing, complemented with a three-week
   cultivation test after storage. All provenances of Douglas fir used in
   this study were able to tolerate frozen storage at -4 degrees C for
   about four months. Norway spruce and the interior Douglas fir
   provenance, Three Valley, could be stored earlier in the autumn than the
   southern coastal Douglas fir provenances. Consequently, it should be
   possible to store Douglas fir seedlings with the same routines as for
   Norway spruce.},

Title = {Nonrandom variation of morphological traits across environmental
   gradients in a land snail},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {323-340},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Morphological variation is often attributed to differential adaptations
   to diverse habitats, but adaptations to a similar environment do not
   necessarily result in similar phenotypes. Adaptations for water and heat
   budget are crucial for organisms living in arid habitats, and in snails,
   variation in shell morphology has been frequently attributed to
   selection by stressful environmental factors. However, their phenotypic
   divergence often is not accompanied by a relevant niche differentiation
   and consistent relationships with environmental correlates are lacking.
   In the pulmonate genus Albinaria, there is great size and shape
   variation between and within species, and there are two major shell
   sculpture morphotypes, ribbed and smooth. We used 62 populations of 28
   Albinaria species, taking into account their phylogeny, to examine the
   variation of shell traits (sculpture, size, shape), their effect on
   water and heat budget, and their association with geographical and
   climatic gradients. We found unambiguous size and shape discrimination
   between the two morphotypes. Ribbed shells are lighter, taller, and
   slimmer and have a smaller aperture than the smooth ones. Moreover,
   significant correlations between shell traits and heat/moisture budget
   and climate/geography were revealed. Ribbed and taller shells retain
   more water on their shell surface, and on the other hand, smooth shells
   exhibit lower water permeability. Therefore, two strategies are being
   used to prevent water loss, active retention or resistance to loss.
   Consequently, different alternative solutions evolved and were retained
   as responses to the same stressful factor by the two distinct shell
   morphotypes. Larger shells occur in southern latitudes, mostly on
   islands, and at sites where there is a shortage of rainfall. Therefore,
   the variation of the examined traits is nonrandom with respect to
   location and to climate and their evolution can be attributed to
   selection by environmental factors, with water availability being the
   key driving agent of body-size variation.},

Abstract = {Common white terns Gygis alba lay a single egg balanced on rocks or
   branches and consequently are at risk of low nesting success. A novel
   technique of hollowing out coconut husks and providing artificial nest
   sites was developed on Cousine Island, Seychelles. Our study aimed to
   critically assess whether common white tern nesting success differed
   between artificial and natural nest sites. For natural nest sites,
   nesting success and the stage of nest failure were also compared between
   seasons, nest heights, and tree species. Finally, we compared results
   from our study to those of a study conducted 10 years ago on the same
   island. Nesting success differed significantly between artificial nests
   and natural nests, with the success of artificial nests nearly double
   that of natural nests. Hatching success was similar for artificial and
   natural nests (65\% and 52\% respectively), suggesting coconut husks do
   not reduce egg losses, but rather provide secure perches for young
   chicks. Most natural nest failures occurred during the egg phase (70\%),
   followed by the youngest chick phase (21\%). Of the eggs that hatched in
   natural nests, 61\% fledged successfully. Tree species and season
   significantly influenced nesting success for natural nests and nest
   height varied significantly between tree species. Higher nesting success
   was observed during the mixed seasonal period (50\%) followed by the
   cooler, windier and drier South-East Monsoon season (33\%). The hotter
   and more humid North-West Monsoon period had the lowest nesting success
   (20\%). Comparisons of nesting success at natural and artificial nest
   sites with the earlier study did not differ significantly, despite a
   smaller population of common white terns being present on the island at
   that stage. Our results support the use of artificial nest sites to
   improve nesting success for this species and serve as a model for
   similar species currently under threat.},

   King George Island. Monthly average downward shortwave radiation was
   less than 210 Wm(-2) in summer. Due to the low albedo of 0.12, monthly
   average net radiation reached > 130 Wm(-2), a magnitude that was
   significantly larger than the reported magnitudes of < similar to 70
   Wm(-2) at glaciated areas with a high albedo, on the Peninsula. The sum
   of monthly average sensible heat (< 64 Wm(-2)) and latent heat (< 20
   Wm(-2)) fluxes amounted up to similar to 80 Wm(-2), which was an order
   of magnitude larger than those at glaciated areas on the Antarctic
   Peninsula. Given that non-glaciated areas should be enlarged if the
   warming continues, more attention may need to be paid to the role of
   non-glaciated areas in the local climate to predict climate change on
   the Antarctic Peninsula.},

Abstract = {The ocean covers over 70\% of the surface of our planet and plays a key
   role in the global climate. Most ocean circulation is mesoscale (scales
   of 50-500 km and 10-100 days), and the energy in mesoscale circulation
   is at least one order of magnitude greater than general circulation;
   therefore, the study of mesoscale oceanic structures (MOS) is crucial to
   ocean dynamics, making it especially useful for analyzing global
   changes. The detection of MOS, such as upwellings or eddies, from
   satellites images is significant for marine environmental studies and
   coastal resource management. In this paper, we present an object-based
   image analysis (OBIA) system which segments and classifies regions
   contained in sea-viewing field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS)Aqua sensor satellite
   images into MOS. After color clustering and hierarchical data format
   (HDF) file processing, the OBIA system segments images and extracts
   image descriptors, producing primary regions. Then, it merges regions,
   recalculating image descriptors for MOS identification and definition.
   First, regions are labeled by a human-expert, who identifies MOS:
   upwellings, eddies, cool, and warm eddies. Labeled regions are then
   classified by learning algorithms (i.e., decision tree, Bayesian
   network, artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, and near neighbor
   algorithm) from selected features. Finally, the OBIA system enables
   images to be queried from the user interface and retrieved by means of
   fuzzy descriptors and oceanic structures. We tested our system with
   images from the Canary Islands and the North West African coast.},

Abstract = {At present stage, the thermodynamic perfection of cycles in the field of
   medium and low temperature heat is generally below 40\%, and this poses
   a challenge in improving the efficiency of thermodynamic cycles.
   Therefore, exploring the energy-conversion potential of thermodynamic
   cycles becomes an urgent question to be addressed. In this study, the
   concept of hydrate regulating working fluid composition is first
   proposed, and a novel composition adjustable combined cooling and power
   system based on hydrate is studied. The separation work of regulating
   working fluid composition could be utilized in the form of hydrate
   formation/dissociation enthalpy. This system could realize the optimal
   match between the working fluids and the thermodynamic processes.
   Besides, the novel system could meet the demand of cooling and
   electricity demands. When R22/R32 mixture is employed as working fluid,
   the second law efficiency of the composition adjustable combined cooling
   and power system based on hydrate is 0.57, while the second law
   efficiency of pure working fluids (R22 or R32) systems is 0.48. Compared
   to the traditional pure working fluid systems, the second law efficiency
   could be increased up to 21.26\% in the novel system. The performance of
   the novel system and traditional pure working fluid systems under
   different heat sources are also compared, the results show that
   performance of the novel system is still better than that of traditional
   pure working fluid systems. This study could provide a new solution for
   offshore energy demand.},

Title = {Horizontal and vertical food web structure drives trace element trophic
   transfer in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {246},
Pages = {772-781},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite a vast amount of literature has focused on trace element (TE)
   contamination in Antarctica during the last decades, the assessment of
   the main pathways driving TE transfer to the biota is still an
   overlooked issue. This limits the ability to predict how variations in
   sea-ice dynamics and productivity due to climate change will affect TE
   allocation in the food web. Here, food web structure of Tethys Bay
   (Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea, Antarctica) was first characterised by
   analysing carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15)
   in organic matter sources (sediment and planktonic, benthic and sympagic
   primary producers) and consumers (zooplankton, benthic invertebrates,
   fish and birds). Diet and trophic position were also characterised using
   Bayesian mixing models. Then, relationships between stable isotopes,
   diet and TEs (Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and V) were assessed in order
   to evaluate if and how horizontal (organic matter pathways) and vertical
   (trophic position) food web features influence TE transfer to the biota.
   Regressions between log{[}TE] and delta C-13 revealed that the sympagic
   pathway drives accumulation of V in primary consumers and Cd and Hg in
   secondary consumers, and that a coupled benthic/pelagic pathway drives
   Pb transfer to all consumers. Regressions between log{[}TE] and delta
   N-15 showed that only Hg biomagnifies across trophic levels, while all
   the others TEs showed a biodilution pattern, consistent with patterns
   observed in temperate food webs. Although the Cd behavior needs further
   investigations, the present findings provide new insights about the role
   of basal sources in the transfer of TEs in polar systems. This is
   especially important nowadays in light of the forecasted trophic changes
   potentially resulting from climate change-induced modification of
   sea-ice dynamics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Features of the seasonal variation of the semidiurnal, terdiurnal and

Journal = {ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE},

Abstract = {This paper presents the thermal forcing of the semidiurnal, terdiurnal,
   and 6-h components of the migrating tide induced by ozone heating in
   stratosphere and lower mesosphere. The heating as a function of local
   time is determined from the global ozone observed by the Microwave Limb
   Sounder on the Aura satellite. The harmonic components of the heating
   rates of the semidiurnal, terdiurnal and the 6-h periodicities are
   calculated using the Strobel/Zhu parameterized model and then decomposed
   into Hough modes. Seasonal variations of each harmonic component and its
   Hough modes are presented. For all three tidal components, the majority
   of the annual mean O-3 heating projects onto symmetric modes. The
   semiannual variation is a prominent signal in almost all of the
   symmetric Hough modes near the stratopause. The strongest annual
   variation takes place in the asymmetric modes. The results also show
   that, during the solstice season, the maximum forcing of the diurnal and
   terdiurnal component occurs in the summer hemisphere while the maximum
   forcing of the semidiurnal and 6-h components occurs in the winter
   hemisphere. The global mean ozone density and the tidal components of
   the ozone heating rate are different between December-January and
   June-July. The asymmetry in the heating is primarily due to the 6.6\%
   annual variation in the solar energy input into the Earth's atmosphere
   due to the annual variation of the Sun-Earth distance.},

Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Engineered sulfate injection has been introduced as an effective
   technology to enhance the remediation of soil and groundwater
   contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. While some studies indicate that
   sulfate injection is a promising method for the treatment of
   hydrocarbon-contaminated subsurface systems, its application in the
   brackish soil environments is unknown. In this study, we explored
   related geochemical indicators along with soil adsorption and dissolved
   phase concentrations to provide an improved understanding of the
   hydrocarbon-contaminated subsurface responses to the sulfate injection
   in brackish environments. A series of flow-through experiments
   representing in situ groundwater anaerobic bioremediation were conducted
   and two sulfate injection episodes were applied to examine the
   degradation of dissolved naphthalene under low salinity and brackish
   conditions. As opposed to the substantial body of previous studies that
   salinity restricts biodegradation, the results from this study showed
   that naphthalene anaerobic degradation was more stable once the salinity
   was as high as that at the sampling location in the coastal brackish
   environment. While increasing naphthalene concentration from 4 to 12 mg
   L(-1)did not limit biodegradation efficiency under brackish condition
   similar to the sampling location, it adversely restricted the developed
   reducing conditions and biodegradation process under low salinity
   conditions. This highlights the adaption of the microbial communities
   within the soil to the brackish environment at the sampling location
   suggesting that changing the salinity during engineered sulfate
   application can make the remediation process more susceptible against
   the environmental stresses and substrate toxicity. The results of this
   study provide insight into the engineered sulfate application as a
   remediation strategy for potential removal of dissolved naphthalene from
   the contaminated brackish groundwater.},

Abstract = {Surface water intakes are a major capital cost for seawater desalination
   facilities, and their performance can greatly impact the operation of
   the entire system. Alternative intakes, based on the riverbank
   filtration concept, are increasingly being implemented because they are
   less expensive than conventional intakes and can also provide natural
   filtering of feedwater prior to the entry of water into the treatment
   plant. The basic concept is to use vertical or horizontal wells or
   galleries located near the seawater source to produce feed water, while
   taking advantage of the natural sand filtration provided by the beach
   sands and other sediments.
   Although conceptually simple, the successful design of beach gallery
   intakes must consider a variety of sedimentological and hydrogeological
   factors. Production rates are dependent upon both the hydraulic
   conductivity of the beach sediments and the length of the flow path from
   the seawater source to the gallery. Beach galleries constructed inland
   above the high tide line thus require relatively great lengths or areas
   to produce a given amount of seawater. Inasmuch as beach galleries act
   as slow sand filters, they are subject to clogging at the sediment-water
   interface. Carbonate scaling has been a major problem in some systems
   constructed in carbonate sediments in tropical settings because of the
   supersaturation of seawater with respect to calcite. Beach sedimentation
   patterns can also impact the long-term performance of beach galleries.
   Improperly designed or constructed beach galleries may be exposed or
   damaged in beaches that experience erosion under normal or storm
   conditions. Prograding beaches are more problematical as the galleries
   become increasingly distant from the seawater source, which reduces
   potential production rates.
   The self-cleaning beach gallery overcomes some of the inherent
   limitations of beach galleries constructed above high tide line. The
   gallery is a horizontal collection system within a single trench that is
   Constructed between the low and high tides lines. The normal wave action
   keeps the sediment-water interface above the gallery clean by
   mechanically removing fine-grained sediment and marine organisms. The
   daily tidal cycle keeps the sediment above the gallery saturated and
   maintains a short travel time. The top of the gallery is set at about 4
   m below normal low tide, so erosion should not be a concern and scaling
   can be managed. However, progradation of the beach may still adversely
   impact system performance.
   The design of the self-cleaning beach gallery requires field testing to
   obtain site-specific data on the hydraulics of surficial sediments. The
   field testing should involve aquifer performance testing and a
   small-scale pilot test. Hydraulic flow modeling is necessary to evaluate
   potential gallery design options and potential water yields. An
   assessment of shoreline sedimentation dynamics should also be performed,
   which may involve a literature review or field investigations.},

Abstract = {Low-elevation islands face threats from sea level rise (SLR) and
   increased storm intensity. Evidence of endangered species' population
   declines and shifts in vegetation communities are already underway in
   the Florida Keys. SLR predictions indicate large areas of these habitats
   may be eliminated in the next century. Using the Florida Keys as a model
   system, we present a process for evaluating conservation options for
   rare and endemic taxa. Considering species characteristics and habitat,
   we assess central issues that influence conservation options. We
   contrast traditional and controversial options for two animal and two
   plant species giving special emphasis to perceptions of ecological risk
   and safety from SLR and suggest courses of action. Multiple strategies
   will be required to spread extinction risk and will be effective for
   different time periods. Global climate change presents an uncertain,
   perhaps no-analog future that will challenge land managers and
   practitioners to re-evaluate equilibrium-state-conceived laws and
   policies not only for these taxa, but for many facing similar threats.
   To embrace conservation in a changing world will require a new dialogue
   that includes controversial ideas, a review of existing laws and
   policies, and preparation for the oncoming change.},

Abstract = {In order to mitigate the potential problems associated with increasing
   atmospheric CO2 levels, RITE has started the biological CO2 fixation and
   utilization project in 1990 using photosynthetic microorganisms, such as
   microalgae and photosynthetic bacteria. Photosynthetic microorganisms
   utilize flue gas CO2 as a carbon source and solar energy as the energy
   source to produce biomass which can be used for useful materials.
   Extensive screening has been conducted to obtain photosynthetic
   microorganisms from nature with high capability in fixing CO2 and/or
   with the ability to produce useful materials. More than ten strains of
   microalgae with high capability in fixing CO2 and/or with the ability to
   produce useful materials have been obtained. Two green algal strains
   obtained by the screening, Chlorella sp. UK001 and Chlorococcum
   littorale, showed the high CO2 fixation rates exceeding the initial
   target value of 1gCO2/1/day at 24h illumination. Botryococcus braunii
   SI-30 was obtained as the alga producing hydrocarbons which can be used
   as recyclable fuel resource. This alga contains more than 15\% of its
   dry weight as hydrocarbons and shows relatively high growth rate than
   other Botryococcus braunii strains.
   Efforts are now under way to increase their CO2 fixation rates by
   optimizing the culture conditions and to develop applications for the
   products. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing technologies can provide accurate, cost-effective and
   real time information for sustainable forest management. Present study
   demonstrates the use of high resolution IRS1C data and Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) with supervised classification to define
   different types of forest cover in protected and unprotected areas for
   growing forest stock assessment of Shorea robusta Gaertn. F. (Sal)
   dominated forest. Further, a map of the same was generated which was
   subsequently validated using phyto-sociological field data in Dehradun,
   India. Three forest canopy density classes, viz., 10-30\%, 30-70\% and
   >70\% could be differentiated. Aim of this study was to test usefulness
   of LISS-III and test its efficacy for assessment of total growing stock
   and further in generalising the method for the whole area. The
   homogeneous forest strata were field inventoried for individual tree (>=
   10 cm dbh) diameter using sample quadrats at each of the study sites.
   The plot inventory data was analysed to arrive at image level growing
   stock estimates. An inspection review was carried out to be familiar
   with the study area using hard copy of LISS-III data to correlate the
   image. A scheme of forest classification was developed and the forests
   were stratified into moist Siwalik sal forest (3C/C2a), dry Siwalik sal
   forest (5B/C1a) and non-forest. High level of accuracy was achieved by
   ground truthing. The objective of the stratification was to categorize
   the forest into homogeneous strata. The biomass measurement from same
   sample plots was also integrated into the remote sensing technique for
   large spatial information on AGB distribution. The study revealed that
   protected sal forest has maximum volume and growing stock per hectare
   followed by unprotected sal forest. Same was also true for sal
   associates. The study also shows good scope of high resolution data for
   growing stock and forest carbon assessment, opening scope in estimating
   carbon sequestration potential of forest which may help researchers and
   policy makers to understand global and regional CO2 cycle.},

Abstract = {The Siberian Traps represent one of the most voluminous continental
   flood basalt provinces on Earth. The mass extinction at the end of the
   Permian was the most severe in the history of life. In the present
   paper, these two major concurrent events that occurred are analysed and
   a geochemical model coupled with an energy balance model is used to
   calculate their environmental impact on atmospheric CO(2), oceanic
   delta(13)C, and marine anoxia. The latitudinal temperature gradient is
   reduced relative to today, resulting in warmer temperatures at high
   latitudes. The warmer climate and the presence of fresh basaltic
   provinces increase the weatherability of the continental surfaces,
   resulting in an enhanced consumption of atmospheric CO(2) through
   weathering. First, the eruption of the Siberian traps is accompanied by
   a massive volume of (13)C depleted CO(2) degassed from the mantle and
   added to the ocean through silicate weathering, thus lowering marine
   delta(13)C. Second, the rapid collapse in productivity induces a strong
   decrease in the global organic carbon burial. This too tends to increase
   the proportion of light carbon in the ocean. These two effects can
   explain the low delta(13)C values across the PT boundary, and methane
   release need not be invoked to explain the delta(13)C fluctuations. It
   is proposed that the phosphorus cycle, which drives primary production
   in the model, plays an important role on the recovery of productivity
   and the delta(13)C variations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {The sensitive detection of low frequency small accelerations is
   particularly desirable in seismic prediction, wave energy utilization
   and dam/bridge damage monitoring. In this work, we report for the first
   time the electro-spinning of polyvinylidene fluoride/carbon dots
   (PVDF/CDs) nanofibers and their piezoresponse under different
   acceleration rate. The desirable nanofibrous mats, with thin and smooth
   morphology, are acquired by changing spinning parameters, and beta-phase
   crystal content is improved with increasing introduction of CDs. At an
   acceleration rate of 6 m/s(2), frequency of 1.6 Hz and applied force of
   35 N, the maximum open-circuit voltage density of 55.6 V cm(-3), and
   short-circuit current density of 2.1 mu A cm(-3) are achieved for
   PVDF/CDs fiber with 1\% (wt/v) CDs loading. In particular, the fiber mat
   is tested with detection sensitivity of acceleration change up to 0.4
   m/s(2) for potential as an acceleration sensor. Moreover, CDs not only
   improve the piezoresponse of PVDF fiber, but also endow the substrate
   with multifluorescence performance. The as prepared fiber could be used
   as active layer to perceive the prevalent small acceleration changes at
   low frequency, such as those from earthquake, tidal flow, ocean waves,
   reservoir dams, railway bridges, and so on.},

Abstract = {The biodiversity in the sub-Antarctic region is threatened by climatic
   change and biological invasions, which makes the understanding of
   distributions of biotas on sub-Antarctic islands essential. Although the
   distribution patterns of vascular plants and insects on sub-Antarctic
   islands are well documented, this is not always the case for
   microarthropods. This study provides the first quantitative assessment
   of the distribution and abundance of microarthropods on Prince Edward
   Island (PEI), one of two islands in the Prince Edward Island group.
   Microarthropod community structure differed significantly between PEI
   and nearby Marion Island, with only two invasive alien species found on
   PEI compared with Marion Island. Furthermore, species richness,
   abundance and community structure differed significantly between habitat
   types on both islands. This study emphasizes the importance of
   quarantine measures when visiting PEI to maintain its status as one of
   the more pristine islands in the sub-Antarctic region.},

Title = {Assessment of heavy metal contamination in the surficial sediments from

Abstract = {The present study analyzed the concentrations of four heavy metals iron
   (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) on the surface sediments
   in Sebou river estuary (Morocco) and evaluated the role of sediment
   grain size and organic carbon (OC) on the distribution of metals.
   Sixteen numbers of surface sediment samples collected during the summer
   period of 2019 from Sebou estuary were used for the study. The dominance
   of fine-grained sediments (clay and silt) was observed in the study
   region. The organic carbon distribution indicates that they were brought
   from the surroundings of coastal areas. Correlation analysis indicates
   that fine-grained particles and organic carbon (OC) control the
   distribution of metals and suggest strong association between metals and
   fine-grained fractions. Significant correlations were evident between Zn
   and Mn (r = 0.66), and between Mn and Fe (r = 0.70). The correlations
   between OC versus Mn (r = 0.80), OC and sand (r = -0.70), OC versus silt
   (r = 0.96), and OC and clay (r = 0.87) were significant. Contamination
   levels of metals were examined by using geo-accumulation index and
   contamination factor, which indicate that the estuarine sediments were
   unpolluted to moderately polluted with heavy metals. The study thus
   provides baseline data on the heavy metal distribution in the Sebou
   estuary for identifying the source of future contamination.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are considered to be a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide
   because of their high calcium carbonate production and low net primary
   production. This was tested by direct measurement of diurnal changes in
   the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P-CO2) in reef waters during two
   3-day periods; one in March 1993 and one in March 1994, on Shiraho reef
   of the Ryukyu Islands, Japan. Although the P-CO2 values in reef waters
   exhibited large diurnal changes ranging from 160 to 520
   microatmospheres, they indicate that the reef flat area is a net sink
   for atmospheric carbon dioxide. This suggests that the net organic
   production rate of the reef community exceeded its calcium carbonate
   production rate during the observation periods.},

   revolution period},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {The C-13 concentration in atmospheric CO2 has been declining over the
   past 150 years as large quantities of C-13-depleted CO2 from fossil fuel
   burning are added to the atmosphere. Deforestation and other land use
   changes have also contributed to the trend. Looking at the C-13
   variations in the atmosphere and in annual growth rings of trees allows
   us to estimate CO2 uptake by land plants and the ocean, and assess the
   response of plants to climate. Here I show that the effects of the
   declining C-13 trend in atmospheric CO2 are recorded in the isotopic
   composition of paper used in the printing industry, which provides a
   well-organized archive and integrated material derived from trees'
   cellulose. C-13 analyses of paper from two European and two American
   publications showed, on average, a -1.65 +/- 1.00 parts per thousand
   trend between 1880 and 2000, compared with -1.45 and -1.57 parts per
   thousand for air and tree-ring analyses, respectively. The greater
   decrease in plant-derived C-13 in the paper we tested than in the air is
   consistent with predicted global-scale increases in plant intrinsic
   water-use efficiency over the 20th century. Distinct deviations from the
   atmospheric trend were observed in both European and American
   publications immediately following the World War II period.},

Abstract = {As a part of removal of toxic heavy metals from hazardous wastes, solid
   phase extraction (SPE) of mercury(II) at trace and ultra trace levels
   was studied using 1-(2-thiazolylazo)-2-naphthol (TAN) functionalized

   quantitatively in the pH range 6.0 +/- 0.2. Other parameters that
   influence quantitative recovery of mercury(II), viz. percent
   concentration of TAN in AC, amount of TAN-AC, preconcentration time and
   volume of aqueous phase were varied and optimized. The possible means of
   removal of Hg(II) from other metal ions that are likely to be present in
   the wastes of the chloroalkali industry is discussed. The potential of
   TAN-functionalized AC SPE material for decontaminating mercury from the
   brine sludge and cell house effluent of a chloralkali plant has been
   evaluated. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Chinese Plan has provided an important model for the global fight
   against COVID-19 since its outbreak. The present study describes the
   structural characteristics of China's COVID-19 patent cooperation
   network at the province, city, and applicant levels by using social
   network analysis based on data from the Incopat global patent database
   since 2020, which helps to clarify the current technology accumulation
   in this field in China, and provide patent information support for the
   scientific efforts to fight against COVID-19. The findings are as
   follows: First, the inter-regional cooperation level in China's COVID-19
   patent cooperation network shows a decreasing trend from eastern to
   central to western regions. At the inter-applicant cooperation level,
   kinship-based cooperation is the strongest, business-based cooperation
   has the widest scope, while proximity-based cooperation exists
   throughout these two main models of cooperation. Second, coastal
   provinces and cities occupy a core position in the network, and play an
   important role in utilizing structural holes and bridging. Patent
   applicants with high centrality are mostly firms. Research institutes
   and universities mainly play the role of bridges. Third and lastly,
   there is no large number of cliques at the province and city levels.
   However, there is a tendency for cliques to develop at the applicant
   level. Hence, actions are needed to prevent the development of
   information barriers.},

Abstract = {Geomorphologic information, topographic maps (dated 1967), aerial
   photographs (dated from 1999 to 2008), and spatial analysis procedures
   were used to investigate a 90 km long coastal sector in South Sicily
   (Italy). Information was obtained on coastal erosion/accretion areas,
   global sediment circulation pattern and littoral cells distribution.
   Human-made structures and natural headlands constituted important
   artificial limits dividing littoral in morphological cells. Ports and
   marinas were observed at Scoglitti, Punta Secca, Marina di Ragusa,
   Donnalucata and Pozzallo. Most of them worked as ``transit{''} limits
   which interrupted predominant, eastward directed sedimentary transport,
   this way generating accretion in updrift (west) side of mentioned
   structures and erosion in downdrift (east) side. During the 1967-2008
   period, about 62,000 m(2) and 42,000 m(2) of beach surface were
   respectively formed updrift of Scoglitti and Donnalucata ports. The
   construction of Pozzallo port gave rise to the formation of a
   ``convergent{''} limit which favoured large accretion (94,000 m(2)) east
   of port structure. Most important natural structures were observed at
   Punta Zafaglione, Punta Braccetto and Cava d'Aliga. The knowledge of
   littoral cells distribution acquires a great importance for appropriate
   management of coastal erosion processes which may be mitigated
   installing by-passing systems in ports and marinas and carrying out
   nourishment works in eroding areas, often located downdrift of mentioned
   structures (when they work as transit limits) and in central part of
   littoral cells (when they work as convergent limits).},

Abstract = {inorganic carbon removal through acidification is a common practice
   prior to isotopic analysis of macroinvertebrate samples. We have
   experimentally tested the effect of acidification on the elemental and
   isotopic composition of a range of beach arthropod species.
   Acidification resulted in a significant depletion of 7.7\% and 1.2\% on
   average for carbon and nitrogen, respectively, suggesting that acid
   washing affects body carbon compounds other than carbonates. With a few
   exceptions, delta C-13 and delta N-15 showed no changes following 1 N
   HCl attack. Based on those exceptions, our results show that only those
   samples with a high CaCO3 content result in impoverished C-13 as a
   consequence of acidification. Those suspected to be carbonate-free are
   not significantly affected. Concerning delta N-15 values, only high
   carbonate species were affected when treated with HCl. As a standard
   protocol, it is recommended to acidify only carbonate-rich samples prior
   to delta C-13 analyses. When possible, muscle tissue samples should be
   used instead of the entire organism. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {Our objectives are to examine the effects of hummock-depression spatial
   heterogeneity on plant communities and soil properties, and to
   understand the process of maintaining and adjusting
   microtopography-mediated hydrological inputs and their spatial
   fluctuations that produce obvious microhabitats. We set up 36 plots (1 m
   x 1 m) and sampled 45 plant and 225 soil samples in flooded (FH) and
   non-flooded hummocks (NFH) and depressions of the marshy, and the
   surrounding non-wetland meadows as well as in the Yellow River Source
   Zone, west China. We evaluated whether the alpine marshy wetland has a
   fertile island effect by the comparison method. Our results show that
   hummock presence can increase the spatial heterogeneity of the
   microhabitat and promote the plant diversity and soil fertility of the
   Kobresia tibetica community. Plant height, coverage, above-ground
   biomass, species richness and diversity were significantly higher in the
   FH and NFH microhabitat than in the areas between hummocks and
   surrounding non-wetland meadows. Compared with broad alpine meadows, the
   hummock-depression complex provided a microhabitat favorable to the
   growth of Cyperaceae. In the 0-50 cm soil layer, the closer the soil
   layer was to the ground surface, the higher its soil organic carbon and
   total nitrogen contents. Thus, in deeper layers, the gap between soil
   nutrients in wetland hummock-depression microhabitat and in the
   surrounding alpine meadows becomes smaller. Hence, the wetland
   hummock-depression microhabitat formed a fertile island pattern.
   Therefore, these results contribute toward improving our understanding
   of ecosystem restoration in alpine marshy meadows.},

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Water management that alters riverine ecosystem processes has strongly
   influenced deltas and the people who depend on them, but a full
   accounting of the trade-offs is still emerging. Using palaeoecological
   data, we document a surprising biogeochemical consequence of water
   management in the Colorado River basin. Complete allocation and
   consumptive use of the river's flow has altered the downstream estuarine
   ecosystem, including the abundance and composition of the mollusc
   community, an important component in estuarine carbon cycling. In
   particular, population declines in the endemic Colorado delta clam,
   Mulinia coloradoensis, from 50-125 individuals m(-2) in the pre-dam era
   to three individualsm-2 today, have likely resulted in a reduction, on
   the order of 5900-15 000 tCyr(-1) (4.1-10.6 mol Cm-2 yr(-1)), in the net
   carbon emissions associated with molluscs. Although this reduction is
   large within the estuarine system, it is small in comparison with annual
   global carbon emissions. Nonetheless, this finding highlights the need
   for further research into the effects of dams, diversions and reservoirs
   on the biogeochemistry of deltas and estuaries worldwide, underscoring a
   present need for integrated water and carbon planning.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {The dissolution of aragonite particles in the ocean primarily depends on
   the degree of undersaturation of seawater with respect to that mineral.
   Most of the upper Atlantic Ocean, particularly north of 30degreesS and
   at depths of less than 2000 m, is supersaturated with respect to
   aragonite, whereas much of the deep Atlantic is undersaturated. Here we
   report, for the first time, shallow layers of aragonite-undersaturated
   water between 20degreesS and 15degreesN in the eastern tropical
   Atlantic. These layers are centered at 800 m and are surrounded by
   aragonite-supersaturated water above and below. This feature most likely
   results from a combination of chemical and biological processes
   including the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and the oxidation of organic
   matter falling from the highly productive overlying surface water.
   Reaction with protons resulting from these processes decreases the
   carbonate ion concentration and consequently the saturation state of the
   waters with respect to aragonite. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic
   CO2 during the industrial era has caused a significant increase in the
   size of the undersaturated layers. Future expansion will likely occur
   laterally to the west and south, where the degree of supersaturation is
   low compared to waters to the north. This expansion of the
   undersaturated layers is a prime example of how human activity during
   the industrial era has altered the upper ocean chemistry by injecting
   fossil fuel CO2 into the ocean.},

Abstract = {Jurassic deposits of shallow to marginal marine (delta) environments are
   widely reported from different continents of the world. This study shows
   inter-relationship of the animal-sediment behaviours in shallow and
   marginal marine conditions, suggesting an interpretation of the possible
   ichnodisparity. The Jurassic succession exposed at Washtawa Dome and
   Adhoi Anticline of Wagad highland, Kachchh comprises an approximately
   341 m thick succession, divided into two formations - Lower Washtawa and
   Upper Wagad Sandstone. Eight sparsely to highly bioturbated sedimentary
   units show twenty-three identifiable ichnospecies from fifteen
   ichnogenera representing five ichnoassemblages broadly attributable to
   the Skolithos and the Cruziana ichnofacies, and developed in
   shallow-marine strandplain shoreface and delta depositional facies. The
   relative frequency statistical data reveals the dominant occurrence of
   feeding structures generated by polychaetes preferentially in quartz
   arenites. These structures represent sub-horizontal, sub-vertical and
   complex burrows, and show twelve and six categories of architectural
   designing Callovian-Oxfordian of shallow-marine shoreface and
   Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian shallow-water delta successions, respectively.
   The lower ichnodiversity and ichnodisparity associated with the
   Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian deltaic intervals represents a decrease in the
   exploitation of under-used ecospace, due to unfavourable environmental
   conditions rather than an expression of evolutionary radiation.},

Abstract = {In an effort to improve our understandings on the workings of the
   coastal ocean for a variety of environmental applications and to improve
   upon forecasts of storm surge for residents along the West Coast of
   Florida, the University of South Florida's College of Marine Science
   (USF/CMS) established a real-time Coastal Ocean Monitoring Prediction
   System (COMPS) for the West Florida Shelf region. COWS program assets
   consist of arrays of offshore buoys and coastal tidal stations for
   surface meteorology and in-water measurement of temperature, salinity,
   and currents. This instrumentation array reflects a substantial
   investment in equipment and effort. Although rare, conditions can arise
   in which the bottom moored offshore surface buoys can separate and drift
   freely. To prevent platform and equipment loss, several onboard methods
   have been used to determine and track the buoy's position when
   necessary. This paper discusses the in-house development of a
   self-contained, satellite-based, moored surface buoy position tracking
   device.},

   times exceeding that in surrounding oceanic waters. The dark microbial
   CO2 uptake there was 10 to 30 times higher than in nearby waters. In
   areas of shallow underwater volcanic hydrotherms around Whale Isl and
   While Isl (New Zealand), as well as in Matupi Harbour Bay (New Britain
   Isls), a significant rates of microbial chemosynthesis were recorded in
   water column (5-10 mg C/m3 day). The microbial biomass was there 20-69
   mg C/m3, and above the field of a algalbacterial mats it was 100 mg
   C/m3. The volume of microbial cells in waters influenced by hydrothermal
   activity was up to 0.4 mum3   which is 2-4 times higher than in
   surrounding areas. The primary phytoplankton production was also
   significantly higher in these waters, along with notable activity of
   hydrogen- and methane-oxidizing bacteria and thiobacilli. In the areas
   influenced by hydrotherms (Whale Isl), planktonic amoebae dominated in
   microplankton communities reaching 30x10(3) individuals per liter. Under
   discussion are probable mechanisms of influence of shallow hydrothermal
   effluents upon the biota of coastal waters.},

Title = {Reduction of NOx and SO2 Emissions by Shore Power Adoption},
Journal = {AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Shore power systems, an alternative energy source to ships at berth,
   have the potential to improve air quality at ports and surrounding
   areas. This study assessed the reduction of four major air pollutants:
   PM10, PM2.5, NOx, and SO2, from adopting shore power at the Port of
   Kaohsiung. The reduction was assessed in two scenarios, S1 and S2, with
   a capacity to provide shore power to 342 and 780 ships at berth,
   respectively. The emissions from the ships were estimated based on the
   operation loads of the auxiliary engines, average time at berth, and
   emission factors. Additionally, the AERMOD model was used to simulate
   the ground-level dispersion of the four pollutants to the surrounding
   urban areas. The simulation results showed that the elevated areas in
   the city were vulnerable to ship emissions, especially for NOx. The
   maximum simulated contribution at ground level from S1 and S2 were 78.8
   mu g m(-3) and 147 mu g m(-3) for NOx, and 20.1 mu g m(-3) and 42.5 mu g
   m(-3) for SO2, respectively; while the results for PM10 and PM2.5 were
   insignificant. The reduction benefit was then calculated as the ratio of
   the simulated air pollutant concentration to the observed concentration
   at the local air quality monitoring station. The highest reduction
   benefit of shore power adoption at the port was for NOx and SO2
   emissions, with average reduction benefits of 8.70\% +/- 2.10\% and
   11.74\% +/- 2.95\%, respectively. In conclusion, shore power adoption at
   the Port of Kaohsiung would greatly reduce air pollution in the port
   city, especially in residential areas, and be considered a sustainable
   solution to improving air quality and combating climate change.},

Title = {An integrated model for aquaculture production, pathogen interaction,
   and environmental effects},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {536},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {This work develops, applies, and tests a methodology for simulating
   three key determinants of aquaculture carrying capacity: production,
   environmental effects, and pathogen interactions. Deterministic models
   for simulation of biomass production and environmental effects for fish
   and shellfish were combined with stochastic host-pathogen models based
   on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) paradigm to build
   the Aquaculture, Biosecurity, and Carrying Capacity (ABC) platform.
   Individual growth models for the finfish species Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar) and gilthead bream (Sparus aurata), and the bivalve species
   Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Eastern oyster (C. virginica)
   were integrated into an Individual Based Model (IBM) capable of scaling
   to any farm size; the resulting framework was coupled to host-pathogen
   models for: (i) salmon-Infectious Hepatopoietic Necrosis virus (IHNv);
   (ii) Pacific oyster-Oyster herpes virus (OsHV-1); and (iii) Pacific
   oyster-Vibrio aestuarianus.
   ABC was run for a set of scenarios both with and without pathogens, and
   results presented for (a) husbandry: food depletion in Eastern oyster,
   showing the effects of overstocking on production and water-column
   chlorophyll; an increase in the spacing of farm sections increases yield
   by 80\%; (b) environmental effects: changes due to marine cage culture
   of gilthead sea bream, and the effect of hydrodynamics on reduction of
   dissolved oxygen (DO) and increase in ammonia; a farm sited in a
   high-dispersion area shows a variation of about 1.5 mg L-1 in DO among
   cages, whereas the range in a low-dispersion site can be up to 5 mg L-1;
   (c) three case-studies of pathogen interaction: (i) effects of a
   salmon-IHNv pathogen event on yield and mortality, and consequences of
   event timing (early- or late-stage in the culture); the late-stage event
   costs almost 300,000 USD more in wasted feed, and the Feed Conversion
   Ratio (FCR) increases from 1.5 to 2.3; (ii) consequences for a Vibrio
   outbreak in oysters; even though the disease event is very short, there
   is a 7.8\% decrease in oyster harvest, and net nitrogen removal, a key
   regulatory ecosystem service, decreases by 10.2\%; and (iii) climate
   change scenarios based on Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5
   and consequences for a herpes outbreak in oysters; ABC results show that
   the direct effect of climate change on growth, which leads to earlier
   harvest and less non-harvestable animals, is strongly outweighed by the
   indirect effect of a pathogen outbreak, which results in a 27.8\%
   increase in dead biomass and a 28.6 t (20.1\%) reduction in harvested
   biomass. Furthermore, since there is a relationship between the
   colonisation of C. gigas by Vibrio and full-blown outbreaks of oyster
   herpes, climate change may lead to synergistic mortality effects of
   significant concern to oyster growers in temperate waters.
   The importance of a combined approach to aquaculture carrying capacity
   that includes the disease component and its relationship to
   environmental stressors is discussed, together with the management
   relevance and potential application by industry of an integrated
   framework.},

Abstract = {A five step sequential extraction technique, following Tessier's

   aluminium with major sedimentary phases (exchangeable, carbonate,
   manganese and iron oxides, organic and residual fraction) in four short
   sediment cores collected from El-Burullus lagoon of the Nile delta,
   Egypt. This study is a first approach of chemical fractionation of
   aluminium in one of the protective areas of the Mediterranean Sea of
   Egypt. The total metal content was also determined. The results of the
   fractionation study indicated that aluminium was mainly associated with
   the residual fraction (> 95\%). The organic and Fe-Mn oxide fractions
   were the next important phases. The exchangeable and carbonate fractions
   were less than 1\%, limiting its potential toxicity as a pollutant. The
   geochemical analysis of aluminium forms reflected the lithogenic origin
   of this metal in the study area.},

Title = {Resource allocation and extracellular acid-base status in the sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis in response to CO2 induced seawater
   acidification},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {194-207},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic CO2 emission will lead to an increase in seawater pCO(2)
   of up to 80-100 Pa (800-1000 mu atm) within this century and to an
   acidification of the oceans. Green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus
   droebachiensis) occurring in Kattegat experience seasonal hypercapnic
   and hypoxic conditions already today. Thus, anthropogenic CO2 emissions
   will add up to existing values and will lead to even higher pCO(2)
   values >200 Pa (>2000 mu atm). To estimate the green sea urchins'
   potential to acclimate to acidified seawater, we calculated an energy
   budget and determined the extracellular acid base status of adult S.
   droebachiensis exposed to moderately (102-145 Pa, 1007-1431 mu atm) and
   highly (284-385 Pa, 2800-3800 mu atm) elevated seawater pCO(2) for 10
   and 45 days.
   A 45-day exposure to elevated pCO(2) resulted in a shift in energy
   budgets, leading to reduced somatic and reproductive growth. Metabolic
   rates were not significantly affected, but ammonium excretion increased
   in response to elevated pCO(2). This led to decreased O:N ratios. These
   findings suggest that protein metabolism is possibly enhanced under
   elevated pCO(2) in order to support ion homeostasis by increasing net
   acid extrusion. The perivisceral coelomic fluid acid-base status
   revealed that S. droebachiensis is able to fully (intermediate pCO(2))
   or partially (high pCO(2)) compensate extracellular pH (pH(e)) changes
   by accumulation of bicarbonate (maximum increases 2.5 mM), albeit at a
   slower rate than typically observed in other taxa (10-day duration for
   full pH(e) compensation). At intermediate pCO(2), sea urchins were able
   to maintain fully compensated pH(e) for 45 days. Sea urchins from the
   higher pCO(2) treatment could be divided into two groups following
   medium-term acclimation: one group of experimental animals (29\%)
   contained remnants of food in their digestive system and maintained
   partially compensated pH(e) (+2.3 mM HCO3-), while the other group
   (71\%) exhibited an empty digestive system and a severe metabolic
   acidosis (-0.5 pH units, -2.4 mM HCO3-). There was no difference in
   mortality between the three pCO(2) treatments.
   The results of this study suggest that S. droebachiensis occurring in
   the Kattegat might be pre-adapted to hypercapnia due to natural
   variability in pCO(2) in its habitat. We show for the first time that
   some echinoderm species can actively compensate extracellular pH.
   Seawater pCO(2) values of >200 Pa, which will occur in the Kattegat
   within this century during seasonal hypoxic events, can possibly only be
   endured for a short time period of a few weeks. Increases in
   anthropogenic CO2 emissions and leakages from potential sub-seabed CO2
   storage (CCS) sites thus impose a threat to the ecologically and
   economically important species S. droebachiensis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Mangrove forests provide enormous goods and services. However, the
   future of the forests has been questioned at many occasions. In
   response, much attention has been given to the ecology and biology of
   mangroves with little information, if any, on the phylogenetic structure
   of mangrove forests despite recent multiple calls for prioritizing
   conservation actions based on phylogenetic information. In this study,
   we firstly review briefly the ecology of mangrove forests and secondly
   review our current knowledge of the phylogenetic structure of the
   forests. On a global scale, there is a match between biogeographic
   regions experiencing species decline and the distribution ranges of
   highly evolutionary distinct species, thus raising concern and providing
   ways of prioritizing actions. At the regional scale, mangrove
   communities (as evidenced by the net relatedness index) are
   phylogenetically patterned such that closely related species occur more
   often than expected by chance, perhaps indicative of recent in situ
   diversification. This is also a concern as pests and pathogen attacks
   tend to spread rapidly among closely related species. However, there is
   a trend toward a phylogenetic overdispersion when moving eastward.
   Nonetheless, the patterns described at regional scale may not always
   match those of local scale, but knowledge of mangrove phylogenetic
   structure at local scale is scant. For example in South Africa, the
   impact of human activities on the phylogenetic structure of mangrove
   communities is unknown. We conclude with a call for more research at a
   local scale, particularly in South Africa, to elucidate how mangrove
   forest is phylogenetically restructured in response to anthropogenic
   disturbances, and how phylogenetic information can inform conservation,
   management and restoration of mangrove forests. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published

Abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can either protect all seabed habitats
   within them or discrete features. If discrete features within the MPA
   are to be protected humans have to know where the boundaries are. In
   Lyme Bay, SW England a MPA excluded towed demersal fishing gear from 206
   km(2) to protect rocky reef habitats and the associated species. The
   site comprised a mosaic of sedimentary and reef habitats and so `non
   reef' habitat also benefited from the MPA. Following 3 years protection,
   video data showed that sessile Reef Associated Species (RAS) had
   colonised sedimentary habitat indicating that `reef' was present. This
   suggested that the functional extent of the reef was potentially greater
   than its visual boundary. Feature based MPA management may not
   adequately protect targeted features, whereas site based management
   allows for shifting baselines and will be more effective at delivering
   ecosystem goods and services. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

   cores to those described and analysed by de Beaulieu et al. (1980) and
   de Beaulieu \& Reille (1984a) provides a preliminary chronostratigraphic
   framework. Sedimentation during MIS3 started with accumulation of sands
   and silts and was followed by alternating gyttja and clayey gyttja
   silts. Exceptionally high sedimentation rates during MIS2 led to the
   infilling of the basin. Alternating organic-rich and minerogenicrich
   sediments appear to coincide with changes in pollen assemblages (de
   Beaulieu \& Reille 1984a) and suggest that millennial-scale climatic
   changes controlled lake productivity and catchment stability during most
   of MIS3.},

Abstract = {Roadside unit (RSU) planning is vital for the operation of an
   intelligent transportation system (ITS). RSUs provide ground coverage
   limited by obstacles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can complement RSU
   coverage by providing flexible connectivity capable of adapting coverage
   for traffic fluctuations, energy consumption, and budgetary constraints
   that all have effects on ITS operations. This article proposes a general
   RSU/UAV joint planning solution, where complex dynamic parameters are
   investigated. The objective is to maximize the effective coverage of
   placed RSUs and UAV docks given: a budget comprised of periodic
   operating expenses and capital expenditures, limitations of the ground
   transceivers and UAVs, and use of renewable energy to offset the on-grid
   electricity cost. We formulate a mixed-integer quadratically constrained
   problem that can determine the optimal placement of RSUs and UAV
   stations, RSU activation schedules, if solar panels are attached, and
   their coverage during each time period. Due to NP-hard complexity of
   such a planning problem, we design a heuristic algorithm that produces
   suboptimal solutions in less time. Afterward, we perform a sensitivity
   analysis and show that changes to the parameters lead to logical shifts
   in infrastructure coverage. Additionally, we visualize the algorithm's
   performance on a large setting-Manhattan Island.},

Title = {Effectuation of biogas based hybrid energy system for cost-effective
   decentralized application in small rural community},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Decentralized applications of the renewable energy system (RES) have
   become extremely popular in rural areas for its pre-eminence over
   extravagant grid extension. The present study proposes a hybrid
   renewable energy system (HRES) for a small rural community at
   Patharpratima island, Sundarbans, India. The abundance of solar energy
   and cow excrement necessitate the study area fit for an HRES based on PV
   and biogas plant (BP). The present work introduces a detail biogas
   resource assessment considering monthly variation in gas production and
   satisfies an extensive dynamic electricity demand by the proposed HRES.
   The component sizes of the system have been optimized using particle
   swarm optimization (PSO) to reduce the total net present value (TNPV).
   For more practical realization, the typical meteorological year (TMY)
   data have been used which legitimately estimate the output of the HRES.
   Furthermore, a system control strategy has been designed to impose the
   proper operating sequence on the HRES components and to ensure zero loss
   of power supply probability (LPSP). The suggested model levies a cost of
   energy (COE) (sic) 9.22/kWh which is found to be very economic than
   alike systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {52, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding and controlling the transformations of transition metal
   dichalcogenides (TMDs) from amorphous precursors into two-dimensional
   (2D) materials is important for guiding synthesis, directing
   fabrication, and tailoring functional properties. Here, the combined
   effects of thermal energy and electron beam irradiation are explored on
   the structural evolution of 2D MoS2 flakes through the thermal
   decomposition of a (NH4)(2)MoS4 precursor inside an ultrahigh vacuum
   (10(-9) Torr) scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The
   influence of reaction temperature, growth substrate, and the initial
   precursor morphology on the resulting 2D MoS2 flake morphology, edge
   structures, and point defects are explored. Although thermal
   decomposition occurs extremely fast at elevated temperatures and is
   difficult to capture using current STEM techniques, electron beam
   irradiation can induce local transformations at lower temperatures,
   enabling direct observation and interpretation of critical growth steps
   including oriented attachment and transition from single- to multilayer
   structures at atomic resolution. An increase in the number of layers of
   the MoS2 flakes from island growth is investigated using electron beam
   irradiation. These findings provide insight into the growth mechanisms
   and factors that control the synthesis of few-layer MoS2 flakes through
   thermolysis and toward the prospect of atomically precise control and
   growth of 2D TMDs.},

Abstract = {Management of power flow at the distribution level will undergo major
   changes in coming years as a result of increasing penetration of
   distributed generation, storage and enhanced capability to control
   loads. Better management is especially important for the purpose of
   improving resilience of power delivery, for example in the case where
   part of the distribution system islands during a blackout to provide
   service to critical loads. To model such situations, an accurate
   description of power flow must be coupled to an accurate description how
   customers use electricity services. Here, a co-simulation involving a
   bottom-up residential load synthesis framework and the GridLAB-D
   distribution system simulator is described. An example based on a real
   distribution feeder, combining residential loads, a set of critical
   loads, including a hospital, a supermarket and a water treatment plant,
   as well as a large battery and a distribution-level solar array, is used
   to demonstrate the combined capabilities of the customer load and
   distribution models. The example shows how demand-response behavior can
   be modeled with the co-simulation. An enhanced capacity to integrate
   human behavior models with power flow simulators will become essential
   for designing distribution management systems, as grid modernization
   leads to more customer-owned devices that can be used to match
   generation and load.},

Title = {3D cloud detection and tracking system for solar forecast using multiple

Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},

Volume = {118},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We propose a system for forecasting short-term solar irradiance based on
   multiple total sky imagers (TSIs). The system utilizes a novel method of
   identifying and tracking clouds in three-dimensional space and an
   innovative pipeline for forecasting surface solar irradiance based on
   the image features of clouds. First, we develop a supervised classifier
   to detect clouds at the pixel level and output cloud mask. In the next
   step, we design intelligent algorithms to estimate the block-wise base
   height and motion of each cloud layer based on images from multiple
   TSIs. This information is then applied to stitch images together into
   larger views, which are then used for solar forecasting. We examine the
   system's ability to track clouds under various cloud conditions and
   investigate different irradiance forecast models at various sites. We
   confirm that this system can (1) robustly detect clouds and track
   layers, and (2) extract the significant global and local features for
   obtaining stable irradiance forecasts with short forecast horizons from
   the obtained images. Finally, we vet our forecasting system at the
   32-megawatt Long Island Solar Farm (LISF). Compared with the persistent
   model, our system achieves at least a 26\% improvement for all
   irradiance forecasts between one and fifteen minutes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {The transient thermal-hydraulic phenomena of a DVI (Direct Vessel
   Injection) line break LOCA (Loss-of-Coolant Accident) in pressurized
   water reactor, APR1400, were investigated. In order to understand the
   phenomena during the LOCA transient, a reduced-height and
   reduced-pressure integral loop test facility, the SNUF (Seoul National
   University Facility), was constructed with scaling down the prototype.
   For the appropriate test conditions in the experiment with the SNUF, the
   energy scaling method was suggested with scaling the coolant mass
   inventory and the thermal power for the reduced-pressure condition.
   According to the conditions determined by the method, the experimental
   study was performed with the SNUF. The experimental results showed that
   the phenomenon of the downcomer seal clearing played a dominant role in
   the reduction of the system pressure and the recovery of the coolant
   level in the core. That phenomenon occurred when the steam incoming from
   cold legs penetrates the coolant in the upper downcomer toward the
   broken DVI line. The experimental results were compared with the
   prototype analysis to estimate the energy scaling method, so that the
   experiment reasonably simulated the phenomena in the prototype. For the
   analytical investigation, the experiment was simulated with MARS code to
   validate the calculation capability of the code, especially for the
   downcomer seal clearing, which showed good agreement with the results of
   experiment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Surface cross-stream eddy diffusion in the Southern Ocean is estimated
   by monitoring dispersion of particles numerically advected with observed
   satellite altimetry velocity fields. To gain statistical significance
   and accuracy in the resolution of the jets, more than 1,5 million
   particles are released every 6 months over 16 years and advected for one
   year. Results are analyzed in a dynamic height coordinate system.
   Cross-stream eddy diffusion is highly inhomogenous. Diffusivity is
   larger on the equatorward flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current
   (ACC) along eddy stagnation bands, where eddy displacement speed
   approaches zero. Along such bands, diffusivities reach typical values of
   3500 m(2) s(-1). Local maxima of about 8-12.10(3) m(2) s(-1) occur in
   the energetic western boundary current systems. In contrast, diffusivity
   is lower in the core of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with values of
   1500-3000 m(2) s(-1), and continues to decrease south of the main ACC
   system. The distribution of eddy diffusion is set at three scales: at
   circumpolar scale, the mean flow reduces diffusion in the ACC and
   enhances it on the equatorward side of the current; at basin scale,
   diffusion is enhanced in the energetic western boundary current
   extension regions; at regional scale, diffusion is enhanced in the wake
   of large topographic obstacles. We find that the zonally average
   structure of eddy diffusion can be explained by theory which takes mean
   flow into account; however, local values depend on eddy propagation, not
   simply described by a single wave speed, and topography.},

   landscape changes of Central Argentina},
Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},

Volume = {87},

Abstract = {We conducted a thorough survey of populations of Ctenomys within the
   distributional ranges of all species that currently represent the
   Ctenomys mendocinus species complex in Central Argentina. From the
   Atlantic Southeastern coast to the heights of the Los Andes mountain
   range we sampled individuals for all the previously recognized species
   within this species complex (C. australis, C. azarae, C. porteousi, C.
   ``chasiquensis{''} and C. mendocinus). Sequences of different fragments
   of mitochondrial DNA were used to assess the phylogenetic relationships
   between individuals and to understand the processes responsible for the
   observed geographic distribution of genetic variation. The genetic
   differentiation among most of the sequences was moderated, although
   highly divergent haplotypes were recorded in some localities in the West
   of our study area, suggestive of the occurrence of a new so far
   undescribed species. The phylogenetic reconstructions suggested the
   presence of three major clades into C. mendocinus complex species that
   do not agree with the currently proposed taxonomy. Phylogeographic and
   demographic estimates indicated that the C. mendocinus species complex
   experienced a strong and recent process of population expansion. We
   propose that the pattern of distribution of haplotype diversity in the
   C. mendocinus species complex corresponds to a scenario of mild local
   differentiation with subsequent expansion to the current distribution
   ranges. Demographic changes through time suggest that
   glacial-interglacial cycles of Late Quaternary, and the consequent
   variation in the aridity of Central plains in Argentina, had strong
   effects on the evolution and cladogenesis of the C. mendocinus species
   complex. (C) 2017 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by

   Northwestern North Atlantic case study},
Journal = {OCEAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {539-548},
Abstract = {Continental shelves play a key role in the cycling of nitrogen and
   carbon. Here the physical transport and biogeochemical transformation
   processes affecting the fluxes into and out of continental shelf systems
   are reviewed, and their role in the global cycling of both elements is
   discussed. Uncertainties in the magnitude of organic and inorganic
   matter exchange between shelves and the open ocean is a major source of
   uncertainty in observation-based estimates of nitrogen and carbon
   fluxes. The shelf-open ocean exchange is hard to quantify based on
   observations alone, but can be inferred from biogeochemical models.
   Model-based nitrogen and carbon budgets are presented for the
   Northwestern North Atlantic continental shelf. Results indicate that
   shelves are an important sink for fixed nitrogen and a source of
   alkalinity, but are not much more efficient in exporting organic carbon
   to the deep ocean than the adjacent open ocean for the shelf region
   considered.},

Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {For a long time, the genus Bacillus has been known and considered among
   the most applicable genera in several fields. Recent taxonomical
   developments resulted in the identification of more species in
   Bacillus-related genera, particularly in the order Bacillales (earlier
   heterotypic synonym: Caryophanales), with potential application for
   biotechnological and industrial purposes such as biofuels, bioactive
   agents, biopolymers, and enzymes. Therefore, a thorough understanding of
   the taxonomy, growth requirements and physiology, genomics, and
   metabolic pathways in the highly diverse bacterial order, Bacillales,
   will facilitate a more robust designing and sustainable production of
   strain lines relevant to a circular economy. This paper is focused
   principally on less-known genera and their potential in the order
   Bacillales for promising applications in the industry and addresses the
   taxonomical complexities of this order. Moreover, it emphasizes the
   biotechnological usage of some engineered strains of the order
   Bacillales. The elucidation of novel taxa, their metabolic pathways, and
   growth conditions would make it possible to drive industrial processes
   toward an upgraded functionality based on the microbial nature.},

Abstract = {There is a constant increase of temperature on global scale from north
   to south. An increase of 0.9 degrees Celsius is monitored since 1906
   onward. In addition, this increase of temperature is even more at some
   particular polar areas both in north of 60 degrees N and south of 60
   degrees S. Both Arctic and Antarctic regions require oceanographic
   observations more than ever now. It is pertinent to mention here that
   during the past decade, though the temperatures in Antarctic have
   remained consistent but the Arctic has experienced an increase of 0.75
   degrees C which appears to be much higher than even the global average.
   Similarly, the Arctic is going through vanishing ice sheets, a gradual
   rise of traffic in this particular part of the ocean, and, last but not
   least, a drastic increase in exploration of natural resources.
   Furthermore, the ice covering protection of Antarctic requires
   continuous monitoring \& persistent measurement. In this regard, polar
   Argo buoys have initiated collecting data at poles due to technological
   improvements in buoys. These improvements include the both way
   communication with the aid of Iridium satellite network, upgraded
   software to store winter profiles and algorithm development for
   avoidance of ice. It is recommended to increase Argo standard sampling
   (3 degrees x 3 degrees) towards poles by enhancing 285 buoys in the sea
   of Arctic and 360 in the proximity of Antarctic. It is pertinent to
   mention here that despite the aforementioned improvements, the Argo
   buoys still experience varying damages caused to their expensive gear on
   multiple occasions thus limiting their frequent employments. In addition
   to that, the survivability of Argo floats is compromised in polar
   regions as compared to the open global oceans. The accumulative effects
   of such causes make the cost of even a single
   Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (from now on CTD) profile to be much
   costly with regard to the profile obtained from open oceans. Similarly,
   in order to develop gridded fields of salinity \& temperature which
   optimally preserve the temporal and spatial capacities of the profiling
   buoys for the Argo array, the In-Situ Analysis System (ISAS) was
   evolved. In 2009, re-analysis on global scale was conducted for the
   first time. Since then, this particular system has been upgraded to
   include all kinds of time series along with the profiles of vertical.
   These gridded spheres of ISAS are utterly comprising in-situ outcomes.
   This near real-time temperature-salinity gridded data on the global
   scale is acquired for the upper 2000 meters. An optimum interpolation is
   the basis of these gridded Argo data sets. These data sets are
   considered as a source of observation in the bipolar regions of the
   globe. Finally, animals are equipped with Autonomous CTD-Satellite Relay
   Data Loggers (from now on CTD-SRDLs) which are mounted on such animals
   on land. Then, the data is acquired \& stored in the form of
   hydrographic profiles during their foraging travels. The moment these
   seals return to surface, the data is transmitted by satellite ARGOS. The
   ARGOS satellites are responsible to ascertain the position of the seals
   by employing triangulation. On the Southern fronts of the ocean, data is
   processed and saved by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU). This data is
   then received by the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) in real-time.
   This particular CTD data undergoes a post-processing proceeding which
   involve editing, rectification, \& subsequent endorsement of
   hydrographic measurements. These records are then made public via
   varying portals.
   In general, such CTD-borne animals are relentlessly recording and
   offering vertical temperature-salinity profiles up to the depth of 2000
   meters. This particular study is aimed at analyzing multifarious ways to
   obtain better estimation of both thermal \& salinity measurements in and
   around the surroundings of polar regions. To accomplish this, the study
   discusses viable data in the proximity of bipolar regions from Argo,
   gridded Argo data sets, and CTD-borne animals in order to highlight the
   prospect of covering polar oceans. Consequently, the data from the 03
   sources is presented both on individual and comparative charts at 02
   core locations in the proximity of the polar regions.},

Abstract = {Technological innovation in a business organization becomes the trend in
   the 21st century. With more progress on hand, e-commerce has paved its
   way to the mainstream giving transformation opportunities such that in

   of a fisherfolk community in the province of Siquijor, Philippines and
   its development of a marine sanctuary park that created livelihood
   opportunities to the local fisherfolks in the area which led to the
   presence of Guiwanon Spring Park Resort. With close competition to other
   tourism-related establishments, the resort decided to adopt an
   e-commerce solution to keep abreast of technology innovation. Thus, the
   researcher creates an interactive mobile-ready application known as the
   GSPR e-Booking System which includes features that help the resort catch
   a wider market online. Further, creating conceptual foundations from
   existing practices, the author develops a new, integrated business
   transformation framework that helps explain how an e-commerce solution
   has generated a supplemental aid in the socio-economic development of
   the said community. This framework is then presented to motivate other
   developing business communities to embrace more appropriate solution for
   issues brought by the current technological situation.},

Title = {Dynamic changes in mangroves of the largest delta in northern Beibu
   Gulf, China: Reasons and causes},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {504},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Many mangrove forests occur along estuaries and deltas are experiencing
   irreparable losses throughout the world due to changes in natural
   factors and intensive anthropogenic interferences. However, little
   information is available regarding variations in mangrove forests and
   associated reasons and causes. Here, the long-term dy-namic patterns of
   mangrove forests in the Nanliu River Delta (NRD), the largest delta in
   the Beibu Gulf, China, were detected based on a series of hydrosediment
   data and remote sensing images between 1986 and 2020. The results
   indicated that the total mangrove forest area of the NRD increased in an
   incremental manner, even though a rapid decline occurred in the western
   terrestrial margin of the delta before 1998. Additionally, mangrove
   forests have expanded southeastward to the sea in the eastern NRD, and
   they have colonized to the southwest in the western NRD. Moreover,
   long-lasting horizontal seaward expansion with vertical accretion in the
   bare tidal flat of the NRD created new sites for potential mangrove
   regeneration. Furthermore, an average annual sea level rise of 0.2 mm
   per year and an 86\% decline in fluvial sediment supply could not cause
   expansions and local losses of mangrove forests. The combination of
   local tidal currents and waves transports sufficient estuarine sediment
   to the northeast into the delta to provide important sediment material
   for the deposition of mangrove tidal flats. The mangrove forest
   destruction induced by local residents and the ecological restoration
   implemented by the government are the causes of the continuous serious
   losses and extensive gains of mangrove forests, respectively. The
   results highlighted that the dynamic changes in mangrove forests in the
   NRD caused by driving forces from natural and human interferences can
   serve as significant references for mangrove forest restoration and
   decision-making policy management in similar deltas around the world.},

Title = {Evaluating the Performance of Fire Rate of Spread Models in
   Northern-European Calluna vulgaris Heathlands},
Journal = {FIRE-SWITZERLAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Land-use, climate, and policy changes have impacted the fire regimes of
   many landscapes across northern Europe. Heathlands in oceanic climates
   are globally important ecosystems that have experienced an increase in
   the prevalence of destructive wildfire. Many of these landscapes are
   also managed using traditional prescribed burning that enhances their
   structural diversity and agricultural productivity. The changing role of
   wild and managed fire highlights a necessity to better understand the
   performance of fire behaviour prediction models for these ecosystems to
   support sustainable fire risk management. Our research evaluates the
   outputs of several empirical and quasi-empirical prediction models, as
   well as their varying software implementations, against observations of
   fire behaviour. The Rothermel model and its implementations predict
   rates of spread with similar accuracy to baseline empirical models and
   provide tolerable estimates of observed fire rate of spread. The generic
   shrubland empirical model developed by Anderson et al. consistently
   overpredicts observed rates of spread for prescribed burns in target
   fuel structures, but its predictions otherwise have a strong correlation
   with observed spread rate. A range of empirical models and software
   tools thus appear appropriate to assist managers who wish to evaluate
   potential fire behaviour and assess risk in heathland landscapes.},

Abstract = {Qiangtang Basin is a large Mesozoic marine sedimentary basin located on
   the northern Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Multiple sets of evaporites were
   observed in the Middle Jurassic Buqu Formation through field outcrop
   description and thin sections analysis, so as to form the sets of
   evaporite-carbonate sedimentary sequences. The evaporites in the Buqu
   Formation are represented by gypsum and anhydrite rocks that contain
   minor secondary diagenetic features such as massive, rosette,
   chicken-wire, and satin spar gypsum. Two lithofacies association types
   were identified in the Buqu Formation, including sparry oolitic
   limestone-dolomite-gypsum/anhydrite and micrite-carbonaceous
   mudstone-gypsum/anhydrite. The former was deposited in an
   intertidal-supratidal (tidal flat) setting and the latter was deposited
   in a subtidal lagoon setting. Two depositional sequences were
   distinguished, including Buqu sequence 1 and Buqu sequence 2. Gypsum of
   the intertidal setting is mainly developed in a lowstand system tract in
   both Buqu sequences 1 and 2, while gypsum of the subtidal setting is
   mainly developed in a highstand system tract in Buqu sequence 2.
   Combining the measured evaporites thickness in the field with
   sedimentary facies analysis, the distribution of the Middle Jurassic
   Buqu Formation evaporites is clear in the Qiangtang Basin, which may
   serve as a local seal for oil and gas plays in this region.},

Abstract = {Previous studies evaluating the success of river restorations have
   rarely found any consistent effects on benthic invertebrate assemblages.
   In this study, we analyzed data from 24 river restoration projects in
   Germany dating back 1 to 12 years and 1231 data sets from adjacent river
   reaches that lie within 0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 km rings centered on the
   restored sites. We calculated restoration success and recolonization
   potential of adjacent river reaches based on stream-type-specific
   subsets of taxa indicative for good or bad habitat quality. On average,
   the restorations did not improve the benthic invertebrate community
   quality. However, we show that restoration success depends on the
   presence of source populations of desired taxa in the surrounding of
   restored sites. Only where source populations of additional desired taxa
   existed within a 0-5 km ring around the restored sites were benthic
   invertebrate assemblages improved by the restoration. Beyond the 5-km
   rings, this recolonization effect was no longer detected. We present
   here the first field results to support the debated argument that a lack
   of source populations in the areas surrounding restored sites may play
   an important role in the failure to establish desired invertebrate
   communities by the means of river restorations. In contrast, long-range
   dispersal of invertebrates seems to play a subordinate role in the
   recolonization of restored sites. However, because the surroundings of
   the restored sites were far from good ecological quality, the potential
   for improvement of restored sites was limited.},

Abstract = {The tidal stream kinetic energy can be abstracted by the horizontal
   axial turbine, and most concentrate closing to seaside, where the tidal
   stream turbine must work near the free surface. The interaction between
   wave surface and the turbine will affect the turbine performance. In
   this work, the performance of tidal stream turbine working beneath the
   free surface was simulated, and the wave was discussed. The results
   indicated that the turbine depth Fr number is the main factor that
   affects wave induced by the turbine. As the turbine depth Fr number is
   less than 1.0, the wave is not apparent, and as the Fr number increased,
   the wave height rose. By the analysis of turbine performance, it is
   discovered that the wave will influence turbine efficiency, but the
   relationship between wave height and turbine efficiency is not regular.},

Abstract = {Cold seep carbonates were studied from two locations (Dongsha and
   Chiasian) in the northern South China Sea and on Taiwan island. Lipid
   biomarkers and their stable carbon isotopic compositions extracted from
   these seep carbonate samples were analyzed in this study and the results
   pointed at the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) as responsible for
   carbonate formation. Distinct AOM communities were indicated by
   isotopically highly depleted archaeal biomarkers (with delta C-13 values
   as low as -140.8\%(0) VPDB) and bacterial biomarkers (with delta C-13
   values as low as -128.6\%0 VPDB), which confirmed that biogenic methane
   was the dominant carbon source. Lipid biomarker distributions indicated
   that ANME-2 archaea were prevalent in sample TVG3-C2g from Dongsha and
   sample JX8 from Chiasian. In addition, differences of the AOM
   communities between the carbonates appeared to be caused by the
   respective biogeochemical environments. ANME-1 archaea tended to be
   abundant in high-Mg calcite carbonates, and their formation might be
   linked to low methane fluxes. In contrast, ANME-2 consortia were
   prevalent in aragonite carbonates and appeared to have prospered at
   sites with high methane supply. Our data imply that the mineralogy of
   the seep carbonates precipitated in the northern South China Sea appears
   to be influenced by the distinct ANME consortia, which are induced by
   methane flux. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Although stylolites in quartz-rich sandstones have been described and
   modeled, more feldspathic sandstones have not been similarly
   investigated. The Upper Jurassic Ula sandstone, Norwegian North Sea, a
   subarkose with 15 to 25\% feldspar, displays stylolites with prominent
   low-porosity haloes up to 10 cm wide. Detailed mineralogical and
   chemical profiles across several stylolites and haloes are used to
   investigate the role of feldspar in mineral reactions at stylolites and
   to constrain the transport of chemical components.
   Quartz and feldspar are intensely dissolved at the margins of
   stylolites. The surrounding haloes are characterized by: dissolution of
   quartz and feldspar, intense compaction, anomalously high feldspar
   content, high concentrations of clay, and oxide cement volumes that
   increase away from the stylolite. Chemical mass-balance calculations
   demonstrate that silica and elements associated with feldspar (Al2O3,
   Na2O, K2O) were exported from the haloes. Grain-size data and evidence
   for aluminum loss from the halo indicate that primary concentrations of
   clay and mica were not higher near the stylolites; and that the
   petrographic and geochemical patterns reflect the diagenetic
   concentration of clay. The analysis suggests that K-feldspar dissolution
   at and near the stylolite resulted in precipitation of authigenic illite
   near the site of K-feldspar dissolution, due to the low solubility of
   Al3+. This in turn catalyzed chemical dissolution of quartz in the
   low-porosity halo.
   Transport of CaO, MgO, and MnO into the haloes suggests that the haloes
   were zones of higher pH. The increased pH, perhaps due to the presence
   of clays, would have also increased quartz solubility, consistent with
   evidence for silica export from the halo. The dissolution of K-feldspar
   in the absence of kaolinite would also have raised pH around the site of
   K-feldspar dissolution and illite precipitation, favoring carbonate
   precipitation.
   This interpretation of stylolite diagenesis differs from conventional
   models based on quartz-rich sandstones, in which quartz cement volumes
   decrease away from stylolites. Models for compaction in arkosic
   sandstones need to account for the enhanced dissolution of quartz that
   is driven by K-feldspar dissolution and for catalysis by the resulting
   illite.},

Title = {Mechanisms for migration of anadromous herring: An ecological basis for
   effective conservation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Land use planners have the challenge of incorporating biologically sound
   guidelines into development plans to balance human development with
   conservation of natural resources. Valued as an important component of
   the natural heritage of the northeastern United States, anadromous river
   herring (Alosa pseudoharengus, A. aestivalis) represent a model system
   to look at how ecological data can help conserve biological diversity in
   systems impacted by humans. Juvenile river herring spend 3-7 months in
   freshwater then migrate to the ocean. However, factors that trigger
   migration, and consequently influence distribution and abundance, are
   not well understood. Thus, our objectives in this study were to (1)
   describe juvenile river herring migration patterns, both ``peak{''}
   (>1000 fish/wk) and ``all{''} (>30 fish/wk) migration; (2) identify
   potential cues for this migration; (3) examine effects of one, type of
   ecosystem alteration, low water levels, on river herring; and (4)
   suggest how this information can be incorporated into an effective
   conservation plan. Weekly during June-November 1994, we sampled both
   migrating and nonmigrating river herring and seven associated abiotic
   and biotic variables in one continuous and one intermittent flow system
   on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. We then used multiple logistic regression to
   predict when juvenile river herring migrate. In the continuous-flow
   system, juvenile river herring migration primarily occurred during the
   midday hours from July through early November, with the peaks of
   migration, comprising >96\% of all migrating fish observed in early July
   and early September.. The peaks of migration occurred during the new
   moon, when Bosmina spp. density was low, and all periods of migration
   occurred when water visibility was low, during decreased amounts of
   rainfall. In the intermittent flow system, juvenile river herring
   migration was frequently inhibited due to low water levels, and herring
   were on average 25 mm smaller than those in the continuous flow system.
   Using these results, managers can more effectively monitor river herring
   populations by identifying factors associated with migration and
   isolating critical flow periods when fish movement is likely to occur.
   Thus, we can detect changes in herring population size due to human
   impacts. Ultimately, these data can be incorporated into an ecologically
   sound conservation plan for juvenile anadromous herring that may help
   ensure their survival while balancing human needs for natural resources.},

Title = {Aggregation of microgrids with DC system},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {134-143},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The aspiration of this paper is to scrutinize the feasibility of DC
   system connecting multiple AC microgrids for improved system
   reliability. In this paper, first multiple microgrids connected through
   a back to back connection (with better power flow control as well as
   frequency isolation) is contemplated. Each of the microgrids can operate
   in island or grid connected mode. The control and power flow management
   of the multiple microgrids system are first depicted with a common DC
   link capacitor. As second step, the DC capacitor is dispersed among the
   converter terminals as separate converter DC capacitor. As final step,
   the back to back converters are assumed to be far from each other and
   connected through DC cables. This result in a multi terminal medium
   voltage DC system connected to multiple AC microgrids. The active power,
   reactive power and output current capability of each converter terminal
   depends on the corresponding microgrid operating mode, DG output, local
   load demand etc. A DC system connecting multiple AC microgrids (with VSC
   interfaced DGs and ability to operate in island) bestows a test bench
   for studying the possibility smaller grids for higher reliability and
   better power flow management. The control schemes, generalized
   guidelines for such integrated system are proposed based on currently
   available standards, equipment, devices, system solutions and market
   requirements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Biodiversity Impacts from Salinity Increase in a Coastal Wetland},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {47},
Number = {12},
Pages = {6384-6392},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {A Life Cycle Impact Assessment method was developed to evaluate the
   environmental impact associated with salinity on biodiversity in a
   Spanish coastal wetland. The developed characterization factor consists
   of a fate and an effect factor and equals 3.16 x 10(-1) +/- 1.84 x
   10(-1) PAF.m(3).yr.m(-3) (PAF: Potentially Affected Fraction of species)
   indicating a ``potential loss of 0.32 m(3) ecosystem{''} for a water
   consumption rate of 1 m(3).yr(-1). As a result of groundwater
   consumption with a rate of 1 m(3).yr(-1), the PAF in the lost cubic
   meter of ecosystem equals 0.05, which has been proposed as the maximum
   tolerable effect to keep the ecosystem intact. The fate factor was
   calculated from seasonal water balances of the wetland Albufera de Adra.
   The effect factor was obtained from the fitted curve of the potentially
   affected fraction of native wetland species due to salinity and can be
   applied to other wetlands with similar species composition. In order to
   test the applicability of the characterization factor, an assessment of
   water consumption of greenhouse crops in the area was conducted as a
   case study. Results converted into ecosystem quality damage using the
   ReCiPe method were compared to other categories. While tomatoes are
   responsible for up to 30\% of the impact of increased salinity due to
   water consumption on ecosystem quality in the studied area, melons have
   the largest impact per tonne produced.},

Abstract = {Three and a half years of hydrographic, velocity, and meteorological
   observations are used to examine the dynamics of upper Elkhorn Slough, a
   seasonally inverse, shallow, mesotidal estuary in central California.
   The long-term observations revealed that residual circulation in Elkhorn
   Slough is seasonally variable, with classic estuarine circulation in the
   winter and inverse estuarine circulation in the summer. The strength of
   this exchange flow varied both within years and between years, driven by
   the annual cycle of dry summers and wet winters. Subtidal circulation is
   a combination of both tidal and density-driven mechanisms. The subtidal
   magnitude and reversal of the exchange flows is controlled primarily by
   the density gradient despite the significant tidal energy. As the
   density gradient weakens, the underlying tidal processes generate
   vertically sheared exchange flows with the same sign as that expected
   for an inverse density gradient. The inverse density gradient may then
   further strengthen this inverse circulation. These data were collected
   as part of the Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory and demonstrate the
   utility of long-term in situ measurements in a coastal system, as
   consideration of such a wide range of forcing conditions would not have
   been possible with a less comprehensive data set.},

Abstract = {The abyssal plains below the central gyres of the major ocean basins are
   examples of extremely food-limited (oligotrophic) environments. Standing
   stocks are orders of magnitude below adjacent continental margins. This
   is assumed to be a function of the slow and meagre rain of particulate
   detritus from the euphotic zone. These abyssal deserts are also
   characterized by low rates of aerobic metabolism in and on oxic
   sediments, with minimal mineral accumulation. The low biomass and
   metabolism correlate well with the rate of particulate organic carbon
   (POC) input measured with sediment traps. The biomass distribution among
   size groups of organisms displays an increase in the relative
   percentages of microbiota (bacteria and meiofauna) and, in some systems,
   of the mega-fauna, but the latter may not be a universal trait Data on
   standing stocks and community metabolism from several different
   food-limited systems are used in a mathematical model to simulate the
   community responses to pulses of organic matter and possible
   predator-prey interactions. Processes in the deep central North Pacific
   are compared with a polynya on the east coast of Greenland and the
   continental shelf of the western Gulf of Mexico. The simulated responses
   suggest that carbon cycling in some benthic sub-systems may be affected
   by `'top down'' (predation) as well as `'bottom up'' (POC sedimentation)
   processes.},

Abstract = {The Suffolk coast around Dunwich and Sizewell has experienced major
   changes during the past 2000 years, with significant loss of land caused
   by marine erosion. Against a background of projected acceleration in sea
   level rise and storminess resulting from global climate change, concern
   has been expressed that present coastal defences may become
   unsustainable in the medium to longer term, and that the survival of
   internationally important wildlife habitats is under threat. This paper
   examines the past coastal evolution in the light of natural processes,
   and provides a discussion of future management options. Based on
   analysis of historical maps, charts, air photographs, and ground survey
   data, it is shown that rates of coastal erosion have actually been much
   lower in the last 50 years than historically, and at present there is
   little scientific evidence to support a case for large-scale managed
   realignment or abandonment of flood and coastal defences. However, in
   some areas, notably the very northern end of the Minsmere barrier and
   the middle part of the Dunwich-Walberswick barrier, local realignment
   and/or construction of stronger secondary flood defences are required to
   establish a coastal condition that is more in equilibrium with current
   processes, and to provide adequate protection against marine flooding
   even under present climatic and sea level conditions.},

Abstract = {The interaction of Cs and CO was studied for submonolayer coverages of
   Cs on Ru(0001) by means of high-resolution electron energy-loss
   spectroscopy (HREELS), thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), and
   low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). From the HREEL spectra and the
   2x2 LEED pattern it is concluded that two-dimensional islands of Cs+2CO
   stoichiometry are formed first. For high CO doses CO adsorbs on the bare
   Ru surface between the islands as concluded from the nu(C-O)
   stretch-mode frequency and the (root 3x root 5)R30 degrees LEED pattern.
   Besides some local interaction between CO and Cs, there is strong
   evidence found for a long range, through substrate interaction. Our data
   can be understood in terms of a charge redistribution model; Cs donates
   a given amount of charge to the surface which is then backdonated to and
   shared between the adsorbed CO molecules within the (Cs+2CO)-islands and
   outside of them on the bare surface. The desorption temperature of CO
   with theta(CO)-->0 increases nearly linearly with theta(Cs) indicating
   CO desorption out of a two dimensional Cs gas in which the lateral
   interaction increases with theta(Cs). (C) 1997 American Institute of

Abstract = {We carried Out a comprehensive exploration of predation by the invasive
   predatory cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi in the laboratory. A range of
   potential prey was offered to the predator, including all major summer
   nearshore zooplankton taxa in Lake Michigan; we used prey in different
   concentrations from 5 to 100 ind. L(-1). We found that Cercopagis is a
   generalist capable to consume a variety of prey species, including small
   and large prey, and slowly and rapidly swimming prey. Consumption rates
   increased with concentration in several species, but did not saturate
   even at the highest concentration tested (40 or 100 ind. L(-1)).
   Cladocerans were consumed lit a higher rate than copepods. Cercopagis
   was able to catch and handle prey of nearly its own body size to prey
   about seventeen times smaller; however, it did not show any clear size
   preference within this range. In contrast to most indigenous Great Lakes
   zooplankton, Cercopagis can efficiently feed on veligers of the zebra
   Mussel, another invader from the Ponto-Caspian region.},

Title = {Wave-influenced formation of new ice: Model building and a test case},
Journal = {OCEAN MODELLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A parameterization of new ice formation in a wave field has been
   developed. Detailed processes of new sea ice growth with multiple ice
   types (nilas, grease, and pancake ice) and associated wave attenuation
   by different sea ice types are presented and implemented into a coupled
   ROMS and SWAN model. Sea ice formation includes growth and
   transformation of frazil, grease, pancake, nilas and solid ice. Ice
   types are determined by thermal condition and the wave fields.
   Simultaneously, the attenuation of wave energy through the ice cover is
   dependent on ice types. The two processes are coupled by COAWST. The
   resulting coupled model is applied to the Bohai Sea. When compared with
   in-situ data from oil platforms, the model performed well in
   distinguishing solid ice, pancake and nilas. When compared with previous
   ice models without the consideration of new ice types, the appearance of
   solid ice is delayed, the total ice area and ice volume are increased,
   solid ice thickness is increased while the type-averaged thickness is
   reduced and heat flux from the ocean to air is increased during the
   freezing phase. By considering the new ice formation, wave attenuation
   in the test case is enhanced.},

Abstract = {Glaciations in the Cordillera of western North America began during the
   Late Miocene in the St Elias Range and coastal ranges near Anchorage,
   Alaska.  Radiometric dating of the tephra and lava flows intercalated in
   the succession of older tills, loesses and outwash deposits permits the
   reconstruction of the probable early glacial sequence along the
   Cordillera.  No one site shows the complete sequence, but the available
   data suggest synchroneity of the major glacial events throughout the
   region.
   The first evidence for cold conditions at low elevations at midlatitudes
   is from 3.5 MaBP.  By 2.8 Ma, alpine glaciations may have occurred in
   the Sierra Nevada and ice wedges had formed in bedrock near Fairbanks,
   Alaska.  Three more major glaciations complete with contemporary
   periglacial and permafrost landforms had occurred by 1.65 Ma, while at
   least six more major cold events can be recognized during the Quaternary
   period.  Once again, expansion of permafrost conditions occurred during
   each event and forms an integral part of the evidence for climatic
   change.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The effects of changes in climate predicted for 2100-reduction in
   recharge, increase in water demand and sea-level rise-on groundwater
   volume and saltwater intrusion have been quantified in the Maltese
   Islands, an archipelago located at the center of the Mediterranean Sea.
   A three-dimensional density dependent and heterogeneous model, working
   in transient conditions, was developed based on morphological and
   geological information. The hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the
   lithological formations were derived from previous tests and studies
   conducted on the islands. The complex fault system intersecting the area
   has also been included in the model. The results show that among the
   three considered factors affecting groundwater resources, the most
   significant is the increase in water demand, which is closely followed
   by the decrease in groundwater recharge. Sea-level rise plays a marginal
   role. The 80-year simulation period showed that these combined impacts
   would cause a loss of more than 16\% of groundwater volume.</p>},

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {174},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Architectural heritage is one of the most essential parts of community
   well-being; it reflects a complexity of ideas and local cultural values.
   Currently, new plans or programmes are needed to manage and protect
   heritage building areas, such as the cities on the Pacific Chilean
   coastline that are susceptible to natural afflictions. This research
   intends to apply a functional service life methodology to a new context
   in Chile: the city of Valparaiso, which represents one of the most
   excellent examples of late 19th century urban and architectural
   development in Latin America. The service life model assists a panel of
   professional experts in making key decisions about heritage building
   preservation. This research work applied the serviceability method to 25
   heritage building constructions (timber-framed masonry) located in
   Valparaiso. The viability of the system has been verified in previous
   works and applications in Europe (Spain and Portugal) and the South of
   Chile (Valdivia). The majority of the sample presents a good functional
   level, with the exception of just three cases which are positioned in
   the middle level/grey area (cost and benefits are taken into account and
   balanced). These case studies should be analysed periodically over time
   to preserve their functionality. Intervention has been defined as a
   priority; this information is completely relevant to establishing an
   approximate periodicity of intervention for this kind of heritage
   construction and in this kind of context in South America. This work is
   complemented by a climate change approximation which considers the main
   possible effects on built heritage located in Valparaiso, Chile. The
   research work can help stakeholders become involved in the definition of
   future effective preventive maintenance programmes for heritage building

Volume = {3},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {There has been a considerable expansion in the use of desalination
   plants for supplying potable water to many communities in the world.
   However, the production of brine, which is known to be a concentrated
   solution, is an integral part of the operation of the desalination
   plant, which faces critical environmental challenges because of its high
   salinity. Therefore, a cost-effective and environmentally benign brine
   management system is required prior to its proper disposal. Currently,
   several disposal options including surface water discharge, deep well
   injection, and evaporation ponds have been used. However, these
   processes are unsustainable and their use is limited by a high capital
   cost and limited applications. Various conventional treatments including
   physicochemical, oxidation and biological processes with varying extents
   of organics removal have been reported. Nowadays, membrane-based
   technologies appear to be cost-effective methods for managing brine
   concentrate as they can recover valuable resources and produce clean
   water with high recovery. This paper critically reviews current
   technologies for concentrate management, including disposal practices
   and treatment processes. The characteristics of the brine in terms of
   water quality and its impact on open water bodies are discussed. This
   paper examines emerging membrane processes such as forward osmosis,
   membrane distillation, and electrodialysis that show promise for
   minimizing brine volume, in recovering valuable resources and
   improvement of water recovery. This paper also discusses the fact that
   integrated membrane processes are better for brine management for
   resource recovery together with water purification in wastewater
   treatment facilities and can achieve a zero liquid discharge.},

Abstract = {A multi-purpose platform (MPP) is an offshore system designed to serve
   the purposes of more than one offshore industry. Indeed, over the past
   decades, a number of industries have expanded, or are expanding, from
   onshore to offshore locations (renewables, aquaculture, tourism, mineral
   extractions, etc.), and the research on these type of platform is
   increasing. In the present work, a MPP able to accommodate wind
   turbines, wave energy converters, and aquaculture systems are
   considered. This work presents the first part (Part A) of the analyses
   of the dynamics of the floating support structure for this MPP, focusing
   on the rigid body dynamic response, while its complementary hydroelastic
   analysis is presented in Part B (OMAE2019-96282).
   The aim here is to assess the dynamic response of the platform with
   respect to the preliminary requirements imposed by the wind turbine, the
   aquaculture system, and the other ancillary systems. After describing
   the platform analyzed, and explaining the aero-hydro coupled model of
   dynamics approach adopted, two independent analyses are conducted, one
   using the SESAM package by DNV-GL, and another using ANSYS AQWA, in
   order to verify the results, in absence of experimental data.
   Considering a severe, but still operational, load case, the preliminary
   results seem to demonstrate that the chosen platform can satisfy the
   dynamics constraints imposed by the payload systems.},

   Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Typhoons and cyclones are the most impacting and destructive natural
   disasters in the world. To address the shortcomings of a previous
   typhoon disaster risk assessment (for example, human factors were
   involved in determining weights by importance, and this affected the
   experimental results), an emergy method, which converts energy flows of
   different properties into the same solar energy basis for a convenient
   comparison, was used to assess the risk of regional typhoon disasters.
   Typhoon disaster-related data from 2017 were used to develop an index
   system including resilience, potential strength, and sensitivity which
   was in turn applied to assess typhoon disaster risks in Zhuhai City,
   Guangdong Province, China. The results showed that the spatial
   distribution of the typhoon disaster risks in Zhuhai significantly
   differed, with the highest risk in Xiangzhou district, the second
   highest risk in Doumen district, and the lowest risk in Jinwan district.
   In addition, improving the level of regional resilience can effectively
   reduce risks from typhoon disasters. The application of the emergy
   method in a typhoon disaster risk assessment may provide some
   theoretical support for national and regional governmental strategies
   for disaster prevention and reduction.},

Abstract = {The Upper Cretaceous carbonates on the Island of Hvar were deposited
   within the central Tethyan, intraoceanic Adriatic carbonate platform (s.
   str). The Upper Cretaceous stratigraphy of the platform has been
   described in detail from the neighbouring island of Brac. Following the
   intra-platform deeper-water carbonate sedimentation of the Dol
   Formation, the Campanian Pucisca Formation (the Brac `Marbles' unit) in
   the area of the town of Hvar are characterized by massive bioclastic
   rudist-bearing carbonates deposited in relatively deeper subtidal
   environments.
   Within the uppermost part of the Pucisca Formation we recognized massive
   rudist valves, characterized by a complex canaliferous inner shell
   structure, and determined them as Pseudosabinia klinghardti. The valves
   are embedded in massive, light-grey to white, mostly recrystalized
   peloidal-bioclastic packstone to rudstones, characterized in places by
   chalky appearance. The macrofossil association comprises various
   radiolitids, rare hippuritids, plagioptychids and inoceramid bivalves.
   Microfossil association includes index species of orbitoids and
   siderolitines. The range of the microfossils, along with results of
   strontium-isotope stratigraphy, indicate the latest Middle Campanian age
   of the Pseudosabinia horizon. Thus, it is the youngest horizon of the
   Pucisca Formation in the Adriatic carbonate platform reported to date.},

Title = {Marine and coastal environmental education in the context of global

Abstract = {As changes in coastal and marine environments are expected to negatively
   affect Brazilian ecosystems, the importance of Marine Environmental
   Education (MEE) comes to the fore. However, so far only 32 contributions
   related to this issue have been published in Brazil. The MEE workgroup
   of ReBentos aims at promoting EE and the communication of marine
   ecological research to the scholastic public as a whole, as well as to
   groups which exert an influence on general perception, such as the
   media, politicians, and scientists. This paper presents an overview of
   the initiatives of MEE in Brazil, with emphasis on the ReBentos projects
   and guidelines. The conceptual background of action is based on the
   Rio'92 Treaty on Environmental Education, thereby implying an MEE with
   Transdisciplinar, emancipatory and reflexive characteristics, directed
   to changes in values, principles and attitudes. During the period 2011
   to 2015, 10 projects were developed from Alagoas to Santa Catarina
   States, involving the development, implementation and testing through
   scientific research of 16 MEE activity-models. The didactic material
   subsequently produced comprised three books and 21 book-chapters. A
   public of around 6,500 Conservation Unit visitors, 250 public school
   teachers and 800 high school students have been impacted to date. To act
   as monitors and multipliers, 250 undergraduate students and
   professionals were trained. Research project evaluation generated the
   publication of nine papers. As a further step, the need for protocol
   elaboration for each model is placed in evidence, in order to direct and
   facilitate future initiatives.},

Title = {Environmental Considerations for the Management of the Bivalve Fisheries
   of Bahia Magdalena (Mexico), a Coastal Lagoon at the Southern End of the
   California Current},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {This study presents an overview of bivalve assemblages in Bahia
   Magdalena (BM, Mexico) and the possible impact of environmental
   variability on these populations, constantly stressed by fishing. This
   lagoon is responsible for a high proportion of harvest of regional
   bivalves. First, we list the bivalve species reported in public
   biogeographic databases. Based on eight commercially exploited species,
   we described the composition of the bivalve assemblage and its
   biological characteristics, the history of fishery, and environmental
   variability in the marine area adjacent to the lagoon (1970-2019) and
   the habitat of bivalves (2002-2020). Sources of data were public
   databases and published literature. The enlisted species (n = 184)
   belong to six orders, and most are small and infaunal, but the structure
   of the assemblage is unknown. The fisheries began at different times and
   focused on the most valuable resources. Almost all harvest of bivalves
   had wide variations because of intensive fishing and a weak regulation
   frame. After 2015, the main resources were the Pacific wing-oyster (a
   new resource since 2017) and the geoduck clam due to the declining
   abundance of other resources (e.g., pen shells, Pacific calico scallop).
   There was a warming trend in the region since the 1970's, but the
   strongest El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases caused the most
   notable changes before 2013; after that year, a combination of
   large-scale phenomena increased the temperature significantly. The trend
   of chlorophyll-a abundance negatively correlated with temperature, but
   there was an almost constant supply of particulate organic matter in the
   interior of Bahia Magdalena (BM). After 2015, the quality of lagoon
   water gradually deteriorated, and in 2017 and 2019, harmful algal blooms
   developed, but the impact was not fully assessed. The challenges faced
   by the fishery are multiple (institutional weakness and regional
   warming); however, permanent monitoring programs of environmental
   conditions and critical biological variables should be implemented to
   design scenarios that allow fishery sustainability.</p>},

Title = {Aerosol-boundary-layer-monsoon interactions amplify semi-direct effect
   of biomass smoke on low cloud formation in Southeast Asia},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Low clouds play a key role in the Earth-atmosphere energy balance and
   influence agricultural production and solar-power generation. Smoke
   aloft has been found to enhance marine stratocumulus through
   aerosol-cloud interactions, but its role in regions with strong human
   activities and complex monsoon circulation remains unclear. Here we show
   that biomass burning aerosols aloft strongly increase the low cloud
   coverage over both land and ocean in subtropical southeastern Asia. The
   degree of this enhancement and its spatial extent are comparable to that
   in the Southeast Atlantic, even though the total biomass burning
   emissions in Southeast Asia are only one-fifth of those in Southern
   Africa. We find that a synergetic effect of aerosol-cloud-boundary layer
   interaction with the monsoon is the main reason for the strong
   semi-direct effect and enhanced low cloud formation in southeastern
   Asia.
   Biomass burning emissions have been shown to influence clouds in the
   Atlantic, but its influence in other regions is not well known. Here,
   the authors show that biomass burning aerosols increase the low-cloud
   cover over subtropical southeastern Asia by a similar magnitude than
   over the Atlantic.},

Title = {CyberShip-IoT: A dynamic and adaptive SDN-based security policy
   enforcement framework for ships},
Journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {736-750},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With the wide adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
   in the marine environment, ship systems are increasingly similar to
   other networked computing systems. The integration of positioning
   systems with navigational and propulsion control systems and the
   increasing reliance on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   systems for monitoring the ship's performance makes modern ships
   vulnerable to a wide range of cyber security issues. Moreover, frequent
   or permanent onshore connection makes the ship's communication network a
   potential target for cyber-criminals. Such attacks can incapacitate the
   vessel, i.e., through a ransomware attack, or greatly degrade the
   performance of the ship systems, i.e., causing delays in the propagation
   of control messages between critical components within the ship.
   Furthermore, crew members and marine engineers are challenged with the
   task of configuring security policies for networked devices, using
   low-level device specific syntax, which is an error prone and time
   consuming process. In addition to this, crew members must also be
   familiar with the specific syntax for low-level network management task,
   which exacerbates the problem. The emergence of Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN) helps reduce the complexity of the network management
   tasks and we believe that a similar approach may be used to address the
   larger problem. We therefore propose the CyberShip-IoT framework to
   provide a network level defense for the communication network component
   of ship systems. CyberShip-IoT offers a high-level policy language and a
   translation mechanism for automated policy enforcement in the ship's
   communication network. The modular design of the framework provides
   flexibility to deploy detection mechanism according to their
   requirements. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this
   framework, we develop a prototype for a scenario involving the
   communication network of a typical ship. The experimental results
   demonstrate that our framework can effectively translate high-level
   security policies into OpenFlow rules of the switches without incurring
   much latency, ultimately leading to efficient attack mitigation and
   reduced collateral damage. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {401},
Number = {6755},
Pages = {779-782},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {The surface waters of the modern subarctic Pacific Ocean are isolated
   from the nutrient-rich waters below by a steep vertical gradient in
   salinity (halocline), a feature which is a dominant control on
   upper-ocean stratification in polar environments(1-3). The physical
   processes which maintain the halocline and, in turn, its physical,
   biological, and geochemical effects have long been subjects of intense
   inquiry(3,4). The stratification of polar surface waters influences the
   exchange of CO2 between ocean and atmosphere(5-8), so the history of the
   subarctic Pacific halocline may have played a role in past changes in
   atmospheric CO2 concentration. Here we report opal accumulation rates
   and nitrogen-isotope data from sediments in this region which indicate
   that the subarctic Pacific halocline developed abruptly 2.73 million
   years ago, coincident with the onset of extensive Northern Hemisphere
   glaciation. The halocline would have reduced the transport of
   nutrient-rich deep water into the euphotic zone, leading to a decrease
   in biological production but an increase in the fraction of nutrient
   stocks utilized. This increase in the efficiency of the `biological
   pump' would have lowered the rate of CO2 evasion from ocean to
   atmosphere, potentially reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations from the
   suggested higher level of the preceding mid-Pliocene warm
   interval(9,10).},

Title = {A data-limited modeling approach for conserving connectivity in marine
   protected area networks},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are areas of marine ecosystems that have
   some level of protection to support one or more conservation objectives.
   One characteristic of MPA networks is that MPAs are spatially configured
   such that they provide the greatest protection possible for multiple
   species. Yet, it can be difficult to determine optimal MPA network
   arrangement due to insufficient information on multi-species habitat use
   and their dispersal abilities as larvae and adults. Here, we propose a
   modelling approach that involves determining the optimal MPA network
   configuration for multiple species assemblages, located at different
   depths and having differing dispersal abilities. As a case study, we
   applied this methodology in Pacific Canada where we identified optimal
   MPA configurations to protect 40 species having different pelagic larval
   duration (proxy for dispersal) at 3 different depth class groupings
   (proxy for habitat use). Taken together, we found dispersal ability had
   a larger impact on optimal MPA network configuration for species
   spending a long time as larvae compared to species spending a short time
   as larvae. We identify which 10\% of this area is most important to
   conserve to maintain connectivity for a multi-species MPA network and
   show that half of these sites remain important to conserve in the future
   as climate change alters connectivity patterns. This model for MPA
   network design is feasible with limited data which is beneficial for
   application to other regions and ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Sugar maple reaches its northern limit along the eastern shore of Lake
   Superior marking the transition from the deciduous forest of eastern
   North America to a predominantly boreal forest community. In light of
   regional warming trends over the past 100 years and projections for even
   warmer conditions in the future, we sought to characterize the current
   age structure and regeneration status of both sugar maple and boreal
   tree species within this ecotone zone. Within Lake Superior Provincial
   Park (Ontario, Canada), a series of east-west trending hills create
   numerous deciduous-boreal transition zones as sugar maple occupies
   uplands and boreal species occupy valley bottoms; then, once north of
   the sugar maple limit, boreal species dominate all topographic
   positions. Unlogged forest stands were sampled in the transition zone on
   ridges and slopes both north and south of the sugar maple limit. Overall
   tree density and basal area in sugar maple and boreal stands were
   similar across the ecotone, but seedling density was significantly
   higher in plots dominated by sugar maple. Moreover, sugar maple
   seedlings, but not saplings, were found slightly beyond the adult sugar
   maple tree hillside limit, indicating that the potential for range
   expansion may be limited by microclimatic variables, namely cold air
   drainage.},

Title = {Global Importance of Indigenous and Local Communities' Managed Lands:
   Building a Case for Stewardship Schemes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The role of Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) in
   sustainably using and managing natural resources is becoming broadly
   recognised within some international platforms (e.g., the UN Permanent
   Forum on Indigenous Issues and Intergovernmental Platform on
   Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). However, the support for IPLCs to
   continue managing their land is either completely absent or scanty. This
   paper presents the value of only four ecosystem services, estimated at
   USD 1.16 trillion per year, that are delivered from IPLCs managed lands
   alone (excluding coastal, marine, and other resources). These four
   ecosystem services (ES), i.e., carbon sequestration, biocontrol, air,
   and water regulation offer offsite benefits to the wider regional and
   global populations yet without returns to the IPLCs themselves except
   for facing more climate and natural disaster-related challenges mainly
   caused by the actions of mainstream society. It further outlines key
   challenges and advocates for establishing stewardship mechanisms to
   promote and support IPLCs land management practices that will
   effectively help in protecting and preserving biodiversity, water, and
   other natural resources on Earth to sustain and enhance human
   well-being.},

Abstract = {In the past two centuries, anthropogenic fire suppression has affected
   many biomes, including boreal forests. Absence of fire in the boreal
   zone is often linked to declining soil fertility and increased carbon
   sequestration in the humus through changes in NPP and litter
   decomposition. We studied tree litterfall and litter decomposition for
   thirty lake islands in the boreal forested zone of Sweden, which differ
   naturally in fire regime: larger islands have burned far more frequently
   than smaller ones because they are intercepted more often by lightning.
   We used litter trays to show that the ratio of twig to foliar litterfall
   for Picea abies with prolonged absence of fire is largely responsible
   for the concomitant increased twig proportion in the total litterfall.
   We hypothesised that the increased twig proportion in the litterfall
   with time since fire would affect overall decomposition by reducing net
   litter quality and through impairing decomposition of associated foliar
   litters. We established a litter decomposition mesocosm experiment based
   on litter from the three main tree species found on the islands. From
   each of the thirty islands, we prepared a set of litterbags comprising
   three mixtures (all foliar litters combined, all twig litters combined,
   and all twig and foliar litters combined), plus monotypes (i.e. each of
   the separate foliage and twig litters for each species). Unlike most
   studies, we used the natural litterfall proportions in the mixtures. We
   found a (negative) effect of time since wildfire on decomposition rate
   for only the foliage-twig mixtures, although twig litter did not inhibit
   the decomposition of foliar litter within these mixtures. The reduced
   decomposition rate in the foliage-twig mixture from the small islands
   was therefore due to the increased proportion of twigs in the mixtures
   from these islands. Our results suggest that, with prolonged absence of
   fire, the increase of twig proportion in the foliage-twig litterfall for
   P. abies combined with the shift to canopy dominance by P. abies may be
   important in contributing to reduced decomposition rates in boreal
   forest soils.},

   Pacific island states},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Theoretical positioning of energy poverty has to date largely been
   dominated by an adult-centric viewpoint. This article examines the
   impact of energy poverty on children and young people in developing
   Pacific islands Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga and developed New Zealand. We
   argue that children and young people have a greater burden of cumulative
   exposure to energy poverty than adults, which exposes them to greater
   risks of negative health and wellbeing. We draw on the geographically
   defined, but economically and politically diverse area of the Pacific
   islands to provide comparative examples demonstrating how energy policy
   in both lowand high income countries entrenches energy inequalities in
   children and young people. After examining the energy profiles of
   countries in the Pacific, we provide case examples from our research in
   Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand to demonstrate the everyday
   realities of children experiencing energy poverty in the region. We call
   for a reframing of the energy poverty debate in relation to those who
   are most vulnerable to climate change and the reshaping of regionaland
   stateenergy policy priorities to address these inequalities.},

Journal = {ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {This study demonstrates that wildfires/biomass combustion may be an
   important source of labile pyrogenic water-soluble organic matter
   (Py-WSOM) in aquatic systems. Spectroscopic analysis (solid char and
   Py-WSOM) with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated
   that the Py-WSOM extracted from two low temperature chars (one wood, one
   grass) was dominated by polar moieties (-OH and C-O) derived from
   depolymerization and fragmentation of lignocellulose. Incubation
   experiments under aerobic conditions with unsterilized river water
   suggested that Py-WSOM and associated biomarkers may have a turnover
   rate of the order of weeks to months, consistent with mixing and
   transport conditions of riverine systems. For example, pyrogenic
   dissolved organic carbon (Py-DOC) had a half-life of 30-40 days.
   Turnover rate for the combustion biomarkers was shorter, with
   levoglucosan and free lignin phenols having a half life around 3-4 days
   and polymeric lignin components 13-14 days. The latter observations
   contradict earlier studies of the biodegradation of dissolved lignin and
   point to the need for re-assessment of lignin degradation kinetics in
   well-mixed riverine systems, particularly when such lignin components
   are derived from thermally altered plant material that may exist in a
   form more labile than that in highly processed riverine DOM. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Nowadays, manufacturing enterprises face enormous environmental
   challenges, due to complex and diverse economic trends, including
   shorter product life cycles, rapid advances in science and technology,
   increased diversity in customer demands and globalization of production
   activities. Consequently, the cost is highly affected by environmentally
   related factors. Energy efficiency is one of the main factors, which
   together with waste management, affect manufacturing decisions. The
   complexity and diversity of the factors that determine energy efficiency
   require intelligent systems for their optimization at each
   ``manufacturing level{''}. Manufacturing decisions should be taken as
   fast as possible and with the highest possible accuracy. Artificial
   intelligence/machine learning tools have made significant progress
   during the last decade and are suitable for such applications. The main
   objective of the current study is that an architecture for the
   development of a networked, online, decision support tool, be provided
   towards achieving sustainable value chain management. The main idea
   behind the proposed design is that stakeholders be assisted in taking
   decisions towards improving the energy and eco-efficiency of the entire
   value chain or parts of it. This is suggested within the context of a
   multi-objective optimization procedure, taking into account other
   important decision making attributes, such as flexibility, quality and
   time for the final reduction in the overall cost. This architecture
   incorporates real time information modules that interact with online
   monitoring systems, using any available information within the value
   chain and the existing IT tools. A partial realization of the proposed
   idea is implemented in the form of a user friendly software tool (the
   MetaCAM tool). This based, decision support tool aiming to optimize a
   current production line or to propose alternatives for the manufacturing
   of a product. The tool performs optimization based on a set of
   predefined criteria, namely energy, waste, cost and time. For each of
   these criteria, the end-user selects the desired weight factor in order
   to drive the optimization procedure accordingly. The tool presents the
   characteristics of the setup of the proposed optimized line-and
   maintains all used data and calculations in order to be reused when
   necessary.. For the tool's validation, three real case studies from
   different industrial sectors have been used. The first case study comes
   from the domestic appliances sector (refrigerator door panel), the
   second one from the automotive sector (a two seat bench for light
   commercial vehicles) and finally, the third case study derives from the
   aeronautics sector and deals with the production of the loading ramp
   hinge of a military aircraft.},

Title = {On the multi-century Southern Hemisphere response to changes in
   atmospheric CO2-concentration in a Global Climate Model},
Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {89},
Number = {1-4},
Pages = {17-36},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The transient response of the Southern Hemisphere to climate change is
   examined using an intermediate complexity climate model. Unlike previous
   studies, the Southern Ocean response on the centennial to
   multi-centennial time-scale is assessed in some detail. It is shown that
   changes in atmospheric CO2-concentrations lead to an increase in the
   strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) by similar to 20 Sv
   by 2750 for an atmospheric CO2-concentration of 750 ppm. This increase
   is predominantly the result of an enhanced steric height gradient. The
   increase in the strength of the ACC induces changes in its steering
   around topographic features. This change in ACC pathway causes increased
   surface flow of colder waters into some regions (reducing the rate of
   warming) and increased surface flow of warmer waters into others
   (increasing the rate of warming). This meridional shifting of the ACC
   causes changes in atmospheric temperature in the Southern Hemisphere to
   be nonuniform. It is also shown that the strength and location of the
   Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) overturning cell is affected by increased
   atmospheric CO2. For a CO2-concentration scenario increasing gradually
   to 750 ppm, AABW production initially decreases, then recovers and
   eventually increases. New production zones form, which extend AABW
   production all the way from the Weddell Sea eastward into the Ross Sea.
   These new production zones are the result of increased areas of
   atmosphere-ocean interactions, due to decreased sea-ice coverage,
   although the overturned waters are now warmer and fresher due to climate
   change. A new production zone of Antarctic Intermediate water is also
   established in the Southeast Pacific Ocean, poleward of its present-day
   location.},

Title = {Wind effects on hydrodynamics and implications for ecology in a

Abstract = {The wind forcing effects on mixing dynamics and circulation can drive
   important bio-hydrodynamic interactions in certain regions of a
   hydraulically dominated river-lake floodplain system. Poyang Lake,
   connected with the Yangtze River, is an example of such a system. The
   wind forcing effects on Poyang Lake have not been assessed in detail. In
   this study, a hydrodynamic model and a current energy method were used
   to investigate the hydrodynamic pattern forced by the combination of
   hydraulic and wind drivers and to distinguish both forcings. Two
   prevailing wind directions (NNE and SSW) with 3 wind-speed (3 m/s, 5 m/s
   and 10 m/s) scenarios, including tracer transport and residence time,
   were further simulated to determine the wind effects. The results showed
   that there are distinct hydraulic-dominated and wind-dominated regions.
   In the three wind-dominated zones, various circulation patterns were
   determined by the wind direction and complex geometry, and current
   speeds were positively correlated with the wind speed magnitude,
   regardless of wind direction. However, residence times responded
   differently to wind forcings. The low-speed NNE wind forcing was found
   to be the most disadvantageous for mixing and dispersion and was prone
   to allowing material enrichment in the eastern sub-lakes. An improved
   understanding of ecological behaviour in local zones of Poyang Lake is
   provided to guide future water management.},

Abstract = {In a world increasingly modified by human activities, the conservation
   of biodiversity is essential as insurance to maintain resilient
   ecosystems and ensure a sustainable flow of ecosystem goods and services
   to society. However, existing reserves and national parks are unlikely
   to incorporate the long-term and large-scale dynamics of ecosystems.
   Hence, conservation strategies have to actively incorporate the large
   areas of land that are managed for human use. For ecosystems to
   reorganize after large-scale natural and human-induced disturbances,
   spatial resilience in the form of ecological memory is a prerequisite.
   The ecological memory is composed of the species, interactions and
   structures that make ecosystem reorganization possible, and its
   components may be found within disturbed patches as well in the
   surrounding landscape. Present static reserves should be complemented
   with dynamic reserves, such as ecological fallows and dynamic
   successional reserves, that are part of ecosystem management mimicking
   natural disturbance regimes at the landscape level.},

Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A significant proportion of the total nutrient in soil solution can be
   bound to organic molecules and these often constitute a major loss from
   soil to freshwater. Our purpose was to determine whether chemical
   extractants used for measuring inorganic N could also be used to
   quantify dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and carbon (DOC) in soil. In a
   range of soils, DOC and DON were extracted with either distilled water
   or 2 M KCl and the amount recovered compared with that present in soil
   solution recovered by centrifugal-drainage. The recovery of DON and DOC
   from soil was highly dependent upon the method of extraction. Factors
   such as soil sampling strategy (number of samples over space and time),
   sample preparation (sieving and drying), soil storage, extraction
   temperature, shaking time, and soil-to-extractant volume ratio all
   significantly affected the amount of DOC and DON extracted from soil. To
   allow direct comparison between independent studies we therefore propose
   the introduction of a standardized extraction procedure: Replicate
   samples of unsieved, field-moist soil extracted as soon as possible
   after collection with distilled water, 0.5 M K2SO4 or 2 M KCI at a 1:5
   w/v ratio for 1 h at 20 degrees C. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   observed were in the range of about 1700 to 1830 mu mole s(-1)m(-2) or
   equivalent to about 365 to 435 Wm(-2), The radiative transfer models of
   Gregg and Carder, and Frouin et al. were used to investigate the
   relationship between the quantum and energy of solar radiation available
   in the PAR region, The average ratio of this quanta per energy was found
   to be about 4.2 mu mole W(-1)s(-1), Aerosol optical depth obtained using

Title = {Tropical cyclone cooling combats region-wide coral bleaching},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching has become more frequent and widespread as a result of
   rising sea surface temperature (SST). During a regional scale SST
   anomaly, reef exposure to thermal stress is patchy in part due to
   physical factors that reduce SST to provide thermal refuge. Tropical
   cyclones (TCs - hurricanes, typhoons) can induce temperature drops at
   spatial scales comparable to that of the SST anomaly itself. Such
   cyclone cooling can mitigate bleaching across broad areas when
   well-timed and appropriately located, yet the spatial and temporal
   prevalence of this phenomenon has not been quantified. Here, satellite
   SST and historical TC data are used to reconstruct cool wakes (n=46)
   across the Caribbean during two active TC seasons (2005 and 2010) where
   high thermal stress was widespread. Upon comparison of these datasets
   with thermal stress data from Coral Reef Watch and published accounts of
   bleaching, it is evident that TC cooling reduced thermal stress at a
   region-wide scale. The results show that during a mass bleaching event,
   TC cooling reduced thermal stress below critical levels to potentially
   mitigate bleaching at some reefs, and interrupted natural warming cycles
   to slow the build-up of thermal stress at others. Furthermore,
   reconstructed TC wave damage zones suggest that it was rare for more
   reef area to be damaged by waves than was cooled (only 12\% of TCs).
   Extending the time series back to 1985 (n=314), we estimate that for the
   recent period of enhanced TC activity (1995-2010), the annual
   probability that cooling and thermal stress co-occur is as high as 31\%
   at some reefs. Quantifying such probabilities across the other tropical
   regions where both coral reefs and TCs exist is vital for improving our
   understanding of how reef exposure to rising SSTs may vary, and
   contributes to a basis for targeting reef conservation.},

Title = {Northern winter climate change: Assessment of uncertainty in CMIP5
   projections related to stratosphere-troposphere coupling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {119},

Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Future changes in the stratospheric circulation could have an important
   impact on northern winter tropospheric climate change, given that sea
   level pressure (SLP) responds not only to tropospheric circulation
   variations but also to vertically coherent variations in
   troposphere-stratosphere circulation. Here we assess northern winter
   stratospheric change and its potential to influence surface climate
   change in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5)
   multimodel ensemble. In the stratosphere at high latitudes, an easterly
   change in zonally averaged zonal wind is found for the majority of the
   CMIP5 models, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5
   scenario. Comparable results are also found in the 1\% CO2 increase per
   year projections, indicating that the stratospheric easterly change is
   common feature in future climate projections. This stratospheric wind
   change, however, shows a significant spread among the models. By using
   linear regression, we quantify the impact of tropical upper troposphere
   warming, polar amplification, and the stratospheric wind change on SLP.
   We find that the intermodel spread in stratospheric wind change
   contributes substantially to the intermodel spread in Arctic SLP change.
   The role of the stratosphere in determining part of the spread in SLP
   change is supported by the fact that the SLP change lags the
   stratospheric zonally averaged wind change. Taken together, these
   findings provide further support for the importance of simulating the
   coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere, to narrow the
   uncertainty in the future projection of tropospheric circulation
   changes.},

Abstract = {Low molecular weight carbonyl compounds are produced photochemically
   from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in natural waters.
   Photoproduction rates for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone were
   measured in the laboratory using a pre-column 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
   derivitization HPLC method as a function of optical properties
   (absorption coefficient, spectral slope) and irradiation time. Rates
   decreased linearly with decreasing absorption coefficient at 350 nm
   (a(350 nm)), a measure of CDOM levels, with substantial variability in
   low a(350 nm) beach waters. Apparent quantum yields (Theta) were
   unchanged for a(350 nm)= 2-16 m(-1), but increased rapidly (x5) for
   beach waters with low a(350 nm) values. Theta increased linearly with
   increasing spectral slope for beach waters, consistent with enhanced
   production efficiency with photobleaching of CDOM in coastal waters.
   Theta trends with oxygen and molecular reaction probes (hydroxyl radical
   scavengers and producers) suggested a combination of direct photolysis
   and singlet oxygen quenching as primary production mechanisms. (C) 2011

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {Climate change west of the Antarctic Peninsula is the most rapid of
   anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere, with associated changes in the
   rates and distributions of freshwater inputs to the ocean. Here, results
   from the first comprehensive survey of oxygen isotopes in seawater in
   this region are used to quantify spatial patterns of meteoric water
   (glacial discharge and precipitation) separately from sea ice melt. High
   levels of meteoric water are found close to the coast, due to orographic
   effects on precipitation and strong glacial discharge. Concentrations
   decrease offshore, driving significant southward geostrophic flows (up
   to; similar to 30 cm s(-1)). These produce high meteoric water
   concentrations at the southern end of the sampling grid, where collapse
   of the Wilkins Ice Shelf may also have contributed. Sea ice melt
   concentrations are lower than meteoric water and patchier because of the
   mobile nature of the sea ice itself. Nonetheless, net sea ice production
   in the northern part of the sampling grid is inferred; combined with net
   sea ice melt in the south, this indicates an overall southward ice
   motion. The survey is contextualized temporally using a decade-long
   series of isotope data from a coastal Antarctic Peninsula site. This
   shows a temporal decline in meteoric water in the upper ocean, contrary
   to expectations based on increasing precipitation and accelerating
   deglaciation. This is driven by the increasing occurrence of deeper
   winter mixed layers and has potential implications for concentrations of
   trace metals supplied to the euphotic zone by glacial discharge. As the
   regional freshwater system evolves, the continuing isotope monitoring
   described here will elucidate the ongoing impacts on climate and the
   ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Treadmill of production theory offers a perspective for understanding
   the relationship between modern social institutions and environmental
   sustainability. We use this approach to analyze North Carolina's Coastal
   Resource Commission (CRC), a state agency charged with overseeing
   economic development and environmental concerns on the coast. Data from
   CRC meetings provide insights into the policy-formation process and
   related policy outcomes associated with long-term ecological and social
   concerns, specifically related to sea-level rise. Findings indicate that
   the CRC continually developed policies and fashioned regulatory
   decisions that favored economic growth over environmental protection.
   Importantly, the CRC failed to prepare for the long-term effects of
   climate change, such as sea-level rise. Our analysis extends the
   treadmill of production perspective through a deeper engagement with
   Marxian state theorists. Our analysis suggests that the state's various
   branches and levels contain internal selectivities that favor pro-growth
   policies while simultaneously filtering out stronger environmental
   protections.},

Abstract = {Hydrogen energy is considered as an renewable and interminable source to
   combat the present energy crises and it is capable of balancing the
   environmental impact due to the extensive use of fossil fuels. Hydrogen
   production emerges as a contemporary technique to get rid of this energy
   crises and environmental issues. This review focuses on the
   clean/fresh-water electrolysis and its commercialization aspects.
   Seawater is a great source of water that can be used for electrolysis as
   a substitute of clean water. Several issues impede the widespread use of
   seawater electrolysis as the substitute of fresh water. In this review,
   an extensive discussion on theoretical and experimental investigations
   has been presented to explore the most effective pathway to achieve the
   highest performance of seawater electrolysis. The basic parameters such
   as pH of seawater, use of buffer solution over the electrolyte, applied
   potential, effect of dissolved ions, and nature of electrocatalyst are
   systematically studied to explore the most effective route for direct
   seawater electrolysis. The overview of this article offers a through
   understanding of the existing shortcomings and the possible way out
   related to seawater electrolysis for the benefit of mankind.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the monitoring mission problem using an USV
   equipped with an on-board LiDAR allowing to monitor regions inside its
   coverage radius. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective coverage
   path planning with two conflicting objectives : minimization of the
   consumed energy and maximization of the coverage rate. To solve the
   problem, we use two popular multi-objective evolutionary algorithms :
   Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Pareto Archived
   Evolution Strategy (PAES). First, we compare the efficiency of these two
   algorithms and show that PAES allows to find solutions allowing to save
   more energy as compared to those provided by NSGA-II. Then, we propose a
   new method which improves the performance of evolutionary algorithms
   when solving covering path planning problems by reducing the chromosome
   size. We have applied this method on the used algorithms and simulation
   results shows a significant performance enhancement both PAES and
   NSGA-II.},

Title = {Grazing impact of copepod assemblages and gravitational flux in coastal

Year = {2002},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {In evaluating carbon flux in coastal and oceanic waters off central
   Chile (similar to36degreesS), the grazing pressure by copepod
   size-assemblages and the gravitational flux from the surface layer were
   estimated during two contrasting seasons: spring upwelling (October
   1998) and winter (July 1999) periods. Grazing pressure upon
   phytoplankton biomass was small (<5\%) during both periods at all
   stations. It was, however, an important proportion of primary production
   at the coast during the spring (17-43\%) but minimal in winter (<5\%)
   while, at the oceanic station, it was significant during both seasons
   (13-46\%). Similarly, the downward flux of particulate organic carbon
   was a significant percentage of primary production at the coast during
   the spring (31\%) and less so in winter (15\%); at the oceanic station,
   it was a higher fraction during both seasons (46-47\%). Copepod pellets
   were only a minor component of the faecal flux, suggesting that they
   were rapidly recycled in the water column. The seasonal differences in
   these carbon fluxes in the coastal upwelling zone were related directly
   to the larger quantities of organic matter in the water column during
   the spring upwelling period, including higher chlorophyll a
   concentrations and primary production rates. During the winter, the
   particulate organic carbon appears to be mainly recycled in the water
   column. In the oceanic zone, in contrast to what is expected, a large
   percentage of the primary production appears to be exported during both
   periods, though consumption by copepod assemblages was also important,
   suggesting significant horizontal carbon export from the coast to the
   open ocean.},

Abstract = {As an employment of surface plasmonic effect, the consequence of
   insertion of a layer of Ag clusters into polymer solar cell on the
   enhancement of light absorption and power conversion efficiency is
   investigated. Optical analysis based on the finite-difference
   time-domain (FDTD) is performed with experiments to evaluate the effect
   of the interaction between the Ag clusters and incident light on light
   absorption in polymer solar cell. Ag clusters modify the light wave
   vector and the electromagnetic field inside the device is redistributed
   and enhanced. As a result, polymer solar cells achieve an overall
   increase in absorption, short-circuit current density, and power
   conversion efficiency.},

Abstract = {Carbon isotopes of individual lipids in typical organisms from the
   Nansha sea area were measured by the GC-IRMS analytical technique.
   delta(13)C values of saturated fatty acids in different organisms
   examined are from -25.6parts per thousand to -29.7parts per thousand
   with the average values ranging from -26.4parts per thousand to
   -28.2parts per thousand and the variance range of 11.8parts per
   thousand, between different organisms is also observed. Unsaturated
   fatty acids have heavy carbon isotopic compositions and the mean
   differences of 2.9\%.9-6.8parts per thousand compared to the same carbon
   number saturated fatty acids. delta(13)C values of n-alkanes range from
   -27.5\%o to -29.7parts per thousand and their mean values, ranging from
   -28.6parts per thousand, to -28.9parts per thousand, are very close in
   different organisms. The mean difference in delta(13)C between the
   saturated fatty acids and n-alkanes is only 1.5parts per thousand,
   indicating that they have similar biosynthetic pathways. The carbon
   isotopic variations between the different carbon-number lipids are
   mostly within +/-2.0parts per thousand, reflecting that they experienced
   a biosynthetic process of the carbon chain elongation. At the same time,
   the carbon isotopic genetic relationships between the biological and
   sedimentary lipids are established by comparative studies of carbon
   isotopic compositions of individual lipids in organisms and sediments
   from the Nansha sea area, which provides scientific basis for carbon
   isotopic applied research of individual lipids.},

Abstract = {This work examined diet data from studies of top pelagic predators from
   three large regions of the equatorial and South Pacific Ocean. Food webs
   of each of these three systems were found to have relatively high
   species diversity, but in contrast to other marine systems, relatively
   low connectance. Food webs were examined using graph-theoretic methods,
   which included aggregating species based on food-web relationships and
   identification of potentially influential species. Species aggregations
   were used to construct simplified qualitative models from each region's
   food web. Models from each region were then analyzed to make predictions
   of response to climate change for six commercially important species:
   mahi mahi, skipjack tuna, albacore tuna, yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna,
   and swordfish. We found little commonality in the structure of the three
   food webs, although the two regions in the equatorial Pacific had food
   webs composed of four predation tiers, as defined by network levels of
   predation, whereas the southwestern region had only three predation
   tiers. We also found no consistent pattern in the predicted outcomes of
   the perturbations, which underlines the need for detailed trophic
   databases to adequately describe regional pelagic ecosystems. This work
   demonstrates that food-web structure will be central to understanding
   and predicting how top pelagic predators, and the ecosystems in which
   they are embedded, will respond to climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {This article presents multimode features of a single-phase photovoltaic
   (PV) system controlled through a combined improved
   proportionate-normalized least mean square with modified filtered-X
   (CIPNLMS-MFX) technique. This system waves off from using the battery
   storage and successfully operated in standalone mode to achieve the load
   demand even under the grid outage. The CIPNLMS-MFX based current control
   technique includes asymmetry parameters and the optimized selection of
   these parameters provides fast convergence speed, good steady-state
   response, and improved power quality at nonlinear loads. This PV system
   is also supported with the synchronization and mode transfer control so
   that the PV system has autonomous operation under outage and recovery of
   the grid without disturbing the supply across the domestic loads. A fast
   detection of a dual cascaded generalized integrator
   synchronization/islanding structure is presented to evaluate fundamental
   grid voltage, phase angles, and change in frequency. This structure is
   robust against the abnormal conditions at the utility grid. The
   experimental results show that presented CIPNLMS-MFX, DCGI, and finite
   state machine based logic for islanding/synchronization techniques
   achieve considerably good performance under various operating scenarios,
   e.g., outage/ restoration of grid power, varying nonlinear loads, and
   outage of solar power.},

Abstract = {This study presents the performance of a novel hybrid islanding
   detection method for multi-single-phase photovoltaic (PV) inverters
   based on the combination of four active methods and three passive
   methods. Although islanding detection in PV multi-inverter systems has
   been widely researched, most islanding studies are focused on
   three-phase inverters, rather than single-phase ones. In this study,
   different active and passive methods are used to detect the islanding of
   four paralleled single-phase PV inverters. By combining those methods
   synergistically, it reduces their weakness of each method, while
   combining their advantages. The novelty of the proposed system
   methodology consists of four paralleled single-phase inverters equipped
   with four different active methods, namely active frequency drift,
   Sandia frequency shift (SFS), sliding mode frequency shift, and Sandia
   voltage shift triggered by a block composed of three passive methods:
   voltage frequency protection, rate of change of frequency, and DC-link.
   This novel hybrid system is studied under different detailed scenarios,
   where it shows its performance and characteristics.},

Title = {An Evaluation of the Economic and Resilience Benefits of a Microgrid in
   Northampton, Massachusetts},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent developments and advances in distributed energy resource (DER)
   technologies make them valuable assets in microgrids. This paper
   presents an innovative evaluation framework for microgrid assets to
   capture economic benefits from various grid and behind-the-meter
   services in grid-connecting mode and resilience benefits in islanding
   mode. In particular, a linear programming formulation is used to model
   different services and DER operational constraints to determine the
   optimal DER dispatch to maximize economic benefits. For the resiliency
   analysis, a stochastic evaluation procedure is proposed to explicitly
   quantify the microgrid survivability against a random outage,
   considering uncertainties associated with photovoltaic (PV) generation,
   system load, and distributed generator failures. Optimal coordination
   strategies are developed to minimize unserved energy and improve system
   survivability, considering different levels of system connectedness. The
   proposed framework has been applied to evaluate a proposed microgrid in
   Northampton, Massachusetts that would link the Northampton Department of
   Public Works, Cooley Dickenson Hospital, and Smith Vocational Area High
   School. The findings of this analysis indicate that over a 20-year
   economic life, a 441 kW/441 kWh battery energy storage system, and 386
   kW PV solar array can generate \$2.5 million in present value benefits,
   yielding a 1.16 return on investment ratio. Results of this study also
   show that forming a microgrid generally improves system survivability,
   but the resilience performance of individual facilities varies depending
   on power-sharing strategies.},

Abstract = {Inverter interfaced distributed generation units contribute limited
   fault current and thereby the current magnitude-based protection schemes
   find limitation for such situations. Change in penetration level of
   renewable energy sources with time makes available protection schemes
   more challenging. The distinction between load and fault current is an
   issue and with high resistance fault, level of fault current and load
   current becomes comparable. In this paper, local measurement-based
   protection technique is proposed that uses current and voltage signals
   to derive accurate protection decision for a distribution system in the
   presence of distributed generation units. The method uses real and
   reactive power calculated at the relay point for the decision. The
   performance of the algorithm is tested for a 33 bus distribution system
   simulated using DIgSILENT PowerFactory. Considering such units, the
   method is tested for both islanded and grid-connected modes, the varying
   level of distributed generation penetration and for different fault

Abstract = {The four electron cyclotron (EC) upper port antennas (or ``upper
   launchers{''} -UL) will be used to drive current locally inside magnetic
   islands located at the q= 2 (or smaller) rational surfaces in order to
   stabilize neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs), as well as heat inside of p
   of about 0.4. Each antenna consists of eight beam lines that are
   designed for the transmission of 1.5 MW of mm-wave power at 170 GHz. The
   First Confinement System (FCS) is formed by the ex-vessel mm-wave
   waveguide components, for which SIC-1 classification requirements apply.
   The beam lines in the FCS comprise a Z shaped set of straight corrugated
   waveguides with a nominal diameter of 50 mm connected by miter bends.
   This system is subjected to imposed displacements coming mainly from the
   thermal expansion of the vacuum vessel, seismic events and/or plasma
   disruption events. In absence of suitable SIC-1 waveguide bellows, the
   FCS waveguides must provide the necessary mechanical functional
   compliance. This has required the development of a dedicated, flange
   type coupling system with double metallic seals, capable of resisting
   the generated external loads while maintaining vacuum tightness and
   alignment. This paper presents the results of the design, analysis and
   pre-qualification experimental work done on the waveguides and the
   integrated SIC-1 compliant coupling system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Developing High Resolution Baseline Coast Resource Maps Using World View
   2 Imagery for a Coastal Village in Fiji},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {In Fiji, like most Pacific Island countries, there have been numerous
   reports of degradation of coastal resources, including adverse changes
   in abundance and stock distribution of numerous aquatic species
   associated with the coastal habitat. To develop effective management
   plans, assessment of existing coastal resources is pertinent. High
   spatial resolution satellite imagery, combined with geographic
   information systems allow for efficient and synoptic mapping of coastal
   resources to provide a baseline for developing effective and improved
   management plans. The purpose of this study was to develop a baseline
   habitat map of the intertidal benthic cover in Komave Village, Coral
   Coast, Sigatoka, Fiji. Resource mapping was based on high resolution (2
   m) WorldView-2 imagery. Ground-truthing was attained by means of on-site
   data logging of the intertidal resources, image capturing and GPS
   recording. Based on these records, the benthic cover was classified into
   seven classes: `coral,' `algae,' `brown algae,' `volcanic rocks,' `sand
   and gravel,' `sea grass,' and `bare.' Ground referencing points were
   randomly assigned for either supervised classification training or
   accuracy assessment. A community participatory research approach was
   used to conduct interviews to assimilate information on fishing sites
   and coastal land use activities. This exercise explored the
   social-ecological approach in natural resource management and how it can
   become an important tool in coastal conservation practices. The coastal
   resource map generated through this study serves as a baseline for
   monitoring the status and spatial distribution of the coastal resources
   in Komave. Annual mapping of the resources and enrichment of maps along
   with iterative village consultation will enable managers to develop and
   gauge the effectiveness of coastal management plans. This high
   resolution map is particularly relevant to Fiji as it is the first of
   its kind for the country. This work also serves to reduce the global
   information gap of coastal resource status for Fiji.},

Title = {ORGANIC-CARBON PARTITIONING AS A BASIS FOR PREDICTING THE TOXICITY OF
   CHLORPYRIFOS IN SEDIMENTS},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {621-626},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate an organic carbon
   partitioning model for predicting bioavailability of the organophosphate
   chlorpyrifos in sediments, in support of the development of a
   sediment-quality criterion for the pesticide. Initial 10-d water-only
   toxicity tests were conducted with the midge Chironomus tentans to
   define the sensitivity of this species to chlorpyrifos. Two
   uncontaminated sediments with differing organic carbon contents
   (approximately 3 and 8.5\%) were spiked with varying amounts of
   chlorpyrifos designed to result in equilibrium interstitial (pore) water
   concentrations that would bracket the effects concentrations observed in
   the water-only exposures. Ten-day toxicity tests with Chironomus tentans
   were conducted with the spiked sediments under conditions similar to
   those in the water-only exposure. Based on predicted pore-water
   concentrations of chlorpyrifos, results of the water-only and sediment
   tests were in close agreement. The water-only LC50 of chlorpyrifos to
   Chironomus tentans was 70 ng/L, whereas LC50 values based on predicted
   pore-water concentrations in the two test sediments were 40 and 70 ng/L.
   Total concentrations of chlorpyrifos measured in pore water from the
   test sediments were always at least an order of magnitude greater than
   predicted pore-water concentrations of the pesticide. However, upon
   correction for that fraction of the measured chlorpyrifos potentially
   bound to DOC in the pore water, measured and predicted chlorpyrifos
   concentrations were in much closer agreement, with the former typically
   about threefold greater than the latter. Overall, these results suggest
   that within the range of organic carbon tested in the present study, an
   equilibrium partitioning model based on organic carbon is appropriate
   for predicting the bioavailability of sediment-associated chlorpyrifos
   to benthic invertebrates.},

Title = {Sequestration of heavy metal by glomalin-related soil protein:
   Implication for water quality improvement in mangrove wetlands},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {142-152},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) is a widespread glycoprotein found
   to have strong ability of sequestering heavy metals in soils. However,
   the underlying mechanism for metal and metalloid removal as well as
   water quality improvement and the ecological role played by GRSP are
   still not well documented. This study was initiated to investigate the
   interconnection of metal loading in GRSP between sediments and suspended
   solids, focusing on the mobilization mechanisms of GRSP in the coastal
   mangrove wetland. Combined indicators of nine heavy metals were
   significantly positively correlated with GRSP concentration by Principal
   Component Analysis, indicating that GRSP could act as an indicator of
   contamination level in the mangrove wetlands. Large distribution of GRSP
   in sediments and suspended solids elevated sequestration potential of
   heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd, Pb) and metalloid arsenic in
   the mangrove aquatic ecosystem. GRSP mobilized and sequestered heavy
   metals in sediment profiles, which reduced the bioavailability of heavy
   metals. GRSP was also a significant contributor for suspended solids to
   adsorb heavy metals, enhancing suspended solids deposition and burial
   process in sediments. This new finding provided insights into the
   ecological functions of GRSP and the heavy metal cycling in wetland
   environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Effects of Climate Change on Harp Seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) have evolved life history
   strategies to exploit seasonal sea ice as a breeding platform. As such,
   individuals are prepared to deal with fluctuations in the quantity and
   quality of ice in their breeding areas. It remains unclear, however, how
   shifts in climate may affect seal populations. The present study
   assesses the effects of climate change on harp seals through three
   linked analyses. First, we tested the effects of short-term climate
   variability on young-of-the year harp seal mortality using a linear
   regression of sea ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence against
   stranding rates of dead harp seals in the region during 1992 to 2010. A
   similar regression of stranding rates and North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) index values was also conducted. These analyses revealed negative
   correlations between both ice cover and NAO conditions and seal
   mortality, indicating that lighter ice cover and lower NAO values result
   in higher mortality. A retrospective cross-correlation analysis of NAO
   conditions and sea ice cover from 1978 to 2011 revealed that NAO-related
   changes in sea ice may have contributed to the depletion of seals on the
   east coast of Canada during 1950 to 1972, and to their recovery during
   1973 to 2000. This historical retrospective also reveals opposite links
   between neonatal mortality in harp seals in the Northeast Atlantic and
   NAO phase. Finally, an assessment of the long-term trends in sea ice
   cover in the breeding regions of harp seals across the entire North
   Atlantic during 1979 through 2011 using multiple linear regression
   models and mixed effects linear regression models revealed that sea ice
   cover in all harp seal breeding regions has been declining by as much as
   6 percent per decade over the time series of available satellite data.},

Journal = {RESEARCH IN MARINE SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {860-868},

Abstract = {Different methods for analyzing and evaluating offshore wind turbines
   under combined and single wind and wind loads are discussed. In areas,
   where dynamical analysis is required due to high wave height and high
   structure height, the accuracy of the results obtained from regular
   models will be discussed that statically analyze the behavior of the
   structure. The most correct approach to investigate the dynamical
   behavior of offshore structures against wave and wind force is to use
   long-term and irregular time series of water level and wind force on the
   offshore wind turbine. Because of time consuming and complex
   interpretation of results and high data volume, there is a need for
   alternative methods with appropriate accuracy in short-term period. The
   purpose of this study is to provide a more accurate and practical method
   than statistical and spectral methods to evaluate the response of wind
   turbines under loading of both wave and wind time series. Furthermore,
   the incremental wind-wave analysis is used. The results show that the
   response of the offshore wind turbine support structure, which is a
   jacket platform, is more affected by the waves. While turbine tower
   responses are mostly affected by wind force on wind turbine blades.},

Title = {The evolution and energetics of large amplitude nonlinear internal waves

Abstract = {Intensive in-situ observations of nonlinear internal waves on the
   Portuguese shelf were made in August 1994, including measurements of the
   same wavepacket at three locations as it propagated on-shelf. The waves
   were characterized by sudden isotherm depressions of up to 45 m lasting
   10-35 minutes, accompanied by current surges of up to 0.45 m s(-1) and
   shears of up to 0.7 m s(-1) over 60 m. The waves propagated away from
   the shelf break with an estimated phase speed of 0.57 m s(-1). The
   amplitude of the waves was comparable to the theoretical maximum. The
   kinetic and potential energies of the waves were calculated directly
   from the observed current and density structures. Individual waves were
   associated with a total energy of up to approximately 3.0 M J m(-1) per
   unit crest length. The depth integrated on-shelf internal wave energy
   flux approached 2000 W m(-1) per unit crest length near the shelf break
   and decreased on-shore at a depth integrated rate of approximately 7.7 x
   10(-2) W m(-2). The internal waves provided an important source of
   vertical mixing where they occurred on the Portuguese shelf throughout
   most of August 1994, represented by a sustained vertical eddy
   diffusivity profile which peaked at K-z approximate to 2.2 x 10(-3) m(2)
   s(-1) at 30 m depth. Internal mixing would have to be parameterized by
   such a K-z profile in any model of the Portuguese shelf in which the
   stratification were to be accurately represented.},

Title = {Ecological and biogeographic implications of Siderastrea symbiotic
   relationship with Symbiodinium sp C46 in Sal Island (Cape Verde, East
   Atlantic Ocean)},
Journal = {MARINE BIODIVERSITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {261-272},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The relative abundance of the genus Siderastrea and its relationship
   with temperature and irradiance was assessed around Sal Island (Cape
   Verde). In some of the surveyed sites, these corals accounted for 80-90
   \% of the living cover, making it a biotope-dominant organism. Unlike
   Siderastrea corals from West Atlantic and Caribbean locations, genetic
   analyses of the dinoflagellate symbiotic partner revealed high
   specificity between Siderastrea sp. in Cape Verde and the Symbiodinium
   type C46. Biotope restriction of the ecological success of Siderastrea
   in Cape Verde may be explained in part by this host-symbiont
   partnership, resulting locally in a small optimum ecological niche with
   specific light intensity regimes. Distinctively, West Atlantic and
   Caribbean Siderastrea associates with a much broader range of
   Symbiodinium diversity, suggesting that these symbioses exhibit some
   flexibility under differing environmental conditions where these corals
   occupy a wider range of ecological niches. Geographic isolation and/or
   long-standing environmental conditions are probably responsible for such
   adaptions and coral-dinoflagellate symbioses. Additional genetic
   analyses on Clade C Symbiodinium associated with Siderastrea were
   conducted with the hyper-variable plastid psbA minicircle to resolve
   phylogeographic patterns that indicate the relative connectivity and/or
   isolation of these symbionts throughout the tropical Atlantic.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {In order to understand the biodegradability of algal-derived organic
   matter, biodegradation experiments were conducted with C-13 and
   N-15-labeled natural phytoplankton and periphytic algal populations in
   experimental conditions for 60 days. Qualitative changes in the
   dissolved organic matter were also determined using parallel factor
   analysis and the stable carbon isotopic composition of the hydrophobic
   dissolved organic matter through the experimental period. Although
   algal-derived organic matter is considered to be easily biodegradable,
   the initial amounts of total organic carbon newly produced by
   phytoplankton and periphytic algae remained approximately 16 and 44 \%
   after 60 days, respectively, and about 22 and 43 \% of newly produced
   particulate nitrogen remained. Further, the dissolved organic carbon
   derived from both algal populations increased significantly after 60
   days. Although the dissolved organic matter gradually became refractory,
   the contributions of the algal-derived organic matter to the dissolved
   organic matter and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter increased. Our
   laboratory experimental results suggest that algal-derived organic
   matter produced by phytoplankton and periphytic algae could contribute
   significantly to the non-biodegradable organic matter through microbial
   transformations.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {The soils from four typical natural wetlands, namely, Phragmites
   australis, Tamarix chinensis, Suaeda salsa, and tidal flat, as well as
   reclaimed wetland, were selected to evaluate the soil quality in the
   Yellow River Delta. Fourteen soil physicochemical property indexes were
   employed to build a minimum data set (MDS). Combined with vegetation
   type and soil depth, the soil quality index (SQI) was conducted. A fuzzy
   logic model was applied for data normalization. The contrast test was
   conducted to verify the accuracy of the MDS. The results showed that the
   MDS consists of TOC, NO3--N, soil salinity, TS, TP, Mg, C/N and pH. The
   soil quality decreased from the inland to the coastline and from
   reclaimed wetland to tidal flat with the change of vegetation type. The
   soil quality of 0-10 cm soil depth was better than that of 20-30 cm soil
   depth. The soil qualities of reclaimed land were significantly better
   than those of natural wetlands at the same soil depth. Correlation
   analysis results showed that agricultural reclamation has become an
   important factor of soil quality change in the study area. Comparative
   results of two methods of MDS and the total data set (TDS) testified
   that the method of MDS was credible and accurate for soil quality
   assessment of the study area. Our results indicated that wetland
   protection and agricultural reclamation in coastal areas should keep a
   rational balance.},

Abstract = {The Compact Infrared Camera (CIRC) instruments onboard the Advanced Land
   Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) and the Calorimetric Electron Telescope
   (CALET) attached to the International Space Station are satellite-borne
   2D-array thermal infrared cameras for technical demonstrations in fields
   such as forest fire monitoring, volcano monitoring, and heat island
   analysis. Since they have the characteristics of low cost and low power
   consumption and have no onboard calibrator such as a blackbody or
   shutter, in-flight calibration should be performed by vicarious
   calibration (VC) and cross-calibration (CC). In this study, we
   determined the recalibration coefficients for both of the CIRC
   instruments as a function of time based on VC experiments in Lake
   Kasumigaura (Japan) and Railroad Valley Playa (USA), VC with telemetry
   data from three lakes in Japan and the USA, and CC with imagers onboard
   two geostationary satellites (MTSAT-2 and Himawari-8). As a result, the
   derived recalibration coefficients improved the accuracy of the
   ground-testing-based radiance remarkably in both of the CIRC
   instruments, suggesting that the recalibrated radiance can satisfy the
   target accuracy of CIRC, given as 2 K at 300 K. These coefficients, as a
   function of time, will be applied to all CIRC images by reprocessing
   planned in the near future.},

Title = {Asymmetric and endogenous magnetic reconnection processes in
   quasi-collisionless plasmas},
Journal = {PHYSICS OF PLASMAS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We define an endogenous magnetic reconnection process as the one having
   a driving factor that lies within the region where a drastic change in
   magnetic field topology occurs. A process of this kind is shown to take
   place when an electron temperature gradient is present in a plasma
   column and when, referring to quasi-collisionless regimes, the evolving
   electron temperature fluctuations are anisotropic. A two-fluid theory,
   for weakly collisional plasma regimes and confinement configurations
   which have sheared magnetic fields, is formulated, and two classes of
   reconnecting modes are identified. The localized class of modes is
   characterized by a transverse reconnecting magnetic field (B) over tilde
   (x) of odd parity, as a function of the radial variable (across the
   reconnection layer). The width of this remains significant even when
   large macroscopic distances, such as those of interest to space and
   astrophysics, are considered. The relevant reconnection can be referred
   to as antisymmetric. In fact, the (additional and realistic) presence of
   a finite current density gradient leads to finding modes with mixed (B)
   over tilde (x) parity which are no longer localized within the
   reconnection layer. Then, the resulting magnetic islands are not
   symmetric. In view of the fact that there are plasmas in the Universe
   with considerable electron thermal energy contents, the features of the
   novel reconnecting modes can be relied upon in order to produce
   generation of magnetic fields or conversion of magnetic energy into
   particle energy (through a sequence of mode-particle resonances).

Abstract = {Optical ``rogue{''} waves are rare and very high intensity pulses of
   light that occur in optical devices such as communication fibers. They
   appear suddenly and can cause transmission errors and damage in optical
   communication systems. Indeed, the physics governing their dynamics is
   very similar to ``monster{''} or ``freak{''} waves on the Earth's
   oceans, which are known to harm shipping. It is therefore important to
   characterize rogue wave generation, dynamics and, if possible,
   predictability. Here we demonstrate a simple cascade mechanism that
   drives the formation and emergence of rogue waves in the generalized
   non-linear Schrodinger equation with third-order dispersion. This
   generation mechanism is based on inelastic collisions of quasi-solitons
   and is well described by a resonant-like scattering behaviour for the
   energy transfer in pair-wise quasi-soliton collisions. Our theoretical
   and numerical results demonstrate a threshold for rogue wave emergence
   and the existence of a period of reduced amplitudes - a ``calm before
   the storm{''} - preceding the arrival of a rogue wave event. Comparing
   with ultra-long time window simulations of 3.865 x 10(6) ps we observe
   the statistics of rogue waves in optical fibres with an unprecedented
   level of detail and accuracy, unambiguously establishing the long-ranged
   character of the rogue wave power-distribution function over seven
   orders of magnitude. Published by The Optical Society under the terms of

   This paper presents morphodynamic simulation results for Ancao inlet
   (Rio Formosa, Portugal), for two individual storms (ST01 and ST02),
   observed during the INDIA project in 1999. Despite similarities in
   maximum storm intensity and duration, variation in tidal range and hence
   tidal currents through the inlet during the storms result in very
   different morphodynamic response. ST01 occurs during a neap tide (range
   similar to 1.0m) when peak currents through the inlet are at a minimum,
   allowing wave action to move sediment onshore from the ebb delta,
   reducing inlet cross section and promoting closure. ST02 occurs between
   spring and neap tide (range similar to 2.0m), where ebb tidal currents
   are strong enough to inhibit wave action, causing tidal dominance within
   the channel, delta toe and inlet throat, and wave dominance on the
   up-drift and down-drift swash platforms and adjacent beaches. Analysis
   of aggregated volume change for each morphological element within the
   ebb delta suggests sediment bypassing efficiency increases with wave
   energy, and decreases in inverse proportion to grain size and tidal
   range due to wave blocking by ebb tidal currents.},

Abstract = {The thermal discharge from the Houshi power plant in China has been
   increased continuously with the increase in power supply. In order to
   understand the waste heat pollution conditions in the coastal areas of
   the Houshi power plant, we proposed a modified Princeton Ocean Model
   (POM) model to conduct three-dimensional numerical simulations for heat
   transport in the coastal areas of the plant. The proposed model has been
   verified to be valid in our previous study. This study employed the
   verified model to predict heat transport under the future operational
   conditions of the power plant with a thermal discharge of Q(s) =
   217.0m(3)/s. The prediction results indicate that a larger area of
   waters near the plant outfall will have a temperature rise larger than 4
   degrees C, and this area of temperature rise is close to the water
   intake of the power plant. Besides, the heat accumulation phenomena will
   be serious in the depth direction and this will bring great influence to
   marine ecological environment, especially to benthic organisms. It is
   suggested that some measures are necessary to reduce temperature rise in
   the coastal areas of the Houshi power plant in the future.},

Title = {A conceptual model for assessing rainfall and vegetation trends in

Abstract = {Policymakers, governments and aid agencies require operational
   environmental monitoring in support of evidence-based policy-making and
   resource deployment in crisis situations. For Africa, this is only
   feasible at sub-continental scale with a large network of automated
   meteorological stations, a large number of highly coordinated field
   observers or with satellite remote sensing. The challenge with satellite
   data lies in the derivation of meaningful environmental indicators. This
   article describes a conceptual framework for understanding
   satellite-derived indicators of rainfall and vegetation greenness trends
   over Africa. It attributes observed vegetation changes to climatic (i.e.
   rainfall linked) and non-climatic drivers. A decade of annual rainfall
   and vegetation data over sub-Saharan Africa was analysed using
   satellite-based rainfall estimates {[}Famine Early Warning System
   Rainfall Estimation 2.0 (FEWSNET RFE 2.0)] from National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Climate Prediction Centre and the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from the
   Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) sensor.
   Rainfall and vegetation greenness trends were analysed for 759
   administrative regions of sub-Saharan Africa to identify those regions
   that have experienced a negative, positive or stable rainfall/vegetation
   trend over the period 2001-2010. The character of the relationship
   between the annual rainfall and max NDVI trends were examined to
   identify areas where the changes in greenness could be attributed to
   climatic (rainfall) and non-climatic (human land use or ecological
   disturbance) changes. Regions where increasing rainfall was associated
   with vegetation greening were found in West Africa, Central African
   Republic, West Cameroon and northeastern part of South Africa, whereas
   areas with evidence of climatic vegetation degradation' were located in
   Southern Madagascar, Nigeria, Kenya and the Garden Route region of South
   Africa.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Titan's surface-atmosphere system bears remarkable similarities to
   Earth's, the most striking being an active, global methane cycle akin to
   Earth's water cycle(1,2). Like the hydrological cycle of Earth, Titan's
   seasonal methane cycle is driven by changes in the distribution of solar
   energy(2). The Cassini spacecraft, which arrived at Saturn in 2004 in
   the midst of northern winter and southern summer, has observed surface
   changes, including shoreline recession, at Titan's south pole3,4 and
   equator(5). However, active surface processes have yet to be confirmed
   in the lakes and seas in Titan's north polar region(6-8). As the 2017
   northern summer solstice approaches, the onset of dynamic phenomena in
   this region is expected(6,7,9-12). Here we present the discovery of
   bright features in recent Cassini RADAR data that appeared in Titan's
   northern sea, Ligeia Mare, in July 2013 and disappeared in subsequent
   observations. We suggest that these bright features are best explained
   by the occurrence of ephemeral phenomena such as surface waves, rising
   bubbles, and suspended or floating solids. We suggest that our
   observations are an initial glimpse of dynamic processes that are
   commencing in the northern lakes and seas as summer nears in the
   northern hemisphere.},

   coastal parts of Norway seems to have coincided with an observed rise in
   winter temperatures. This study investigated the frost tolerance (LT50)
   and effects of moderate frost exposure on rush plant regrowth over time
   during the period late November to late winter/spring, and
   photosynthetic activity in late winter/spring. Juncus effusus and
   J.conglomeratus of physiologically young age (seedlings) displayed
   similar high frost tolerance (LT50) and did not differ significantly in
   regenerative ability following prolonged frost exposure. Regrowth
   capacity generally increased during winter and when stress conditions
   increased, shoot formation was prioritised over total biomass
   production. Maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m) and
   performance index of photosystem II (PI) were high in late
   winter/spring, with J.effusus showing higher values than
   J.conglomeratus. Green, photosynthetically active shoots, which
   facilitate accumulation of carbohydrates during autumn and even in
   winter, may provide Juncus spp. with substantial competitiveness in late
   winter and spring. The results revealed that the dominance of J.effusus
   over J.conglomeratus in pastures and leys is not due to major
   differences in winter survival parameters, but probably the higher
   photosynthetic efficiency observed in J.effusus. Generally higher
   temperatures during winter and lower frost kill may be contributing to
   the current increase in rush infestation.},

Title = {Monopile head stiffness for servicibility limit state calculations in
   assessing the natural frequency of offshore wind turbines},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {267-283},
Abstract = {Monopiles are used as foundations for offshore wind energy towers. These
   large diameter monopiles (4-6 m) which result in extremely stiff short
   monopiles do not follow the same elastic deformation patterns as those
   exhibited by small diameter (0.5-1.5 m) monopiles usually used for
   supporting structures in offshore oil and gas industry. Design
   recommendations (API and DNV among others) which have been developed on
   the basis of full-scale load tests on long, slender and flexible piles
   are not suitable for designing foundations for offshore wind turbine
   structures. Furthermore, as these facilities are very sensitive to
   rotations and dynamic changes in the soil-pile system, the precise
   prediction of monopile head displacement and rotation constitutes a
   design criterion of great importance. In this article, the
   semi-analytical finite element analysis which combines the conventional
   finite element method with Fourier series representation of
   displacements is used for the study of monopiles for offshore wind
   turbines under lateral loading in homogeneous soils. In order to develop
   functional forms of design equations for large diameter monopiles like
   the ones used for supporting offshore wind turbines, an extensive
   parametric study has been carried out. The analyzed parameters including
   pile slenderness ratio and soil stiffness allow to obtain simple and
   approximate closed-form solutions for static head stiffnesses of both
   rough and smooth short monopiles embedded in homogeneous soils. It has
   been found that lateral stiffness K-L, rotational stiffness K-R and
   cross coupling stiffness K-LR for both rough and smooth interfaces
   depend only on the value of the monopile slenderness L-p/D-p rather than
   the relative soil/monopile rigidity E-p/E-s usually found in the
   offshore platforms designing codes (DNV code for example). These
   analytical expressions have been incorporated into the expressions of
   the Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) natural frequency of two wind farm
   sites. Excellent agreement has been found between the computed and the
   measured natural frequencies.},

Title = {Successive marine heatwaves cause disproportionate coral bleaching
   during a fast phase transition from El Nino to La Nina},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {715},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves that result in coral
   bleaching events have increased over recent decades and led to
   catastrophic losses of reef-building corals in many regions. The
   high-latitude coral assemblages at Lord Howe Island, which is a UNESCO
   listed site is the world southernmost coral community, were exposed to
   successive thermal anomalies following a fast phase-transition of the
   record-breaking 2009 to 2010 warm pool El Nino in the Central Pacific to
   a strong La Nina event in late 2010. The coral community experienced
   severe and unprecedented consecutive bleaching in both 2010 and 2011.
   Coral health surveys completed between March 2010 and September 2012
   quantified the response and recovery of approximately 43,700 coral
   colonies to these successive marine heatwaves. In March 2010, coral
   bleaching ranged from severe, with 99\% of colonies bleached at some
   shallow lagoon sites, to mild at deeper reef slope sites, with only 17\%
   of individuals affected. Significant immediate mortality from thermal
   stress was evident during the peak of the bleaching event. Overall,
   species in the genera Pocillopora, {*}Whom. Seriatopora and Ponies were
   the most affected, while minimal bleaching and mortality was recorded
   among members of other coral families (e.g. Acroporidae, Dendrophylfidae
   \& Merulinidae). Surviving corals underwent a subsequent, but much less
   intense, thermal anomaly in 2011 that led to a disproportionate
   bleaching response among susceptible taxa. While this observation
   indicates that the capacity of thermally susceptible high-latitude
   corals to acclimatize to future ocean warming may be limited,
   particularly if bleaching events occur annually, our long-term survey
   data shows that coral cover at most sites recovered to pre-bleaching
   levels within three years in die absence of further thermal anomalies.

Abstract = {A new procedure for the determination of inorganic arsenic (III,V) and
   antimony (III,V) in water samples by dispersive liquid-liquid micro
   extraction separation and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry
   (ETAAS) is presented. At pH 1, As(III) and Sb(III) are complexed with
   ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and extracted into the fine
   droplets formed when mixing carbon tetrachloride (extraction solvent),
   methanol (disperser solvent) and the sample solution. After extraction,
   the phases are separated by centrifugation, and As(III) and Sb(Ill) are
   determined in the organic phase. As(V) and Sb(V) remain in the aqueous
   layer. Total inorganic As and Sb are determined after the reduction of
   the pentavalent forms with sodium thiosulphate. As (V) and Sb(V) are
   calculated by difference. The detection limits are 0.01 and 0.05 mu g
   L-1 for As(III) and Sb(III), respectively, with an enrichment factor of
   115. The relative standard deviation is in the 2.9-4.5\% range. The
   procedure has been applied to the speciation of inorganic As and Sb in
   bottled, tap and sea water samples with satisfactory results. (C) 2009

Abstract = {Climate has been proposed conventionally as the primary factor that
   determines periglacial river activity (aggradation) and pattern
   (braided). This concept does not explain the rich diversity in river
   patterns and morphological processes in both the present and past
   periglacial environments: besides braided rivers and sandur, meandering,
   anabranching, transitional and deltaic rivers also occur. A first
   attempt is made to combine past and present periglacial river types with
   regard to their morphology, processes and environments. The processes
   that control river energy and morphology are discussed especially for
   periglacial conditions. This approach permits an assessment of the
   responses of periglacial rivers to climatic conditions and the
   modulation of the responses due to changes in the basin properties.
   Examples drawn from palaeo- and present-day periglacial rivers and
   environments demonstrate that there is no unique type of periglacial
   river but rather an azonal fluvial system with a number of periglacial
   variants.},

Abstract = {Helical piles have emerged as an attractive foundation system for
   offshore applications with renewed interest from the offshore community.
   Significant research gap currently exists in transferring this
   technology offshore and this paper discusses how existing and emerging
   knowledge can be successfully used to bridge some of the gaps. We focus
   on the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) large deformation finite
   element (LDFE) modelling technique that is commercially available and
   can be used to model the three-dimensional installation process with
   consideration of strain rate and softening effects in soft offshore
   clays. A helical pile of L = 7.5 m long is modelled with one or two
   large-diameter helices (D = 2 m) attached to a central shaft of d = 0.5
   m in diameter.The net effect of strain rate and softening is to increase
   the installation torque. The measured torque is within the range of
   200-400 kN.m for the offshore clay and the pile geometry studied.
   Additional helices increase the uplift force but to a lesser degree than
   that of the measured torque. Remoulding induced strength reduction is
   found to be within the range of 25-33\% of the intact clay strength.
   Issues of extracting and reusing offshore helical pile foundations are
   discussed.},

Title = {Regulatory branch points affecting protein and lipid biosynthesis in the
   diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum},
Journal = {BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {306-315},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It is widely established that nutritional nitrogen deprivation increases
   lipid accumulation but severely decreases growth rate in microalgae. To
   understand the regulatory branch points that determine the partitioning
   of carbon among its potential sinks, we analyzed metabolite and
   transcript levels of central carbon metabolic pathways and determined
   the average fluxes and quantum requirements for the synthesis of
   protein, carbohydrates and fatty acid in the diatom Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum. Under nitrate-starved conditions, the carbon fluxes into
   all major sinks decrease sharply; the largest decrease was into proteins
   and smallest was into lipids. This reduction of carbon flux into lipids
   together with a significantly lower growth rate is responsible for lower
   overall FA productivities implying that nitrogen starvation is not a
   bioenergetically feasible strategy for increasing biodiesel production.
   The reduction in these fluxes was accompanied by an 18-fold increase in
   a-ketoglutarate (AKG), 3-fold increase in NADPH/NADP(+), and sharp
   decreases in glutamate (GLU) and glutamine (GLN) levels. Additionally,
   the mRNA level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and two type II
   diacylglycerol-acyltransferases were increased. Partial suppression of
   nitrate reductase by tungstate resulted in similar trends at lower
   levels as for nitrate starvation. These results reveal that the GS/GOGAT
   pathway is the main regulation site for nitrate dependent control of
   carbon partitioning between protein and lipid biosynthesis, while the
   AKG/GL(N/U) metabolite ratio is a transcriptional signal, possibly
   related to redox poise of intermediates in the photosynthetic electron
   transport system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Temporal and spatial variability of the carbon cycle in the east of
   China's seas: a three-dimensional physical-biogeochemical modeling study},
Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the east of China's seas, there is a wide range of the continental
   shelf. The nutrient cycle and the carbon cycle in the east of China's
   seas exhibit a strong variability on seasonal to decadal time scales. On
   the basis of a regional ocean modeling system (ROMS), a three
   dimensional physical-biogeochemical model including the carbon cycle
   with the resolution (1/12)A degrees x(1/12)A degrees is established to
   investigate the physical variations, ecosystem responses and carbon
   cycle consequences in the east of China's seas. The ROMS-Nutrient
   Phytoplankton Zooplankton Detritus (NPZD) model is driven by daily
   air-sea fluxes (wind stress, long wave radiation, short wave radiation,
   sensible heat and latent heat, freshwater fluxes) that derived from the
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis2 from
   1982 to 2005. The coupled model is capable of reproducing the observed
   seasonal variation characteristics over the same period in the East
   China Sea. The integrated air-sea CO2 flux over the entire east of
   China's seas reveals a strong seasonal cycle, functioning as a source of
   CO2 to the atmosphere from June to October, while serving as a sink of
   CO2 to the atmosphere in the other months. The 24 a mean value of airsea
   CO2 flux over the entire east of China's seas is about 1.06
   mol/(m(2)center dot a), which is equivalent to a regional total of 3.22
   Mt/a, indicating that in the east of China's seas there is a sink of CO2
   to the atmosphere. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in sea water
   in the east of China's seas has an increasing rate of 1.15 mu atm/a (1
   mu tm/a=0.101 325 Pa), but pH in sea water has an opposite tendency,
   which decreases with a rate of 0.001 3 a(-1) from 1982 to 2005.
   Biological activity is a dominant factor that controls the in the east
   of China's seas, and followed by a temperature. The inverse relationship
   between the interannual variability of air-sea CO2 flux averaged from
   the domain area and Nio3 SST Index indicates that the carbon cycle in
   the east of China's seas has a high correlation with El Nio-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO).},

Title = {Remote energy sources for mixing in the Indonesian Seas},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In addition to locally generated tidal mixing, remotely generated
   planetary (Kelvin and Rossby) waves and eddies are found to supply
   energy into the Indonesian Seas, sufficient to drive mixing in the upper
   ocean at rates inferred from observations.
   The role of the Indonesian Seas in climate is attributed to the intense
   mixing observed throughout the region. Mixing cools the surface
   temperature and hence modifies the atmospheric convection centered over
   the region. Mixing also controls the heat exchange between the Pacific
   and Indian Oceans by transforming water-mass properties while they
   transit through the region. Mixing in the Indonesian Seas has long been
   identified to be driven locally by tides. Here we show that the observed
   mixing can also be powered by the remotely generated planetary waves and
   eddies. We use a regional ocean model to show that the Indonesian Seas
   are a sink of the energy generated in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. We
   estimate that 1.7 GW of the remotely generated energy enters the region
   across all straits. The energy flux is surface intensified and
   characterized by a convergence, implying dissipation and mixing, within
   the straits and along topography. Locally, energy convergence associated
   with this process is comparable in magnitude to tidal energy
   dissipation, which dominates the deep ocean.},

Abstract = {The known post-glacial isostatic land rise rates at Faro Island, Central
   Baltic Sea, allowed for the reliable estimation of frost weathering
   rates of limestone clasts along five beach profiles. Weathering rates
   measured by clast dimension change were quantified over periods ranging
   between 640 and 2090 years. While the deposited beach materials at each
   profile have varying lithostratigraphic compositions these attributes
   appear to have no direct influence on the long-term comminution rates.
   Mean clast size of initially deposited beach materials is suggested to
   be primarily a function of local wave energy and sourced from local rock
   platforms. Field observations, climate data and literature point to the
   beach materials in the upper 10-20 cm being fractured under an active
   diurnal to short-term frost environment that has persisted over the past
   1000-2000 years. Pore water freezing by 9\% volumetric expansion and the
   development of pore water expulsion and hydrofracture is suggested to
   increase pore volume and pore interconnectedness over time and
   facilitate ice segregation growth. Observed modes of clast fracture,
   bursting, flaking and granular disaggregation suggest different frost
   weathering mechanisms to operate on different limestone lithologies.
   Long term rates of break down appear however not differentiated by
   limestone composition.},

Abstract = {Wet sedge tundra communities in the High Arctic are valuable sources of
   forage for several resident and migratory herbivores; however, the
   effects of grazing on these systems have been rarely studied. We
   simulated grazing in two wet sedge meadows at a site on Ellesmere Island
   that has not been affected by grazing. Over two summers, we clipped
   plots at four different frequencies and removed litter to assess effects
   on aboveground net primary production, availability of soil nitrogen,
   shoot concentrations of carbon and nitrogen, and soil temperature and
   moisture regimes. Available soil nitrate and ammonium were highest in
   plots with intermediate clipping frequencies. Shoot nitrogen
   concentrations were also greater at intermediate clipping frequencies in
   two of the four species studied. Aboveground net primary production
   decreased after clipping, regardless of frequency. Litter removal
   resulted in slightly increased soil moisture, but had no effect on
   aboveground net primary production. Soil temperature was not affected by
   any of our treatments. These results suggest that nitrogen cycling is
   stimulated by intermediate frequencies of simulated grazing, but
   clipping decreased aboveground net primary production in ungrazed high
   arctic wet sedge tundra.},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Three macroscopic diagenetic features can be recognized in the
   sandstones of the Upper Cretaceous Desert Member of the Blackhawk
   Formation and Castlegate Sandstone of the Mesaverde Group exposed in the
   Book Cliffs, Utah, each of which have distinctive form, geometry, and
   stratigraphic distribution. Diagenetic alterations are: (1) leached
   zones ({''}whitecaps{''}), up to 10 m thick, beneath coal beds; (2)
   large (up to 8 m) concretionary carbonate-cemented bodies in amalgamated
   shoreface and thin fluvial sandstones; and (3) thin (up to 2 m),
   laterally extensive carbonate-cemented horizons beneath major marine
   flooding surfaces. Each feature has distinct petrographic and
   geochemical signatures, and formed through discrete diagenetic
   processes. Large isolated carbonate-cemented bodies are composed of
   ferroan dolomite, most of which precipitated during early diagenesis.
   Field and petrographic data, coupled with stable-isotope data (early
   cements, delta(13)C = -2.5 to +3.4 parts per thousand VPDB; delta(18)O =
   -7.8 to -12.0 parts per thousand VPDB; Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7078; later
   cements, delta(13)C = -3.1 to -5.7 parts per thousand VPDB; delta(18)O =
   -12.0 to -15.1 parts per thousand VPDB; Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7093) suggest
   precipitation from meteoric fluids, input into sediments during times of
   relative sea-level fall. The source of carbonate for the dolomite cement
   was dissolution of detrital dolomite from beneath coals by organic acids
   and subsequent mobilization by meteoric fluids. Carbonate precipitation
   in laterally extensive cement horizons appears to have started as a
   result of hiatus in sediment accumulation during marine flooding events
   (relative sea-level rise). Cement precipitation in these horizons
   continued through sediment burial as a result of organic-matter
   oxidation reactions in overlying organic-rich mudstones. The results of
   this study show a link between sedimentation (related to changes in
   relative sea level) and diagenesis, leading to the potential for the
   development of process-based, predictive models of early diagenesis in
   depositional successions.},

   from 0.9973 to 0.9998, and this validated good linearity of the
   method.Percent relative standard deviations obtained in the range of 2.5
   - 10.6\% verified the method's high intraday repeatability. Accuracy of
   the proposed method was assessed with spiking experiments performed on
   complex sample matrices. Percent recoveries calculated for spiked soil,
   artificial seawater and seaweed samples were in acceptable ranges of 95
   - 121\%, 87 - 117\% and 85 - 111\%, respectively. These figures of merit
   suggest that HPLC-UV coupled with the US-Fe3O4@rGO-DSPEmethod is
   suitable for the determination of parabens in Antarctic samples.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a synopsis of recently published studies by the
   co-authors, which show that several land surface characteristics unique
   to Northern Eurasia are responsible for facilitating a causal
   relationship between autumn snow anomalies in this region and subsequent
   hemispheric winter climate patterns. The large size and extratropical
   location of the contiguous Eurasian land mass results in broad,
   continental-scale interannual snow cover extent and depth variations
   throughout autumn and winter, and corresponding diabatic heating
   anomalies. These surface anomalies occur in the presence of a large
   region of stationary wave activity, produced in part by the orographic
   barriers that separate northern/central Eurasia from southern/eastern
   Eurasia. This colocation of snow-forced anomalies and ambient wave
   energy is unique to Northern Eurasia, and initiates a teleconnection
   pathway involving stationary wave-mean flow interaction throughout the
   troposphere and stratosphere, ultimately resulting in a modulation of
   the winter Arctic Oscillation (AO). Complementary new results are also
   presented which show that partial snow cover extent or snow depth only
   anomalies in Northern Eurasia are insufficient to initiate the
   teleconnection pathway and produce a winter AO signal. This synopsis
   provides a useful interpretation of the earlier studies in the specific
   context of Northern Eurasia regional climate and environmental change.

Title = {Using ecological niche modelling to infer past, present and future
   environmental suitability for Leiopelma hochstetteri, an endangered New

Abstract = {Leiopelma hochstetteri is an endangered New Zealand frog now confined to
   isolated populations scattered across the North Island. A better
   understanding of its past, current and predicted future environmental
   suitability will contribute to its conservation which is in jeopardy due
   to human activities, feral predators, disease and climate change. Here
   we use ecological niche modelling with all known occurrence data (N =
   1708) and six determinant environmental variables to elucidate current,
   pre-human and future environmental suitability of this species.
   Comparison among independent runs, subfossil records and a clamping
   method allow validation of models. Many areas identified as currently
   suitable do not host any known populations. This apparent discrepancy
   could be explained by several non exclusive hypotheses: the areas have
   not been adequately surveyed and undiscovered populations still remain,
   the model is over simplistic; the species' sensitivity to fragmentation
   and small population size; biotic interactions; historical events. An
   additional outcome is that apparently suitable, but frog-less areas
   could be targeted for future translocations. Surprisingly, pre-human
   conditions do not differ markedly highlighting the possibility that the
   range of the species was broadly fragmented before human arrival.
   Nevertheless, some populations, particularly on the west of the North
   Island may have disappeared as a result of human mediated habitat
   modification. Future conditions are marked with higher temperatures,
   which are predicted to be favourable to the species. However, such
   virtual gain in suitable range will probably not benefit the species
   given the highly fragmented nature of existing habitat and the low
   dispersal ability of this species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Improvements in plate anchor capacity due to cyclic and maintained loads
   combined with consolidation},

Abstract = {Plate anchor technology is an efficient solution for mooring offshore
   floating facilities for oil and gas or renewable energy projects. When
   used with a taut mooring, the anchor is typically subjected to a
   maintained load component and intermittent episodes of cyclic loading
   throughout the design life. These loads, and the associated shearing,
   remoulding and consolidation processes, cause changes in the anchor
   capacity, particularly in soft, fine-grained soils. The changing anchor
   capacity affects the mooring performance by changing the safety margin
   and also the overall system reliability. In this paper the changing
   anchor capacity in reconstituted, normally consolidated natural
   carbonate silt was assessed through a series of beam centrifuge tests on
   horizontally loaded circular plate anchors. The results demonstrate that
   full consolidation under a typical maintained load leads to a 50\% gain
   in the anchor capacity, and subsequent cyclic loading and
   reconsolidation can triple this increase. An effective stress framework
   based on critical state concepts is employed to explain and support the
   experimental observations. This study shows that, when viewed from a
   whole-life reliability perspective, maintained and cyclic loading
   provide a long-term enhancement of anchor capacity in soft, fine-grained
   soils. This beneficial effect is currently overlooked in design
   practice, but can be predicted using the framework shown here, which can
   form the basis for a digital twin that monitors the through-life
   integrity of a plate anchor.},

Title = {Effect of Printing Temperature on Mechanical and Viscoelastic Properties

Abstract = {Material extrusion (ME) is one of the additive manufacturing methods and
   widely used to produce polymer-based parts. Thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU) is a relatively new material in ME. It has microdomains consisting
   of hard segments (HS) and soft segments (SS) in varying proportions.
   This structural complexity and weak interactions between HS and SS cause
   the properties of TPUs to become very sensitive to processing parameters
   such as temperature. In this study, the effect of printing temperature
   in a range of 170-250 degrees C on the physical, mechanical, and
   viscoelastic properties of ultra-flexible TPU (Shore A 60) samples was
   investigated. Furthermore, to elucidate the effect of the manufacturing
   method, a sample prepared by compression molding (CM) at 230 degrees C
   was used. Thermal transitions of the samples were analyzed by DSC.
   Increasing T-g values were observed in correlation with increased
   printing temperature. A relation between T-g and hardness values was
   thus established. In order to observe molecular weight (M) changes after
   printing, zero shear viscosities (eta(0)) of polymer solutions were
   examined and preserved M values up to 200 degrees C were detected.
   Mechanical properties of the samples were analyzed through tensile
   tests. Among the samples including CM, the highest tensile strength and
   elongation at break were 37.6 MPa and 921\%, respectively, which was
   detected for the sample printed at 230 degrees C. Oscillation tests
   revealed that both entanglements and HS content influence storages
   modulus (G `). Among the printed parts, highest G ` value was measured
   at 220 degrees C printing temperature. This result was attributed to the
   synergistic effect of entanglement and HS. Furthermore, it is concluded
   that chain alignment has greater contribution on mechanical properties
   than M, whereas viscoelastic properties is more sensitive to M.},

Title = {Macrobenthic diversity response to the atlantification of the Arctic
   Ocean (Fram Strait, 79?N) - A taxonomic and functional trait approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This is the first study presenting temporal changes of the macrofauna
   biodiversity along the bathymetric gradient from the shelf to abyssal
   depths in the eastern Fram Striat. In this region, between 2004 and
   2008, a significant increase in surface water temperature was observed
   due to the transport of Atlantic water from lower latitudes and was
   defined as a Warm Water Anomaly (WWA). Effects of the WWA in the eastern
   Fram Strait were observed across the entire food web, from the pelagic
   to the deep seafloor. The material for our study was collected before
   (in 2000) and after the WWA (in 2010 and 2017) at station depths ranging
   from 203 m to 5561 m. Samples of macrofauna and surface sediments were
   collected with use of a box corer to analyze species composition and
   functional traits, and environmental characteristics in sediments. We
   explore the influence of environmental changes on the structure (species
   composition and diversity) and functioning (functional trait composition
   and diversity) of macrofauna communities. An increase of primary
   production in surface waters during and after the WWA was reflected in a
   higher food availability at the seafloor from shelf to abyssal depths.
   Warming induced environmental changes led to an increase of macrofauna
   density and taxonomic diversity at all water depths. Macrofauna species
   composition significantly changed after the WWA. At all study sites,
   macrofauna functional diversity increased after the warm period.
   Functional trait composition changed significantly along the
   bathy-metric transect. Despite changes in the taxonomic composition,
   macrofauna communities at the shallowest stations showed high functional
   redundancy, i.e., trait composition remained unchanged after the WWA. At
   water depths below 1500 m, where functional redundancy was significantly
   lower, functional trait composition changed significantly after the WWA.
   Our results suggest that macrofauna communities on the shelves are more
   resistant to environmental changes compared to deep-sea assemblages in
   the eastern Fram Strait.},

Abstract = {Ongoing climate change is manifesting in the expansion of the urban heat
   island (UHI) effect. This paper evaluates the microclimate benefits of
   cool pavements and green infrastructures in a historical square in Rome,
   Italy. The ENVI-Met software enabled us to conduct a microclimatic
   analysis of the examined square in July 2021, through a comparison of
   the thermal performances of the current asphalt and sampietrini pavement
   (AS) with three alternatives. The proposed options are to change the
   existing layout to include: light concrete slabs and green furniture
   consisting of 5 m high trees (LC+G1), a perimeter hedge with 5 m high
   trees (LC+G2), and a perimeter hedge with 15 m high trees (LC+G3). The
   effects of the road pavements as passive countermeasures to the UHI
   effect are investigated in terms of air temperature (AT), mean radiant
   temperature (MRT), and predicted mean vote (PMV). The results show that
   the existing asphalt pavement is the worst option, while the cool
   pavement integrated with vegetation is greatly beneficial to human
   thermal comfort. Compared to the current layout, LC+G3 is the best
   scenario, because it implies an AT reduction higher than 3 degrees C, a
   MRT reduction equal to 50\%, and a maximum PMV value equal to 2.2.},

Abstract = {King George Island is an extremely natural valuable area in which took
   place and still takes a lot of research expeditions. There is therefore
   a real need for efficient and effective management of this area, as well
   as the coordination of research carried out by scientists of many
   specialties while protecting the fragile ecosystem of the island. These
   conditions prompted the authors to create a concept of geographic
   information system for the island, which meets the above mentioned
   requirements. The article is an attempt to create the concept and
   prototype of geographic information system for King George Island (South
   Shetland Islands archipelago). The work was preceded by an inventory of
   available spatial data from different sources - field measurements,
   maps, archival and latest satellite data, aerial photos, orthophotomaps
   and digital terrain models. All data have been integrated, stored in a
   database and shared by a geoportal using ArcGIS for Server software. The
   basic spatial databases and feature classes to be included in the system
   have been identified. The proposed concept is the beginning of work on
   the construction of a fully functional geographic information system for
   King George Island, which will be developed according to the needs of
   users.},

Title = {Large seasonal variation in phytoplankton production in the Amundsen Sea},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {319-331},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To better estimate annual primary production in the Amundsen Sea, which
   is one of the highest productivity regions in the Southern Ocean, the
   seasonal variations in carbon and nitrogen uptake rates of phytoplankton
   were investigated in this study. Based on C-13-N-15 dual isotope tracer
   techniques, the average daily productivities for the Amundsen polynya
   (AP), Pine Island polynya (PIP) and non-polynya regions were 0.25, 0.16
   and 0.12 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The average daily uptake rates
   of total nitrogen were 60.2, 53.5 and 34.8 mg N m(-2) day(-1) for the
   AP, PIP and non-polynya stations, respectively. In spite of the high
   concentration of nitrate in the Amundsen Sea, daily nitrate uptake rates
   (mean +/- A SD = 0.02 +/- A 0.01 g N m(-2) day(-1)) were lower than
   ammonium uptakes for all productivity stations in this study, which
   resulted in a significantly lower f-ratio (mean +/- A SD = 0.44 +/- A
   0.24) than that (mean +/- A SD = 0.71 +/- A 0.15) of the previous year.
   The substantially lower uptake rates of carbon and nitrogen and the
   f-ratio, especially in the AP, are due to a large seasonal variation in
   the uptake rates mainly caused by the shorter daytime duration and
   partly due to lower light availability induced by deeper mixed
   conditions in the present study compared with the previous study in
   2010/2011. The large seasonal variation in daily phytoplankton
   production should be considered to better estimate annual production as
   a basic food source for higher trophic levels in the Amundsen Sea.},

Title = {Incorporating Ocean Wave Spectrum Information in Short-Term Free-Surface
   Elevation Forecasting},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {401-414},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Real-time prediction of free-surface elevation or wave excitation force
   is necessary for a variety of applications, including noncausal optimal
   control of wave energy converters and detection of quiescent periods for
   offshore operations. Prediction methods can use past measurements at the
   point of interest, treating the wave elevation as a time series (looking
   backward). Alternatively, wave elevation values can be recorded at a set
   of locations about the point of interest and propagated in time and
   space through physical or statistical models (looking forward). In this
   paper, assuming Gaussian waves, a unified framework is proposed, which
   treats any combination of wave elevation values at various points in
   time and space as a Gaussian vector and covers both ``backward{''} and
   ``forward{''} approaches. It is shown that, using any given combination
   of measurement points in time and space, the optimal predictor, in a
   least mean square sense, is linear for any time horizon and can be
   directly derived from the wave spectrum, provided that the latter is
   known. The associated error can be readily calculated, thus providing,
   based on the wave spectrum, an upper bound on the predictability of the
   wave elevation process. In addition, the applicability of the
   spectrum-based predictor to real-time wave elevation forecasting is
   discussed.},

Year = {2000},
Volume = {171},

Pages = {217-228},
Abstract = {The Amadeus Segment which falls within the Oceanic Anoxic Event Ic, is a
   composite stratigraphic interval of late Albian age, composed by
   frequent alternation of black shales characterised by organic carbon
   content usually lower than 1 \% and carbonate-richer sediments.
   Geochemical and clay mineral signatures indicate a coarser grain size
   for the black shales, and geochemical data from literature indicate a
   continental origin of the organic matter.
   Most of the geochemical variables analyzed show a record which follows
   an orbital cyclicity, with the exception of Mn and Ba, whose mobility
   after burial was identified by independent compositional criteria; The
   spectral analysis succeeded in identifying such compositional
   peculiarities, and also enabled to correlate the Amadeus Segment with
   the Segment-1 of the nearby Piobbico Core.
   The Milankovitch cyclicity (low eccentricity and obliquity) deeply
   affects the sedimentation of the Amadeus Segment, because orbital
   frequencies characterize the distribution of foraminiferal and
   compositional variables, which are both controlled by organic
   productivity and by detrital supply (dilution effect excluded).
   The high frequency changes from carbonate-rich layers to black shales
   are interpreted as changes in oceanographic regimes which in turn caused
   variations in the dispersal regime of continental inputs and in
   productivity.},

Abstract = {Dojran Lake located in south-eastern part of the Balkan is shared by
   Macedonia and Greece. This valuable water body and its ecosystem are
   vulnerable both to climate and anthropogenic impacts. Within the period
   1988-2002, the Dojran Lake water level decreased seriously (6 m) and the
   littoral zone of the lake became dry. This water level decline together
   with the simultaneous water quality deterioration resulted in a
   biodiversity diminish and plankton reduction. The attack on the
   ecosystem had a harmful impact on the economy in the region. In the last
   decade, the water increasing trend of the lake water level has been
   observed. How much the lake is impacted by natural climatic causes, and
   how much by human activities in the watershed, is a question that cannot
   be answered easily. The main obstacle for Dojran Lake sustainable water
   resources management is the fact that there is no exchange of data and
   information between Greece and Macedonia. Hydrological analysis is
   obtained using data measured for the period 1951-2010 at the
   meteorological and hydrological Nov Dojran gauging stations located on
   the Macedonian side. The aim of the paper is stimulation of a close
   international interdisciplinary monitoring and cooperation. Of crucial
   importance is to facilitate the free and unrestricted exchange of data
   and information, products and services in real and non-real time on
   matters relating to the safety and security of society, economic welfare
   and the protection of Dojran Lake environment.},

Abstract = {Hornby's Storm Petrel Oceanodroma hornbyi is endemic to the Humboldt
   Current Region. Historically, little has been known about the location
   of the species' breeding sites or the size of its population. For these
   reasons, this species has been classified as `Data Deficient' by IUCN,
   and it is difficult to know whether the species is threatened, and if
   so, what conservation actions may be necessary. As part of the project
   `Golondrinas del Desierto' a search for the colonies of this species
   began in November 2013. It was known that the species breeds in the
   Atacama Desert, because some mummified individuals had been found there,
   and fledglings attracted by lights whilst on their way to the sea were
   found in nearby coastal cities. In this paper, we describe the first
   breeding site discovered for this species. This breeding location is 75
   km from the shoreline, at 1100 meters above sea level, in the centre of
   the Atacama Desert, also known as the `absolute desert'. However, there
   is strong anthropogenic pressure on this desert due to the development
   of mines and solar energy projects. To protect these birds, it is
   important to estimate the breeding population size of the colony, search
   for new colonies and assess the threats to each of them, and to evaluate
   how many fledglings are drawn off course by lights into cities and
   industrial sites and how many die there.},

Title = {THE INFLUENCE OF ISLAND AND MAINLAND LAKESHORE LANDSCAPES ON BOREAL
   FOREST-FIRE REGIMES},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {72},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1980-1992},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In order to characterize the fire regime of the southern boreal forest
   and to understand the way in which landscape and fire regime interact, a
   detailed study of fire history was undertaken in two adjacent
   contrasting landscapes in northwestern Quebec. The fire history for the
   islands of Lake Duparquet was reconstructed and compared to that of the
   surrounding lakeshore. Fire occurrence was determined by archival search
   and by collection of information from fire scars. Dendroecological
   techniques were used to determine years of stand initiation on the
   lakeshore and for a subsample of the islands. Stand initiation data were
   used to estimate fire frequency, fire cycle, and fire intensity (lethal
   and non-lethal fires). Tree composition and surficial deposits were
   sampled in order to assess the possible effect of topography and forest
   cover on fire frequency.
   Dated fire scars (n = 273) revealed 82 fire years, with the earliest
   dated to 1593. Islands experienced more fire years (56) than the
   lakeshore (37), and fire years were uncorrelated. Most (72\%) of the
   lakeshore stands were initiated by a few large fires (eight), whereas
   the fire size on islands was variable, ranging from < 10\% to 100\% of
   the total surface of the island. Despite these differences in fire
   regime, fire occurrence and fire frequency decreased concurrently on the
   islands and the lakeshore starting almost-equal-to 120 yr ago. The
   lakeshore fire cycle was 63 yr before 1870 and 99 yr since 1870, whereas
   the fire cycle on the islands was slightly longer (74 yr and 112 yr)
   during the same intervals. The long-term decrease in fire frequency of
   both the lakeshore and the islands was possibly driven by climatic
   change.
   Fire frequency was generally similar for all surficial deposits and fuel
   types on the lakeshore, whereas fires were more abundant in pine
   woodland growing on bedrock on the islands. Lakeshore fires were
   generally of lethal intensity, whereas both a long cycle of lethal fires
   and a shorter cycle of non-lethal fires were observed on 50\% of the
   islands. The morphology and location of islands with both types of fires
   suggest that a higher frequency of lightning strikes resulted in a
   regime characterized by more frequent fires and fires of variable
   intensity. The specific fire regime observed in the island landscape may
   be the cause of the abundance of pines, whose presence may contribute,
   in turn, to the continuation of this regime of less intense and more
   frequent fires.
   We suggest that fire regime in the boreal forest is controlled by
   long-term climate change at the regional scale, and by a strong
   interaction with landscape at the local scale, both components having a
   great impact on the distribution and the dynamics of boreal vegetation.},

Abstract = {The seawater source heat pump (SWHP) utilizes low-grade energy from
   seawater to satisfy heating/cooling requirements of coastal buildings.
   Compared with the open-loop SWHP system, the closed-loop system is more
   stable and reliable when used in cold regions because the seawater heat
   exchanger can mitigate icing and corrosion problems. This study
   established mathematical modeling for the seawater heat exchanger, which
   was validated by the experimental results, to estimate the heat transfer
   performance. The thermal performance of the seawater heat exchanger
   under different operating conditions was predicted, and the effects of
   several key parameters on thermal resistance were analyzed. The results
   revealed that the pipe wall thermal resistance of the original heat
   exchanger was the most important factor limiting the heat transfer.
   Hence, a cost analysis of the heat exchangers with different pipe
   materials was conducted, and the steel pipe with anticorrosive coating
   was proven to be optimal in reducing pipe wall thermal resistance and
   economy. The findings are useful in designing and optimizing the
   seawater heat exchanger and promoting the application of ocean thermal

Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {2277-2290},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The seasonal variation and spatial distribution of atmospheric particles
   at three islands in the Taiwan Strait were investigated. Atmospheric
   particles (PM10) were collected at three offshore islands (i.e., Kinmen
   islands, Matsu islands, and Penghu Islands) and two coastal regions
   (i.e., Xiamen and Fuzhou) in the years of 2008-2012. Field sampling
   results indicated that the average PM10 concentrations at the Kinmen
   islands were generally higher than other sampling sites, suggesting that
   a superimposition phenomenon was regularly observed during the air
   pollution episodes at Kinmen Islands and Xiamen region. PM10 samples
   were analyzed for their chemical composition, including water-soluble
   ions, metallic elements, and carbonaceous content. The most abundant
   water-soluble ionic species of PM10 were recognized as SO42-, NO3-, and
   NH4+, indicating that PM10 was mainly composed of secondary inorganic
   aerosols. Although natural crustal elements dominated the metallic
   content of PM10, the most abundant anthropogenic metals of PM10 were Zn
   and Pb. Enrichment factor calculations showed that Ni, Cr, and Zn were
   the enriched elements emitted mainly from anthropogenic sources.
   Moreover, the OC concentration of PM10 was always higher than that of EC
   at all sampling sites. High OC/EC ratios of PM10 were commonly observed
   at the sampling sites on the Matsu Islands, the Fuzhou region, and the
   Penghu Islands. Source apportionment results indicated that vehicular
   exhausts were the main source of PM10, and followed by industrial
   boilers, secondary aerosols, soil dusts, biomass burning, petrochemical
   plants, steel plants, oceanic spray, and cement plants at the island and
   coastal sampling sites in the Taiwan Strait.},

Title = {Interactive effects of soil amendments (biochar and gypsum) and salinity
   on ammonia volatilization in coastal saline soil},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {190},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ammonia (NH3) volatilization is a major route of nitrogen (N) loss from
   soil, especially in saline soil. Biochar and gypsum are two important
   soil amendments that are widely used in coastal saline farmland.
   However, little is known about the interactive effects of soil
   amendments and salinity on NH3 volatilization. In this study, five soil
   salinity levels, three N sources (urea, monoammonium phosphate (MAP),
   and manure) and two soil amendments (biochar and gypsum, both applied at
   two rates) were selected to conduct incubation experiments. Nitrogen
   transformation experiments were conducted simultaneously with NH3
   volatilization experiments. The results showed that cumulative NH3
   volatilization increased with salinity due to the accumulation of
   ammonium, which resulted from the inhibition of nitrification by
   salinity, and also the effect of salinity on soil properties related to
   NH3 volatilization. Among the tested N sources, the highest NH3
   volatilization was observed for urea, followed by MAP and manure, in
   soils with three different salinity levels. Biochar application
   increased NH3 volatilization in saline soil, as salt ions constrained
   the NH3/NH(4)(+ )adsorption capacity of biochar, and the inhibition of
   nitrification by biochar was aggravated in saline soil. Overall, NH3
   volatilization increased with the biochar application rate in saline
   soil, whereas the effect of a low rate of biochar application on NH3
   volatilization was not significant. Gypsum decreased NH 3 volatilization
   in saline soil, whereas the contribution of different gypsum rates to
   NH3 volatilization showed no difference. The conclusion could be drawn
   from the above results that low rates of biochar and gypsum may prevent
   or reduce NH3 volatilization and nitrogen losses in coastal saline soil.},

Title = {Density dependence and marine bird populations: are wind farm
   assessments precautionary?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1406-1414},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Although density-dependent regulation of population growth is thought
   to be relatively widespread in nature, density-independent models are
   often used to project the population response to drivers of change. Such
   models are often considered to provide a maximum estimate of mortality
   and therefore offer a precautionary approach to impact assessment.
   However, this perception assumes that density dependence operates as
   compensatory (negative density dependence), and overlooks that other
   forms of density dependence, such as depensation (positive density
   dependence), would generate a contrasting population response.
   2. Currently, there is debate about including density-dependent
   mechanisms in models that assess the impact of offshore wind farms on
   marine bird populations. Density dependence is considered poorly
   understood for this group of species. Consequently, it is either
   excluded from assessments, or incorporated in a compensatory form that
   has little empirical validation.
   3. We reviewed the evidence for compensatory and depensatory regulation
   of 31 marine bird species, and conducted a meta-analysis to examine the
   functional shape of density-dependent population growth. The evidence
   was also evaluated in relation to established species-specific indices
   of wind farm vulnerability in order to assess whether compensatory
   mechanisms are likely to offset losses associated with collision or
   displacement.
   4. Compensatory regulation was reported across all of the demographic
   processes and focal groups considered, and was attributed to a variety
   of causal mechanisms. The strength of compensatory population growth
   appeared consistent between colonies; however, the regulation of
   productivity was highly context-dependent with a similar number of
   studies reporting compensatory, depensatory and insignificant effects.
   Depensation was consistently attributed to increased rates of predation
   at lower population densities.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that among marine bird
   species with high vulnerability to wind farms, compensatory regulation
   is unlikely to offset large and sustained losses from the breeding
   population. In addition, depensation has the potential to accelerate
   population declines and generate local or regional extinctions,
   especially in smaller colonial species. Consequently,
   density-independent models will not offer a consistently precautionary
   approach for assessing the potential impact of wind farms on marine bird
   populations. Instead, assessments should examine the potential
   population response using a range of density-dependent structures.},

Title = {Observed Basin-Scale Response of the North Atlantic Meridional
   Overturning Circulation to Wind Stress Forcing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2029-2054},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The response of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
   (MOC) to wind stress forcing is investigated from an observational
   standpoint, using four time series of overturning transports below and
   relative to 1000 m, overlapping by 3.6 yr. These time series are derived
   from four mooring arrays located on the western boundary of the North
   Atlantic: the RAPID Western Atlantic Variability Experiment (WAVE) array
   (42.5 degrees N), the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Line W array
   (39 degrees N), RAPID-MOC/MOCHA (26.5 degrees N), and the Meridional
   Overturning Variability Experiment (MOVE) array (16 degrees N). Using
   modal decompositions of the analytic cross-correlation between
   transports and wind stress, the basin-scale wind stress is shown to
   significantly drive the MOC coherently at four latitudes, on the time
   scales available for this study. The dominant mode of covariance is
   interpreted as rapid barotropic oceanic adjustments to wind stress
   forcing, eventually forming two counterrotating Ekman overturning cells
   centered on the tropics and subtropical gyre. A second mode of
   covariance appears related to patterns of wind stress and wind stress
   curl associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, spinning anomalous
   horizontal circulations that likely interact with topography to form
   overturning cells.},

Title = {An Integrated Approach to Study the Morphodynamics of the Lignano Tidal
   Inlet},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The morphological evolution of a tidal inlet is the combined result of
   tides and wind waves, which interact in a non-linear manner and over
   very different time-scales. Likewise, the presence of maritime
   structures built in the vicinity of the tidal inlet, for coastal or port
   defense or to stabilize the inlet itself, can greatly affect this
   dynamic equilibrium, changing erosional and depositional patterns of the
   adjacent shoreline. In this study, the narrowing phenomenon of the
   Lignano tidal inlet subsequent to the construction of the related port,
   is examined through an integrated approach in order to propose and
   verify a possible form of evolution. This approach is the result of the
   combination of three methods: the historical reconstruction of the
   shifting of the coastline, an empirical scheme which describes the
   qualitative morphology of a mixed-energy tidal inlet, and a
   process-based morphodynamic modeling, which adopts a bi-dimensional
   depth averaged (2DH) approach. The application of numerical modeling has
   required the definition of a reduced input set of data representing an
   average year, in particular for wind and tidal conditions, including the
   meteorological component. The magnitude and the directions of the
   simulated dominant sediment transport are coherent with real processes
   both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view.},

Abstract = {Identifying and quantifying the importance of environmental variables in
   structuring population genetic variation can help inform management
   decisions for conservation, restoration, or reforestation purposes, in
   both current and future environmental conditions. Landscape genomics
   offers a powerful approach for understanding the environmental factors
   that currently associate with genetic variation, and given those
   associations, where populations may be most vulnerable under future
   environmental change. Here, we applied genotyping by sequencing to
   generate over 11,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 311 trees and
   then used nonlinear, multivariate environmental association methods to
   examine spatial genetic structure and its association with environmental
   variation in an ecologically and economically important tree species
   endemic to Hawaii, Acacia koa. Admixture and principal components
   analyses showed that trees from different islands are genetically
   distinct in general, with the exception of some genotypes that match
   other islands, likely as the result of recent translocations. Gradient
   forest and generalized dissimilarity models both revealed a strong
   association between genetic structure and mean annual rainfall.
   Utilizing a model for projected future climate on the island of Hawaii,
   we show that predicted changes in rainfall patterns may result in
   genetic offset, such that trees no longer may be genetically matched to
   their environment. These findings indicate that knowledge of current and
   future rainfall gradients can provide valuable information for the
   conservation of existing populations and also help refine seed transfer
   guidelines for reforestation or replanting of koa throughout the state.},

Abstract = {We have analyzed two recently acquired multi-channel seismic profiles
   across the Reed Bank area, South China Sea. A detailed seismic
   interpretation coupled with drilling data has proved the occurrence of a
   wide carbonate platform, developed between the Late Oligocene and the
   Early Miocene (32-20 Ma). The top of these carbonates is an important
   regional unconformity, corresponding to a strong and continuous seismic
   reflector. An age of about 20 Ma is inferred for this reflector, acting
   as a regional unconformity marking the cessation of seafloor spreading
   with an erosional/non-depositional hiatus, spanning 3 or 4 m.y. The time
   interval during which the carbonate platforms formed is concurrent with
   the opening of the South China Sea. The reconstruction of the tectonic
   subsidence in this area has shown a decrease in rate of subsidence
   during the drifting stage (32-17 Ma), indicating that the whole Reed
   Bank area was in a tectonically stable and shallow water environment for
   more than 10 m.y., favoring the development of shallow water carbonates.
   With a sharply increased subsidence rate after the end of spreading (17
   Ma) and a continuously increased sea level, the carbonate platforms were
   drowned and died, except some structural highs with reef buildups, where
   the carbonate sedimentation continued to Middle Miocene. We suggest that
   delayed tectonic subsidence in Reed Bank area might have been related to
   a secondary mantle convection under the rift lasting more than about 10
   m.y.},

Abstract = {Viruses play a key role in controlling the population dynamics of algae,
   including Emiliania huxleyi, a globally distributed haptophyte with
   calcite coccoliths that comprise ca. 50\% of the sinking carbonate flux
   from the surface ocean. Emiliania huxleyi viruses (EhVs) routinely
   infect and terminate E. huxleyi blooms. EhVs are surrounded by a lipid
   envelope, which we found to be comprised largely of glycosphingolipids
   (GSLs) with lesser amounts of polar glycerolipids. Infection appears to
   involve membrane fusion between the virus and host, and we hypothesized
   that specific polar lipids may facilitate virus attachment. We
   identified three novel intact polar lipids in E. huxleyi strain CCMP 374
   and EhV86, including a GSL with a monosaccharide sialic acid headgroup
   (sGSL); for all 11 E. huxleyi strains we tested, there was a direct
   relationship between sGSL content and sensitivity to infection by EhV1,
   EhV86 and EhV163. In mesocosms, the E. huxleyi population with greatest
   initial sGSL content had the highest rate of virus-induced mortality. We
   propose potential physiological roles for sGSL that would be beneficial
   for growth but leave cells susceptible to infection, thus furthering the
   discussion of Red Queen-based co-evolution and the cost(s) of
   sensitivity and resistance in the dynamic E. huxleyi-EhV system.},

Abstract = {During the last two decades the fast developments in the fields of data
   acquisition, monitoring and operational modelling led to new
   technological approaches, which extended and improved the capabilities
   of the recent generation of operational systems. Some ten years ago
   mainframe computers were needed to nm even simple mathematical models.
   Nowadays, huge mathematical models can be operated on desktop PCs.
   Forecast models for coastal waters can provide assistance in developing
   management concepts, compatible with sustainable development and with
   the preservation of ecosystems integrity. These models must be
   complemented by continuous monitoring systems supported by efficient
   databases. These integrated systems, if used in a regular basis by local
   authorities, can help them to achieve important improvements in coastal
   management practice (including risk assessment).
   The concepts described above are being used in the Tagus estuary in the
   framework of different projects (e.g. OPCOM, EUROSAM). A fully 3D
   mathematical model, able to simulate hydrodynamics and water quality,
   supported by field data and a web database, is being used. The model is
   used to simulate management scenarios (e.g. consequences of new demands,
   reasons for the present problems) and also to decide when and where
   field measurements should be done. These simulations also contribute to
   a better understanding of the system.
   This paper describes the modelling system being used and some results of
   selected simulations.},

Abstract = {Land subsidence is not a new phenomenon for Semarang. Some report said
   the subsidence in Semarang probably is occurring for more than 100
   years. Based on the leveling surveys conducted by the Centre of
   Environmental Geology from 1999 to 2003 it was found that relatively
   large subsidence was detected around Semarang Harbor, Pondok Hasanuddin,
   Bandar Harjo and around Semarang Tawang Railway station, with the rates
   ranging from 1 to 17 cm/year. Results derived from GPS show that land
   subsidence in Semarang has spatial and temporal variations. In general,
   subsidence rates in Semarang have an average rate of about 6 to 7
   cm/year, with maximum rates that can go up to 14-19 cm/year at certain
   locations. The impact of land subsidence in Semarang can be seen in
   several forms, such as the wider expansion of (coastal) flooding areas
   ``rob{''}, cracking of buildings and infrastructure, and increased
   inland sea water intrusion. It also badly influences the quality and
   amenity of the living environment and life (e.g. health and sanitation
   condition) in the affected areas. In the case of Semarang, adaptation
   and mitigation are considered very important. We have been done some
   investigations to this area by field observations (mapping the flooded
   area, mapping the infrastructure problems, interviewing people and
   seeing the adaptations, conduct GPS measurement to see deformation,
   etc.), gather information from Government, from digital media, etc., and
   we noticed people increased their house, and the local goverment
   elevated the road and the bridge, etc. regulary over less decade periode
   as part of adaptation. We also noticed the Central Goverment built the
   dyke and pumping station. Our conclusions said that the adaptation only
   made temporaly since significant land subsidence keep coming and
   worsening by the sea level which is keep rising. Another conclusion, so
   far we have seen lack of mitigation program, monitoring or even
   inevective mitigation in Semarang related to this subsidence issue.},

Abstract = {In order to be able to simulate long-term climate, it is necessary to
   model the evolution of both the atmospheric and hydrological variables
   in their fundamentally two-way interactive setting and to model the
   significant heterogeneity of land surface characteristics. A two-way
   feedback mode and the heterogeneity in a computational mesh are
   important keys to stable and realistic simulation. The coupling based on
   areally-averaged conservation equations was applied to a regional-scale
   atmospheric model for the main islands of Japan. Atmospheric-hydro
   logical processes observed at Tsukuba station were compared with their
   counterparts simulated by the coupled model with a 20 x 20 km(2)
   resolution for the January 1989 historical period. The results of this
   comparison are quite satisfactory. Then, the model of Japan was run to
   simulate the climate change over Japan under the scenario of the
   doubling Of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Social learning, learning from others, has value in extending knowledge
   about farm management through networks of growers. Exactly how much
   value depends on the structure of the networks. We employed social
   network analysis to study knowledge networks and social learning in
   three American Viticulture Areas in California: Central Coast, Lodi and
   Napa Valley. In a survey, growers confirmed that experiential and social
   learning are more useful for accessing information about farm management
   than formal learning. UC Agriculture and Natural Resources Cooperative
   Extension (UCCE) was found to be well positioned to access and spread
   knowledge through the grower networks but a bottleneck exists - many
   knowledge-sharing relationships and relatively few staff. We also found
   that grower participation in traditional outreach activities, e.g.,
   meetings and demonstrations, is a strong predictor of their number of
   knowledge-sharing relationships, so UCCE and other agricultural support
   organizations have an important role to play in strengthening networks.
   Several network-smart extension strategies might help alleviate the
   bottleneck and rewire networks to more efficiently connect those with
   questions to those with solutions.},

Title = {Shifting fish distributions impact predation intensity in a sub-Arctic
   ecosystem},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An abundance of studies in marine systems have documented species range
   shifts in response to climate change, and many more have used species
   distribution models to project species ranges under future conditions.
   However, there is increasing interest in moving beyond a single-species
   focus to understand how species redistribution alters ecosystem dynamics
   via changes in trophic interactions. We employed spatiotemporal models
   to characterize decadal-scale changes in spatial overlap between the
   distribution of juvenile walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus and the
   distributions of four of its groundfish predators: arrowtooth flounder
   Atheresthes stomias, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, Pacific halibut
   Hippoglossus stenolepis and adult walleye pollock. These fishes
   represent ecologically and commercially important species in a rapidly
   changing sub-Arctic ecosystem, the eastern Bering Sea, Alaska, USA. We
   then examined whether changes in spatial overlap corresponded to changes
   in predation, using spatiotemporal models of predator stomach contents.
   We found marked shifts in spatial overlap between juvenile pollock and
   two predators (arrowtooth flounder and Pacific halibut) over 34 years,
   with changes in overlap corresponding to increases in population-scale
   predation pressure. By contrast, we did not find clear relationships
   between spatial overlap and predation for Pacific cod and adult pollock,
   the two predators for which juvenile pollock constitute a much smaller
   diet proportion. Our findings highlight the complexity of predicting
   predation dynamics for generalist marine species and suggest a need for
   better process-based methods for understanding the potential future
   ecological impacts of coupled species range shifts. However, simple
   metrics of spatial overlap between relatively specialized predators and
   their prey offer promise as a means to integrate predictions from
   species distribution models into ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

Title = {Global trends analysis of the main vegetation types throughout the past
   four decades},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {184-195},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In remote sensing studies, the photosynthetically active radiation
   absorbed by chlorophyll in the green leaves of vegetation canopies is
   measured using Red and Near-Infra Red bands. The Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the most commonly used vegetation
   indices that are generally obtained from a calculation of the above
   mentioned bands; it presents a decent surrogate measures of the
   physiologically functioning surface greenness level. In this study, the
   latest version of the GIMMS NDVI data set, between the period of January
   1982 and December 2015, were used to classify the global vegetation
   areas into five main categories (i.e. Agriculture Areas, Boreal Forests,
   Deciduous Forests, Evergreen and Tropical Forests, and Other
   Vegetation), using a simple and straight-forward method of
   classification, sumamed Global Vegetation Types Classification (GVTC).
   The total accuracy of the model reached 90.4\% with a kappa value of
   87.1\%.
   In each category, a trend analysis has been carried out at both global
   and continental levels. The objective was to highlight the changes
   within each category, throughout the past thirty-four years. Results
   show that Agriculture Areas are increasing worldwide, with a huge
   upsurge observed since 2011 coinciding with a remarkable decrease in
   Boreal Forests. Changes in vegetation's classes, between 1982 and 2015,
   were more pronounceable in continents such as Asia, America and Africa;
   Europe and Oceania showed limited variations throughout this same
   period. Following these results, regional policies should be reformed
   and mitigation plans should be established in order to maintain a
   sustainable development of the global vegetation lands. The GVTC could
   be implemented with higher spatial resolution imageries for more
   local-based assessments.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {203-221},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A decade of observation in South San Francisco Bay demonstrates that
   estuarine phytoplankton biomass fluctuates at the time scale of days to
   weeks, and that much of this variability is associated with fluctuations
   in tidal energy.  During the spring seasons of every year from
   1980-1990, episodic blooms occurred in which phytoplankton biomass rose
   from a baseline of 2-4 mg chlorophyll a m-3, peaked at 20-40 mg
   chlorophyll a m-3, and then returned to baseline values, all within
   several weeks.  Each episode of biomass increase occurred during neap
   tides, and each bloom decline coincided with spring tides.  This
   suggests that daily variations in the rate of vertical mixing by tidal
   stirring might control phytoplankton bloom dynamics in some estuaries.
   Simulation experiments with a numerical model of phytoplankton
   population dynamics support this hypothesis.  The model incorporates
   biological processes (light-dependent growth, zooplankton grazing,
   benthic grazing) and physical processes (sinking, vertical mixing) as
   controls on the biomass distribution of phytoplankton in a 10-m water
   column.  Numerical simulations indicate that phytoplankton dynamics are
   highly sensitive to the rate of vertical mixing (parameterized as an
   eddy diffusivity K(z)), such that biomass increases rapidly at small
   K(z) (5 m2 d-1), but not at large K(z) (50 m2 d-1).  Cyclic variation of
   K(z) between 5 and 50 over a 14-d period (simulated neap-spring cycle)
   yields simulation results that are similar to bloom events observed in
   this estuary.},

Abstract = {Wave glider harvests the abundant ocean wave energy for long term ocean
   cruising due to its particular two-part architecture. Its submerged part
   named glider converts vertical fluctuation of waves to horizontally
   forward propulsion. Because of the uncertainty of the ocean condition
   and irregularity of its wave motion, the design parameters of the
   submerged glider vary in a confined range in the state of art design
   models. In order to indicate the hydrodynamic characteristics and
   summarize the dynamic law of the submerged glider with different design
   parameters, this paper concentrates on three critical design details:
   profile of the wings, interval space of the arrayed multiple flapping
   wings and maximum rotating angle of wings, and performs the
   corresponding CFD analysis. Finally, we conclude that the lift curve of
   NACA0006 and plate profile is almost the same with small waves at sea,
   but NACA0006 profile can generate much larger forward lift than the
   plate profile with seawater velocity up to 0.5m/s; Decreasing space of
   intermittent causes more obvious decrement of forward lift while space
   of intermittent overpasses the inflection point at 20cm; With the
   decrement of the maximum rotating angle, the forward lift occurs to take
   a sharp decline if the angle strides the inflection point.},

Abstract = {In Normandy, the marine macroalgae become a large problem when the
   retreat of the tide leaves large quantities of stranded seaweed on
   coast. These stranded seaweeds can be toxic during their degradation in
   addition to creating odor problems. Consequently, their elimination has
   become a major problem and their recovery an emergency. In this work, we
   proposed to use the stranded seaweed in the building construction at a
   large scale. We investigated in particular the performance of insulated
   walls based on lightened earth incorporating reed and stranded Laminaria
   digitata seaweed at different substitution level. The compressive
   strength and the hygrothermal properties of the earth insulated walls
   specimens were carried out. Our results show that the incorporation of
   seaweed in lightened earth improves both its heat storage capacity and
   its level of insulation without compromising its compressive strength.
   The most efficient seaweed content for improving the thermal insulation
   of the material seems to be 20\%. Indeed, the addition of 20\% of
   Laminaria digitata decreased the thermal conductivity by 34\% at 20
   degrees C in comparison with standard cob. For this mixture, the
   specific heat capacity value is around 800 J.kg- 1.K-1 at 20 degrees C,
   which are very high compared to that of the only earth-fiber specimen
   (400 J. kg-1.K-1). These increases in mechanical and hygrothermal
   performance of insulating cob material incorporating seaweed will lead
   to a reduction of the cob walls thickness and therefore to the
   development of sustainable energy efficient building materials with a
   low environmental impact.},

Abstract = {Development of antifouling strategies requires knowledge of how fouling
   organisms would respond to climate change associated environmental
   stressors. Here, a calcareous tube built by the tubeworm, Hydroides
   elegans, was used as an example to evaluate the individual and
   interactive effects of ocean acidification (OA), warming and reduced
   salinity on the mechanical properties of a tube. Tubeworms produce a
   mechanically weaker tube with less resistance to simulated predator
   attack under OA (pH 7.8). Warming (29 degrees C) increased tube volume,
   tube mineral density and the tube's resistance to a simulated predatory
   attack. A weakening effect by OA did not make the removal of tubeworms
   easier except for the earliest stage, in which warming had the least
   effect. Reduced salinity (27 psu) did not affect tubes. This study
   showed that both mechanical analysis and computational modeling can be
   integrated with biofouling research to provide insights into how fouling
   communities might develop in future ocean conditions.},

Title = {Development of a MXene-based membrane with excellent anti-fouling for
   air humidification-dehumidification type desalination},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {641},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Membrane-based air humidification-dehumidification desalination (MHDD)
   is an emerging seawater desalination process that can be driven by
   low-grade, renewable energy sources; however, membrane fouling and
   wetting are key issues that hinder its practical application. In this
   study, a composite membrane using a hydrophobized MXene deposited on a
   polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) support layer was fabricated to improve
   membrane antifouling ability in seawater desalination without
   sacrificing permeability. The MXene-P
   (1H,1H,2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecyltrimethoxysilane-modified MXene)
   membrane exhibited optimal desalination performance, maintaining a water
   permeation flux of 1.88 kg m- 2 h-1, and a salt rejection of nearly
   100\%. Its permeability was close to that of a pure PVDF porous membrane
   (1.95 kg m- 2 h-1). A plausible explanation is that the porous MXene
   layer, enlarged interlayer spacing, and gaps created by the stacking of
   sheets provide multiple water transport channels, and the ultra-thin
   coating thickness minimizes the additional mass transfer resistance.
   Moreover, it was found that the performance of the MXene-P membrane
   remained stable within 120 h under actual seawater conditions, and no
   obvious contamination of the membrane surface was observed after this
   testing, which was attributed to the large water contact angle (150
   degrees) and high negative charge (-70 mV) of the coated layer. The
   maintenance of both long-term operational stability and high moisture
   permeability, with outstanding salt rejection, are essential for real
   seawater desalination driven by solar energy.},

Title = {Scheduling of Yard Truck Considering Loading and Unloading
   Simultaneously in an Underground Container Logistics System},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Abstract = {With the rapid growth of containers and scarce of land, the underground
   container logistics system (UCLS) presents a logical alternative for
   container terminals to better protect the environment and relieve
   traffic pressure. The operating efficiency of container terminals is one
   of the competitive edges over other terminals, which requires UCLS to be
   well integrated with the handling process of the storage yard. In UCLS,
   yard trucks (YTs) serve different handling points dynamically instead of
   one fixed handling point, and yard cranes (YCs) perform loading and
   unloading simultaneously. To minimize the total time of handling all
   containers in UCLS, the mixed integer programming problem is described
   and solved using an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA). The convergence
   speed and accuracy of AGA are demonstrated by comparison with
   conventional genetic algorithm (GA). Additionally, AGA and CPLEX are
   compared with different scale cases. Experimental results show that the
   proposed algorithm is superior to CPLEX in resulted solutions and
   calculation time. A sensitivity analysis is provided to obtain
   reasonable numbers of YTs for scheduling between handling points and the
   storage yard in UCLS.},

Title = {Mangrove biomass estimation in Southwest Thailand using machine learning},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Mangroves play a disproportionately large role in carbon sequestration
   relative to other tropical forest ecosystems. Accurate assessments of
   mangrove biomass at the site-scale are lacking, especially in mainland
   Southeast Asia. This study assessed tree biomass and species diversity
   within a 151 ha mangrove ecosystem on the Andaman Coast of Thailand.
   High-resolution GeoEye-1 satellite imagery, medium resolution ASTER
   satellite elevation data, field-based tree measurements, published
   allometric biomass equations, and a suite of machine learning techniques
   were used to develop spatial models of mangrove biomass. Field
   measurements derived a whole-site tree density of 1313 trees ha(-1),
   with Rhizophora spp. comprising 77.7\% of the trees across forty-five
   400 m(2) sample plots. A support vector machine regression model was
   found to be most accurate by cross-validation for predicting biomass at
   the site level. Model-estimated above-ground biomass was 250 Mg ha(-1);
   below-ground root biomass was 95 Mg ha(-1). Combined above-ground and
   below-ground biomass for the entire 151-ha stand was 345 (+/- 72.5) Mg
   ha(-1), equivalent to 155 (+/- 32.6) Mg C ha(-1). Model evaluation shows
   the model had greatest prediction error at high biomass values,
   indicating a need for allometric equations determined over a larger
   range of tree sizes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   useful ocean hydrographic observations in the climate general

   captures co-variability of these variables and strength of the MOC.
   Fingerprints of this pattern emerge clearly on time scales of 10 years
   from background noise caused by internal variability. If similar results
   are found in other climate models this will provide useful information
   for the design of an MOC observing system.},

Abstract = {A strong relationship between current vegetation and the opal phytolith
   content of surface soil was established. Opal phytoliths obtained from
   buried soil surface horizons 200-800 years old were then used to
   establish a profile of the vegetation present on four sites within
   Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA, prior to European settlement. The
   plant communities so reconstructed contained more forbs and/or shrubs
   than present-day communities and were dominated by cool-season rather
   than warm-season grasses. Although these differences could be due to
   climate change, the pattern of change from cool-season to warm-season
   grasses is not consistent with the accepted pattern of climate change.
   Grazing pressure could account for this change in plant community
   composition. Livestock tend to graze Capitol Reef in the cool season,
   and the area is rested from grazing during the warm season. This pattern
   could account for the decline in cool-season grasses. Phytolith analyses
   can serve as an alternative method for assessing the impact of
   management on grasslands. This method is particularly valuable when no
   comparable `'undisturbed'' control area exists.},

Abstract = {Sustainable management of the natural resources is influenced by
   understanding of basic ecological condition. This study aims to
   investigate distribution and diversity of seagrass ecosystem at
   Karimunjawa National Park using satellite imagery GEO-EYE and ecological
   surveys as the basis of its management. Seagrass mappings were done at
   10 locations. While ecological surveys were conducted using line and
   square transect. Satellite image interpretation results showed that
   seagrass were found scattered at several islands. The highest and the
   lowest percent cover of seagrass ecosystems were found at Krakal Kecil
   (38.64\%/6.55 ha) and Cilik (0.20\%/0.06 Ha). Diversity of seagrass was
   identified from two family, namely Hydrocharitacea and Cymodocea. The
   percentage cover of seagrass species including the highest and lowest
   were Thalassia hemprichii (11.31\%) and Thalassodendron ciliatum
   (0.01\%), respectively. The highest and lowest individual density were
   Menjangan (280 ind/m(2)) and Mrican (26 ind/m(2)), with an average of
   148 ind/m(2). The value of diversity index ranged from low to moderate,
   while the evenness index values ranged from medium to high. There is no
   dominance of particular species at the study site. The results suggest
   that there is a need to develop diversity based sustainable management
   for this marine resource.},

Abstract = {Iron (Fe) biogeochemistry is potentially of environmental significance
   in plantation-forested, subtropical coastal ecosystems where soil
   disturbance and seasonal water-logging may lead to elevation of Fe
   mobilization and associated water quality deterioration. Using
   wet-chemical extraction and laboratory cultivation, we examined the
   occurrence of Fe forms and associated bacterial populations in diverse
   soils of a representative subtropical Australian coastal catchment
   (Poona Creek). Total reactive Fe was abundant throughout 0-30 cm soil
   cores, consisting primarily of crystalline forms in well-drained sand
   soils and water-logged loam soils, whereas in water-logged, low-clay
   soils, over half of total reactive Fe was present in poorly-crystalline
   forms due to organic and inorganic complexation, respectively. Forestry
   practices such as plantation clear-felling and replanting, seasonal
   water-logging and mineral soil properties significantly impacted soil
   organic carbon (C), potentially-bioavailable Fe pools and densities of
   S-, but not Fe-, bacterial populations. Bacterial Fe(III) reduction and
   abiotic Fe(II) oxidation, as well as chemolithotrophic S oxidation and
   aerobic, heterotrophic respiration were integral to catchment
   terrestrial Fe-C cycling. This work demonstrates bacterial involvement
   in terrestrial Fe cycling in a subtropical coastal circumneutral-pH
   ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) system has been allowed
   in monitoring various natural hazards, so highly accurate and airborne
   LiDAR data have been used in the field of oceanic sciences, including a
   digital terrain modeling and bathymetric mapping. In this study, we
   adopted airborne LiDAR measurements to assess coastal erosion for the
   first time. The airborne LiDAR data were acquired along the east coastal
   zone of Korea (shoreline is about 205km). The 3D topographical data and
   digital orthophotos, which were obtained from aerial LiDAR with a
   digital camera, were integrated with the beach profiles conducted by the
   VRS-based DGPS surveying. The integrated dataset were relocated into a
   developed flight simulator module, which is a Dynamic geographical
   information system solution with Digital AirScape (D-DAS), for the 3D
   visual analysis of erosion status. The 3D visual result of seasonal and
   yearly variability with respect to beach width is validated to
   understand the evolution trends of the coastal environment on the test
   areas. Preliminary result from this study shows the potential
   availability of LiDAR data and the additional opportunities within the 3
   dimensional monitoring of coastal evolution, for a detailed evaluation
   of erosion supported by the Coastal Erosion Monitoring Program (CEMP).
   Additionally, we expect that the early introduction of the airborne
   LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB) system in Korea, such as Scanning Hydrographic
   Operational Airborne Lidar Survey (SHOALS), will be used for more
   effective and deliberative monitoring of coastal erosion in the coastal
   zone management program.},

Title = {Fine Root and Soil Organic Carbon Depth Distributions are Inversely

   Forests},

Abstract = {Humid tropical forests contain some of the largest soil organic carbon
   (SOC) stocks on Earth. Much of this SOC is in subsoil, yet variation in
   the distribution of SOC through the soil profile remains poorly
   characterized across tropical forests. We used a correlative approach to
   quantify relationships among depth distributions of SOC, fine root
   biomass, nutrients and texture to 1 m depths across 43 lowland tropical
   forests in Panama. The sites span rainfall and soil fertility gradients,
   and these are largely uncorrelated for these sites. We used fitted beta
   parameters to characterize depth distributions, where beta is a
   numerical index based on an asymptotic relationship, such that larger
   beta values indicate greater concentrations of root biomass or SOC at
   depth in the profile. Root beta values ranged from 0.82 to 0.95 and were
   best predicted by soil pH and extractable potassium (K) stocks. For
   example, the three most acidic (pH < 4) and K-poor (< 20 g K m(-2))
   soils contained 76 +/- 5\% of fine root biomass from 0 to 10 cm depth,
   while the three least acidic (pH > 6.0) and most K-rich (> 50 g K m(-2))
   soils contained only 41 +/- 9\% of fine root biomass at this depth. Root
   beta and SOC beta values were inversely related, such that a large fine
   root biomass in surface soils corresponded to large SOC stocks in
   subsoils (50-100 cm). SOC beta values were best predicted by soil pH and
   base cation stocks, with the three most base-poor soils containing 34
   +/- 8\% of SOC from 50 to 100 cm depth, and the three most base-rich
   soils containing just 9 +/- 2\% of SOC at this depth. Nutrient depth
   distributions were not related to Root beta or SOC beta values. These
   data show that large surface root biomass stocks are associated with
   large subsoil C stocks in strongly weathered tropical soils. Further
   studies are required to evaluate why this occurs, and whether changes in
   surface root biomass, as may occur with global change, could in turn
   influence SOC storage in tropical forest subsoils.},

   (n=1-7) clusters},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {127},
Number = {23},

Abstract = {Equilibrium geometries, charge distributions, stabilities, and
   electronic properties of the Ag-adsorbed (SiO2)(n) (n=1-7) clusters have
   been investigated using density functional theory with generalized
   gradient approximation for exchange-correlation functional. The results
   show that the Ag atom preferably binds to silicon atom with dangling
   bond in nearly a fixed direction, and the incoming Ag atoms tend to
   cluster on the existing Ag cluster leading to the formation of Ag
   islands. The adsorbed Ag atom only causes charge redistributions of the
   atoms near itself. The effect of the adsorbed Ag atom on the bonding
   natures and structural features of the silica clusters is minor,
   attributing to the tendency of stability order of Ag(SiO2)(n) (n=1-7)
   clusters in consistent with silica clusters. In addition, the energy
   gaps between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular
   orbitals remarkably decrease compared with the pure (SiO2)(n) (n=1-7)
   clusters, eventually approaching the near infrared radiation region.
   This suggests that these small clusters may be an alternative material
   which has a similar functionality in treating cancer to the large
   gold-coated silica nanoshells and the small Au-3(SiO2)(3) cluster. (c)

Abstract = {The recent International Panel on Climate Change report predicts the
   highly urbanized Northeastern U.S. to be at high risk to heat waves.
   Since urban residents and infrastructure are known to be highly
   vulnerable to extreme heat, the goal of this paper is to understand the
   interaction between the synoptic-scale heat wave and the city-scale
   urban heat island (UHI) effects. The study also qualitatively analyzes
   the primary factors that contribute to UHIs by comparing their
   intensities in different cities with distinct geo-physical
   characteristics. Our results, generated by using the Weather Research
   and Forecasting model augmented with advanced urban surface
   parameterizations, confirm that the amplitude of UHI is related to the
   physical size of the city. However, the results suggest that cities of
   comparabale sizes might interact differently with heat waves: in New
   York City; Washington, DC; and Baltimore (but not in Philadelphia) the
   regular UHI was amplified more strongly during heat waves compared to
   smaller cities. The results also establish that the pattern of UHI in
   different cities, its variability, and its interaction with heat waves
   are inherently linked to dynamic factors.},

Abstract = {In this study, we use IP25 and alkenone biomarker proxies to document
   the subdecadal variations of sea ice and sea surface temperature in the
   subpolar North Atlantic induced by the decadally paced explosive
   tropical volcanic eruptions of the second half of the thirteenth
   century. The short-and long-term evolutions of both variables were
   investigated by cross analysis with a simulation of the IPSL-CM5A LR
   model. Our results show short-term ocean cooling and sea ice expansion
   in response to each volcanic eruption. They also highlight that the long
   response time of the ocean leads to cumulative surface cooling and
   subsurface heat buildup due to sea ice capping. As volcanic forcing
   relaxes, the surface ocean rapidly warms, likely amplified by subsurface
   heat, and remains almost ice free for several decades.},

Title = {Integrating the impact of global change on the niche and physiology of

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {7078-7093},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Marine nitrogen fixation is a major source of new nitrogen to the ocean,
   which interacts with climate driven changes to physical nutrient supply
   to regulate the response of ocean primary production in the oligotrophic
   tropical ocean. Warming and changes in nutrient supply may alter the
   ecological niche of nitrogen-fixing organisms, or `diazotrophs',
   however, impacts of warming on diazotroph physiology may also be
   important. Lab-based studies reveal that warming increases the nitrogen
   fixation-specific elemental use efficiency (EUE) of two prevalent marine
   diazotrophs, Crocosphaera and Trichodesmium, thus reducing their
   requirements for the limiting nutrients iron and phosphorus. Here, we
   coupled a new diazotroph model based upon observed diazotroph energetics
   of growth and resource limitation to a state-of-the-art global model of
   phytoplankton physiology and ocean biogeochemistry. Our model is able to
   address the integrated response of nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium
   and Crocosphaera to warming under the IPCC high emission RCP8.5 scenario
   for the first time. Our results project a global decline in nitrogen
   fixation over the coming century. However, the regional response of
   nitrogen fixation to climate change is modulated by the
   diazotroph-specific thermal performance curves and EUE, particularly in
   the Pacific Ocean, which shapes global trends. Spatially, the response
   of both diazotrophs is similar with expansion towards higher latitudes
   and reduced rates of nitrogen fixation in the lower latitudes. Overall,
   95\%-97\% of the nitrogen fixation climate signal can be attributed to
   the combined effect of temperature on the niche and physiology of marine
   diazotrophs, with decreases being associated with a reduced niche and
   increases resulting due to a combination of expanding niche and
   temperature driven changes to EUE. Climate change impacts on both the
   niche and physiology of marine diazotrophs interact to shape patterns of
   marine nitrogen fixation, which will have important implications for
   ocean productivity in the future.},

Title = {Amazonian Dark Earths in Rondonia State: Soil properties, carbon dating
   and classification},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Abstract = {Throughout the Amazon region, dark-colored soils with increased
   fertility are identified and referred as Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE).
   These unique soils are characterized by an anthropic surface horizon
   with dark colors, presence of charcoal and artifacts, in contrast with
   surrounding non-ADE soils. The ADEs show extraordinary properties such
   as the capacity of maintaining the dark colors and high nutrient levels
   after years of farming, even under the highly favorable climatic
   conditions for oxidation of organic matter and weathering of nutrients
   of Amazon region. The ADE are considered islands of fertility in the
   Amazon biome, as well as very important models for research, in terms of
   agricultural and environmental sustainability, carbon sequestration,
   nutrient bioavailability, food security, and for anthropological
   studies. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding the
   extent of human alterations, how they were formed, and their
   classification in the taxonomic systems. Therefore, the objectives of
   this study were to identify, describe, and characterize soil profiles of
   ADEs, located in the Southern region of Rondonia State, Brazil, and to
   contribute to their classification according to the Brazilian Soil
   Classification System (SiBCS) and the World Reference Base (WRB). Five
   soil profiles were described and sampled; P1 to P3 were under grass
   pastures, P4 and P5 under forest and crops with no-till, respectively.
   The morphological, physical, and chemical attributes, as well as
   contents of Fe, Al, Si, and Ti oxides and extractable iron forms were
   characterized. The anthropic horizons exhibited dark colors, artifacts,
   charcoal, sandier textures, predominantly granular structures, abrupt or
   clear transitions, and mostly wavy and irregular boundaries. Values of
   pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, exchangeable bases (S), CEC, and C were high in all
   anthropic horizons. Compared to non-ADE soils in the Amazon region,
   phosphorus contents were superior in all anthropic horizons, with the
   highest values in surface horizons of P1, P2, and P3. According to
   SiBCS, P1 was classified as Cambissolo, P2 as Argissolo, and P3, P4, and
   P5 as Latossolos. Except for P4, where values of extractable P by
   Mehlich-1 are lower than 30 mg kg(-1), all soils fulfilled the
   requirements for the anthropic horizon in the SiBCS, and new classes at
   the subgroup level were proposed. In the WRB, P4 and P5 were classified
   as Ferralsols. The other profiles were classified as Anthrosols. The
   radiocarbon dates (C-14) of charcoal fragments, obtained using a mass
   accelerator, showed ages between 940 +/- 40 and 1230 +/- 60 years BP.},

   Louisiana, United States: Wave processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Observations of wave and sediment processes collected at two locations
   on the Atchafalaya inner shelf show that wave dissipation in shallow,
   muddy environments is strongly coupled to bed-sediment reworking by
   waves. During an energetic wave event (2 m significant wave height in 5
   m water depth), acoustic backscatter records suggest that sediment in
   the surficial bed layer evolves from consolidated mud through
   liquefaction, fluid mud formation, and hindered settling to gelled,
   under-consolidated mud. Net swell dissipation increases steadily during
   the storm from negligible prestorm values, consistent with bed
   softening, but shows no correlation with detectable fluid mud layers.
   Remarkably, the maximum dissipation rate occurs poststorm, when no fluid
   mud layers are present. In the waning stage of the storm, the
   contribution of different wave-forcing processes to wave dissipation is
   analyzed using an inverse modeling approach based on a nonlinear
   three-wave interaction model. Although wave-mud interaction dominates
   dissipative processes, nonlinear three-wave interactions control the
   shape of the frequency distribution of the dissipation rate. In the wake
   of the storm, the viscosity values predicted by the inverse modeling
   converge toward measured values characteristic for gelled mud in a trend
   that is consistent with a fluid mud entering dewatering and
   consolidation stages.},

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In some hardwater rivers of the Seine basin (France), the development of
   an encrusting cyanobacterial microflora may gradually lead to a
   cementation of river bed sediments, to a reduction of spawning ground
   areas and to a loss of benthic floral and faunal diversity. Current
   methods for build-up management are based on mechanical dredging of the
   stream bed. In the short term, the habitat diversity and microfaunal
   diversity are improved, but in 1-3 years the cyanobacterial growth
   resumes and the bed sediments are cemented again. The early growth
   stages of stromatolitic structures on newly available substrata were
   studied for three years in the river Eaulne (Upper-Normandy, France) in
   relation with microfloral development, sedimentary processes and water
   quality. Seasonal current velocity variations appeared to control the
   construction process (colonization dynamics and dependency of
   stromatolite growth to mat extension) through substratum availability
   and nutrient renewal. Under the conditions allowing an optimal
   microfloral development, the carbonate precipitation rates were
   inversely correlated with substratum grain size, i.e. the maximal
   encrusting biomass was hosted by gravels. Homogeneous substrata showed
   the highest short-term potentialities for high sediment cementation
   rate, whereas heterogeneous, mixed grain size had the highest
   potentialities for long-term colonization by the encrusting microflora.},

Title = {A data-driven model for nonlinear marine dynamics},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {236},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The design and engineering of ships and platforms that operate in the
   ocean environment requires understanding of a nonlinear dynamical system
   that responds according to complex interaction with a wide range of sea
   and wind conditions. Time domain observation of nonlinear marine
   dynamics with either experiments or high-fidelity numerical simulation
   tools is costly due to the random nature of the ocean and the full range
   of environmental and loading conditions that are experienced in the
   lifetime of a ship or platform. In this paper, a data-driven method is
   presented to predict the complex nonlinear input-output relationship
   typical of marine systems. A Long Short-Term Memory neural net is used
   to learn nonlinear wave propagation and the nonlinear roll of a ship
   section in beam seas. Training data are generated with second-order wave
   theory or a volume-of-fluid computational fluid dynamics, although the
   method is directly applicable to data that is generated by other means
   such as nonlinear potential flow or experimental measurements. The cost
   and the amount of data to apply the method are estimated and measured.
   The data-driven results are compared with unseen data to demonstrate the
   accuracy and feasibility.},

Title = {Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of alternative osmotic
   and mixing dilution desalination system configurations},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {504},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {An environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was applied to
   compare the conventional SWRO desalination process to two contemporary
   low-pressure membrane desalination processes: an osmotic dilution
   desalination (ODD) and a mixing dilution desalination (MDD). The ODD
   process combines a forward osmosis (FO) membrane and a low-pressure RO
   membrane (LPRO) in a hybrid (FO-RO) configuration. The MDD process
   couples the ultrafiltration (UF) with LPRO in a hybrid UF-RO
   configuration. SimaPro (TM) was used to conduct the LCA study. CML
   environmental impact assessment method was used to evaluate 11
   environmental impact categories. Results from LCIA reveal the strong
   dependency of environmental impacts on the clean in place (CIP) process
   in dilution desalination systems while the energy flow in the standalone
   RO shows almost similar levels of dependency of environmental impacts
   instead of CIP process. Overall, the ODD process with FO-RO hybrid
   membrane technology has the highest environmental impact. The normalised
   comparison LCIA indicates that standalone RO has the lowest total
   environmental impacts as the fossil fuel is considered as the main
   source of power generator. Compared to conventional SWRO, the MDD
   process coupled with hybrid UF-RO technology had a lowest contribution
   to global warming and ozone layer depletion but had higher impacts to
   marine and aquatic resource depletion. Scenarios substituting the
   conventional with renewable energy sources to power the water treatment
   options favoured the MDD process coupled with hybrid UF-RO technology
   and prove the hybrid UF-RO process as the most environmentally
   favourable comparing to the conventional SWRO and hybrid FO-RO.},

Abstract = {The Australian Coastal Ocean Radar Network includes eight WERA phased
   array radar stations. The stations are configured in pairs in order to
   produce high quality gridded surface current data at 10-minute intervals
   at four sites. Other gridded parameters of significant wave height,
   dominant wave period, Bragg peak energies and directional wave spectral
   information are also extracted from the radar sea-echoes. Three of the
   sites operate at 8-9 MHz, giving ranges of up to 200 km for surface
   currents, while the fourth site operates in the 13-14 MHz band and has
   an operating range of 150 km. Each pair of radar stations operates on
   the same frequency and separation is achieved by an alternating sequence
   of 5 minutes on and 5 minutes off. First-Look analyses are carried out
   at the radar sites by proprietary WERA software and are transmitted by
   broadband phone connections to a base laboratory for operational
   monitoring and preparation for archiving. These data are attached to
   metadata in netCDF format and sent to the archive. Raw data (time
   series) are stored at the radar stations for each of the elements of the
   phased array receive antennas. At this stage the data have been sorted
   into range bins by the WERA firmware and a Radio Frequency Interference
   (RFI) reduction process is applied using a scan of the band by the radar
   receiver immediately prior to each 5-minute run. These time series data
   are returned to the laboratory on hard disks in a delayed mode every 2-3
   months on a regular maintenance program. Delayed-mode re-processing is
   carried out using software developed by ACORN to achieve improved
   identification of Bragg peaks and subsequent improved parameter
   extraction. At this stage gridded data are combined from each pair of
   stations to produce hourly maps of surface current vectors and
   directional wave spectra. Quality flags are set for each data value
   before the delayed-mode data are filed for archiving.},

Abstract = {Boolean classifiers can be evolved by means of genetic algorithms. This
   can be done within an intercommunicating island system, of evolutionary
   niches, undergoing cycles that alternate long periods of isolation to
   short periods of information exchange. In these settings, the efficiency
   of the communication is a key requirement. In the present work, we
   address this requirement by providing a technique for efficiently
   representing and transmitting differential encodings of Boolean
   functions. We introduce a new class of Boolean Neural Networks (BNN),
   the all-implicants BNN, and show that this representation supports
   efficient update communication, better than the classical

Abstract = {The idea of garden is expressed, for the first time in history, by the
   Mesopotamian civilization as early as the IV millennium BCE as drawings
   and poetry texts showing a wall fencing one single tree. This is the
   first representation of the idea of sheltering/protecting a tree by
   human artifacts and, in its simplest form, brings the idea of the tight
   relationship between horticulture and urban environment. The
   ``jardinu{''} of Pantelleria, a drystone wall shaped into an open-top
   tower encircling a single citrus tree, fully matches both in its
   founding idea and its physical implementation the elemental idea of the
   Mesopotamian garden. Such traditional growing system, developed in
   Pantelleria to cope with water scarcity, is an artifact at the service
   of households, fully integrated into the urban settlements of the Island
   and providing a valuable source of fresh fruit to families despite the
   lack of irrigation water. Currently, as many as 500 of such structures
   are still active in Pantelleria, standing as the distinguishing
   landmarks of the island. The simple, albeit expensive, principle of
   enclosing a tree inside a protective wall has many effects on the
   surrounding environment and on the eco-physiological behavior of the
   tree itself. We discuss here this system from the point of view of the
   interactions between the tree and the enclosing wall, focusing on the
   ability of the ``Pantelleria citrus garden{''} to affect the water cycle
   of the tree and to avoid irrigation at all. Our analysis shows beyond
   simple, easily recognizable effects such as wind protection and the
   related reductions in transpiration, diurnal thermal dynamics of wall's
   stones actively affects the water balance of the system. Implications of
   this analysis suggest that the knowledge behind the empirical
   building-rules developed over the years for the construction of such
   structures are expression of the physical principles underlying the
   environmental dynamics of the ``Pantelleria citrus garden{''}.},

   system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {377},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Waste carbide slag (WCS) is a typical industrial solid waste with high
   calcium content, which shows highly potential in preparation of CaCO3 by
   CO2 mineralization technology. This study demonstrated the feasibility
   of efficient calcium leaching from WCS using ammonium sulfate
   ((NH4)(2)SO4) under mild conditions (<= 40 degrees C, 0.1 MPa). Nearly
   90\% calcium was converted into calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4 center
   dot 2H(2)O) in about 15 min, and after impurity separation the CaSO4
   center dot 2H(2)O with about 90\% whiteness and 94\% purity was
   effectively collected. In addition, a surface coverage kinetics model
   suitable for this leaching system was proposed. It was found that,
   kinetics behavior followed the chemical reaction control mechanism
   within the first minutes and then switched to the product islands
   diffusion-control along with CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O crystallization.
   Accordingly, calcium leaching in (NH4)(2)SO4 system could be reinforced
   by readjusting S/L after reaching equilibrium. This process provides a
   potential path for the resource treatment of industrial solid wastes
   such as calcium carbide slag and desulfurization gypsum.},

Title = {Short Communication: Evidence for non-Gaussian distribution of rock
   weathering rates},
Journal = {EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {441-445},
Abstract = {The weathering of rocks influences the geochemistry of the oceans, the
   erosion of landscapes and man-made structures, and even the global
   climate. Although a high degree of variance is often observed in rate
   measurements, little is understood about the statistical characteristics
   of weathering rate distributions. This preliminary study demonstrates
   that the weathering rates of limestone, determined from measurements of
   an ancient eroded limestone edifice, can exhibit highly non-Gaussian
   behavior. While a Gaussian model produced a poor fit with the data, an
   alternative model - the generalized extreme value (GEV) framework - was
   capable of capturing the asymmetric long-tailed distribution, in good
   agreement with the measured curve. Furthermore, the non-Gaussian
   distribution of these field rates was found to have similar
   characteristics to the distribution of rates measured over much smaller
   microscopic regions of limestone surfaces in laboratory experiments.
   Such similar behavior could be indicative of analogous chemical and
   mechanical weathering processes acting over a range of spatial and
   temporal scales. Moreover, highly asymmetric rate distributions with
   high variance could be characteristic of rates not only in carbonate
   rocks, but also in other rock types, suggesting that the use of a small
   number of measurements to determine field weathering rates may be
   insufficient to fully characterize the range of rates in natural
   systems.},

Title = {The effect of acidification and the combined effects of
   acidification/lipid extraction on carbon stable isotope ratios for
   sub-arctic and arctic marine zooplankton species},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1541-1548},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) in zooplankton are widely
   applied in ecosystem-level studies of energy flux and trophic
   interactions. Carbonate (CaCO3) and lipid content are highly variable
   both among and within zooplankton species. Such variability can arise
   from the delta C-13-depleted nature of lipids as well as differences in
   carbon incorporation among tissues (e.g., relative amount of carbonate).
   Critically, the impact of the common lipid- and carbonate-normalization
   steps of extraction and acidification is poorly understood and applied
   in an inconsistent manner. Here, we investigated the effect of lipid
   extraction and sample acidification (CaCO3 removal) on delta C-13 in
   sub-arctic and arctic marine zooplankton species. Our results indicate
   that, with the exception of the shelled mollusc Limacina helicina,
   acidification of samples can be omitted for all other marine zooplankton
   considered in this study. In the case of L. helicina, delta C-13 can be
   corrected for carbonate content using the linear equation developed in
   this study. In contrast, the delta C-13 for all species was
   significantly enriched by a combination of lipid extraction and
   acidification (up to +4.9 aEuro degrees) prior to stable isotope
   analysis. Our data were used to develop simple, predictive
   species-specific correction models for lipid-acid-normalized delta C-13
   using C:N and/or untreated delta C-13 values. Our results indicate that
   the delta C-13 value for all species, including those with lower C:N
   ratios (similar to 3-4), should be corrected for lipid content. We
   recommend lipid extraction whenever possible, or else the use of
   species/taxon-specific delta C-13 lipid-normalization models for
   accurate determination of carbon sources and dynamics for arctic and
   sub-arctic marine zooplankton.},

Abstract = {CO2 emissions from the Peterhead CCS gas power plant were planned to be
   captured, compressed and transported offshore to be injected at a rate
   of 1 million tons per year for up to 20 years into the depleted
   Goldeneye hydrocarbon gas field. Although site selection,
   characterization and engineering designs are considered the prime means
   of ensuring confidence in the long-term security of CO2 storage,
   demonstration that they are performing is provided by a comprehensive
   risk-based Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MMV) program. The
   Goldeneye MMV program was designed according to a systematic
   site-specific storage containment risk assessment to (1) demonstrate
   containment, (2) monitor for conformance, (3) provide data for emission
   accounting, and (4) support storage transfer of long-term liabilities.
   The MMV design process identified a set of appropriate monitoring tasks
   and candidate monitoring technologies needed to perform them based on
   comprehensive site-specific feasibility studies.This procedure reduced
   forty-five candidate monitoring technologies by half to result in a
   fit-for-purpose monitoring plan that satisfied UK and EU regulations
   while using less than fifteen different containment and environmental
   monitoring techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   modeling},

Abstract = {On 5 December 2018, a magnitude M-w 7.5 earthquake occurred southeast of
   Mare, an island of the Loyalty Islands archipelago, New Caledonia. This
   earthquake is located at the junction between the plunging Loyalty Ridge
   and the southern part of the Vanuatu Arc, in a tectonically complex and
   very active area regularly subjected to strong seismic crises and
   earthquakes higher than magnitude 7 and up to 8. Widely felt in New
   Caledonia, it was immediately followed by a tsunami warning, confirmed
   shortly after by a first wave arrival at the Loyalty Islands tide gauges
   (Mare and Lifou), and then along the east coast of Grande Terre of New
   Caledonia and in several islands of the Vanuatu Archipelago. Two
   solutions of the seafloor initial deformation are considered for tsunami
   generation modeling, one using a non-uniform finite-source model from
   USGS and the other being a uniform slip model built from the Global
   Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) solution, with the geological knowledge of
   the region and empirical laws establishing relationships between the
   moment magnitude and the fault plane geometry. Both tsunami generation
   and propagation are simulated using the Semi-implicit Cross-scale
   Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM), an open-source modeling
   code solving the shallow-water equations on an unstructured grid
   allowing refinement in many critical areas. The results of numerical
   simulations are compared to tide gauge records, field observations and
   testimonials from 2018. Careful inspection of wave amplitude and wave
   energy maps for the two simulated scenarios shows clearly that the
   heterogeneous deformation model is inappropriate, while it raises the
   importance of the fault plane geometry and azimuth for tsunami amplitude
   and directivity. The arrival times, wave amplitude and polarities
   obtained with the uniform slip model are globally coherent, especially
   in far-field locations (Hienghene, Poindimie and Port Vila). Due to
   interactions between the tsunami waves and the numerous bathymetric
   structures like the Loyalty and Norfolk ridges in the neighborhood of
   the source, the tsunami propagating toward the south of Grande Terre and
   the Isle of Pines is captured by these structures acting like
   waveguides, allowing it to propagate to the north-northwest, especially
   in the Loyalty Islands and along the east coast of Grande Terre. A
   similar observation results from the propagation in the Vanuatu islands,
   from Aneityum to Efate.},

Title = {Projected Near-Surface Wind Speed Trends in Lithuania},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Developing wind energy in Lithuania is one of the most important ways to
   achieve green energy goals. Observational data show that the decline in
   wind speeds in the region may pose challenges for wind energy
   development. This study analyzed the long-term variation of the observed
   2006-2020 and projected 2006-2100 near-surface wind speed at the height
   of 10 m over Lithuanian territory using data of three models included in
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). A slight
   decrease in wind speeds was found in the whole territory of Lithuania
   for the projected wind speed data of three global circulation models for
   the scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. It was found that the most
   favorable scenario for wind energy production is RCP2.6, and the most
   unfavorable is the RCP4.5 scenario under which the decrease in wind
   speed may reach 12\%. At the Baltic Sea coastal region, the decline was
   smaller than in the country's inner regions by the end of the century.
   The highest reduction in speed is characteristic of the most severe
   RCP8.5 scenario. Although the analysis of wind speeds projected by
   global circulation models (GCM) confirms the downward trends in wind
   speeds found in the observational data, the projected changes in wind
   speeds are too small to significantly impact the development of wind
   farms in Lithuania.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess the temporal variability of
   tropospheric ozone pollution. The research was carried out for the
   agricultural region of central-eastern Poland, an area covering the
   Lublin Voivodeship. One-hour averages of automatic measurements of
   tropospheric ozone concentration in 2015-2017 were used for the study.
   The data were obtained from three measuring stations belonging to the
   Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Poland. The stations
   were located as part of the Air Quality Monitoring System in rural
   communes in the north-western, central and southern parts of the Lublin
   Voivodeship. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the
   tropospheric ozone concentrations were significantly dependent on
   weather conditions during the years of the study. At each monitoring
   station, the one-hour average O-3 concentrations showed a clear
   structure over the course of the day: they were higher in the late
   morning and early afternoon than in the early morning and at night. The
   highest O-3 concentrations were observed at the Florianka measurement
   station, located in Roztocze National Park. This area had high forest
   cover and was located at the highest elevation above sea level of the
   three measuring stations. In the light of climate change and increasing
   O-3 concentrations, further scientific research on atmospheric air
   pollution is crucial, especially in agricultural areas associated with
   food production.},

Title = {Petroleum production platforms as sites for the expansion of ciguatera

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {253-259},

Abstract = {Ciguatera is a common human disease of tropical, coral reef ecosystems
   acquired by consuming finfish-containing ciguatoxins (CTX). There are
   few records of this disease in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, a region
   characterized by soft muddy bottoms that are considered poor habitat for
   the CTX source dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. However, the
   approximately 4000 petroleum production platforms and hundreds of
   state-sponsored artificial reefs located in the Gulf of Mexico provide
   hard substrate and often support coral and other components of the
   tropical benthos. In addition to their role in their resource
   extraction, these oil production platforms are also popular sites for
   recreational fishing and sport diving. We examined these platforms as
   potential substrate for G. toxicus and report a first record of this
   species in the NW Gulf of Mexico. All the platforms (n = 6) examined
   harbored the dinoflagellate as an epiphyte on the fouling community,
   with three finds of G. toxicus associated with the pelagic macroalga,
   Sargassum. Only minor toxicity (< 0.15 ppb) was noted in two of 20 great
   barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) examined. Tagging data suggest
   trans-Gulf migrations by barracuda are common; thus, we cannot determine
   if the toxicity was acquired locally or transported in migrating fish.
   These platforms are a clear example of how human activity has altered
   the environment in a way that allows expansion of a HA-B population. The
   rapid increase in production platforms since 1942 has provided novel
   substrate in a sandy/muddy bottom environment generally considered to be
   poor habitat for these benthic dinoflagellates. These platforms create a
   unique habitat in the upper euphotic zone and serve as intersection
   points for fishermen and potentially toxic fish. Many Gulf of Mexico
   states have active programs to turn non-producing platforms into
   artificial reefs. Our results suggest that the use of these platforms as
   fisheries enhancement structures could have unintended consequences for
   human health, particularly if projected rising sea-surface temperatures
   over the next century alter benthic distributions and fish migration
   patterns. These concerns also extend to mariculture operations around
   oil production rigs or offshore wind farms, both of which would also add
   substrate for epibenthic microalgae. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {Climate change threatens coral survival by causing coral bleaching,
   which occurs when the coral's symbiotic relationship with algal
   symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) breaks down. Studies on thermal adaptation
   focus on symbionts because they are accessible both in vitro and in
   hospite. However, there is little known about the physiological and
   biochemical response of adult corals (without Symbiodiniaceae) to
   thermal stress. Here we show acclimatization and/or adaptation potential
   of menthol-bleached aposymbiotic coral Platygyra verweyi in terms of
   respiration breakdown temperature (RBT) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH)
   enzyme activity in samples collected from two reef sites with
   contrasting temperature regimes: a site near a nuclear power plant
   outlet (NPP-OL, with long-term temperature perturbation) and Wanlitong
   (WLT) in southern Taiwan. Aposymbiotic P. verweyi from the NPP-OL site
   had a 3.1 degrees C higher threshold RBT than those from WLT. In
   addition, MDH activity in P. verweyi from NPP-OL showed higher thermal
   resistance than those from WLT by higher optimum temperatures and the
   activation energy required for inactivating the enzyme by heat. The MDH
   from NPP-OL also had two times higher residual activity than that from
   WLT after incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h. The results of RBT and
   thermal properties of MDH in P. verweyi demonstrate potential
   physiological and enzymatic response to a long-term and regular thermal
   stress, independent of their Symbiodiniaceae partner.},

Title = {The strengthening relationship between Eurasian snow cover and December

Abstract = {The haze pollution in December has become increasingly serious over
   recent decades and imposes damage on society, ecosystems, and human
   health. In addition to anthropogenic emissions, climate change and
   variability were conducive to haze in China. In this study, the
   relationship between the snow cover over eastern Europe and western
   Siberia (SCES) and the number of haze days in December in central North
   China was analyzed. This relationship significantly strengthened after
   the mid-1990s, which is attributed to the effective connections between
   the SCES and the Eurasian atmospheric circulations. During 1998-2016,
   the SCES significantly influenced the soil moisture and land surface
   radiation, and then the combined underlying drivers of enhanced soil
   moisture and radiative cooling moved the the East Asia jet stream
   northward and induced anomalous, anti-cyclonic circulation over central
   North China. Modulated by such atmospheric circulations, the local lower
   boundary layer, the decreased surface wind, and the more humid air were
   conducive to the worsening dispersion conditions and frequent haze
   occurrences. In contrast, from 1979 to 1997, the linkage between the
   SCES and soil moisture was negligible. Furthermore, the correlated
   radiative cooling was distributed narrowly and far from the key area of
   snow cover. The associated atmospheric circulations with the SCES were
   not significantly linked with the ventilation conditions over central
   North China. Consequently, the relationship between the SCES and the
   number of hazy days in central North China was insignificant before the
   mid-1990s but has strengthened and has become significant since then.},

Title = {Geological characterization and potential for carbon dioxide (CO2)
   enhanced oil recovery in the Cardium Formation, central Pembina Field,
   Alberta},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {56},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Injection of CO2 into the Cardium Formation, central Pembina Field,
   Alberta was initiated in 2004 in two inverted 5-spot waterflood
   patterns. The purpose of this flood was to assess the economic viability
   of enhanced oil recovery (FOR) using CO2. To study CO2 behaviour within
   the reservoir and assess long-term risks of CO2 leakage and storage
   potential, a geological and hydrogeological model was developed for the
   Cardium Formation, and for both the underlying and overlying strata. The
   injection zone, Cardium Formation, was sub-divided into four permeable
   and three impermeable reservoir units. The underlying and overlying
   strata were subdivided based on their geological potential to contain
   CO2 over the long-term (5,000 years).
   Permeable reservoir units in the Cardium Formation include the lower,
   middle and upper sandstones, and the conglomerate. Most of the storage
   capacity of the Cardium Formation is contained within the three
   sandstone beds, which exhibit average porosities between 14.8 percent
   and 16.4 percent. Permeability in the sandstones increases predictably
   with increasing porosity, but is variable from sandstone to sandstone.
   The lower sandstone has the lowest average permeability (9.5 md), which
   is about half the average permeability of the middle and upper
   sandstones (21.4 and 19.8 md, respectively). There is no relation
   between porosity and permeability in the conglomerate. The conglomerate
   on average is 50 percent more permeable (33 md) than the middle and
   upper sandstones; although, permeability may exceed one Darcy in
   individual beds. The higher permeability of the conglomerate results in
   it acting as a ``thief{''} zone for injected CO2. This tendency is
   further compounded by both the endemic use of hydraulic fractures (which
   propagate vertically) to stimulate oil production, and the positive
   buoyancy of CO2 relative to water.
   The Cardium Formation at Pembina occurs within the middle of the 650 m
   thick Colorado Group shale. The effectiveness and integrity of the
   overlying shale succession, as a seal for the Cardium Formation, is
   vital to the long-term storage of CO2. Leakage through this shale is
   very unlikely as it is thicker than 300 m and separates two aquifers
   with significantly different regional pressure regimes (the Cardium
   Formation was originally over-pressured whereas the overlying Wapiti
   Formation is sub-hydrostatically pressured).},

Title = {Co-occurrence and transfer of fixed nitrogen from Trichodesmium spp. to
   diatoms in the low-latitude Kuroshio Current in the NW Pacific},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {421},
Pages = {25-38},
Abstract = {Actively growing Trichodesmium spp. are known to release their newly
   fixed nitrogen (N) into the surrounding N-limited water. Although newly
   released fixed N could potentially enhance the growth of nearby
   non-diazotrophic phytoplankton, the interactions of Trichodesmium spp.
   and other co-occurring cells, i.e. diatoms, have never been well
   documented. We conducted laboratory N-15 tracer experiments to
   investigate the trophic interactions of T. erythraeum and diatoms in
   culture. Field studies were carried out to examine spatial-temporal
   distributions of Trichodesmium spp. and diatoms in the low-latitude
   Kuroshio Current and the neighboring northern South China Sea (SCS).
   Enrichment of 15N occurred in 3 species of cultured diatoms when they
   were incubated with T. erythraeum IMS101 in culture media enriched with
   gaseous N-15(2), which confirmed the transfer of newly fixed N from T.
   erythraeum to diatoms. Field results showed that in the Kuroshio, where
   Trichodesmium spp. flourished in the warm seasons, the abundances of
   Trichodesmium spp. and diatom cells with >10 mu m diameter were
   positively correlated (p < 0.05). During the warm seasons, diatom
   vertical distributions showed a surface-abundance maximum that coincided
   with the depth of highest cell densities of Trichodesmium spp. and a
   second abundance maximum near the nitracline. The diatom
   surface-abundance maximum disappeared in the cold seasons, when the
   Trichodesmium spp. population languished. The bimodal distribution of
   diatoms and the co-occurrence of diatom and Trichodesmium spp. abundance
   maxima recurred as Trichodesmium spp. abundance increased when the warm
   seasons returned. In contrast to the Kuroshio, the SCS, inhabited
   sparsely by Trichodesmium spp., showed no surface abundance maxima in
   the vertical distributions of Trichodesmium spp. or diatoms. Both field
   and laboratory data suggest that the co-occurrence of Trichodesmium spp.
   and diatoms might be driven by the transfer of N fixed by Trichodesmium
   spp. to diatoms in the N-limited oligotrophic ocean. Because diatoms are
   more effective than Trichodesmium spp. in exporting N and carbon to
   depth, the N exudation by Trichodesmium spp. that supports diatom growth
   could represent an important pathway of N and carbon export to depth in
   tropical and subtropical oceans.},

Title = {Impact of diagenesis on the microbial reservoirs of the terminal
   Ediacaran Dengying Formation from the Central to Northern Sichuan Basin,
   SW China},
Journal = {MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The central part of the Sichuan Basin shows an excellent exploration
   potential in the dolomitized microbial reservoirs of the Dengying
   Formation. However, the influence of diagenesis on the formation of
   high-quality reservoirs is unclear. This study aims to establish the
   parasequence of the diagenesis in microbial reservoirs and decipher its
   control on the quality of microbialite-dominated reservoirs. The
   microbialite consists of stromatolites and thrombolites in the Dengying
   Formation, which firstly underwent meteoric alteration in the early
   diagenetic stage. Subsequently, the microbialites experienced fibrous
   and bladed dolomite cementation and dolomitization. Laminated and
   clotted sedimentary fabrics are well-preserved in dolomite with less
   than 100 mu m in crystal-sizes. The carbon (delta C-13), oxygen (delta
   O-18), and strontium (Sr-87/Sr-86) isotopes in the microbial dolomite
   are similar to the Ediacaran seawater, indicating the marine origin of
   the dolomitizing fluid. The carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopes of the
   fibrous and bladed dolomite cements are closed to the microbial matrix,
   which means that the diagenetic fluid is originated from the coeval
   seawater. The medium-coarse crystalline granular dolomite cement filled
   later than the fibrous cement, and the oxygen isotope of this cement was
   affected by the recrystallization caused by the temperature rise after
   burial. Finally, the saddle dolomite cement filled in fractures and
   veins. The delta C-13 (1.1 + 1.3 parts per thousand) value of saddle
   dolomite is similar to the matrix and early cement, while the delta O-18
   value is significantly negative (-10.9 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand). The
   high Mn (751.4 +/- 570.0 ppm), Fe (3872.5 +/- 3347.9 ppm)
   concentrations, homogenization temperature (194 +/- 26 degrees C)
   derived from the fluid inclusion and concomitant silicification suggest
   its formation of Fe-rich high-temperature burial fluid. For the
   microbialite-dominated reservoir, its initial porosity is high. The
   porosity and permeability characteristics show dissolution-specific
   behavior, suggesting a key factor of meteoric diagenesis in enhancing
   the reservoir. The early dolomitization enhance the resistance to the
   compaction and pressure dissolution. For the geophysical properties, the
   cementation of marine-derived fluids occupies the most pore spa ce
   (similar to 28.1\%), followed by compaction and stylolitization that
   reduce porosity by 10-13\%. The hydrothermal alteration, organic acid
   dissolution, and thermochemical sulfate reduction slightly influence the
   reservoir quality. This study provides further understanding on the
   mechanism of microbial reservoirs and enlightens the further exploration
   of Precambrian successions.},

Abstract = {Power feeding system is the most challenging technical issue to realize
   a mesh-like underwater cable network for scientific use. IEEE OES
   (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Oceanic Engineering
   Society) Japan Chapter organized a committee on the under-water
   cable-network for scientific seafloor monitoring, and conducted a
   technical feasibility study. In this paper, outline of the proposed
   power feeding system will be presented. In the feasibility study, three
   systems were proposed and compared, namely, (a) constant current (CC)
   power feeding system, (b) constant voltage (CV) power feeding system,
   and (c) hybrid system that consists of constant voltage feeding
   subsystem and constant current feeding subsystem. As a result of the
   feasibility study, the authors think the CC power feeding system is the
   most promising system for the proposed scientific cable network. The
   authors also proposed a new current to current converter that is the key
   devise for the CC power feeding system.},

Title = {Seasonal dynamics of carbon and nutrients from two contrasting tropical
   floodplain systems in the Zambezi River basin},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},

Pages = {7535-7547},
Abstract = {Floodplains are important biogeochemical reactors during fluvial
   transport of carbon and nutrient species towards the oceans. In the
   tropics and subtropics, pronounced rainfall seasonality results in
   highly dynamic floodplain biogeochemistry. The massive construction of
   dams, however, has significantly altered the hydrography and chemical
   characteristics of many (sub)tropical rivers. In this study, we compare
   organic-matter and nutrient biogeochemistry of two large, contrasting
   floodplains in the Zambezi River basin in southern Africa: the Barotse
   Plains and the Kafue Flats. Both systems are of comparable size but
   differ in anthropogenic influence: while the Barotse Plains are still in
   large parts pristine, the Kafue Flats are bordered by two hydropower
   dams.
   The two systems exhibit different flooding dynamics, with a larger
   contribution of floodplain-derived water in the Kafue Flats and a
   stronger peak flow in the Barotse Plains. Distinct seasonal differences
   have been observed in carbon and nutrient concentrations, loads, and
   export and retention behavior in both systems. The simultaneous
   retention of particulate carbon and nitrogen and the net export of
   dissolved organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen suggested that
   degradation of particulate organic matter was the dominant process
   influencing the river biogeochemistry during the wet season in the
   Barotse Plains and during the dry season in the Kafue Flats. Reverse
   trends during the dry season indicated that primary production was
   important in the Barotse Plains, whereas the Kafue Flats seemed to have
   both primary production and respiration occurring during the wet season,
   potentially occurring spatially separated in the main channel and on the
   floodplain.
   Carbon-to-nitrogen ratios of particulate organic matter showed that
   soil-derived material was dominant year-round in the Barotse Plains,
   whereas the Kafue Flats transported particulate organic matter that had
   been produced in the upstream reservoir during the wet season. Stable
   carbon isotopes suggested that inputs from the inundated floodplain to
   the particulate organic-matter pool were important during the wet
   season, whereas permanent vegetation contributed to the material
   transported during the dry season. This study revealed effects of dam
   construction on organic-matter and nutrient dynamics on the downstream
   floodplain that only become visible after longer periods, and it
   highlights how floodplains act as large biogeochemical reactors that can
   behave distinctly differently from the entire catchment.},

Title = {The effects of reduced end-tidal carbon dioxide tension on cerebral
   blood flow during heat stress},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {587},
Number = {15},
Pages = {3921-3927},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Passive heat stress reduces arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure
   (P-aCO2) as reflected by 3 to 5 Torr reductions in end-tidal carbon
   dioxide tension (P-ETCO2). Heat stress also reduces cerebrovascular
   conductance (CBVC) by up to 30\%. While P-aCO2 is a strong regulator of
   CBVC, it is unlikely that the relatively small change in P-ETCO2 during
   heating is solely responsible for the reductions in CBVC. This study
   tested the hypothesis that P-aCO2, referenced by P-ETCO2, is not the
   sole mechanism for reductions in CBVC during heat stress. Mean arterial
   blood pressure (MAP), P-ETCO2, middle cerebral artery blood velocity
   (MCA V-mean), and calculated CBVC (MCA V-mean/MAP) were assessed in
   seven healthy individuals, during three separate conditions performed
   sequentially: (1) normothemia, (2) control passive heat stress and (3)
   passive heat stress with P-ETCO2 clamped at the normothermic level
   (using a computer-controlled sequential gas delivery breathing circuit).
   MAP was similar in the three thermal conditions (P = 0.55). Control heat
   stress increased internal temperature similar to 1.3 degrees C, which
   resulted in decreases in P-ETCO2, MCA Vmean and calculated CBVC (P <
   0.001 for all variables). During heat stress + clamp conditions internal
   temperature remained similar to that during the control heat stress
   condition (P = 0.31). Heat stress + clamp successfully restored P-ETCO2
   to the normothermic level (P = 0.99) and increased MCA Vmean (P = 0.002)
   and CBVC (P = 0.008) relative to control heat stress. Despite
   restoration of P-ETCO2, MCA V-mean (P = 0.005) and CBVC (P = 0.03)
   remained reduced relative to normothermia. These results indicate that
   heat stress-induced reductions in P-aCO2, as referenced by P-ETCO2,
   contribute to the decrease in MCA Vmean and CBVC; however, other factors
   (e. g. perhaps elevated sympathetic nerve activity) are also involved in
   mediating this response.},

Abstract = {Admiralty Bay is located on the western side of King George Island.
   Although several research teams of different nationalities have carried
   out surveys in the region for decades, there are only two publications
   dealing with the seaweed flora of the bay. Here, we report on a
   taxonomic survey of the seaweeds we collected during the 25th Brazilian
   Antarctic Expedition (December 2006/November 2007). We discovered 42
   species (21 Rhodophyta, 14 Phaeophyceae, and 7 Chlorophyta),
   corresponding to an increase of about 31\% in the seaweed biodiversity
   hitherto known for the region. Considering that the Antarctic Peninsula,
   adjacent to King George Island seems to be one of the most rapidly
   warming spots on the planet, this kind of survey may provide a valuable
   tool for detecting eventual changes in seaweed biodiversity.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {74},
Number = {6},
Pages = {958-971},

Abstract = {Recruitment declines of anguillid eels are difficult to understand
   because both anthropogenic impacts on juveniles and adults and oceanic
   changes affecting larval survival or dispersal may be contributing.
   Anguillid larvae may passively disperse widely from offshore spawning
   areas but late-stage larvae or glass eels apparently must swim
   directionally to reach recruitment habitats. Their long larval durations
   vary among tropical (similar to 3-4 months) and temperate species (5
   months to >1 year). The bodies of anguillid leptocephali are filled with
   transparent gelatinous material, possibly reducing predation rates and
   providing an energy reserve for swimming and metamorphosis. Leptocephali
   feed on marine snow making their first-feeding success linked to primary
   producers contributing to marine snow production. Alternations between
   ubiquitous cyanobacteria dominating in low-nutrient conditions and
   eukaryotic phytoplankton such as diatoms that are important for marine
   snow production dominating in high-nutrient conditions may influence
   early-larval survival at first-feeding due to many eggs simultaneously
   hatching within sympatric spawning areas. Fewer spawning eels resulting
   from population reductions and variations in early-larval survival may
   offer some explanations for lower and fluctuating recruitment in recent
   decades.},

Title = {SEDIMENTOLOGY OF THE UPPER DINANTIAN CHARLESTOWN MAIN LIMESTONE -
   IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONTROLS ON CYCLOTHERM DEPOSITION, EASTERN MIDLAND
   VALLEY OF SCOTLAND},
Journal = {SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-31},
Abstract = {The Charlestown Main Limestone of the upper Dinantian (Brigantian) Lower
   Limestone Group was deposited in an intracratonic basin undergoing
   differential subsidence. In the eastern Midland Valley two areas of
   increased susidence are recognized, the Fife-Midlothian Low and the
   Central Low, separated by an area of reduced subsidence, the Burntisland
   High, centred on West Lothian and Central Fife. The Charlestown Main
   Limestone forms the base of a typical Yoredale cyclothem and the area of
   deposition was flanked to the NW and NE by fluvio-deltaic systems.
   Five distinct lithofacies are recognized within the Charlestown Main
   Limestone (CML); bioclastic wackestones, argillaceous lime mudstones,
   mottled limestones, bioclastic grainstone/packstones and carbonate
   buildups. Bioclastic wackestones are present at the base of the CML
   throughout the eastern Midland Valley. However, distinct regional
   differentiation of lithologies followed: buildups and bioclastic
   grainstones and packstones developed on, or near, the Burntisland High
   whereas fine terrigenous material (introduced from the flanking
   fluvio-deltaic systems) preferentially accumulated in the bounding lows
   where the CML is dominated by more argillaceous lithologies (the
   argillaceous lime mudstone and mottled limestone lithofacies).
   Progradation of prodeltaic muds from the NE curtailed carbonate
   deposition earlier in East Fife and accounts for the thinning of the CML
   towards this area. In distal areas, such as Midlothian, this
   progradation was heralded by an influx of fine terrigeneous sediment
   reflected in an increasingly argillaceous upper part of the limestone.
   Eustasy appears to have been the primary control on the deposition of
   the Charlestown Main Cyclothem: sea level rise resulted in transgression
   and initiation of carbonate sedimentation while delta progradation,
   which curtailed carbonate production, was probably triggered by a
   sea-level fall. Differential subsidence and autocyclic processes (such
   as major channel avulsion) were secondary factors and controlled the
   distribution and thickness of lithofacies within the limestone and the
   nature of the overlying deltaic sediments.},

   lower resolution seismic data also are used to understand the
   relationship between the basement and the sedimentary cover and to
   correlate the evolution of the rise and the shelf.
   On the basis of the acoustic character and the internal geometry, we
   recognise nine different sequences (named WL-S1-WL-S9, from the deepest
   to the shallowest) within the sedimentary section. Sequence WL-S1
   represents syn-rift sediments deposited within tilted blocks of
   sedimentary, crystalline and volcanic basement. Sequences WL-S2-WL-S9
   represent the post-rift sediments that show quite a complex
   architecture: sequence WL-S2 is a well-developed wedge downlapping onto
   the break-up unconformity; sequences WL-S3-WL-S7 are parts of a margin
   prograding/aggrading sequence during which large sediment ridges were
   deposited on the slope and rise. In particular, sequences WL-S5-WL-S7
   began with the deposition of a turbidite fan system (sequence WL-S5),
   that developed in a braided channel levee complex (WL-S6-WL-S7),
   dominated by downslope flows. Indirect correlation of the sequences
   WL-S4-WL-S6 with DSDP 269 about 600 km north of the study area suggests
   an early late Miocene age. Sequences WL-S8 and WL-S9 represent the
   smoothing and filling of the pre-existing morphology, in a generally
   low-energy environment with reduced bottom current activity. During this
   time, most of the sediment is deposited on the shelf and slope, while
   the rise is generally starved.
   Differences in downslope current energy and in sediment load are
   interpreted to reflect variation of the terrigenous input from the shelf
   to the rise through time. We suggest that channel-levee systems on the
   rise reflect an increase in sediment supply from the continental shelf
   during the Early Miocene, marking the growth of wet-based, temperate ice
   sheet on the near continent. The youngest sequences on the rise and
   shelf reflect decreased sediment supply to the rise that may be related
   to the transition from a temperate to a polar glacial system. (C) 2003

Abstract = {The most vulnerable global challenges faced today are of global warming
   and its effect on climate with deteriorating air quality. Air pollution
   is increasing and causing global warming, rise in sea level, change in
   seasonal patterns, rainfall pattern, extreme summer and winter
   temperatures, droughts and floods, etc. along with various endemic and
   epidemic diseases. There is a lack of understanding of air pollution and
   related health risk. The condition of air quality in India is poor. As
   many as 54\% of Indians live in cities not meeting NAAQS standards on
   fine particulate matter and none of the cities meeting WHO standards.
   The whole world, including India, is worried about the degradation of
   air quality which is affecting every form of life and material; hence
   there is a need for extensive study on the causes, effects and
   mitigation of air pollution. A scientific model is proposed to control
   environmental pollution. The ultimate solution of global warming climate
   change problem is making the people aware about the causes,
   consequences, and control of energy consumption through environmental
   consciousness.},

Title = {Acceleration loggers reveal fine-scale heterogeneity in wave exposure
   along an open coast},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {233},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Wave action shapes species distributions and ecological interactions
   within the intertidal- and shallow-subtidal zone. Empirical estimates of
   wave exposure within these zones are limited by logistical constraints
   and/or cost. Hydrodynamic models of wave action poorly resolve
   fine-scale heterogeneity in wave energetics that are important for
   biology. We used cost-effective accelerometers to continuously measure
   fine-scale wave exposure across 12 locations (i.e., two depth strata at
   each of six sites), over sixteen consecutive months. We categorised wave
   exposure at each of our sites a priori (as `exposed' or `sheltered')
   based on shore topography. We compared in situ measurements of
   acceleration with a nearby wave rider buoy and evaluated variation in
   water acceleration and frequency of large wave events among sites and
   between depths. Wave height data significantly correlated with
   accelerometer data confirming accelerometers sufficiently measure wave
   action. Our analyses indicate significant fine-scale variation in
   acceleration, and differences in timing and frequency of large wave
   events during the study period. In situ acceleration had limited
   correspondence with shore-based (a priori) assessments of wave exposure.
   These results demonstrate the spatial and temporal differences in water
   acceleration on the Wellington south coast and highlight the limitations
   of surface topography to predict fine-scale wave action. This study also
   emphasizes the need for fine scale wave action measurements to better
   explain patterns in intertidal/shallow subtidal organism traits.},

Title = {The modern record of ``concretionary{''} carbonate: Reassessing a
   discrepancy between modern sediments and the geologic record},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {420},
Pages = {77-87},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Carbonate concretions have long been recognized as common constituents
   of sedimentary rocks exposed in outcrop. Although formation mechanisms
   vary, organic matter degradation often plays a role in carbonate
   concretion authigenesis, providing a source of alkalinity for mineral
   production. Perhaps surprisingly, modern examples of concretionary
   carbonates are rarely identified in cores despite ubiquitous organic
   matter degradation in marine sediments. This has prompted the general
   notion that the modern record of concretionary carbonate does not mirror
   that preserved in the geologic record. Here, we present data from
   continental margin sediments that receive enhanced delivery of organic
   matter and demonstrate that concretionary carbonates are indeed
   recovered from many of these sites. In addition, sites where
   concretionary carbonates have not been recovered exhibit chemical
   profiles that suggest local authigenesis. The lack of concretion
   recovery from some locations likely reflects the poor potential for
   modern coring techniques to adequately capture concretions or provide
   context for their identification once recovered. Concretionary carbonate
   recovered from the Peru Margin, Cascadia, the Gulf of California, the
   Cariaco Basin and the western margin of southern Africa exhibit evidence
   for modern or very recent formation via methanogenesis or the anaerobic
   oxidation of methane. Demonstrably modern organotrophic sulfate
   reduction concretions have not been found. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {In today's global IT outsourcing relationships, individual employees
   need to operate effectively in culturally diverse environments. Such
   intercultural interactions can be especially challenging for members of
   IT service suppliers based in offshore locations. Through an in-depth
   qualitative case study of one of the largest China-based IT service
   firms with diverse clients from Japan, the United States, and China,
   this research elaborates the cultural sensemaking activities of the
   supplier's individual employees. Specifically, drawing on the dynamic
   constructivist view of culture, this study develops the construct of
   ``cultural frames{''} in the context of global IT outsourcing to
   characterize the knowledge structures guiding an individual's
   collaboration with diverse clients. A portfolio of cultural frames
   emerges and evolves through the individual's cultural sensemaking
   activities, which consist of the iterative enactment, alignment, and
   retention of cultural frames. In the cultural sensemaking process, the
   activity of frame bridging, in particular, creates significant value for
   the outsourcing relationship, and is especially salient among bicultural
   employees.},

Journal = {MATERIALS},

Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Pages = {6811-6831},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Since the introduction of general European rules for the design of
   aluminium structures, specific rules for the design of aluminum stressed
   skin panels are available. These design rules have been used for the
   optimization of two extrusion products: one for explosions and wind load
   governing and one for explosions and floor load governing. The optimized
   extrusions fulfill Class 3 section properties, leading to weight
   reductions up to 25\% of regularly-used shear panel sections. When the
   design is based on Class 4 section properties, even more weight
   reduction may be reached. The typical failure mode of the optimized
   stressed skin panels depends on the applied height of the hat
   stiffeners. For sections using relatively high hat stiffeners, failure
   is introduced by yielding of the heat-affected zone. For this type of
   cross-section, Eurocode 9 design rules and numerical calculations show
   very good agreement. For sections using relatively low hat stiffeners,
   failure is introduced by global buckling. For this type of
   cross-section, Eurocode 9 gives rather conservative results.},

Title = {Submesoscale Currents Modulate the Seasonal Cycle of Nutrients and
   Productivity in the California Current System},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the California Current, subduction by mesoscale eddies removes
   nutrients from the coastal surface layer, counteracting upwelling and
   quenching productivity. Submesoscale eddies are also ubiquitous in the
   California Current, but their biogeochemical role has not been
   quantified yet in the region. Here, we present results from a
   physical-biogeochemical model of the California Current run at a
   resolution of 1 km, sufficient to represent submesoscale dynamics. By
   comparing it with a coarser simulation run at 4 km resolution, we
   demonstrate the importance of submesoscale currents for the seasonal
   cycles of nutrients and organic matter and highlight the existence of
   different regimes along a cross-shore gradient. In the productive
   coastal region, submesoscale currents intensify quenching and reduce
   productivity, further counteracting wind-driven upwelling. In the
   offshore oligotrophic region, submesoscale currents enhance the upward
   transport of nutrients, fueling a dramatic increase in new production.
   These effects are modulated by seasonality, strengthening near the coast
   during upwelling and offshore in wintertime. The intensification of the
   transport by submesoscale eddies drives an adjustment of the planktonic
   ecosystem, with a reduction of plankton biomass, productivity, and size
   near the coast and an increase offshore. In contrast, organic matter
   export by sinking particles and subduction of detritus and living cells
   are enhanced nearly everywhere. Similar processes are likely important
   in other regions characterized by seasonal upwelling, for example, other
   eastern boundary upwelling systems.},

Title = {Optimal probabilistic reliability-oriented planning of islanded
   microgrids considering hydrogen-based storage systems, hydrogen
   vehicles, and electric vehicles under various climatic conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {525},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Much attention has been paid to the deployment of Hydrogen storage
   systems (HSSs) and Hydrogen vehicles (HVs) in the modernized energy
   system. However, a research gap exists in the literature about optimal
   probabilistic planning of microgrids (MGs) equipped with HSS,
   considering the uncertainties of renewable energy resources and electric
   vehicle (EV) and HV owners' behaviors. The main purpose of this research
   is to fill such a gap by developing a new probabilistic optimization
   problem to determine the capacity of Hydrogen-based MGs' sub-systems.
   Another contribution is to consider the reliability constraints and loss
   of energy cost (LOEC) in the MGs' total net present cost (TNPC). The
   Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) are
   used to model stochastic behaviors and solve the proposed probabilistic
   optimization problem. This paper studies different actual climates of
   Iran based on historical data, while various coordinated/uncoordinated
   charging modes of EVs and HVs are examined. Test results infer that a
   significant inaccuracy (more than 4.66\% depends on the climate
   conditions and vehicle scenarios) occurs due to neglecting the
   uncertainties. The sensitivity analyses imply that the reliability
   constraints, LOEC, and their interactions might affect the MGs' optimal
   design.},

Abstract = {Mechanical seals play a critical role in the functionality of diverse
   joint mechanical elements and solid structures. Their main functions are
   the prevention of mass transfer, maintaining stable pressure between the
   joints, as well as avoiding external contamination. Yet, current sealing
   technology is unable to provide a sealing solution in which the pressure
   applied between the mechanical elements is monitored to ensure sealing
   functionality. In this work, the use of square-shaped nanocomposite
   sensors made of polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS)/carbon nanotubes (CNT)
   encapsulated in neat PDSMS is investigated and its performance against
   high pressure is evaluated. The sensing behavior was found to be
   significantly different depending on the pressure level (below or above
   1.5 MPa), while adjusting the CNT content improves the sensitivity at
   higher loads. This kind of smart seals based on nanocomposite pressure
   sensors can be applied in different fields of industry, such as
   manufacturing, automotive, aerospace and even energy as smart seal for
   monitoring in-between plates' pressure in hydrogen fuel cells.},

Abstract = {The advance of our understanding on coal-gas interactions has changed
   the way how we treat coalbed methane: from a mining hazard to an
   unconventional gas resource to a concurrent by-product of CO2
   sequestration. When solid coal is removed from or a liquid
   (supercritical carbon dioxide) is injected into a coal seam, a chain of
   reactions is induced: gas sorption and flow, coal deformation, porosity
   change, permeability modification, and so on. In this lecture, we define
   this chain of reactions as coupled multiphysics. The term ``coupled
   multiphysics{''} implies that one physical process affects the
   initiation and progress of another. The individual processes, in the
   absence of full consideration of cross couplings, form the basis of very
   well-known disciplines such as elasticity, hydrology and heat transfer.
   Therefore, the inclusion of cross couplings is the key to mathematically
   formulate the coupled multiphysics of coal-gas interactions. Although
   coal-gas interactions have been comprehensively investigated, all of
   these prior studies focus on one or more individual processes. They
   usually assume that these interactions are under conditions of invariant
   total stress where effective stresses scale inversely with applied pore
   pressures. Here we started with a new cross coupling relation between
   coal porosity and four (mechanical, hydrological, chemical and thermal)
   volumetric strains under variable stress conditions. A cubic relation
   between porosity and permeability is then introduced to relate coal
   storage capability (changing porosity) to coal transport property
   (changing permeability) also under variable stress conditions. These two
   relations (porosity model and permeability model) have been the key
   cross couplings that couple the multiphysics of coal-gas interactions.
   We implemented these two relations into a series of finite element
   models for the coupled multiphysics of coal-gas interactions from single
   poroelastic model to dual poroelastic model. These models couple the
   transport and sorption of a compressible fluid within a deformable
   medium where the effects of deformation are rigorously accommodated.
   This relaxes the prior assumption that total stresses remain constant
   and allows exploration of the full range of mechanical boundary
   conditions from invariant stress to restrained displacement. We applied
   these models to investigate the injectivity of CO2 under different in
   situ conditions, and reported the results in this lecture.},

Abstract = {Inuit are at the forefront of ecosystem change in the Arctic, yet their
   observations and interpretations are rarely reported in the literature.
   Climate change impacts are rapidly unfolding in the Arctic and there is
   a need for monitoring and reporting unique observations. In this short
   communication, we draw upon observations and experiential knowledge from
   western Canadian Inuit (Inuvialuit) harvesters combined with a
   scientific assessment to describe and interpret an unusual account of
   gelatinous organisms at high densities during summer 2019 in eastern
   Amundsen Gulf, near Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories. The gelatinous
   organisms were identified as primarily appendicularian larvaceans
   (Oikopleura spp., pelagic tunicates) and their gelatinous ``houses{''}.
   The organisms were observed within 3-5 km of the marine coast, from
   similar to 1-2 m below the surface and to depths of similar to 30 m with
   an underwater camera. Pelagic tunicates have rarely been documented in
   the eastern Amundsen Gulf and, to our knowledge, this was the first time
   these organisms had been noted by the people of Ulukhaktok. The pelagic
   tunicates clogged subsistence fishing nets and Inuvialuit harvesters
   were concerned about negative impacts to marine mammals and fishes,
   which they depend on for food security. These interpretations highlight
   major knowledge gaps for appendicularians in the Arctic.},

Abstract = {1. Eradication of a single pest species from a multiply invaded island
   system may have unpredicted and detrimental impacts. Bergstrom et al.
   (2009) describe damage to vegetation following an increase in the number
   of rabbits on Macquarie Island. They propose that the increase in rabbit
   numbers was caused solely by eradication of cats.
   2. However, their modelling is. awed and their conclusion that cats were
   controlling rabbit numbers is unsupported. We suggest the increase was
   because of some combination of four factors: reduced releases of Myxoma
   virus, abundant food after 20 years of vegetation recovery, release from
   cat predation and climate variability.
   3. Recent high numbers of rabbits on Macquarie Island are not
   unprecedented; vegetation has been damaged in the past but has
   recovered. Rabbit numbers appear to be in decline again in the absence
   of both cats and Myxoma releases, suggesting that other factors can
   contribute to regulation of rabbit numbers in this system.
   4. We do not agree with the implication that pest management could have
   been better integrated. Eradication techniques for rodents and rabbits
   on an island the size of Macquarie were unavailable when cat eradication
   was deemed necessary. The benefits to seabirds of cat eradication have
   been rapid. Our analysis further highlights the complexity of multiply
   invaded island ecosystems.},

Title = {Temporal Dynamics of Soil Virus and Bacterial Populations in
   Agricultural and Early Plant Successional Soils},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {As reported in many aquatic environments, recent studies in terrestrial
   ecosystems implicate a role for viruses in shaping the structure,
   function, and evolution of prokaryotic soil communities. However, given
   the heterogeneity of soil and the physical constraints (i.e., pore-scale
   hydrology and solid-phase adsorption of phage and host cells) on the
   mobility of viruses and bacteria, phage-host interactions likely differ
   from those in aquatic systems. In this study, temporal changes in the
   population dynamics of viruses and bacteria in soils under different
   land management practices were examined. The results showed that
   bacterial abundance was significantly and positively correlated to both
   virus and inducible prophage abundance. Bacterial and viral abundance
   were also correlated with soil organic carbon and nitrogen content as
   well as with C:N ratio. The seasonal variability in viral abundance
   increased with soil organic carbon content. The prokaryotic community
   structure was influenced more by land use than by seasonal variation
   though considerable variation was evident in the early plant
   successional and grassland sites. The free extracellular viral
   communities were also separated by land use, and the forest soil viral
   assemblage exhibiting the most seasonal variability was more distinct
   from the other sites. Viral assemblages from the agricultural soils
   exhibited the least seasonal variability. Similar patterns were observed
   for inducible prophage viral assemblages. Seasonal variability of viral
   assemblages was greater in mitomycin-C (mitC) induced prophages than in
   extracellular viruses irrespective of land use and management. Taken
   together, the data suggest that soil viral production and decay are
   likely balanced but there was clear evidence that the structure of viral
   assemblages is influenced by land use and by season.},

   alterniflora community (during invasion, DI stage), were studied using
   the space-for-time substitution method. Results showed that the
   decomposition of C. malaccensis was 59.79\% faster than that of S.
   alterniflora, which was mainly related to the great variations in the
   C/N and lignin. Compared with S. alterniflora, the N (nitrogen) and S
   (sulfur) concentrations of litter in C. malaccensis were significantly
   higher. The C, N, and S stocks increased as the C. malaccensis was being
   invaded or after complete invasion by S. alterniflora, which might be
   ascribed to the higher mass remaining in S. alterniflora. Compared with
   S. alterniflora in DI stage, the higher C/N and C/S ratios might explain
   the higher C, N, and S stocks in S. alterniflora in AI stage. In
   summary, the invasion of S. alterniflora reduces the decomposition rate
   and nutrient release of litter.},

Abstract = {The C-14 and the C-13 methods are routinely used for measuring
   phytoplankton production. However, few systematic comparisons of
   estimates using the two approaches have been conducted. The present
   comparison is based on 257 pairs of samples, representing 1 year of
   monthly sampling at 10 depths in the euphotic zone. Data, obtained by
   the same operators following a standard protocol, were collected at
   three different stations on the Scotian Shelf (Northwestern Atlantic
   Ocean). Overall agreement between the two methods was good (r = 0.827).
   However, relative differences between the two sets of estimates were not
   randomly distributed in time and space. Three factors (photic depth,
   station and sampling date), identified to explain the observed
   differences, were included in a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   using relative differences as the covariate. Following this ANOVA, the
   whole set was split into three subsets. For the two subsets where the
   above identified factors did not have any significant effect, the
   distribution of relative differences was narrower than these for the
   whole data set. Significant effects of the three factors persisted for
   the third subset and relative differences exhibited wide variations.
   Possible explanations for the observed differences include (i) the
   volume of incubation bottles, (ii) the incubation temperature and (iii)
   the absence of measurements of dark uptake.},

Abstract = {Regional scale management of coastal aquifers for control of saltwater
   intrusion is a challenging problem, requiring solution of optimization
   and simulation models. Simulation of density dependent nonlinear flow
   and transport processes in a coastal aquifer requires the solution of
   coupled flow and transport equations. Prescription of optimal spatial
   and temporal management strategy for coastal aquifers is possible by
   utilizing a linked simulation-optimization approach. However, such
   linked models require the iterative and numerical simulation of the flow
   and transport processes numerous number of times within an optimization
   algorithm. In order to ensure computational feasibility and efficiency,
   trained and tested surrogate models with acceptable accuracy and
   efficiency can be used as approximate simulators within an optimization
   algorithm. In this study, an efficient surrogate model based on ensemble
   of Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is developed and
   evaluated as an approximate simulator of the physical processes of a
   multi-layered coastal aquifer. The management of coastal aquifers is
   also multiple-objective in nature. Therefore, the developed surrogate
   model is linked to a Controlled Elitist Multi-objective Genetic
   Algorithm (CEMGA). Ensembles of the surrogate models (En-ANFIS) are
   utilized in order to incorporate uncertainties in prediction using
   surrogate models. The proposed simulation-optimization framework is
   implemented in a parallel computing platform to achieve further
   computational efficiency. The performance of the multi-objective
   management model is evaluated for an illustrative study area. The
   evaluation results indicate that ANFIS based ensemble-modelling approach
   together with CEMGA is able to evolve reliable strategies for this
   multiple objective management of coastal aquifers.},

Abstract = {Coral-algae symbiosis is a key feature of tropical corals and is highly
   dependent on the efficiency with which solar energy is attenuated by the
   coral. Scleractinian corals are among the most efficient light
   collectors in nature because of the modulation of the internal light
   field in the coral skeleton. Interestingly, coral skeleton particles
   composing the sandy bottoms in reef margins sustain these optical
   characteristics. In the present study, we examined two free-living coral
   species - Heterocyathus aequicostatus (Caryophyllidae) and Heteropsammia
   cochlea (Dendrophylliidae) - common on biogenic coarse carbonate sand of
   the Great Barrier Reef but absent from fine sand at the same depth. In
   coarse carbonate sand, light penetrates a few millimeters below the
   surface and propagates along horizontal distances of a few centimeters.
   In fine sand, almost all of the light is reflected back to the water
   column. For photosynthetic sand-dwelling organisms such as the studied
   species, with over one-third of their surface area facing the substrate,
   light flux to their underside may be beneficial. A correlation was found
   between the diameter of these corals and the distance that light may
   travel in the sand under the coral. Laboratory and field measurements
   show that the symbiotic algae on the underside of the corallites are
   photosynthetically active even when the coral is partially buried,
   implying sufficient light penetration. Other organisms in the study
   site, such as fungid corals and foraminiferans, with different
   morphologies, have different light-trapping strategies but are also
   photosynthesizing on their underside. The importance of the substrate
   type to the performance of the three main partners of the symbiosis
   (coral, endosymbiotic algae and a sipunculan worm) is highlighted, and
   is a striking example of co-evolution.},

Abstract = {The invasive alien seaweed Rugulopteryx okamurae (R.o.) has spread
   quickly through the Mediterranean Sea causing an unprecedented
   ecological impact. A solution integrated into a circular economy model
   is needed in order to curb the negative effects of its presence.
   Anaerobic digestion (AD) is proposed as a feasible process able to
   transform biomass into renewable energy. Nevertheless, in order to
   improve the methane yield and surpass the drawbacks associated with AD
   processes, this research proposes a thermal pretreatment and a new
   developed method where the macroalgae is mechanically pretreated with
   zeolite. Chemical and microstructure characterization of the algal
   biomass after pre -treatments involved scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infra-red
   spectroscopy (FTIR). The highest methane yields of 240 (28) and 250 (20)
   NLCH4 kg-1 VSadded were obtained with the new mechanical pretreatment
   and the thermal pretreatment at 120 degrees C for 45 min without
   zeolite, achieving a 35 \% improvement against the non-pretreated algae.
   A direct relationship between the crystallinity index of the samples and
   methane production was observed. The experimental data of methane
   production versus time were found to be in ac-cordance with both
   first-order kinetic and Transference Function mathematical models.},

Abstract = {Authigenic carbonate associated with anaerobic oxidation of methane
   (AOM), usually via microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) or ferric iron
   reduction, is generally characterized by extremely low delta C-13 values
   (<-30 parts per thousand, VPDB). This has been used as one of the major
   diagnostic features for the recognition of hydrocarbon seep carbonate in
   the geological past. Previous reports on Precambrian authigenic
   carbonates are rare, limiting our understanding of the effects of their
   deposition on the Earth's carbon isotopic mass balance. In this study,
   mainly based on petrographic features and pronounced negative delta C-13
   values as low as -38.1 parts per thousand, we discovered authigenic
   calcite cement immediately above the cap dolostone in the basal
   Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in the Jiulongwan section, Yangtze Gorges
   area, South China. Our observations not only provide direct evidence for
   the involvement of AOM during carbonate precipitation in the early
   Ediacaran (similar to 635 Ma), but also suggest that the seawater
   sulfate concentrations in the early Ediacaran may have been higher than
   previously thought. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate change in the rocky intertidal zone: predicting and measuring
   the body temperature of a keystone predator},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {374},
Pages = {43-56},
Abstract = {Forecasting the responses of populations and ecosystems to climate
   change requires that we understand both the direct effects of
   temperature on organism physiology and the indirect effects of
   temperature change on interactions such as predation and competition.
   The sea star Pisaster ochraceus is a keystone predator in the rocky
   intertidal zone with a broad geographic distribution along the west
   coast of North America. We developed a mechanistic heat budget model
   that uses environmental data to predict the body temperatures of P.
   ochraceus. Model accuracy was verified by comparing model output
   temperatures, generated using measured microclimatic data as input, to
   the temperatures of live P. ochraceus in the field. The average absolute
   errors between predicted and measured body temperatures were similar to
   1 degrees C. To continuously monitor sea star body temperatures in the
   field, we developed data loggers that thermally mimic P. ochraceus.
   Accuracy of these biomimetic loggers was tested by comparing logger
   temperatures to P. ochraceus body temperatures, and they were found to
   mimic body temperatures within similar to 1 degrees C. Loggers were
   deployed at different tidal heights at a site in Bamfield, British
   Columbia, Canada, to investigate within-site body temperature variation.
   We also explored the relationship between body temperature and vertical
   distribution of P, ochraceus. A negative correlation was found between
   maximum body temperatures on Day n and the number of sea stars found in
   the intertidal on Day n + 1. These results suggest that temperatures
   reached during aerial exposure at low tide, at least in part, may
   determine where in the intertidal zone these sea stars are located,
   which could affect their foraging limits.},

Title = {Feeding - Cleaning Trade-Off: Manta Ray ``Decision-Making{''} as a
   Conservation Tool},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Identifying critical aggregation sites and behavioral patterns of
   imperiled species contributes to filling knowledge gaps essential for
   their conservation. Manta rays present a prominent example of such
   species, the populations of which are declining globally due to directed
   fishery, by-catch, and other anthropogenic stressors. Our goal was to
   explore manta ray aggregation sites in the Philippines in order to
   determine the factors governing the mantas' visits - a knowledge gap
   essential to understand manta ecology, facilitate ecosystem-based
   fishery management, and promote sustainable manta-based ecotourism.
   Diving surveys, environmental conditions assessment, and autonomous
   cameras were employed to study manta behavior and visit patterns to a
   cleaning station cluster on a commonly fished seamount, visited by both
   Mobula birostris and Mobula alfredi. Our findings reveal several
   environmental conditions (e.g., sea state, moon illumination, and flow)
   that serve as predictors of manta presence/absence at the site. We
   suggest that these conditions affect both the behavior of the manta's
   food (i.e., the spatial distribution of plankton) and the cleaning
   effectiveness of the cleaner wrasse, which consequently influence manta
   activity. The findings suggest a trade-off between cleaning and
   foraging: i.e., mantas tend to visit the cleaning stations when
   environmental conditions are less favorable for foraging but suitable
   for effective cleaning; while being absent from the cleaning stations
   when environmental conditions form plankton aggregations, ideal for
   efficient feeding. This study sheds light on manta behavior and habitat
   use on dynamic, small spatio-temporal scales (i.e., hundreds of meters
   to a few kilometers, hours to days). The acquired data may be applied in
   the planning of marine protected areas and in fishery management (e.g.,
   to reduce the chances of manta bycatch by limiting fishing activities to
   periods of manta absence) as well as contribute to enhancing sustainable
   exploitation, such as ecotourism, by increasing the chances of diving
   encounters with manta rays.},

Title = {A pulse in the delivery of ice-rafted debris at site 704 in the

Journal = {MARINE GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-48},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Termination V, the transition from glacial marine isotope stage 12 to
   interglacial stage 11-425 ka, is the largest deglaciation of the late
   Pleistocene and culminated with temperatures potentially warmer than
   present. Coastal geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence provides
   estimates of a sea-level high-stand 20 m above present at the time
   (Hearty et al. in Geology 27(4): 375-378, 1999). Such sea-level rise
   would require disintegration of the Greenland Ice Sheet and West
   Antarctic Ice Sheet as well as part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet
   (Raynaud et al. in Earth's climate and orbital eccentricity: the marine
   isotope stage 11 question. Geophysical monograph 137. American
   Geophysical Union, Washington, 2003). Lithic fragments in deep-sea
   sediments > 150 mu m at Site 704 in the South Atlantic Ocean were
   quantified. A large multipronged peak in concentration of this
   ice-rafted debris consisting of clear minerals, rose-colored transparent
   minerals, and ash punctuates glacial Termination V. It coincides with a
   brief two-pronged 1 parts per thousand reversal to heavier isotopic
   values from similar to 2.4 to similar to 3.4 parts per thousand at
   similar to 416 ka interpreted to reflect cooling resulting from influx
   of a large number of icebergs. The peak in ice-rafted debris also
   coincides with a 1 parts per thousand decrease in carbon isotopic ratios
   interrupting the similar to 2 parts per thousand increase in carbon
   isotope values across the entirety of Termination V. This is interpreted
   to reflect a reduction or shutdown in North Atlantic Deep Water
   formation and attendant Circumpolar Deep Water upwelling at the site and
   is also consistent with a shift in storage of carbon and carbonate from
   the deep sea to continental shelves resulting from a dramatic sea-level
   high-stand. Consequently, the lithic record at Site 704 lends support
   for the upper end of sea-level estimates based upon land-based evidence
   that requires a substantial contribution from the East Antarctic Ice
   Sheet. However, caution is warranted as differences with lithic records
   from Site 1089, 1090 and 1094 suggest sea-surface temperatures may have
   also affected lithic concentration through controls on iceberg
   trajectories and decay.},

Abstract = {Ecological problems associated with current antifouling technologies
   have increased interest in the natural strategies that marine organisms
   use to keep their surfaces clean and free from fouling. Bacteria
   isolated from living surfaces in the marine environment have been shown

   from the cells and culture supernatant of two bacterial strains, FS-55
   and NudMB50-11, isolated from surface of the seaweed, Fucus serratus,
   and the nudibranch, Archidoris pseudoargus, respectively, were extracted
   using solid phase extraction. The extracts were combined with acrylic
   base paint resin and assayed for antifouling activity by measuring their
   ability to inhibit the growth of fouling bacteria. These formulations
   were found to be active against fouling bacteria isolated from marine
   surfaces. The formulation of antifouling paints that incorporate marine
   microbial natural products is reported here for the first time. This is
   a significant advance towards the production of an environmentally
   friendly antifouling paint that utilises a sustainable supply of natural

Abstract = {One of the major concerns for pipeline operators is to efficiently
   monitor the events happening over the pipeline corridor, or right-of-way
   (ROW). Monitoring of the ROW is an important part of ensuring the safe
   and efficient transportation of oil and gas. Events occurring within
   this zone require rapid assessment and, if necessary, mitigation. These
   events could be physical intrusions such as encroachment from growing
   settlements, impact of vegetation, pipeline leakage or geoenvironmental
   hazards.
   Analysis of satellite imagery can provide an efficient and low cost
   solution to access and quantify change across the ROW. Examining these
   events over a periodic interval requires implementation of specific
   methods that can support the ongoing monitoring and decision making
   practices. In this context, satellite remote sensing images can provide
   a low cost and efficient solution for monitoring the physical and
   environmental impacts over the ROW of pipeline system.
   This paper reports on the development of a methodological approach for
   environmental change analysis using high resolution satellite images
   that can help decision making in pipeline systems. Analysis results and
   maps produced during this work provide an insight into landcover change
   over the study area and expected to support in on-going pipeline
   management practices.
   Two methods, Vegetation index differencing and post classification
   comparison have been implemented to identify change areas in the
   Taranaki region of the North Island of New Zealand. Vegetation index
   differencing with NDVI shows increase or decrease of overall vegetation
   within the study area. Special focus was given on large area increase
   and decrease with area threshold value above 0.2 hectare.
   Detailed analysis of change was conducted with post classification
   comparison method that uses land cover classification results of year
   2010 and 2013. An overall change of 10\% has been observed throughout
   the study area with large area change of approximately 5\%. Results
   obtained from post classification comparison method were further
   analyzed with 6 focus areas and compared with the existing soil data and
   rainfall data.
   The methods adopted during this study are expected to provide a base for
   environmental change analysis in similar pipeline corridors to support
   decision making.},

Abstract = {Rapidly changing heat fluxes deposited on the limiter blades are
   observed during disruptions by infrared (IR) scanners. These scanners
   are a suitable tool for the analysis of these heat fluxes because they
   provide both spatial and temporal information with sufficient
   resolution. Several new features of the power flux to the plasma facing
   surfaces during a disruption have been found. The disruptive heat flux
   occurs on three different time-scales. The fastest ones are for heat
   bursts with a duration of less-than-or-equal-to 0.1 ms; several of these
   bursts form a thermal quench of about one millisecond duration, and some
   of these thermal quenches are found to occur during the current decay
   phase. Power flux densities of the order of 50 MW/m2 have been observed
   during a burst. The spatial extent of the area on which this power is
   deposited during a burst is larger than or equal to the size of half an
   ALT-II blade, i.e. about 1 m in the toroidal direction. Simultaneous
   measurements with two cameras show that the correlation length of a
   single burst is smaller than half the toroidal circumference, probably
   of the order of half a blade or a full blade length. This is consistent
   with plasma islands of low mode number. The typical heat deposition
   patterns at the limiter blades for normal discharges are preserved
   during a disruption. The magnetic structure near the plasma surface can
   therefore not be destroyed completely during the thermal quench. The
   power flux follows the field lines. However, the power e-folding length
   is about a factor of two to three times larger than under normal
   discharge conditions.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the characteristics of infragravity waves (hereafter
   IGWs) based on field observations collected near the plunging cliffs of
   Chabahar bay, Iran. Observations were made near Chabahar city during the
   summer monsoon season of 2018. The wave climate included two different
   durations of sea and swell predominance, with a maximum wave height
   reaching 2.5 m. Concurrent with the duration of the sea predominance,
   the ratio of IGW to swell wave height had an insensitive fluctuation
   against tidal variations, while this ratio had a strong negative
   correlation with tidal level during the high swell condition. The
   investigation of directional wave energy distribution revealed two
   correlated trends of shoreward and seaward IGWs with the wave regime.
   Larger values of the IGW reflection coefficients were observed during
   high sea wave conditions compared with high swell conditions. The IGW
   reflection coefficients decreased against swell energy growth with a
   logarithmic trend. The bound IGW energy fraction was studied using
   bispectral analysis. It is demonstrated that the maximum values of this
   parameter corresponded to high swell waves observed within low ebbs of
   the spring tide. The insignificant values of bound IGW energy fraction
   and the non-extended surf-zone revealed that most of the released IGWs
   originated from offshore and intermediate water depths. In addition, it
   was revealed that the inverse tidal trend of normalized IGW by swell
   height was due to bound IGW enhancement during ebb periods as a result
   of the nonlinear coupling of swell waves.},

Abstract = {This study aims to highlight how the Basilicata ``Coast to Coast{''}
   FLAG has an important role in local sustainable development actions
   using a bottom-up approach. The FLAG represents one of many significant
   innovative elements in the Lucanian coastal territory. New development
   activities stemming from European Sea Policies, favor the fishing and
   aquaculture sector and represents a driving force in economic
   development employment, tourism and social-culture growth along the
   Lucanian coasts with strong rural traditions.
   Integrated territorial planning approach is required using an
   intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach, and a variety of
   programming tools can be integrated in order to achieve common
   objectives. Informal and formal collaboration between the FLAG and the
   Lucanian LAGs is necessary in order to carry out joint projects which
   are able to connect the blue economy with other productive sectors.},

Abstract = {In Miydzyzdroje, a coastal town in Poland, significant cliff retreat has
   been observed in recent times. It used to be considered mainly a
   response to storm events with particularly high water levels and wave
   energy. However, morphology of cliff coasts is shaped not only by the
   most extreme storm surges or by a number of accompanying processes such
   as precipitation. Much wider effects are now being linked to the
   occurrence of series of subsequent storms. This research uses a set of
   five terrestrial LiDAR surveys carried out between November 2016 and
   April 2017 to determine short-term cliff erosion associated with two
   major storm surges and several smaller storms. The surveys covered the
   whole cliff profile as well as the topography of the adjacent beach.
   Results indicate a considerable reduction in beach levels as a first
   important effect. Frequency of the storm events prevented the beach from
   recovering between the surges, allowing the waves to directly attack the
   cliff base. Consequently, the cliff foot line retreated up to 4.7 m.
   This resulted in an erosion volume exceeding 25.000 m(3) within 5
   sections of the coastal cliff analysed, which are 500 m long in total.
   This work demonstrates that the development of the coastline is not only
   directly linked with the rate of erosion at given storm parameters. More
   importantly, the frequency of extreme events has to be considered.},

Abstract = {High-resolution palynological, charcoal, and sedimentological analysis
   of a sediment core from Kealia Pond, Maui, coupled with archaeological
   and historical records, provides a detailed chronology of vegetation and
   climate change since before human arrival. These records provide new
   evidence for human-environment linkages during the Hawaiian Polynesian
   period and subsequent European period. Prior to human arrival, the
   charcoal record indicates that native forests were subject to natural
   fires. A shift from dry to wet climate conditions marked the beginning
   of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) as evidenced by a precipitation
   reconstruction based on a pollen abundance index. Charcoal increases
   around AD 840-1140 signal the presence of Polynesians in the Kealia Pond
   region, but there is no evidence of rapid and extensive forest clearance
   immediately after Polynesian arrival. The greatest reduction in pollen
   diversity at Kealia Pond occurred during the European period (post
   1778), at which point the pollen record indicates that montane forest
   taxa declined, native lowland taxa disappeared from the record, and
   nonnative taxa Prosopis and Batis made their first appearances. Accounts
   by early Europeans during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries provide
   a historical narrative supporting the interpretation that European
   impacts on vegetation were widespread, whereas in this region of Maui,
   Polynesian impacts on vegetation appear largely confined to the
   lowlands.},

Abstract = {The salmon louse is a highly abundant ectoparasitic copepod of salmonids
   in the North Pacific and Atlantic. Widespread and rapid development of
   resistance to chemical agents used to delouse salmonids on marine farms
   is now threatening the continued development of the aquaculture industry
   and have served as a potent catalyst for the development of alternative
   pest management strategies. These include freshwater and warm-water
   treatments to which the louse is sensitive. However, given the
   well-documented evolutionary capacity of this species, the risk of
   developing tolerance towards these environmental treatments cannot be
   dismissed. Two common-garden experiments were performed using
   full-sibling families of lice identified by DNA parentage testing to
   investigate whether one of the fundamental premises for evolution, in
   this context genetic variation in the capacity of coping with fresh or
   warm water, exists within this species. Significant differences in
   survival were observed among families in both experiments, although for
   the salinity experiment, it was not possible to unequivocally
   disentangle background mortality from treatment-induced mortality. Thus,
   our data demonstrate genetic variation in tolerance of warm water and
   are suggestive of genetic variation in salinity tolerance. We conclude
   that extensive use of these environmental-based treatments to delouse
   salmonids on commercial farms may drive lice towards increased
   tolerance.},

Title = {Impacts on the Deep-Sea Ecosystem by a Severe Coastal Storm},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Major coastal storms, associated with strong winds, high waves and
   intensified currents, and occasionally with heavy rains and flash
   floods, are mostly known because of the serious damage they can cause
   along the shoreline and the threats they pose to navigation. However,
   there is a profound lack of knowledge on the deep-sea impacts of severe
   coastal storms. Concurrent measurements of key parameters along the
   coast and in the deep-sea are extremely rare. Here we present a unique
   data set showing how one of the most extreme coastal storms of the last
   decades lashing the Western Mediterranean Sea rapidly impacted the
   deep-sea ecosystem. The storm peaked the 26th of December 2008 leading
   to the remobilization of a shallow-water reservoir of marine organic
   carbon associated with fine particles and resulting in its
   redistribution across the deep basin. The storm also initiated the
   movement of large amounts of coarse shelf sediment, which abraded and
   buried benthic communities. Our findings demonstrate, first, that severe
   coastal storms are highly efficient in transporting organic carbon from
   shallow water to deep water, thus contributing to its sequestration and,
   second, that natural, intermittent atmospheric drivers sensitive to
   global climate change have the potential to tremendously impact the
   largest and least known ecosystem on Earth, the deep-sea ecosystem.},

Abstract = {In this study, a coordinated control scheme is proposed for sharing
   harmonics compensation effort among voltage and current controlled mode
   (VCM and CCM) inverters in islanded microgrids. In this method, the
   voltage harmonics compensation of sensitive bus (SB) is achieved by
   using secondary control as well as virtual impedance and admittance
   loops in primary control of VCM and CCM units. The limited capacity of
   the inverter is taken into account for harmonics compensation.
   Photovoltaic (PV) systems are considered as CCM units. The harmonics
   compensation is mainly performed by VCM inverters. However, in order to
   prevent these units from overloading, the PV interfacing inverters (CCM
   units) are called to collaborate in harmonics compensation whenever
   needed. The results of simulation study in Matlab/Simulink show the
   effectiveness of this method in coordination of CCM and VCM units.},

Title = {Optimal sizing and control strategy of isolated grid with wind power and
   energy storage system},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {407-415},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Integrating renewable energy and energy storage system provides a
   prospective way for power supply of remote areas. Focused on the
   isolated grids comprising renewable energy generation and energy
   storage, an energy storage sizing method for taking account of the
   reliability requirement and a bi-level control strategy of the isolated
   grids are presented in this paper. Based on comparative analysis of
   current energy storage characteristics and practicability, Sodium-sulfur
   battery is recommended for power balance control in the isolated grids.
   The optimal size of the energy storage system is determined by genetic
   algorithm and sequential simulation. The annualized cost considering the
   compensation cost of curtailed wind power and load is minimized when the
   reliability requirement can be satisfied. The sizing method emphasizes
   the tradeoff between energy storage size and reliability of power
   supply. The bi-level control strategy is designed as upper level wide
   area power balance control in dispatch timescale and lower level battery
   energy storage system V/f control in real-time range for isolated
   operation. The mixed timescale simulation results of Nan'ao Island grid
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed sizing method and control
   strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modeling and numerical simulation of the forces acting on a sphere
   during early-water entry},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Mathematical modeling, absent simplifying assumptions and coupled with
   numerical simulation, has been implemented to determine the motions and
   forces experienced by a sphere penetrating a water surface from an air
   space above the surface. The model and simulation are validated by
   comparisons with extensive experimental data and with trends from
   approximate analyses. Although the present work adds to the
   understanding and quantification of the sphere as an entry object, its
   major contribution is model development and validation to enable
   investigation of water entry of objects of practical utility such as the
   expendable bathythermograph (XBT). The XBT device is widely used in the
   determination of temperature distributions in large water bodies such as
   oceans. The measured temperature distributions are, in turn, used to
   determine the thermal energy content of oceans. During the course of the
   numerical simulations, parametric variations were made of the sphere
   velocity, surface tension, flow regime (laminar or turbulent), and
   Reynolds number. The drag-coefficient results were found to be
   independent of these quantities. This outcome indicates that momentum
   transfer from the sphere to the adjacent liquid is responsible for the
   drag force and that friction is a secondary issue. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {WATER REUSE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-65},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {An ever-increasing volume of saline effluents from industries, oil-gas
   fields, and desalination plants has resulted in an enormous amount of
   pollutants with undesirable effects on the environment and human health.
   Adequate disposal and treatment of these effluents remains a persistent
   problem and poses significant technical as well as economic challenges.
   Saline effluents can have considerable environmental impacts, depending
   upon the sensitivity of the surrounding ecosystems. Conventional
   disposal techniques mostly suffer from direct or indirect contamination
   of water/soil and are no longer preferred. As a result, several advanced
   treatment methods are being considered for sustainable saline effluent
   management in recent times. In this context, a comprehensive and updated
   review of conventional methods, along with emerging technologies for
   disposal and treatment of saline effluent, is presented. Existing
   treatment approaches, including membrane operation, thermal processes,
   chemical techniques, and biological methods, are discussed. The
   application of innovative hybrid processes (combining two or more
   treatment methods) aiming at lower energy demand and higher treatment
   efficiency has also been evaluated. Subsequently, emerging sustainable
   strategies like waste minimization and water recovery, zero liquid
   discharge, and resource recovery for saline effluents have been
   examined. The prospect of integrating the renewable energy sources with
   energy-intensive saline treatment methods towards
   energy-water-environment nexus is also explored.},

Abstract = {Various emission control regulations enforce vessels to collect
   performance and navigation data and evaluate ship energy efficiency by
   implementing onboard sensors and data acquisition (DAQ) systems. These
   DAQ systems are designed to collect, store and communicate large amounts
   of performance and navigation information through complex data handling
   processes. It is suggested that this information should eventually be
   transferred to shore based data analysis centers for further processing
   and storage. However, the associated data transfer costs introduce
   additional challenges in this process and enforce to investigate cost
   effective data handling approaches in shipping. That mainly relates to
   the amount of data that are transferring through various communication
   networks (i.e. satellites \& wireless networks) between vessels and
   shore based data centers. Hence, this study proposes to use a deep
   learning approach (i.e. autoencoder system architecture) to compress
   ship performance and navigation information, which can be transferred
   through the respective communication networks as a reduced data set. The
   compressed data set can be expanded in the respective data center
   requiring further analysis. Therefore, a data set of ship performance
   and navigation information is analyzed (i.e. compression and expansion)
   through an autoencoder system architecture in this study. The compressed
   data set represents a subset of ship performance and navigation
   information can also be used to evaluate energy efficiency type
   applications in shipping. Furthermore, the respective input and output
   data sets of the autoencoder are also compared as statistical
   distributions to evaluate the network performance.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1249-1257},
Abstract = {Global near-surface wind fields are projected to change as a result of
   climate change. An enhanced knowledge of the changes in wind energy
   availability in the twenty-first century is essential for improving the
   development of wind energy production. We use the PRECIS regional model
   over the East Mediterranean to dynamically downscale the results of the
   Had3CM Atmosphere-Ocean coupled Global Circulation Model. Wind field
   changes during the 21st century are determined by comparing the current
   climate simulation (1961-1990) with the IPCC A2 emissions scenario
   simulation (2071-2100). The consistency of the current climate
   simulation of wind speeds is assessed by comparing its results to the
   ERA40 re-analysis data. The comparison of the wind field from ERA40
   re-analysis to that from the PRECIS current climate simulation shows
   relatively large mean differences that could partly be attributed to the
   difference in the spatial resolution of the two sources of data. Wind
   speeds in 2071-2100 exhibit a general increase over land and a decrease
   over the sea, with the exception of a noticeable increase over the
   Aegean Sea.},

Title = {An agent-based bioenergetics model for predicting impacts of
   environmental change on a top marine predator, the Weddell seal},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {351},
Pages = {36-50},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {One of the crucial scientific challenges of this century is
   characterizing the vulnerability of ecosystems to climate change.
   Bioenergetics models can provide a theoretical construct for addressing
   specific physiological and ecological hypotheses about how individuals
   may respond; however, many models fail to link energy deficiencies with
   reproductive consequences, and thus cannotbe used to predict
   population-level impacts. Here, we present an agent-based,
   ecophysiological model that simulates the energy balance of adult,
   female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). The input parameters
   include physiological values and population -wide ranges for the
   duration and phenology of life history events. Energy intake depends on
   foraging effort and stochastic prey availability, whereas energy
   expenditure is calculated from time and behavior-specific demands. The
   simulated seal selects an activity (forage, nurse pup, molt, rest) based
   on body condition and life history constraints. At the end of each
   timestep, the energy budget is balanced, and catabolism or anabolism
   occurs. Following model development and validation with empirical data,
   simulations were run to study the responses of individuals to: (1)
   baseline conditions; and (2) reduced prey availability. As expected, the
   model replicated the known fluctuations in energetic requirements
   associated with reproduction and molt. A 10\% reduction in prey
   availability resulted in seals foraging more and resting less. At the
   end of the year-long simulations, animals in the baseline simulation had
   significantly higher body masses than animals in the perturbation
   simulation. The model was successfully used to explore decision-based
   energy allocation strategies that occur under different energetic
   stressors and to elucidate how extrinsic conditions can impact
   individual fitness. Identifying the temporal sensitivities of Weddell
   seals to predicted anthropogenic changes is a valuable contribution to
   the study of global change biology and can inform management decisions
   in polar regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Hapua are coastal lagoons found at the mouths of braided gravel rivers
   that experiee a semi-permanent connection with the ocean related to
   fluvial discharge and marine sediment deposition. Sustained closure is
   driven by low river flows and is associated with a decrease in water
   quality, the impedance of fish passage and flooding. On many Hapua,
   irrigation schemes have modified natural flow regimes, yet there is
   little field data on how this affects the dynamics of the lagoon. In
   this study we examine the Opihi rivermouth (New Zealand) which has a
   naturally seasonal low flow regime and a hydrology extensively modified
   through irrigation abstraction and dam construction Analysis of the
   entrance morphodynamics pre and post-dam construction indicates a
   decrease in the frequency and duration of rivermouth closures. This is
   due to the more constant flow regime maintained by the dam. Despite
   this, seasonal patterns of closure still persist over summer which
   illustrates the importance of marine processes in driving entrance
   condition. Three scenarios of natural closure are identified: summer low
   flows, fluvial slug deposition, and coastal storms. Closure duration was
   also observed to be extended when river flows are low, onshore wave
   energy is high and when the outlet channel is considerably offset.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2007},

Pages = {61-70},
Abstract = {The functional and numerical responses for the marine obligate
   mixotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum Lohmann, 1908 (=Myrionecta rubra
   Jankowsky, 1976) were studied at 2 irradiances (20 and 100 mu E m(2)
   s(-1)). Furthermore, its tolerance to high pH levels and response to
   starvation were studied in mixed cultures of M rubrum and Teleaulax sp.
   The functional and numerical response study showed that the threshold
   concentration of the cryptophyte Teleaulax sp. was 50 cells ml(-1) and
   the maximum growth of M rubrum was 0.23 and 0.49 d(-1) for 20 and 100 PE
   m(2) s(-1), respectively. Calculation of ingestion rates revealed that
   similar to 1 Teleaulax sp. cell M rubrum(-1) d(-1) was sufficient to
   maintain the maximum growth rate. Maximum ingestion rates were
   independent of light and saturated at similar to 6 Teleaulax sp. cells M
   rubrum d(-1). A heterotrophic carbon uptake of from 2 to 4 \% of M.
   rubrum carbon content was sufficient for maximum growth, but carbon
   contributions as high as 22 \% were observed to have no effect on
   growth. The pH experiments revealed that the growth of M rubrum and
   Teleaulax sp. was impeded at pH levels in excess of 8.5 and 8.8,
   respectively. Experiments to reveal M rubrum's response to starvation
   showed that M rubrum could survive for around 50 d without prey. These
   results are all discussed with respect to M rubrum's adaptation to its
   environment.},

   physical structure, and biogeochemistry of the surficial sediment around
   two farms in southwest Ireland were examined in conjunction with current
   characteristics. Both farms had been in production for over eight years,
   were of reasonably large size (> 100 MT) and located in low-energy
   environments. At one site, the benthic community was subjected to bulk
   sedimentation and organic enrichment and reduced macrobenthic infaunal
   diversity and elevated levels of organic carbon were recorded close to
   the farm. In general, effects were restricted to a radius of 40 m around
   the farm. Conversely. at the second sits, there were no observed effects
   of mussel biodeposits on the benthos and a diverse macrobenthic
   community persisted. We propose that variations in the dispersion of
   biodeposits caused by local current patterns had a significant influence
   on the impact observed, and that this could also account for differences
   reported in other studies. (C) 2001 International Council for the

Title = {Interactions between Fragmented Seagrass Canopies and the Local
   Hydrodynamics},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {The systematic creation of gaps within canopies results in fragmentation
   and the architecture of fragmented canopies differs substantially from
   non-fragmented canopies. Canopy fragmentation leads to spatial
   heterogeneity in hydrodynamics and therefore heterogeneity in the
   sheltering of canopy communities. Identifying the level of instability
   due to canopy fragmentation is important for canopies in coastal areas
   impacted by human activities and indeed, climate change. The gap
   orientation relative to the wave direction is expected to play an
   important role in determining wave attenuation and sheltering. Initially
   we investigated the effect of a single transversal gap within a canopy
   (i.e. a gap oriented perpendicular to the wave direction) on
   hydrodynamics, which was compared to fully vegetated canopies (i.e. no
   gaps) and also to bare sediment. The wave velocity increased with gap
   width for the two canopy densities studied (2.5\% and 10\% solid plant
   fraction) reaching wave velocities found over bare sediments. The
   turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) within the gap also increased, but was
   more attenuated by the adjacent vegetation than the wave velocity. As
   expected, denser canopies produced a greater attenuation of both the
   wave velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy within an adjacent gap,
   compared to sparse canopies. Using non-dimensional analysis and our
   experimental data, a parameterization for predicting TKE in a canopy gap
   was formulated, as a function of easily measured variables. Based on the
   experimental results, a fragmented canopy model was then developed to
   determine the overall mixing level in such canopies. The model revealed
   that canopies with large gaps present more mixing than canopies with
   small gaps despite having the same total gap area in the canopy.
   Furthermore, for the same total gap area, dense fragmented canopies
   provide more shelter than sparse fragmented canopies.},

   the surface in July and August, with an average specific growth rate of
   8.2\% per day in 30-day experiments. Photosynthetic activity changed
   seasonally, with an average of 7.3 mg O-2 g dw(-1) h(-1). The maximum
   rate (14.4 mg O-2 g dw(-1) h(-1)) was recorded in July, or 19.3 mg CO2 g

Title = {Genesis and morphological evolution of coastal talus-platforms (fajas)
   with lagoons: The case study of the newly-formed Faja dos Milagres
   (Corvo Island, Azores)},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {310},
Pages = {138-152},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Supratidal talus-platforms are low-relief subaerial accumulations of
   debris produced by mass wasting along high coastal cliffs, being
   particularly abundant at reefless volcanic islands subjected to high
   wave energy. Known as ``fajas{''} across the Portuguese-speaking
   Atlantic archipelagos, these coastal features, on rare occasions, may
   exhibit lagoons, constituting sites of high geological, biological,
   landscape, and social value. Whilst the origin of fajas is firmly
   established as being the product of coastal landslides, little is known
   about the processes that shape fajas with lagoons. In particular, doubts
   still remain concerning whether fajas featuring lagoons are a fortuitous
   product of mass wasting. or result from marine reworking (by waves and
   currents) after emplacement. On October 30, 2012, a coastal landslide
   (similar to 0.001 km(3)) occurred on Corvo Island, Azores Archipelago,
   forming a nearshore gravel islet that later migrated to the island's
   coast, resulting in a Cap with an ephemeral lagoon (Faja dos Milagres).
   This event provided a unique opportunity to study the generation and
   development of fajas with lagoons, and therefore a 3-year survey was
   carried out to record its evolution. This GIS-based study used aerial
   oblique photography and satellite optical imagery, complemented with a
   land survey for a more precise topographic reconstruction. Analysis of
   data concerning bathymetry, precipitation, and wave regime was also
   employed to investigate the driving forces behind the morphodynamic
   evolution of the deposit. ``Faja dos Milagres{''} evolved very rapidly,
   through an evolutionary pattern with five main stages: 1) ``islet
   stage{''}; 2) ``gravel spit stage{''}; 3) ``early lagoon stage{''}; 4)
   ``mature lagoon stage{''}; and 5) ``faja (without lagoon) stage{''}. Our
   reconstructions show that, for Lajas with lagoons to be formed, several
   factors should converge: a) presence of high coastal cliffs, made up of
   composite volcanic sequences, capable of producing large landslides that
   supply sufficient mobile sediment to the shelf; b) presence of a
   shallow, wide insular shelf where the sediments can be transported
   without significant loss to the submarine slopes; and c) a
   wave-dominated, high-energy regime, capable of significant cross-shore
   and longshore sediment drift. These observations allowed us to propose a
   preliminary conceptual evolutionary model for the generation of fajas
   with lagoons, where marine reworking plays a fundamental role. Finally,
   this study documents the generation and very rapid subsequent evolution
   of a clastic coastal morphology solely driven by the action of waves and
   currents, and without interference from relative sea level and/or
   external sediment replenishment, with possible implications to other
   settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Understanding the influence of ambient hydrostatic pressure in the
   electric circuit breaking performance of pressure-compensated (PC)
   electromagnetically actuated oil circuit breakers is essential for the
   design of reliable deep ocean power systems. Experiments are conducted
   using an industry-standard 300-V direct current PC power contactor in a
   hyperbaric chamber. It is identified that at 150-bar pressure, the
   circuit breaking duration and arc energy reduce fivefold and threefold,
   respectively, compared to their performance at 1-bar conditions. At
   pressures greater than 200 bar, the circuit breaker opening duration
   increases due to the increase in the viscosity of the dielectric PC oil.
   This leads to increased arc energy and formation of larger carbon
   conglomerations due to the breakdown of dielectric oil. During the
   hyperbaric experiments, the pressure-induced viscosity increase was
   offset by increasing the oil temperature.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The textural and geochemical aspects of the sediments of a tropical
   mangrove ecosystem have been studied and discussed. The sediments are
   characterized by the abundance of silt and sand with minor amounts of
   clay. The mean size of the sediment ranges from 0.205 mm to 0.098 mm
   (fine to very fine grained sand). The sediments are very poorly sorted,
   negatively to very negatively skewed, and platy to extremely leptokurtic
   in nature. The organic carbon content of the sediments ranges from
   0.33\% to 4.93\%, which is controlled by the particle size of the
   sediments. The CaCO3 content is five times the enrichment of organic
   carbon. This enhanced CaCO3 content of the mangrove sediments might be a
   result of the abundance of shell fragments in the sediments. The shell
   mining activities in the estuarine bed adjoining the Kumarakam mangroves
   also contribute a substantial amount of lime muds to the mangrove area,
   which in turn add CaCO3 to the sediments. The relative concentrations of
   heavy metals are Fe > Mn > Cr > Zn > Ni > Cu. All heavy metals other
   than Fe show an increase in concentration compared to the other parts of
   the estuarine bed. Cluster analysis indicates that the contents of
   organic C, Fe and Mn have a marked bearing on the Cr, Zn, Ni, and Cu
   levels of the mangrove sediments.},

Title = {Broadening not strengthening of the Agulhas Current since the early
   1990s},
Journal = {NATURE},

Abstract = {Western boundary currents-such as the Agulhas Current in the Indian
   Ocean-carry heat poleward, moderating Earth's climate and fuelling the
   mid-latitude storm tracks(1,2). They could exacerbate or mitigate
   warming and extreme weather events in the future, depending on their
   response to anthropogenic climate change. Climate models show an ongoing
   poleward expansion and intensification of the global wind systems, most
   robustly in the Southern Hemisphere(3-5), and linear dynamical
   theory(6,7) suggests that western boundary currents will intensify and
   shift poleward as a result(3,8). Observational evidence of such changes
   comes from accelerated warming and air-sea heat flux rates within all
   western boundary currents, which are two or three times faster than
   global mean rates(5,9,10). Here we show that, despite these
   expectations, the Agulhas Current has not intensified since the early
   1990s. Instead, we find that it has broadened as a result of more eddy
   activity. Recent analyses of other western boundary currents-the
   Kuroshio and East Australia currents-hint at similar trends(11-15).
   These results indicate that intensifying winds may be increasing the
   eddy kinetic energy of boundary currents, rather than their mean flow.
   This could act to decrease poleward heat transport and increase
   cross-frontal exchange of nutrients and pollutants between the coastal
   ocean and the deep ocean. Sustained in situ measurements are needed to
   properly understand the role of these current systems in a changing
   climate.},

Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},

Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Microbial electrosynthesis has recently emerged as a promising
   technology for the sustainable production of organic acids, bioplastics,
   or biofuels from electricity and CO2. However, the diversity of
   catalysts and metabolic pathways is limited to mainly mesophilic
   acetogens or methanogens. Here, eleven hyperthermophilic strains related
   to Archaeoglobales, Thermococcales, Aquificales, and methanogens were
   screened for microbial electrosynthesis. The strains were previously
   isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where a naturally occurring,
   spontaneous electrical current can serve as a source of energy for
   microbial metabolism. After 6 days of incubation in an electrochemical
   system, all strains showed current consumption, biofilm formation, and
   small organic molecule production relative to the control. Six selected
   strains were then incubated over a longer period of time. In the course
   of one month, a variety of metabolic intermediates of biotechnological
   relevance such as succinic acid and glycerol accumulated. The production
   rates and the promotion of specific metabolic pathways seemed to be
   influenced by the experimental conditions, such as the concentration of
   CO2 in the gas phase and electron acceptor limitation. Further work is
   necessary to clearly identify these effects to potentially be able to
   tune the microbial electrosynthesis of compounds of interest.},

   neighborhood-scale study of Zhoushan Island, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many island cities have vulnerable ecosystems, yet island ecosystems
   also present special challenges for research. Ecological footprint
   analysis is an effective method of evaluating the ability of island
   cities to engage in regional ecological sustainable development. This
   study uses ecological footprint analysis combined with the ArcGIS
   platform to evaluate the ecological security of 14 neighborhoods on
   Zhoushan Island (Zhejiang Province, China) in 2010, 2013, and 2015. The
   partial least squares regression model is used to explore factors
   affecting spatial and temporal differences in ecological security in the
   island's neighborhoods and to help optimize the island's ecological
   sustainable development. Results reveal that Zhoushan Island's per
   capita ecological footprint decreased from 7.355 hm2 in 2010 to 4.662
   hm2 in 2015, yet throughout the study period, the per capita ecological
   footprint remained higher than the per capita ecological carrying
   capacity in all neighborhoods. Although the island's ecological security
   has gradually improved, there continue to be large ecological deficits
   and ecological pressure. To improve the island city's ecological
   security, we should optimize the mode of urban development, develop
   renewable energy sources, protect ecologically valuable land, improve
   the scale and quality of urban zones and transportation infrastructure,
   and improve residents' industrial and consumption structures.},

Abstract = {The NSROC Program (NASA Sounding Rocket Operations) was privatized in
   February 1999 at NASA Wallops Island, Virginia, USA. NSROC Teammates
   Northrop Grumman and Orbital Sciences Corporation continue to
   successfully implement the NASA Sounding Rocket Program. NSROC provides
   the cradle-to-grave program for the worldwide scientific community. As
   of 15 February 2007, NSROC has performed 181 Sounding Rocket flights at
   launch ranges around the globe. These missions have supported various
   science disciplines including Geospace, Solar/Heliospheric, High Energy
   Astrophysics, UV/Optical Astrophysics, Solar System Exploration, Student
   Outreach and Technology Innovation.
   Recovery of sounding rocket payloads is typical for many of the NSROC
   launches at both land and coastal launch ranges. A payload's reentry
   characteristics, thermal distribution and dynamic stability though the
   atmosphere are critical for the proper positioning and preparation for
   the recovery phase. A certain Black Brant IX mission from White Sands
   Missile Range in the summer of 2006 noted peculiar reentry dynamics that
   led to an atypical recovery. Details of this mission and its recovery
   will be shared.
   NSROC is developing the Mesquito sounding rocket vehicle for lower
   mesosphere scientific investigations. The two-stage vehicle includes a
   high thrust, short duration first stage motor and a non-propulsive
   second stage that also allows for rapid reload capability. The
   streamlined processing allows for the ability to launch a series of
   vehicles that can provide both temporal and spatial measurements and is
   planned for 30 minute interval launches. The Mesquito is a low cost
   sounding rocket that can contain a user specified payload or can
   interface with a small suite of avionics and instrument(s). A full
   telemetry suite is available to transmit 2 mbit/sec of payload data. The
   data can include analog, digital, parallel, synchronous, asynchronous
   and/or video data. System details and the qualification status will be
   shared.},

Abstract = {Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous carbonate sediments of different age
   and facies form the post-emplacement settings on top of the Mirdita
   Ophiolite Zone in northern Albania. They seal the early Late Jurassic
   emplacement of the ophiolite nappes, and are the only datable relics
   overlying the ophiolites. They aid evaluating the different tectonic
   movements associated with uplift and erosion as well as sea-level
   fluctuations during that time span. These carbonates overlie
   ophiolite-derived elastics very often as shallowing-upward sequences.
   One of the largest shallow-water platforms is the Mali I Shenjtit
   platform, previously assigned to the Barremian-Aptian. A well-preserved
   section at the base of the platform can be ascribed to the Early-Late
   Aptian based on orbitolinid foraminifera together with dasycladalean
   algae. This carbonate platform is the youngest preserved Early
   Cretaceous platform in Albania, but was largely eroded away. Late
   Cretaceous shallow-water rudist limestones are widespread and preserved
   in the Dinaride-Albanide-Hellenide realm directly above an eroded older
   basement. Therefore, this Aptian platform is very important for the
   reconstruction of the Early Cretaceous palaeogeography in the
   northwestern Neotethyan realm. In addition, the stratigraphic ranges of
   characteristic Aptian orbitolinid foraminifera, Rectodictyoconus
   giganteus SCHROEDER and Mesorbitolina texana (ROEMER), are discussed on
   the basis of these results.},

Abstract = {Thermodynamic calculations and Gibbs free energy minimization computer
   experiments strongly support the hypothesis that kerogen maturation and
   oil generation are inevitable consequences of oxidation/reduction
   disproportionation reactions caused by prograde metamorphism of
   hydrocarbon source rocks with increasing depth of burial.These
   experiments indicate that oxygen and hydrogen are conserved in the
   process. Accordingly, if water is stable and present in the source rock
   at temperatures greater than or similar to 25 but less than or similar
   to 100 degrees C along a typical US Gulf Coast geotherm, immature
   (reduced) kerogen with a given atomic hydrogen to carbon ratio (H/C)
   melts incongruently with increasing temperature and depth of burial to
   produce a metastable equilibrium phase assemblage consisting of
   naphthenic/biomarker-rich crude oil, a type-II/III kerogen with an
   atomic hydrogen/carbon ratio (H/C) of similar to 1, and water. Hence,
   this incongruent melting process promotes diagenetic reaction of
   detritus in the source rock to form authigenic mineral assemblages.
   However, in the water-absent region of the system CHO (which is
   extensive), any water initially present or subsequently entering the
   source rock is consumed by reaction with the most mature kerogen with
   the lowest H/C it encounters to form CO2 gas and a new kerogen with
   higher H/C and O/C, both of which are in metastable equilibrium with one
   another.This hydrolytic disproportionation process progressively
   increases both the concentration of the solute in the aqueous phase, and
   the oil generation potential of the source rock; i.e., the new kerogen
   can then produce more crude oil. Petroleum is generated with increasing
   temperature and depth of burial of hydrocarbon source rocks in which
   water is not stable in the system CHO by a series of irreversible
   disproportionation reactions in which kerogens with higher (H/C)s melt
   incongruently to produce metastable equilibrium assemblages consisting
   of crude oil, CO2 gas, and a more mature (oxidized) kerogen with a lower
   H/C which in turn melts incongruently with further burial to produce
   more crude oil, CO2 gas, and a kerogen with a lower H/C and so forth.The
   petroleum generated in the process progresses from heavy naphthenic
   crude oils at low temperatures to mature petroleum at similar to 150
   degrees C. For example, the results of Computer Experiment 27 (see
   below) indicate that the overall incongruent melting reaction in the
   water-absent region of the system C-H-O at 150 degrees C and a depth of
   similar to 4.3 km of an immature type-II/III kerogen with a bulk
   composition represented by C292H288O12(c) to produce a mature (oxidized)
   kerogen represented by C128H68O7(c), together with a typical crude oil
   with an average metastable equilibrium composition corresponding to
   C8.8H16.9 (C8.8H16.9(1)) and CO2 gas (CO2(g)) can be described by
   writing
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   which corresponds to a disproportionation reaction in the source rock
   representing the sum of a series of oxidation/reduction conservation
   reactions. Consideration of the stoichiometries of incongruent melting
   reactions analogous to Reaction (A) for reactant kerogens with different
   (H/C)s and/or atomic oxygen to carbon ratios (O/C)s, together with crude
   oil compositions corresponding to Gibbs free energy minima at specified
   temperatures and pressures permits calculation of the volume of oil
   (mole of reactant organic carbon (ROC))(-1) that can be generated in, as
   well as the Volume of oil (mol ROC)(-1) which exceeds the volume of
   kerogen pore space produced that must be expelled from hydrocarbon
   source rocks as a function of temperature, pressure, and the H/C and O/C
   of the reactant kerogen. These volumes and the reaction coefficients
   (mol ROC)(-1) of the product kerogen, crude oil, and CO2 gas in the
   incongruent melting reaction are linear functions of the H/C and O/C of
   the reactant kerogen at a given temperature and pressure. The slopes of
   the isopleths call be computed from power functions of temperature along
   a typical US Gulf Coast geotherm. All of these reactions and relations
   tire consistent with the well-known observations that (1) the relative
   abundance of mature kerogen increases, and that of miniature kerogen
   decreases with increasing burial of hydrocarbon Source rocks and (2)
   that the volume of oil generated in a given Source rock increases with
   increasing weight percent total organic carbon (TOC) and the H/C and (to
   a lesser extent) the O/C of the immature kerogen. They are also
   compatible with preservation of biomarkers and other polymerized
   hydrocarbons during the incongruent melting process. It can be deduced
   from Reaction (A) that nearly 11 mol of crude oil are produced from one
   mole of the reactant kerogen (rk). which increases to similar to 39.5
   mol (mol rk)(-1) as the carbon content and H/C of the reactant kerogen
   increase to that in the hydrogen-rich type-I kerogen represented by
   C415H698O22(c). The secondary porosities created in source rocks by
   Reaction (A) and others like it are of the order of 75-80 vol \% of the
   oil generated, which requires expulsion of the remainder, together with
   the CO2 gas produced by the reaction. The expulsion of the CO2 gas and
   excess crude oil from the hydrocarbon source rock is facilitated by
   their buoyancy and the fact that the pressure in the source rocks is >=
   the fluid pressure in the adjoining formations during progressive
   generation of the volume of crude oil that exceeds the kerogen pore
   volume produced by the incongruent melting process. The expelled CO2 gas
   lowers the pH of the surrounding formation waters, which promotes the
   development of secondary porosity and diagenetic reaction of detrital
   silicates to form authigenic mineral assemblages. Hence. the expulsion
   process facilitates initial upward migration of the oil, which is
   further enhanced by expansion of the oil and its reaction with H2O at
   the oil-water interface to generate methane gas. Mass transfer
   calculations indicate that the minimal volume of crude oil expelled into
   these formations is comparable to, or exceeds the volume of oil produced
   and in proven reserves in major oil fields Such as the North Sea, the
   Paris and Los Angeles Basins, and those in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and
   elsewhere in the Middle East.
   For example, taking account of the average weight percent (organic
   carbon ill the immaturekerogen (3.4 wt\%) with an average H/C of similar
   to 1.04 in the hydrocarbon source rocks in Saudi Arabia, which have an
   average thickness of similar to 43 in, it can be shown (see below) that
   all of the oil (and oil equivalent Of natural gas) produced and in
   proven reserves in Saudi Arabia (374 billion barrels of oil or similar
   to 1.9 million barrels of oil km(-2)) call be accounted for by minimal
   expulsion from the source rocks of oil generated at similar to 125
   degrees C solely by the incongruent melting process. computer
   experiments indicate that this process can also account for all the
   petroleum that can be, and has been generated in the world's hydrocarbon
   source rocks. Of the latter, as much as 75-80\% may still remain in
   these rocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {T-phase observations in northern California: Acoustic to seismic
   coupling at a weakly elastic boundary},

Year = {2001},
Volume = {158},
Number = {3},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Plans for a hydroacoustic network intended to monitor compliance with
   the CTBT call for the inclusion of five T-phase stations situated at
   optimal locations for the detection of seismic phases converted from
   ocean-borne T phases. We examine factors affecting the sensitivity of
   land-based stations to the seismic T phase. The acoustic to seismic
   coupling phenomenon is described by upslope propagation of an acoustic
   ray impinging at a sloping elastic wedge. We examine acoustic to seismic
   coupling characteristics for two cases; the first in which the shear
   velocity of the bottom is greater than the compressional velocity of the
   fluid (i.e., v(p) > v(s) > v(w)), the second is a weakly elastic solid
   in which vs much less than v(w) < v(p). The former is representative of
   velocities in solid rock, which might be encountered at volcanic
   islands; the latter is representative of marine sediments. For the case
   where v(s) > v(w), we show that acoustic energy couples primarily to
   shear wave energy, except at very high slope angles. We show that the
   weakly elastic solid (i.e., v(s) much less than v(w)) behaves nearly
   like a fluid bottom, with acoustic energy coupling to both P and S waves
   even at low slope angles.
   We examine converted T-wave arrivals at northern California seismic
   stations for two event clusters; one a series of earthquakes near the
   Hawaiian Islands, the other a series of nuclear tests conducted near the
   Tuamoto archipelago. Each cluster yielded characteristic arrivals at
   each station which were consistent from event to event within a cluster,
   but differed between clusters. The seismic T-phases consisted of both P-
   and S-wave arrivals, consistent with the conversion of acoustic to
   seismic energy at a gently sloping sediment-covered seafloor. In
   general, the amplitudes of the seismic T phases were highest for
   stations nearest the continental slope, where seafloor slopes are
   greatest, however noise levels decrease rapidly with increasing distance
   from the coastline, so that T-wave arrivals were observable at distances
   reaching several hundred kilometers from the coast. Signal-to-noise
   levels at the seismic stations are lower over the entire frequency
   spectrum than at the Pt. Sur hydrophone nearby, and decrease more
   rapidly with increasing frequency, particularly for stations furthest
   from the continental slope.},

Title = {Storms, shoreface morphodynamics, sand supply, and the accretion and
   erosion of coastal dune barriers in the southern North Sea},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {199},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {8-21},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The coast of the southern North Sea is bound by dune barriers that have
   developed adjacent to a shallow storm- and tide-dominated shoreface
   comprising numerous shore-parallel to sub-shore-parallel tidal sand
   banks. The banks evolve under the joint control of tide-, wave- and
   wind-induced shore-parallel currents, which tend to `stretch' them,
   eventually leading to bank division, and to shoaling and breaking storm
   waves, which tend to drive them ashore. The banks, thus, modulate the
   delivery of storm wave energy to the coast, redirect currents alongshore
   and are the sand sources for the accretion of coastal dunes. Foredune
   accretion occurs where major sand banks have migrated shoreward over the
   last centuries to be finally driven ashore and weld under the impact of
   storm waves. Morphological changes in the bank field can impact on
   shoreline stability through dissipation or enhanced shoreward
   transmission of storm wave energy and effects on radiation stress,
   particularly when waves are breaking over the banks. Where banks are
   close to the shore, mitigation of offshore sediment transport,
   especially during storms, can occur because of gradients in radiation
   stress generated by the complex 3D bank structure. These macro-scale
   mechanisms involve embedded meso-scale interactions that revolve around
   the mobility of sand waves, mobility of beach bars and troughs and
   foredune mobility, and micro-scale processes of bedform mobility in the
   subaqueous and intertidal domains, and of swash and aeolian beach-dune
   sand transport. These embedded interactions and the morphodynamic
   feedback loops illustrate the importance of synchroneity of sand
   transport from shoreface to dune on this coast.
   Large stretches of the foredunes show either signs of stability, or mild
   but chronic erosion. Furthermore, a demonstrated lack of a clear
   relationship occurs between storminess and coastal response over the
   second half of the 20th century. The present situation may be indicative
   of conditions of rather limited sand supply from offshore,
   notwithstanding the abundance of sand on the nearby shallow shoreface,
   except in areas where a nearshore storm-driven tidal sand bank has
   become shore-attached. Apart from the important influence of shoreface
   sand banks and of wave-bank interactions, foredune accretion and erosion
   also depend on various context controls that include individual storm
   characteristics, wind speed and incidence relative to the shore, tidal
   stage during storms, and direct human intervention on the shore through
   foredune and beach management. The bewildering variability inherent in
   these intricately related parameters may also explain the poor
   relationship between storminess and barrier shoreline change and will
   still continue to render unpredictable the response of shores to
   individual storms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The further development of the first-order panel method panMARE for
   simulating floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) in time domain is
   presented in this work. Based on a surface discretisation of platform,
   tower and rotor with its wake, the three-dimensional aerodynamic and
   hydrodynamic flow fields are calculated. A free wake deformation model
   is integrated to capture blade-wake interaction. Hydrodynamic,
   aerodynamic and mooring loads are cumulated by a six-degrees-of-freedom
   solver to compute the motion of the FOWT. The presented method is able
   to simulate unsteady and aperiodic motions and to predict the wake
   deformations and their influence on the rotor loads due to the platform
   motion. In order to verify the method, simulation results of the
   DeepCWind floater with the NREL 5-MW baseline turbine are compared with
   those obtained in the OC4 project. The ability to capture highly
   unsteady situations is studied as well by simulating a gust with varying

Title = {A New Metric of the Biological Carbon Pump: Number of Pump Passages and
   Its Control on Atmospheric pCO(2)},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We develop novel locally defined diagnostics for the efficiency of the
   ocean's biological pump by tracing carbon throughout its lifetime in the
   ocean from gas injection to outgassing and counting the number of
   passages through the soft-tissue and carbonate pumps. These diagnostics
   reveal that the biological pump's key controls on atmospheric pCO(2) are
   the mean number of lifetime pump passages per dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC) molecule at the surface and the mean aphotic sequestration time of
   regenerated DIC. We apply our diagnostics to an observationally
   constrained carbon-cycle model that features spatially varying
   stoichiometric ratios and is embedded in a data-assimilated global ocean
   circulation. We find that for the present-day ocean an average of 44 +/-
   4\% of DIC in a given water parcel makes at least one lifetime passage
   through the soft tissue pump, and about 4\% makes at least one passage
   through the carbonate pump. The global mean number of lifetime pump
   passages per molecule, including the fraction with zero passages, is N
   over bar soft=0.65 +/- 0.08 and N over bar carb similar to 0.04 for the
   soft-tissue and carbonate pumps. Using idealized perturbations to sweep
   out a sequence of states ranging from zero biological activity
   (pCO2atm=493 +/- 1 ppmv) to complete surface nutrient depletion
   (pCO2atm=207 +/- 1 ppmv), we find that fractional changes in pCO2atm are
   dominated by fractional changes in the number of soft-tissue pump
   passages. At complete surface nutrient depletion, the mean fraction of
   DIC that has at least one lifetime passage through the soft-tissue pump
   increases to 69 +/- 5\% with N over bar soft=1.6 +/- 0.3.},

Title = {Record of Permian Tethyan transgression in eastern India: A reappraisal

Journal = {MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {67},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Barren Measures Formation (middle Permian, similar to 271-260 Ma),
   the non-coaliferous lithounit sandwitched between two major coal-bearing
   formations in the Indian Lower Gondwana succession, was earlier
   interpreted as continental fluvio-lacustrine deposits. The present
   contribution documents sedimentary attributes of marginal marine
   tide-wave interference from the Barren Measures Formation of eastern
   peninsular India, exposed along the Bokaro River section, West Bokaro
   Coalfield, Jharkhand. Tidalites, including various tidal bundle
   sequences with frequent reactivation surfaces (velocity asymmetry) and
   single/double mud drapes (pause planes), systematic arrangement of tidal
   beddings (flaser, wavy, lenticular) and tidal rhythmites with alternate
   sand-dominated and mud-dominated planelaminated units, manifest
   sedimentation by open marine spring-neap-spring tidal cycles under
   diurnal inequalities in a semi-diurnal tidal system. The architecture of
   tidalites attests to sedimentation in shallow subtidal to intertidal
   flat facies, affected by intermittent strong to week reworking by open
   marine waves/storms. Wave reworking is manifested by wave ripples,
   combined-flow ripples and wavegenerated tidal bundles. Their coexistence
   and gradation with tidalites indicate low-energy wave/storm interference
   with tidal currents in a sheltered, tide-dominated estuary, especially
   on tidal flats along estuary channel banks. Overall fining-up facies
   sequence, upward increase of prodeltaic mud over tide -wave led
   sediments, signify a sustained transgressive phase onlaping the estuary

Title = {Microbial carbon monoxide consumption in salt marsh sediments},
Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-9},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We have examined sediments from a fringing salt marsh in Maine to
   further understand marine CO metabolism, about which relatively little
   is known. Intact cores from the marsh emitted CO during dark oxic
   incubations, but emission rates were significantly higher during anoxic
   incubations, which provided evidence for simultaneous production and
   aerobic consumption in surface sediments. CO emission rates were also
   elevated when cores were exposed to light, which indicated that
   photochemical reactions play a role in CO production. A kinetic analysis
   of marsh surface sediments yielded an apparent K-m of about 82 ppm,
   which exceeded values reported for well-aerated soils that consume
   atmospheric CO (65nM). Surface (0-0.2 cm depth interval) sediment
   slurries incubated under oxic conditions rapidly consumed CO, and methyl
   fluoride did not inhibit uptake, which indicated that neither ammonia
   nor methane oxidizers contributed to the observed activity. In contrast,
   aerobic CO uptake was inhibited by additions of readily available
   organic substrates (pyruvate, glucose and glycine), but not by
   cellulose. CO was also consumed by surface and sub-surface sediment
   slurries incubated under anaerobic conditions, but rates were less than
   during aerobic incubations. Molybdate and nitrate or nitrite, but not
   2-bromoethanesulfonic acid, partially inhibited anaerobic uptake. These
   results suggest that sulfidogens and acetogens, but not dissimilatory
   nitrate reducers or methanogens, actively consume CO. Sediment-free
   plant roots also oxidized CO aerobically; rates for Spartina patens and
   Limonium carolinianum roots were significantly higher than rates for
   Spartina alterniflora roots. Thus plants may also impact CO cycling in
   estuarine environments.},

Title = {In situ Response of Tropical Coralline Algae to a Novel Thermal Regime},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Coralline algae provide important ecosystem services. In situ
   observations of how they respond to different environmental conditions
   can help us to understand (i) their ability to adapt to their local
   environment and (0 their capacity to acclimatize to a novel thermal
   regime. Here, individuals of the tropical coralline algae, Lithophyllum
   kotschyanum, were translocated on a coral reef from thermally stable
   areas to areas characterized by natural temperature variability. Changes
   in their photosynthetic efficiency were determined using pulse amplitude
   modulation (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence. Despite an initial stress
   response, algae exposed to increases in thermal variation recovered
   within 24 hours, indicating a rapid, short-term acclimatization
   capacity. Algae naturally inhabiting thermally variable areas of the
   reef showed no change in photosynthetic efficiency throughout the study
   suggesting longer-term adaptation to living in a variable environment
   also occurs. However, coralline algae living in thermally stable reef
   areas were abundant and marginally larger, suggesting physiological
   trade-offs are used to survive in variable environments. Thus, our
   results suggest that while coralline algae can survive in
   environmentally variable conditions, there may be structural and
   ecosystem costs.},

Title = {The Third Global Coral Bleaching Event on the Marginal Coral Reefs of

Abstract = {Coral reefs reach their southernmost limits in the southwestern Indian
   Ocean in Maputaland, South Africa. Here, we investigate the recent
   global coral bleaching event of 2016, the thermal dynamics of these
   marginal high-latitude reefs and the potential environmental factors
   regulating the responses of coral communities. Pre-, peak- and
   post-bleaching surveys of over 9850 coral colonies from 29 genera were
   undertaken over 3 years across 14 sites spanning 120 km of coastline
   using point-intercept and visual bleaching index survey methodologies.
   Bleaching data were related to several environmental variables including
   temperature, degree heating weeks (DHW), depth, latitude, and upwelling
   intensity. These reefs have experienced a history of relatively low
   thermal stress based on DHW. Long-term in situ temperature records
   nevertheless showed no obvious trend of increase. In situ temperatures
   also displayed poor relationships, with temperatures predicted by the
   Representative Concentration Pathway models. Mild coral bleaching with
   no significant mortality was recorded across sites with taxon-specific
   bleaching responses evident. Latitude and cumulative daily DHW were
   significantly related to the bleaching index whereas depth and
   interactions of depth with latitude and DHW were not. While upwelling of
   cooler water may offer some refuge to coral communities, especially in
   the Central and Southern Reef Complexes where it is more pronounced,
   this may only be transient as the upwelled water may also experience
   some degree of warming in future, thereby limiting such protection from
   global warming.},

Title = {Watershed restoration as a tool for improving coral reef resilience

Abstract = {Environmental stressors in coastal areas threaten the sustainability of
   marine resources and reduce their resilience to climate change impacts.
   Accelerated land erosion is a major stressor that leads to increased
   turbidity and sedimentation on downstream coral reefs and the
   degradation of ecosystem functions. Volunteers from a community-based
   initiative in Guam installed 130 tree seedlings and 54 m of sediment
   filter socks in eroding hillsides above Fouha Bay, to reduce erosion. A
   soil probing method for measuring soil depth was developed and used to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the watershed restoration tools. The trees
   and socks trapped 111.8 tons of sediment on land after 21 months. In
   heavily eroding portions of the restoration plot, where socks and trees
   were used in combination, the mean sediment trapping efficiency was 44
   kg m(-2) yr(-1). Previous studies indicate a 75\% reduction in
   sedimentation rate is required to bring Fouha Bay below
   severe-catastrophic sedimentation stress (>50 mg cm(-2) day(-1)). Based
   on the observed sediment trapping efficiency of restoration tools in
   this study, an estimated 0.05 km(2) of severely eroding hillsides must
   be treated with 19 km of socks and 11,000 trees to trap 2121 tons of
   sediment and achieve the necessary reduction. If sediment input into the
   bay is controlled, existing sediment will clear out with storm-driven
   swells. As shown in other high islands, coral reefs are resilient and
   can recover after sedimentation stress is reduced. Data generated on the
   efficiency of watershed restoration tools in this study can be used in
   watershed management plans to promote the sustainability and resilience
   of coastal areas in other tropical islands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Japan has a very large area because
   Japan consists of many islands. As the worldwide supply and demand of
   natural resources and food are being tight, the technology for the
   effective use of the EEZ will become the key for the future development
   of Japan. From this background, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
   Transport and Tourism of Japan (MLIT) started an R\&D project of
   floating offshore platform technologies in 2007.
   In this project an integrated design support tool, called ``Harmonic
   Design Tool{''}, has been developed for evaluating economical and safety
   aspects of the offshore platforms. At the first stage, the tool makes
   the basic planning based on many kinds of relating datasets. In the
   second and third stages, safety assessment and economic evaluation are
   carried out by datasets and numerical simulation programs.
   In this paper the outlines of the total tool, each stage, some technical
   components and a trial estimate for seafloor massive sulphides (SMS)

Abstract = {This paper presents detailed studies involving sizing, stability
   analysis, and power flow through the series and parallel power
   converters in a multifunctional three-phase distributed generation (DG)
   system composed of a single-stage photovoltaic (PV) system integrated
   into a unified power quality conditioner (UPQC). The UPQC operates as a
   bidirectional interface when the DG system is placed between the grid
   and either generic loads or ac microgrid. In the grid-connected mode,
   the DG system performs active power-line conditioning, while injecting
   the energy produced by the PV array into the grid. In islanded
   operation, the system can act as ac grid forming via a parallel
   inverter, whether there is the presence of an energy storage system. A
   complete study involving the power flow through the PV-UPQC is mandatory
   to achieve the overall understanding of the s y stem operation and
   designing the power converters properly. For this purpose, sizing curves
   are presented and discussed. Furthermore, two strategies aimed at
   limiting and/or decreasing the power processed by the series and
   parallel inverters are presented and discussed in detail. Both
   simulation and experimental results are presented to evaluate the static
   and dynamic performances of the PV-UPQC system operating grid connected

Title = {Role of macrofauna on benthic oxygen consumption in sandy sediments of a
   high-energy tidal beach},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {96-105},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Sandy beaches exposed to tide and waves are characterized by low
   abundance and diversity of benthic macrofauna, because of high-energy
   conditions. This is the reason why there are few studies on benthic
   communities living in such highly dynamic environments. It has been
   shown recently that tidal sandy beaches may act as biogeochemical
   reactors. Marine organic matter that is supplied in the sand during each
   flood tide is efficiently mineralized through aerobic respiration. In
   order to quantify the role of macrofauna in the whole beach benthic
   respiration, we studied the macrofauna and the pore water oxygen content
   of an exposed sandy beach (Truc Vert, SW of France) during four seasons
   in 2011. The results showed that macrofauna was characterised by a low
   number of species of specialized organisms such as the crustaceans
   Eurydice naylori and Gastrosaccus spp. and the polychaetes Ophelia
   bicornis and Scolelepis squamata. The distribution and abundance of
   macrofauna were clearly affected by exposure degree and emersion time.
   The combined monitoring of benthic macrofauna and pore waters chemistry
   allowed us to estimate (1) the macrofauna oxygen uptake, calculated with
   a standard allometric relationship using biomass data, and (2) the total
   benthic oxygen uptake, calculated from the oxygen deficit measured in
   pore waters. This revealed that benthic macrofauna respiration
   represented a variable but low (< 10\%) contribution to the total
   benthic oxygen consumption. This suggests that oxygen was mainly
   consumed by microbial respiration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Elevated salinity blocks pathogen transmission and improves host
   survival from the global amphibian chytrid pandemic: Implications for
   translocations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {1. Emerging infectious diseases are one of the greatest threats to
   global biodiversity. Chytridiomycosis in amphibians is perhaps the most
   extreme example of this phenomenon known to science. Translocations are
   increasingly used to fight disease-induced extinctions. However, many
   programmes fail because disease is still present or subsequently
   establishes in the translocation environment. There is a need for
   studies in real-world scenarios to test whether environmental
   manipulation could improve survival in populations by generating
   unfavourable environmental conditions for pathogens. Reintroductions of
   amphibians impacted by chytridiomycosis into environments where the
   disease persists provide a scenario where this paradigm can be tested.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that manipulating environmental salinity in
   outdoor mesocosms under near-identical environmental conditions, present
   in a nearby translocation programme for an endangered amphibian, would
   improve survival and determine the mechanisms involved. One hundred and
   sixty infected and 288 uninfected, captive-bred, juvenile frogs were
   released into 16 outdoor mesocosms in which salinity was controlled
   (high-or low-salinity treatment). The experiment was run for 25 weeks
   from the mid-austral winter to the mid-austral summer of 2013 in a
   temperate coastal environment, Australia.
   3. Increasing salinity from c. 0.5 ppt to 3.5-4.5 ppt reduced pathogen
   transmission between infected and uninfected animals, resulting in
   significantly reduced mortality in elevated salt mesocosms (0.13,
   high-salt vs. 0.23, low-salt survival at 23 weeks). Increasing water
   temperature associated with season (from mean 13 to 25 degrees C)
   eventually cleared all surviving animals of the pathogen.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We identified a mechanism by which
   environmental salinity can protect amphibian hosts from chytridomycosis
   by reducing disease transmission rates. We conclude that manipulating
   environmental salinity in landscapes where chytrid-affected amphibians
   are currently translocated could improve the probability of population
   persistence for hundreds of species. More broadly, we provide support
   for the paradigm that environmental manipulation can be used to mitigate
   the impact of emerging infectious diseases.},

Abstract = {Solar interfacial evaporation based on wood-derived materials has been
   considered a promising strategy for desalination and wastewater
   purification. Herein, we adopted delignified wood (DW) as the water
   transport substrate and lignosulfonate (LS)-modified narrow-band gap
   semiconductor nickel disulfide (NiS2) as the light-absorbing agent
   (LS-NiS2) to fabricate a high-efficiency evaporator (LS-NiS2@ DW). On
   the one hand, the high absorbance (>95\%) within a broad wavelength
   range and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of LS-NiS2 endow
   efficient solar energy utilization. On the other hand, the
   hydrophilicity of DW facilitates water activation, which results in a
   lower evaporation enthalpy of LS-NiS2@DW (1274.4 kJ kg-1) than that of
   pure water. By combining LS-NiS2 and DW, LS-NiS2@DW achieved an
   evaporation rate as high as 2.80 kg m-2 h-1 under one sun irradiation (1
   kW m-2), and the evaporation efficiency reached 87.4\%. Notably,
   LS-NiS2@DW exhibits a high evaporation rate (2.42-2.69 kg m-2 h-1) in
   simulated seawater for 24 h with no salt crystals formed on the surface.
   Moreover, LS-NiS2@DW shows high antibacterial activity with about 90\%
   reduction in bacterial survival rate. This work could provide new
   perspectives for the design of a high-efficiency wood-based photothermal
   evaporator.},

Title = {A global monthly climatology of phosphate, nitrate, and silicate in the
   upper ocean: Spring-summer export production and shallow
   remineralization},

Year = {2000},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {We have created monthly climatologies of nutrients in the upper 500 m of
   the ocean using the 1998 release of the World Ocean Atlas from the Ocean
   Climate Laboratory at the National Oceanographic Data Center. The data
   processing is similar to that used by Najjar and Keeling {[}1997] to
   create an oxygen climatology. The spatial extrapolation of the nutrients
   exploits regional relationships between nutrients and temperature in the
   ocean. The annual mean horizontal and vertical distributions of the
   nutrients follow the large scale patterns of oceanic circulation as
   previously reported in the literature. Surface seasonal variations of
   nutrients are high in the high latitudes and some restricted upwelling
   areas, whereas in the subtropical oligotrophic gyres nutrients are low
   all year. Surface seasonal variations are characterized by high values
   in winter and low values in summer, consistent with the dominance of
   entrainment during the winter and biological production during the
   summer. Good agreement is found between the climatologies and the
   limited reports of seasonal nutrient variations in the literature.
   Weaker seasonal variations of opposite phasing are found below roughly
   100 m and likely reflect the dominance of remineralization during the
   summer and ventilation during the winter. Spring-summer export
   production derived from the seasonal nutrient drawdown in the upper 100
   m is 4.2+/-0.6 Tmol P, 59+/-8 Tmol N, and 70+/-15 Tmol Si. The N:P
   drawdown ratio is, within the error, in agreement with the traditional
   value of 16. Similarly, the Si:N drawdown ratio is in agreement with the
   value of 1 expected for diatom growth in unstressed conditions. The
   export of organic carbon estimated from the phosphate drawdown is
   5.3+/-0.8 Gt C. The shallow remineralization inferred from seasonal
   phosphate variation between 100 and 200 m is 2.6+/-1.1 Gt C. The carbon
   and silica fluxes, considering that they are lower bounds on global
   export production because they do not capture the production signal in
   advectively dominated systems, are in reasonable agreement with other
   large scale estimates of organic carbon and silica export. The computed
   f ratio (using satellite-based estimates of primary production) and the
   ratio of shallow aphotic zone remineralization to new production tend to
   increase with increasing latitude, supporting an increase in respiration
   with temperature, as suggested in recent studies.},

Abstract = {On the open shores of the Yellow Sea along Korea's Baeksu coast, a
   severe erosional phase in a tidal flat has been attributed to
   hydrodynamic processes in winter. To investigate the hydrodynamic
   behavior of winter storms on the intertidal flat, in situ measurements
   of currents and waves were obtained with an instrumented system deployed
   at a low tidal zone over a neap-spring tidal period in February 1999.
   The measurements included two storm events under different tidal
   conditions, i.e. the first storm occurred during a neap tide and the
   second weaker storm during a spring tide. Near-bottom velocities
   recorded during storm conditions at an elevation of 15 cm show that
   currents were dominantly directed alongshore with a maximum speed of
   0.55 m/s and that the wave orbital velocity and significant wave height
   reached up to I m/s and 3 in, respectively. In particular, it was
   observed that the magnitude of wave-related parameters was greater
   during the spring tide (the weaker storm) than during the neap tide,
   regardless of the intensity of the storms. Analysis of the relationship
   between wave height and water depth, and temporal variations in wave
   velocity spectra and skewness, show that the effect of storm conditions
   on waves was relevant to wave-breaking processes. The occurrence of
   harmonics in the broad-banded spectra of wave velocity demonstrates
   redistribution of wave energy due to the breaking of waves. Wave height
   (H,) was linearly related to water depth (h) fluctuating with tides,
   yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.7 (=H-s/h), which was close to
   the breaking limit. This tidal modulation of storm waves associated with
   wave-breaking processes is possibly responsible for the observed
   discrepancy between the intensity of storms and their hydrodynamic
   consequences on the intertidal flat. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {Evolution of the Northern Nicaragua Rise during the Oligocene-Miocene:
   Drowning by environmental factors},

Abstract = {Possible causes to explain platform drowning have been hotly debated by
   carbonate sedimentologists for more than a decade now. In this paper, we
   present multiple evidence to explain the drowning of a carbonate
   megabank that covered most of the modem Northern Nicaragua Rise (NNR)
   during an interval spanning from late Oligocene to early Miocene by the
   interaction of several environmental factors. The recovery during ODP
   Leg 165 of late Oligocene to middle Miocene sedimentary sequences in the
   sub-seafloor of the modern channels and basin, Pedro Channel and Walton
   Basin, respectively, that dissect the NNR (Site 1000) and south of the
   rise in the Colombian Basin (Site 999), combined with information from
   dredged rock samples, allows us to explore in more detail the timing and
   possible mechanisms responsible for the drowning of the megabank and its
   relationship to Miocene climate change. The modern system of isolated
   banks and shelves dissected by a series of intervening seaways and
   basins on the NNR has evolved from a continuous, shallow-water carbonate
   ``megabank' that extended from the Honduras/Nicaraguan mainland to the
   modern island of Jamaica. Available information suggests that this
   megabank broke apart and partially drowned in the late part of the late
   Oligocene at around 27 Ma and finally foundered during the late early
   Miocene around 20 Ma, resulting in limited neritic coral growth in the
   areas where the modern isolated carbonate banks and shelves are
   occurring today. Available information also suggests that the southern
   and central parts of Pedro Channel were already a deep-water area before
   the major episode of platform drowning, and its formation predates the
   initiation of the Caribbean Current. However, after the partial drowning
   of the megabank, the channel has become a major pathway for the
   Caribbean Current. Stratigraphic units identified in deep-water
   carbonates sampled at ODP Sites 999 and 1000 help to constrain the
   environmental setting leading to the drowning of the banks. Changes in
   lithology and mass accumulation rates of both the carbonate and
   non-carbonate fraction parallel stable isotope shifts and likely
   indicate regional changes in climate and circulation during the late
   Oligocene-middle Miocene interval. Carbonate mass accumulation rates
   (MARS) at Site 999 suggest increased regional productivity during the
   early Miocene. Terrigenous MARS at both Sites 999 and 1000 show a
   general increase from the Burdigalian through the Serravallian. The
   temporal association among episodes of neritic platform deposition,
   followed by increased productivity as identified by higher carbonate
   MARs and positive excursion in carbon isotopes, suggests that
   oceanographic changes such as local upwelling and nutrification have led
   to the partial drowning of the NNR ``megabank{''}. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {This work aimed to improve the understanding of the role played by
   surface waters in controlling the carbon dioxide partial pressure
   (pCO(2)) and sea-air CO2 fluxes in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula
   (NAP) region. Physical, chemical and biological measurements were made
   on board the Brazilian RV NApOc. Ary Rongel during the austral summers
   of 2008, 2009 and 2010. The study region included the southern portion
   of Drake Passage, Bransfield Strait and the northwestern Weddell Sea.
   The variability in seawater pCO(2) and sea-air CO2 fluxes was
   investigated by quantifying the relevant biological, physical and
   thermodynamic effects. Considerable variability in the seawater pCO(2)
   was found at both spatial and interannual scales. Biological activity
   was the dominant process that removed inorganic carbon from the surface
   waters throughout most of the region, especially in areas with strong
   diatom blooms in the Weddell Sea and areas dominated by cryptophytes in
   Bransfield Strait. Features such as glacial meltwater discharges,
   fronts, eddies, thermodynamic effects and stratification of the mixing
   layer also modified these distributions. Overall, the surface waters in
   the study area represented a sink of atmospheric CO2 in the summers of
   2008 and 2010, with average CO2 fluxes of - 1.0 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and
   - 2.4 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. In the summer of 2009, the
   region was a weak source of CO2 to the atmosphere, with an average CO2
   flux of 0.2 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1). This result suggests that the physical
   processes prevailed over the biological activity at that time, mainly in
   Bransfield Strait.},

Abstract = {To tap the organic waste generated onboard cruise ships is a very
   promising approach to reduce their adverse impact on the maritime
   environment. Biogas produced by means of onboard anaerobic digestion
   offers a complementary energy source for ships' operation. This report
   comprises a detailed presentation of the results gained from
   comprehensive investigations on the gas yield from onboard substrates
   such as food waste, sewage sludge and screening solids. Each person
   onboard generates a total average of about 9 kg of organic waste per
   day. The performed analyses of substrates and anaerobic digestion tests
   revealed an accumulated methane yield of around 159 L per person per
   day. The anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge and food waste (50:50
   VS) emerged as particularly effective and led to an increased biogas
   yield by 24\%, compared to the mono-fermentation. In the best case,
   onboard biogas production can provide an energetic output of 82 W/P, on
   average covering 3.3 to 4.1\% of the total energy demand of a cruise
   ship.},

Abstract = {Purpose Due to rising interest in wind energy harvesting offshore as

   have recently received renewed interest. Their omnidirectional ability
   makes them a very fascinating choice for use with the frequently varying

   the turbine blade as well as wind tower, self-starting at low wind
   speed, and stability issues at very high wind speed for VAWT. Methods In
   this paper presents a detailed overview of various pitch control
   configurations in VAWT to avoid vibration, self-starting problem w.r.t.
   wind speed. Conclusion Various research work carried out in this field
   has been studied critically and according to the number of blades choose
   effective pitch control mechanism to control the vibration and rotation

Title = {Alternative stable states and phase shifts in coral reefs under
   anthropogenic stress},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Pages = {967-982},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ecosystems with alternative stable states (ASS) may shift
   discontinuously from one stable state to another as environmental
   parameters cross a threshold. Reversal can then be difficult due to
   hysteresis effects. This contrasts with continuous state changes in
   response to changing environmental parameters, which are less difficult
   to reverse. Worldwide degradation of coral reefs, involving ``phase
   shifts'' from coral to algal dominance, highlights the pressing need to
   determine the likelihood of discontinuous phase shifts in coral reefs,
   in contrast to continuous shifts with no ASS. However, there is little
   evidence either for or against the existence of ASS for coral reefs. We
   use dynamic models to investigate the likelihood of continuous and
   discontinuous phase shifts in coral reefs subject to sustained
   environmental perturbation by fishing, nutrification, and sedimentation.
   Our modeling results suggest that coral reefs with or without
   anthropogenic stress can exhibit ASS, such that discontinuous phase
   shifts can occur. We also find evidence to support the view that high
   macroalgal growth rates and low grazing rates on macroalgae favor ASS in
   coral reefs. Further, our results suggest that the three stressors
   studied, either alone or in combination, can increase the likelihood of
   both continuous and discontinuous phase shifts by altering the
   competitive balance between corals and algae. However, in contrast to
   continuous phase shifts, we find that discontinuous shifts occur only in
   model coral reefs with parameter values near the extremes of their
   empirically determined ranges. This suggests that continuous shifts are
   more likely than discontinuous shifts in coral reefs. Our results also
   suggest that, for ecosystems in general, tackling multiple human
   stressors simultaneously maximizes resilience to phase shifts, ASS, and
   hysteresis, leading to improvements in ecosystem health and functioning.},

Abstract = {Global riverine discharge of organic matter represents a substantial
   source of terrestrial dissolved and particulate organic carbon to the
   oceans(1,2). This input from rivers is, by itself, more than large
   enough to account for the apparent steady-state replacement times of
   4,00-6,000 yr for oceanic dissolved organic carbon(3-5). But
   paradoxically, terrestrial organic matter, derived from land plants, is
   not detected in seawater and sediments in quantities that correspond to
   its inputs(6-8). Here we present natural C-14 and C-13 data from four
   rivers that discharge to the western North Atlantic Ocean and rnd that
   these rivers are sources of old (C-14-depleted) and young
   (C-14-enriched) terrestrial dissolved organic carbon, and of
   predominantly old terrestrial particulate organic carbon. These findings
   contrast with limited earlier data(9) that suggested terrestrial organic
   matter transported by rivers might be generally enriched in C-14 from
   nuclear testing, and hence newly produced. We also rnd that much of the
   young dissolved organic carbon can be selectively degraded over the
   residence times of river and coastal waters, leaving an even older and
   more refractory component for oceanic export. Thus, pre-ageing and
   degradation may alter significantly the structure, distributions and
   quantities of terrestrial organic matter before its delivery to the
   oceans.},

Abstract = {Four cores of anoxic sediments were collected from the Seine estuary to
   assess the early diagenesis pathways leading to the formation of
   previously reactive phase. Pore waters were analyzed for dissolved iron
   (Fe) and manganese (Mn) and different ligands (e.g., sulfate, chloride,
   total inorganic carbon). The anoxic zone is present up to the first
   centimeter depth, in these conditions the reduction of Mn and Fe oxides
   and SO42- was verified. The sulfate reduction was well established with
   a subsequent carbon mineralization in the NORMAI94 core. The chemical
   speciation of Mn and Fe in the dissolved and solid phases was
   determined. For the dissolved phase, thermodynamic calculations were
   used to characterize and illustrate the importance of carbonate and
   phosphate phases as sinks for Fe and Mn. The ion activity product (LAY)
   of Fe and Mn species was compared to the solubility products (Ks) of
   these species. In the solid phase, the presence of higher concentration
   of calcium carbonate in the Seine sediments is an important factor
   controlling Mn cycle. The carbonate-bound Mn can reach more than 75\% of
   the total concentration. This result is confirmed by the use of electron
   spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The reduction of Fe is closely
   coupled to the sulfate reduction by the formation of new solid phases
   such as FeS and FeS2, which can be regarded as temporal sinks for
   sulfides. These forms were quantified in all cores as acid volatile
   sulfide (AVS: FeS + free sulfide) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS:
   FeS2 + elemental sulfur S-0).},

Abstract = {Two-steps utilization of residual Shorea wood biomass (Meranti) from saw
   mill industry in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, Indonesia was studied to
   point out its potential as the feedstock for the production of food and
   energy. For this purposes, oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus was
   cultivated on mixed sawdust of Shorea wood (major species; Shorea
   leprosula), and then the residual wood obtained from mushroom production
   (spent waste) was subjected to methane fermentation by mixing with cow
   dung in two steps utilization process. The effects of the bio treatment
   on biogas production and correlation with compositional changes in the
   wood by mushroom cultivation were evaluated. P. ostreatus preferentially
   decomposed lignin in the tropical wood with high productivity of matured
   fruiting body. During 44 days, fruiting bodies were harvested and
   collected four times, and lignin and holocellulose in the Shorea wood
   decreased by 24.7\% and 15.8\%, respectively. Biological activity
   expressed as yields of the fruiting body was the maximum at the first
   flush, and decreased gradually. In methane fermentation, addition of
   pretreated wood waste increased production of biogas by 2-3 times higher
   than those without the bio-treated wood. The combination of mushroom and
   biogas production of residual Shorea wood biomass creates a new
   industrial application of unutilized wood biomass from tropical
   rainforests, with a great deal of advantages supplying value-added
   foodstuff and also renewable energy for the local community. (C) 2016

Abstract = {During several expeditions in Mediterranean in 1970-1980s on the
   scientific vessel ``Akademic Kovalevsky{''} (Institute of the Biology of
   the Southern Seas, Sevastopol) some parameters of energy metabolism of
   fishes were studied. It was shown that fat (triacylglicerol)
   accumulation, their utilization for energy metabolism, effect of food
   supply on these processes in Mediterranean fishes have features of
   similarity and difference with Black Sea ones. Principal scheme of
   energy balance for Black Sea fishes may be used for Mediterranean ones.
   At the exumple of horse mackerel Trachurus mediterranus energy
   consumption, utilization, expenditure for growth and metabolism was
   analysed. Intensity and efficiency of production formation was studied.
   Such investigation has perspectives for estination of energy and
   substance balance (budjet) not only for mass species of fishes but
   invertebrate animals of both water bodies too.},

Abstract = {The reorganisation of Earth's climate system from the Oligocene to the
   Miocene was influenced by complex interactions between Tethyan
   tectonics, orbital parameters, oceanographic changes, and carbon cycle
   feedbacks, with climate modelling indicating that pCO(2) was an
   important factor. Oscillating episodes of climate change during the
   Oligocene Miocene transition (OMT) have however been difficult to
   reconcile with existing pCO(2) records. Here we present a new pCO(2)
   record from the OMT into the early Miocene, reconstructed using the
   stomatal proxy method with a database of fossil Lauraceae leaves from
   New Zealand. The leaf database derives from three relatively well-dated
   sites located in the South Island of New Zealand; Foulden Maar, Mataura
   River and Grey Lake. Atmospheric pCO(2) values were obtained based on
   four separate calibrations with three nearest living equivalents, using
   the stomatal ratio method as well as transfer functions. Our results,
   based on the mean values of each of the four calibrations, indicate
   pCO(2) ranging 582-732 ppm (average 650 ppm) at the OMT, falling
   precipitously to mean values of 430-538 ppm (average 492 ppm) for the
   earliest Miocene and similar to 454-542 ppm (average 502 ppm) in the
   early Miocene. The much higher values of pCO(2) at the OMT indicate that
   pCO played an important role in climate dynamics during this time,
   potentially including the abrupt termination of glaciations.},

Title = {A fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach for Exo-Planetary
   Habitability},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Nowadays, we know thousands of exoplanets, some of them potentially
   habitable. Next technological facilities (JWST, for example) have
   exoplanet atmosphere analysis capabilities, but they also have limits in
   terms of how many targets can be studied. Therefore, there is a need to
   rank and prioritize these exoplanets with the aim of searching for
   biomarkers. Some criteria involved, such as the habitability potential
   of a dry-rock planet versus a water-rich planet, or a potentially-locked
   planet versus a tidally-locked planet, are often vague and the use of
   the fuzzy set theory is advisable. We have applied a combination of
   Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methodologies with fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy
   Reference Ideal Method (FRIM), to this problem. We have analyzed the
   habitability potential of 1798 exoplanets from TEPCat database based on
   a set of criteria (composition, atmosphere, energy, tidal locking, type
   of planet and liquid water), in terms of their similarity to the only
   ideal alternative, The Earth. Our results, when compared with the
   probability index SEPHI, indicate that Kepler-442b, Kepler-062e/f, and
   LHS\_1140b are the best exoplanets for searching for biomarkers,
   regardless its technical difficulty. If we take into account current
   technical feasibility, the best candidate is TRAPPIST-1e. (C) 2021

Abstract = {With the increasing demand for marine structures, including ships and
   wave energy devices, to operate in energetic, high seastates, the need
   for modeling and simulation of nonlinear ocean wave fields in
   large-scale wave basins is becoming essential. In response to this
   demand, a number of large-scale wave basins have been placed into
   operation over the years and larger and more sophisticated new ones are
   under planning and construction. In this article, the current state of
   practice and technical issues in modeling and simulation of high
   seastate ocean waves are summarized. A novel methodology for
   quantitative evaluation of the suitability of competing linear and
   nonlinear wave theories for a given wave field with multi-spatial
   measurements is presented. Preliminary results of an on-going study on
   wave modeling and analysis of measured data from a wave simulation
   performance study of the Oregon State University directional wave basin,
   using nonlinear wave theory (e.g. the nonlinear Schrodinger equation),
   nonlinear Fourier analysis and inference to the existence of rogue
   waves, are presented. Suggestions on future development of nonlinear
   wavemaker theories and numerical modeling and simulation of large-scale
   wave basin nonlinear wave generation are proposed. The article concludes
   with some observations and remarks on the importance of using an
   appropriate wave theory to determine the existence of nonlinear
   coherence structures, including breathers and rogue waves.},

Title = {Resilience of cold-water scleractinian corals to ocean acidification:
   Boron isotopic systematics of pH and saturation state up-regulation},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {21-34},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The boron isotope systematics has been determined for azooxanthellate
   scleractinian corals from a wide range of both deep-sea and
   shallow-water environments. The aragonitic coral species, Caryophyllia
   smithii, Desmophyllum dianthus, Enallopsammia rostrata, Lophelia
   pertusa, and Madrepora oculata, are all found to have relatively high
   delta B-11 compositions ranging from 23.2 parts per thousand to 28.7
   parts per thousand. These values lie substantially above the
   pH-dependent inorganic seawater borate equilibrium curve, indicative of
   strong up-regulation of pH of the internal calcifying fluid (pH(cf)),
   being elevated by similar to 0.6-0.8 units (Delta pH) relative to
   ambient seawater. In contrast, the deep-sea calcitic coral Corallium sp.
   has a significantly lower delta B-11 composition of 15.5 parts per
   thousand, with a corresponding lower Delta pH value of similar to 0.3
   units, reflecting the importance of mineralogical control on biological
   pH up-regulation.
   The solitary coral D. dianthus was sampled over a wide range of seawater
   pH(T) and shows an approximate linear correlation with Delta pH(Desmo) =
   6.43 - 0.71pH(T) (r(2) = 0.79). An improved correlation is however found
   with the closely related parameter of seawater aragonite saturation
   state, where DpHDesmo = 1.09 - 0.14 Omega(arag) (r(2) = 0.95),
   indicating the important control that carbonate saturation state has on
   calcification. The ability to up-regulate internal pHcf, and
   consequently Omega(cf), of the calcifying fluid is therefore a process
   present in both azooxanthellate and zooxanthellate aragonitic corals,
   and is attributed to the action of Ca2+-ATPase in modulating the proton
   gradient between seawater and the site of calcification. These findings
   also show that the boron isotopic compositions (delta B-11(carb)) of
   aragonitic corals are highly systematic and consistent with direct
   uptake of the borate species within the biologically controlled
   extracellular calcifying medium.
   We also show that the relatively strong up-regulation of pH and
   consequent elevation of the internal carbonate saturation state
   (Omega(cf) similar to 8.5 to similar to 13) at the site of calcification
   by cold-water corals, facilitates calcification at or in some cases
   below the aragonite saturation horizon, providing a greater ability to
   adapt to the already low and now decreasing carbonate ion
   concentrations. Although providing greater resilience to the effects of
   ocean acidification and enhancing rates of calcification with increasing
   temperature, the process of internal pH(cf) up-regulation has an
   associated energetic cost, and therefore growth-rate cost, of similar to
   10\% per 0.1 pH unit decrease in seawater pH(T). Furthermore, as the
   aragonite saturation horizon shoals with rapidly increasing pCO(2) and
   Omega(arag) < 1, increased dissolution of the exposed skeleton will
   ultimately limit their survival in the deep oceans. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Spatio-temporal evolution of temperature and fluid flow through a new
   ``thermo-lithological{''} boundary; the case of a pit crater of Karthala
   volcano (Comoros archipelago) refilled on January 13th 2007 by a lava
   flow},

Abstract = {On January 13th 2007 an effusive eruption on the top of Karthala
   volcano, in the Comoros islands, emitted a lava flow which has been
   perfectly constrained inside the cylindrical shape of the Choungou
   Chagnoumeni pit crater; 225 min diameter and with a thickness of about 7
   m.
   This eruptive event, with a known geometry before the eruptive event,
   give a unique opportunity to study a ``thermo-lithological{''}
   structural boundary recently born, and follow its thermal and fluid flow
   evolution in time. The motivation of this survey is to better understand
   some scientific questions such as: How fluid flows evolve in time along
   a new thermo-lithological boundary? How lava temperature cooling induce
   changes in hydrothermal circulation? Different data set have been
   acquired on the field in order to discuss these problematics. On March
   2008, a temperature monitoring was installed with a data logger (CR 1000
   Campbell Scientific) and 11 sensors placed at 30 cm depth, 1 m apart,
   inside the crater, along a straight profile, perpendicular to the
   western rim of the Choungou Chagnoumeni crater. Data were recorded
   during 275 days out of 677 days, through 4 different periods between 3rd
   March 2008 and 8th January 2010.
   On June 2009, high resolution electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)
   coupled with soil CO2 diffuse degassing was performed above the
   monitoring line of temperature sensors along a profile of 128 m long,
   with ERT electrodes and CO2 measurements located each 2 m.
   Numerical modeling of the temperatures was also tested on this case
   study, thanks to a finite element method (FEM) code using the Rheolef C+
   + library. The aim of using a numerical code, integrating a maximum of
   parameters, have been to better interpret the other data acquired on the
   field.
   The lateral permeability transition induced by the crater refilled with
   lava flow material was attested by the soil diffuse degassing profile.
   Coupling ERT and temperature modeling allow evidencing the heat transfer
   with conductive processes.
   The most striking result has been the inversion of the lateral
   temperature gradient which evolves during the first three years of
   cooling, from the highest temperature in direction to the center of the
   crater to the highest temperature in direction to the boundary of the
   crater.
   Such a result highlights the importance of structural boundary in
   dragging hydrothermal fluids and has been interpreted by a change in the
   main parameter governing the heat transfer close to the boundary of the
   crater, which evolved from (1) a lava heat source toward (2) a higher
   permeability area constituted by the boundary of the crater. This study
   dearly displays the importance of the lateral permeability gradient in
   changing the hydrothermal circulation in time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {A region of hypoxic waters has formed annually over the past several
   decades in the northern Gulf of Mexico. This has motivated the studies
   of mechanisms controlling the development of hypoxia. Both field and
   laboratory approaches were used to examine sediment texture,
   erodibility, and composition. Sediment texture analyses show that grain
   size relates to the proximity to the Mississippi and Atchafalaya river
   deltas and to the remnants of shifts in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya
   deltaic lobes. Temporal variability in erodibility relates to seasonal
   weather patterns, with more energetic wave conditions in winter and
   spring setting up an active bottom layer that increases erodibility,
   compared to quiescent summers that allow for seabed consolidation. The
   amount of eroded material is fairly low until shear stress levels in the
   bottom boundary layer exceed 0.4 Pa. An organically enriched fluff layer
   was found at the sediment-water interface, which is highly erodible
   under low shear stress levels. Eroded volatile suspended solids (a proxy
   for organic material) vs. increasing levels of shear stress revealed a
   distinct pattern at all sample areas; higher concentrations of organic
   material were eroded at the lowest (0.01 Pa) and highest (0.6 Pa)
   applied shear stresses, and there was a higher ratio of the volatile to
   total suspended solids at 0.01 Pa. Based on erodibility experiments and
   modeling data analysis, the low shear stress levels during the quiescent
   periods in summer were sometimes high enough to resuspend this fluff
   layer, but not underlying sediment, thereby potentially facilitating the
   development of bottom water hypoxia.},

Title = {Development of a multi-scale wetland Resilience Index from muskellunge
   nursery habitat in Georgian Bay, Lake Huron},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {212-225},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In a 2012 study, no age-0 muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) were found in
   any of 16 historic nursery sites in coastal marshes of southeastern
   Georgian Bay (SEGB), and this was attributed to sustained low water
   levels (1999-2013) that had altered the vegetation structure of nursery
   habitat. In the same study, age-0 muskellunge were found in 16 coastal
   marshes surveyed in northern Georgian Bay (NGB), even though these sites
   had been subjected to the same water-level conditions. We hypothesize
   that hydrogeomorphic features of NGB sites made them resilient to
   effects of sustained low lake levels that made the SEGB sites unsuitable
   for age-0 muskellunge. Compared to their SEGB counterparts, the NGB
   nursery sites were significantly steeper, deeper, and less sheltered
   under low water levels. We used these hydrogeomorphic features to
   develop a multi-scale Resilience Index (RI) for identifying coastal
   wetlands that are resilient to stable low lake levels. The RI correctly
   classified the NGB and SEGB nursery sites, with an area-under-the-curve
   score of 0.973. Coarser-scale variants of the RI provide a regional
   screening tool in the identification of resilient wetland habitat (e.g.
   potential muskellunge nursery habitat), and a basin-wide approach to
   identify vulnerable wetland habitats. This multi-scale index, in
   conjunction with targeted field surveys, should provide managers a
   useful tool in the face of uncertain water level forecasts.},

Title = {Short-term variability of photosynthetic parameters and particulate and
   dissolved primary production in the Alboran Sea (SW Mediterranean)},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {212},
Pages = {53-67},
Abstract = {The short-term variability of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E)
   relationships and integrated primary production at 3 stations (Stns A,
   B, C in a coastal-offshore gradient) located across the Western Alboran
   Sea Gyre (SW Mediterranean) were investigated during a High Frequency
   Flux Experiment (1 to 16 May 1998). Photosynthetic production of total,
   particulate and dissolved organic carbon (TOC, POC and DOC respectively)
   was considered separatedly in 34 experiments. Photosynthetic parameters
   were calculated for TOC and POC data. For POC measurements, maximum
   photosynthetic rate (p(m)(B) (POC)) and the initial slope of the P-E
   curve (alpha) varied between 0.59 and 6.25 mg C (mg chi a)(-1) h(-1) and
   0.0023 and 0.0182 mg C (mg chi a)(-1) h(-1) (mu mol photons m(-2)
   s(-1))(-1), respectively, and were significantly correlated, showing a
   similar decrease with depth. No photoinhibition was detected at any
   depth and the light saturation parameter (E-k) was on average 251 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1), suggesting that phytoplankton assemblages were
   acclimated to high irradiance levels in the whole area. Percent
   extracellular release (PER) obtained for each experimental irradiance
   (PERE = DOC/ {[}POC+DOC]) showed an inverse relationship with irradiance
   when data from all the P-E experiments were pooled. A light-saturated
   chi a-normalized DOC production rate (P, Dec) was calculated as P-m(B)
   (TOC) - P-m(B) (POC), and PERm values calculated as P-m(B) (DOC)/P-m(B)
   (TOC) tended to increase with depth. Integrated particulate and total
   primary production varied considerably (23- and 35-fold, respectively),
   but tended to decrease along a coastal-offshore gradient. During the
   cruise, a subsurface phytoplankton bloom was advected into Stn A,
   increasing primary production rates up to 1 g C m(-2) d(-1). Average
   particulate primary production was 632 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn A, 388 mg
   C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn B and 330 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn C, with dissolved
   primary production ranging from 4 to 44\% of total values. integrated
   primary production was significantly correlated with surface chi a but
   not with integrated chi a. This finding has implications for the
   estimation of regional primary production based on remote sensing of
   near-surface pigments. Altogether, the results confirmed that the high
   hydrodynamism of the Alboran Sea was associated with marked biological
   variability and episodic high primary production events.},

Abstract = {The western coast of Cape Corse in northern Corsica is a remarkable area
   by virtue of its geological, biological and landscape diversity.
   Asbestos extraction between 1948 and 1965 however at Canari Mine, has
   modified the natural rocky escarpments, cutting the mountain into steps
   and has altered the coastal and marine zones from Punta di Canella to
   Farinole. Albo harbour was filled with rubble discharging directly to
   the sea, and the coast prograded 400 m after 4 years between 1954 and
   1958. Artificial shores of up to 300 m in width appeared at the bottom
   of existing steep cliffs over a distance of more than 5 km between 1948
   and 1973. The Posidonia seagrass was buried by the introduction of
   debris. Since June 1965, the mine is closed and coastal modification
   results from material movement from north to south. As an exception,
   Campana beach appeared in the northern part of the discharge area in
   1973. The sediment on Nonza beach already displays cemented slabs that
   attest to very early diagenesis. This particular environment of
   ultramafic sands and pebbles appear to have produced alkaline conditions
   and probably enhances carbonate precipitation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {The country of Indonesia is an agrarian country and an archipelagic
   country with a vast land area of 1,890,754 km2 based on the results of
   the Round Table Conference (KMB) and has the potential of numerous
   islands scattered throughout the archipelago with a total of
   approximately 17,500 according to the Hydrographic and Oceanography
   Center Navy (Pushidrosal). As a country that has a wealth of agriculture
   is so abundant and the population is ranked third in Asia and ranked
   fourth in the world. As time goes by the development of the economic
   system as well as the increasing number of population density, so the
   need for land for the sake of residence is higher. The clash between the
   interests of survival and eating can lead to the conversion of
   agricultural land. Transfer of land that does not pay attention to
   environmental aspect and humanitarian aspect cause serious threat to the
   nation of Indonesia in the future. This paper examines (1) Human rights
   violations against farmers (2) Protection of agricultural land due to
   the granting of uncontrolled transfer of uncontrolled agricultural land
   functions to food threats (3) alternative use of customary law-based
   agricultural dispute resolution.},

Abstract = {As documented by various recent studies (AUCELLI et alu, 2004, FAILLACE,
   2004. IANNANTUONO et alu, 2005, GRUPPO NAZIONALE PER LA RICERCA
   DELL'ANIBIENTE COSTIERO, 2006a, ACLLI e abi, 2007, IANNANTLIONO, 2007),
   the evolution of the 36 km long Molise coast during the last fifty years
   is characterised by a prevailing tendency to shoreline retreat
   The aim of the present paper is to provide a precise description of the
   Molise coast with reference to its coastal morphology along with a
   detailed frame of the evolution of its shoreline and first indications
   on the potential erosion risk
   The Molise coast that includes ca 13 km of high coast behaves at as a
   low coast system, because the cliffs limiting the high coast to the sea
   are located, except for the promontory of Termoh, at variable distance
   from the shoreline Beaches are present nearly all along the coast and
   anthropic structures frequently are located along their inner edges
   To analyse shoreline variations in detail, the Molise coast was
   subdivided nine reaches (T1-T9) of different lengths and characters
   Quantitative analyses on linear shoreline variations and related surface
   changes were carried OM for the 1954-2003 time interval and relative
   sub-periods 1954-1992 and 1992-2003 From 1954 to 2003, the general
   shoreline retreat caused a total loss of ca 1 090 000 m(2) of coastal
   area (beaches, clones, deltaic and retro-dune areas) The most sensible
   reaches to erosion are TI and T7 that respectively comprise the mouths
   of the Trigno and Biferno rivers, which experienced in this period a
   retreat of ca 230 and 350 metres, respectively A acceleration of
   shoreline retreat with shown by the comparison sub-periods 1954-1992 and
   1992-2003 Though the second period is much shorter (11 years vs 38
   years), TI and T7, in particular, totalize nearly 50\% of the surface
   losses that occurred during the precedent periocl Due to such an
   acceleration. during the second periocl ca 32\% of the total erosion
   occurred. giving rise to a loss of ea 348 609 m(2) For reaches T1 and
   17, the average annual retreat rates changed from respectively 2 37 and
   3 24 m/y to 4 24 and 4 74 during the second penocl, when reach T7
   underwent a maximum reti-eat of about 231 men-es which corresponds to an
   average annual retreat of 21 m/y
   The reconstructed acceleration of erosion is in net contrast to the
   increasing protection of the coast by defense structures as evident
   above all for reach 17 In order to better understand this apparent
   inconsistency, and the consequent hypothesis for a possible meteochmanc
   influence (already outlined for part of the Molise coast by AUCELLI et
   alit, 2007), a detailed analysis of the period 1992-2003, subdivided
   therefore into sub-periods 1992-1997, 19972000, 2000-2003, was carried
   out This analysis showed consistent differences between the
   distinguished sub-periods in relation to average annual shoreline
   variations zind the percentage with which each reach contributed to
   erosion The observed differences strongly support the hypothesis that
   variations of meicomarine conditions have strongly favoured erosion
   during the second period, and in particular durme sub-period 2000-2003.
   thus outImmg the need to adequately consider such climatic influence
   when developing potential erosion scenaries related to climate change
   Starting from the basic morphological and topographical features of the
   Molise coast, in order to examine the potential erosion risk, the rates
   of annual average linear shoreline variations for periods 1954-992 and
   1992-2003 were examined on the basis of the risk scheme developed by
   (1994) Such an examination allowed to evaluate the degree of erosion
   risk for each reach and to attribute, in particular, a very high erosion
   risk to reaches TI and 17, which, indeed, are the main responsible for
   the observed shoreline instability
   Further analyses carried out on coastal sectors characterised by the
   occurrence of constructions located up to ca 200 m from the current
   shoreline along the inner edges of the beaches, allowed to calculate the
   potential time span required by marine erosion to possibly affect the
   constructions Said calculations point out for the northern sectors of
   reaches T1 and T7 time spans of 13,5 and 22 years, respectively, and
   therefore a real, and very high erosion risk},

Abstract = {Information on palaeoclimate is encoded in groundwater in a variety of
   measurable ``tracers{''}. A great variety of geochemical and isotopic
   methods has been developed and tested with the aim of defining the
   different moments and aspects of the water cycle, providing a
   fundamental information on the recharge and groundwater flow conditions.
   Furthermore, environmental tracers allow us to reconstruct past
   environmental changes.
   Particular emphasis is put on Western Africa and on the Po valley. In
   fact, two features are common to these regions: the movement of air
   masses crossing them and the geological characteristics. From the global
   perspective, Sahel, North Africa, Mediterranean Basin and Central Europe
   reveal a relative simple pattern of spatial and temporal composition of
   precipitation. The displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone
   (ITCZ) and the Azores anticyclone control the climatological regime and,
   consequently, the isotopic composition of rainfall. Moreover, both
   regions are characterised by big aquifers in the form of multilayer
   systems several hundred metres thick in large sedimentary basins. The
   aquifers are generally formed by sandstones (Sahara) or sands (Po
   valley) and are interbedded with argillaceous layers and outcrop only in
   fairly limited areas, constituting the recharge zones. The groundwater
   movement in confined aquifers is always lower than 1 in year respecting
   the conditions of steady-state flow regime and hydraulic continuity,
   necessary for the ``hydro-archives{''}.
   The comparison between the Sahara-Sahel and southern Alps allows to
   define the principal periods of aquifer replenishment associated with
   the displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the
   Azores anticyclone.
   Continental isotope archives provide a means of extending the knowledge
   on the magnitude and the causes of environmental and climate changes.
   Nevertheless, for a quantitative interpretation of the isotope records
   preserved in continental archives, it is necessary to know the response
   of the isotopic composition of precipitation to long-term fluctuations
   in key climatic parameters over a given area. Further, the transfer
   functions relating the climate-induced changes of the isotopic
   composition of precipitation to the isotope record preserved in the
   given archive should be established. It appears, thus, that stable
   isotopes can, presently only be used as an indirect proxy dating method
   for palaeowaters. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens in mosquitoes from Corsica
   Island, France},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens are the main
   causative agents of heartworm disease and subcutaneous dirofilariasis in
   domestic and wild canids, respectively. Both pathogens have zoonotic
   potential and are transmitted by mosquitoes. The present study aimed to
   determine the transmission period, prevalence and diversity of
   Dirofilaria spp. vectors from endemic areas of Corsica (France).
   Methods: A monthly point data model based on average temperature
   recorded by four meteorological stations during 2017 was used to
   calculate the Dirofilaria transmission period. From June to September
   2017, female mosquitoes (n = 1802) were captured using-Biogents (R)
   Sentinel 2 traps lured with carbon dioxide and BG-LureT or octanol.
   Mosquitoes were identified to species level, pooled accordingly, and
   screened using multiplex real-time qPCR to detect D. immitis and D.
   repens.
   Results: The monthly point data model showed the possible transmission
   of Dirofilaria spp. from the third week in May to the last week in
   October in the studied area. Mosquitoes were identified as Ochlerotatus
   caspius (n = 1432), Aedes albopictus (n = 199), Culex pipiens sensu lato
   (n = 165) and Aedes vexans (n = 6) and were grouped into 109 pools (from
   1 to 27 specimens, mean 11.4 +/- 0.7), of which 16 scored positive for
   Dirofilaria spp. (i.e., n = 13; estimated infection rate {[}EIR] = 1.1\%
   for D. immitis and n = 3; EIR = 0.2\% for D. repens). Specifically, 6
   (i.e., EIR = 3.8\%) of 15 pools of Ae. albopictus were positive for D.
   immitis, 2 of 14 of Cx. pipiens s.l. were positive for D. immitis and D.
   repens, respectively, and 8 of 77 pools of Oc. caspius were positive for
   D. immitis (i.e., n = 6; EIR = 0.4\%) and D. repens (i.e., 2; EIR =
   0.1\%). The highest mosquito infection rate was recorded in July (EIR =
   2.5\%), then in June (EIR = 1.3\%) and September (EIR = 0.6\%).
   Conclusions: The data suggest that both Dirofilaria species are endemic
   and occur possibly in sympatry in the studied area in Corsica,
   highlighting the need to implement preventive chemoprophylaxis and
   vector control strategies to reduce the risk of these filarioids in dog
   and human populations.},

Abstract = {The coastal zone, consisting of the continental shelves to -200 m,
   including bays, lagoons, estuaries, and near-shore banks, is an
   environment that is strongly affected by two much bigger environmental
   reservoirs adjacent to it: the land and open ocean. Zn the coastal zone,
   as elsewhere in the Earth system, the biogeochemical cycle of carbon is
   coupled to, and driven by, the cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus through
   biological transfer processes. Human activities in the past 300 years
   have become an increasingly important geological factor with respect to
   the coastal zone through four major environmental perturbations: (1) C,
   N, and S emissions from fossil fuel burning; (2) changes in land-use
   activities resulting in gaseous C emissions, increased dissolved and
   particulate loads, organic matter transport, and feedbacks to biological
   production; (3) application of inorganic nitrogen- and
   phosphorus-containing fertilizers; and (4) discharges of sewage
   containing reactive organic C, N, and P. In addition, the mean global
   surface temperature of the planet has increased over this period of time
   by approximately 1 degrees C, perhaps also because of human activities.
   Starting with the year 1700 as a base for the industrial-age
   perturbations on land, we analyzed the consequences of these five
   perturbations to the carbon cycle in the coastal zone using the
   thirteen-reservoir, process-driven model TOTEM for the coupled C-N-P-S
   biogeochemical cycles. An indicator of the reliability of the model is
   the good agreement of its results showing the time course of increasing
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the year 1700 with the
   observational results reported in the literature. During the past three
   centuries, there has been a significant increase in the amount of
   organic carbon transported from land and stored in coastal zone
   sediments. Of the total transported. about 65\% was stored in sediments
   and the remaining 35\% primarily recycled through exchange with the
   atmosphere and open ocean. The imbalance between the amounts of organic
   carbon produced by gross photosynthesis and remineralized has apparently
   increased slightly in favor of remineralization, corresponding to an
   increase in the degree of heterotrophy of the global coastal zone. This
   process, along with the release of CO2 from the formation of CaCO3,
   counteracts the invasion of CO2 from the atmosphere to coastal waters
   that is driven by the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. An
   analysis of a possible reduction or full collapse of the oceanic
   thermohaline circulation, as believed to have occurred in the past and a
   possibility for future centuries, indicates that the CO2 transfer from
   the atmosphere to coastal waters would increase while that from the
   atmosphere to open ocean surface waters would decrease, if such an event
   took place. This is attributable to a reduced supply to the coastal zone
   of dissolved inorganic carbon by coastal upwelling from the deeper
   ocean, a process linked to the global conveyor belt of the thermohaline
   circulation. To date, fossil fuel CO2 emissions to the atmosphere,
   changes in land-use practices, and sewage discharges have been the three
   main factors affecting the carbon cycle in the global coastal zone. The
   latter inputs from land have apparently produced a slight increase in
   the heterotrophy of the global coastal zone.
   However, increases in the inputs of nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus
   from land to the coastal zone in the future may drive its. trophic state
   toward net production and storage (autotrophy), thereby also increasing
   its potential role as a sink; for atmospheric CO. The direction of
   future change in net ecosystem production in the coastal zone strongly
   depends on changes in the relative magnitudes of organic carbon and
   nutrient N and P fluxes to the coastal zone via rivers, provided the
   upwelling fluxes remain constant. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {Cardiopulmonary exercise testing adds measurement of ventilation and
   volume of oxygen uptake and exhaled carbon dioxide to routine
   physiological and performance parameters obtainable from conventional
   exercise testing, furnishing an all-around vision of the systems
   involved in both oxygen transport from air to mitochondria and its use
   during exercise. Peculiarities of cardiopulmonary exercise testing
   methodology are the use of ramp protocols and calibration procedures for
   flow meters and gas analyzers. Among the several parameters provided by
   this technique, peak oxygen uptake, first and second ventilatory
   thresholds, respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen pulse, slope of
   ventilation divided by exhaled carbon dioxide relationship, exercise
   oscillatory ventilation, circulatory power, and partial pressure of
   end-tidal carbon dioxide are among the most relevant in the clinical
   setting. The choice of parameters to be considered will depend on the
   indication to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in the individual subject
   or patient, namely, exercise tolerance assessment, prognostic
   stratification, training prescription, treatment efficacy evaluation,
   diagnosis of causes of unexplained exercise tolerance reduction, or
   exercise (patho) physiology evaluation for research purposes. Overall,
   cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a methodology now widely available
   and supported by sound scientific evidence. Despite this, its potential
   still remains largely underused. Strong efforts and future
   investigations are needed to address these issues and further promote
   the use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in the clinical and research
   setting.},

Abstract = {Purpose: CONTRAIL (Comprehensive Observation Network for Trace gases)
   observations retrieved by passenger aircrafts is becoming more popular
   among the researchers who are doing inverse modelling. The inverted
   Asian CO2 fluxes still remains challenging with a large uncertainty due
   to lack of observations. In this study, we use maximum likelihood
   ensemble filter (MLEF) method to estimate the carbon fluxes using
   CONTRAIL observations in addition to the existing flask and continuous
   measurements.
   Methodology: A pseudodata experiment is carried out with the
   artificially generated biases for the CO2 fluxes. Hourly land fluxes
   (Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)) derived from Simple Bioshereversion 3
   (SiB3) model, Takahashi ocean fluxes and Brenkert fossil fuel emissions
   are the fluxes used. Estimated fluxes defined in monthly scale are
   recovered for the months from May to October using MLEF coupled with
   Parametric Chemistry Transport Model (PCTM).
   Findings: CONTRAIL observations give a considerable uncertainty
   reduction for the estimated land fluxes for the Asian region and more
   than 50\% uncertainty reduction for North American and European regions.
   Pseudo truth has been well recovered using this assimilation scheme.
   Originality: In the future, this model is going to be used with real
   observations to identify the carbon sinks and sources globally as well
   as mainly for the South Asian region.},

Abstract = {Elucidating the physiological mechanisms of the irregular yet concerted
   flowering rhythm of mass flowering tree species in the tropics requires
   long-term monitoring of flowering phenology, exogenous and endogenous
   environmental factors, as well as identifying interactions and
   dependencies among these factors. To investigate the proximate factors
   for floral initiation of mast seeding trees in the tropics, we monitored
   the expression dynamics of two key flowering genes, meteorological
   conditions and endogenous resources over two flowering events of Shorea
   curtisii and Shorea leprosula in the Malay Peninsula. Comparisons of
   expression dynamics of genes studied indicated functional conservation
   of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and LEAFY (LFY) in Shorea. The genes were
   highly expressed at least 1month before anthesis for both species. A
   mathematical model considering the synergistic effect of cool
   temperature and drought on activation of the flowering gene was
   successful in predicting the observed gene expression patterns.
   Requirement of both cool temperature and drought for floral transition
   suggested by the model implies that flowering phenologies of these
   species are sensitive to climate change. Our molecular phenology
   approach in the tropics sheds light on the conserved role of flowering
   genes in plants inhabiting different climate zones and can be widely
   applied to dissect the flowering processes in other plant species.},

Abstract = {A baseline hydrochemistry of the above zone aquifer was examined for the
   potential of CO2 early detection monitoring. Among the major ionic
   components and stable isotope ratios of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon,
   components with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of <10 \% for the
   seasonal variation were selected as relatively stable. These components
   were tested for sensitivity to the introduction of 0.1 mol/L CO2 (g)
   using the PHREEQC simulation results. If the relatively stable
   components were sensitive to the introduction of CO2, then they could be
   used as indicators of CO2 leakage into the above zone. As an analog to
   the zone above CO2 storage formation, we sampled deep groundwater,
   including geothermal groundwater from well depths of 400-700 m below the
   ground surface (bgs) and carbonated springs with a high CO2 content in
   Korea. Under the natural conditions of inland geothermal groundwater,
   pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bicarbonate (HCO3), delta O-18, delta
   H-2, and delta C-13 were relatively stable as well as sensitive to the
   introduction of CO2 (g), thus showing good potential as monitoring
   parameters for early detection of CO2 leakage. In carbonated springs,
   the parameters identified were pH, delta O-18, and delta H-2. Baseline
   hydrochemistry monitoring could provide information on parameters useful
   for detecting anomalies caused by CO2 leakage as measures for early
   warning.},

Title = {Improving estuary models by reducing uncertainties associated with river

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {207},
Pages = {63-73},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {To mitigate against future changes to estuaries such as water quality,
   catchment and estuary models can be coupled to simulate the transport of
   harmful pathogenic viruses, pollutants and nutrients from their
   terrestrial sources, through the estuary and to the coast. To predict
   future changes to estuaries, daily mean river flow projections are
   typically used. We show that this approach cannot resolve higher
   frequency discharge events that have large impacts to estuarine
   dilution, contamination and recovery for two contrasting estuaries. We
   therefore characterise sub-daily scale flow variability and propagate
   this through an estuary model to provide robust estimates of impacts for
   the future.
   River flow data (35-year records at 15-min sampling) were used to
   characterise variabilities in storm hydrograph shapes and simulate the
   estuarine response. In particular, we modelled a fast-responding
   catchment-estuary system (Conwy, UK), where the natural variability in
   hydrograph shapes generated large variability in estuarine circulation
   that was not captured when using daily-averaged river forcing. In the
   extreme, the freshwater plume from a `flash' flood (lasting <12 h) was
   underestimated by up to 100\% - and the response to nutrient loading was
   underestimated further still. A model of a slower-responding system
   (Humber, UK), where hydrographs typically last 2-4 days, showed less
   variability in estuarine circulation and good approximation with
   daily-averaged flow forcing. Our result has implications for entire
   system impact modelling; when we determine future changes to estuaries,
   some systems will need higher resolution future river flow estimates.

Abstract = {China has entered the area of new normal economy which requires the
   harmonious development of energy consumption, environmental protection
   and economic development. Natural gas hydrate is a potential clean
   energy with tremendous reserve in China The successful field test of
   marine hydrate exploitation in South China Sea created a new record of
   the longest continuous gas production from natural gas hydrate. However,
   the corresponding fundamental research is still urgently needed in order
   to narrow the gap between field test and commercial production. This
   paper reviewed the latest advances of experimental study on gas
   production from hydrate reservoir in China. The experimental apparatus
   for investigating the performance of hydrate dissociation in China has
   developed from one dimensional to two dimensional and three dimensional.
   In addition, well configuration developed from one tube to complicated
   multi-well networks to satisfy the demand of different production
   models. Besides, diverse testing methods have been established. The
   reviewed papers preliminary discussed the mechanical properties and the
   sediment deformation situation during the process of hydrate
   dissociation. However, most reported articles only consider the physical
   factor, the coupled mechanism of physical and chemical factor for the
   mechanical properties of the sediment and the sand production problem
   should be studied further. (C) 2019 The Chemical Industry and

Abstract = {Petroleum hydrocarbons in offshore sediments from the central part of
   the Gulf were measured using fluorescence spectrophotometry.
   Concentrations varied between 4.0 and 56.2 mu g g(-1) wet sediment
   (expressed as Kuwait Crude Oil equivalents), with an average of 12.3 mu
   g g(-1). Highest concentrations were recorded in the north-west sector,
   with concentrations decreasing in a south-westerly direction. No
   significant correlations were observed between petroleum hydrocarbons
   and sedimentary organic carbon (r=-0.07), `mud' content (r=0.09), `sand'
   content (r=-0.08) or `gravel' content (r=-0.12), Distributions of oil
   are considered to relate more closely to prevailing current and
   localized pollutant sources in the region. Despite the substantial
   inputs of oil to the Gulf, contamination earn be considered
   comparatively low, possibly reflecting physical processes and biological
   degradation which accelerate removal of petroleum from this marine
   environment.},

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems can be seen in the
   changing distribution, migration, and abundance of species in the
   oceans. For some species this changing environment may be beneficial and
   can support population expansions. In the northeast Atlantic (NEA), the
   Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) is undergoing an increase in stock
   size accompanied by changing summer migration patterns, which have
   resulted in an expansion further north and north west than previously
   recorded. This study uses microsatellite loci to confirm the
   differentiation among NEA and northwest Atlantic (NWA) mackerel spawning
   populations and to assess the level of structuring within these
   populations. In addition, to enable population-specific exploitation
   rates to be factored into fisheries management, we identified the origin
   of individuals composing the expanding feeding aggregations in the
   central north Atlantic (Greenland, Iceland, Faroes), with all
   aggregations tested originating from spawning populations in the NEA.
   This study showed that microsatellite loci were useful to assess the
   contribution of NEA and NWA populations to mixed feeding aggregations
   across the north Atlantic for large pelagic fish stocks but were not
   powerful enough to evaluate the specific contribution of known stocks
   within NEA and NWA.},

Title = {A substantial export flux of particulate organic carbon linked to

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the Arctic Ocean, vertical fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC)
   remain low during the dark winter period because POC fluxes are derived
   from photosynthetic production. Passively sinking dead copepods are
   traditionally excluded from POC fluxes estimated using sediment traps,
   resulting in the underestimation of the total POC flux. Here, we present
   the seasonal variability of total POC export flux measured by a sediment
   trap moored at similar to 100 m in the Amundsen Gulf (southeastern
   Beaufort Sea) over October 2007-July 2008. Surprisingly, the integrated
   total POC flux for February (466 mg m(-2)) was the second highest flux
   during the study period (the highest was in Jul; 1015 mg C m(-2)) due to
   a contribution of 91\% from sinking dead copepods. The total POC flux in
   February 2008 in the Amundsen Gulf was up to two orders of magnitude
   higher than the previously reported traditional POC winter fluxes that
   did not include the contribution of sinking dead copepods. Hence, the
   POC flux in February only could be equivalent to similar to 18\% of the
   quasi-annual traditional POC flux. Our observations suggest that a
   substantial POC export flux occurred during winter 2007-2008 due to
   zooplankton life cycle.},

Abstract = {To avoid or mitigate global warming, several ocean carbon capture and
   storage concepts have been proposed. One of the recent approaches is to
   dispose carbon dioxide via a fixed vertical cantilevered pipe onto the
   seabed in deep waters. Due to a high aspect ratio and flexibility of
   such long pipe conveying fluid with fixed-free end conditions and
   external hydrodynamic loading caused by currents, the pipe may
   experience large amplitude 3-D vibrations leading to structural failure.
   Hence, it is essential to understand and investigate the pipe nonlinear
   dynamic behaviors subject to combined flow-induced vibration (FIV) and
   vortex-induced vibration (VIV).
   In this study, the 3-D nonlinear equations of a cantilevered pipe
   discharging fluid in the sea are analyzed using a Galerkin-based multi
   modal approach combined with a finite difference Houbolt's integration
   scheme. Particular attention is paid to the combined effects of FIV and
   VIV on the dynamic response of the cantilevered pipe in water. To model
   the fluctuating lift and drag forces associated with VIV, the two
   dimensional wake oscillators distributed along the pipe are adopted.
   Numerical simulations in the FIV case of a pipe discharging fluid in the
   air are first validated with experimental results in the literature to
   justify the mathematical models and numerical approaches. Modal
   convergence analysis is also performed. Results in the combined FIV and
   VIV cases are then highlighted in order to show the effects of
   cross-flow and in-line VIV when compared with the pure FIV case. The
   effects of geometric nonlinearities, the coupling/interaction of multi
   modes and the space-time modifications of pipe responses and
   trajectories are highlighted. It is hoped that the numerical
   observations and findings obtained from this study could be verified by
   experimental studies which are presently lacking in the literature.},

Abstract = {Local capillary trapping (LCT) occurs during buoyancy-driven migration
   of bulk phase CO2 within a saline aquifer exhibiting spatially varying
   properties (permeability and capillary entry pressure). When the rising
   CO2 plume encounters a region where capillary entry pressure is locally
   larger than average, CO2 accumulates beneath the region. The benefit of
   LCT, applied specially to CO2 sequestration, is that saturation of
   stored CO2 is larger than the saturation predicted for other trapping
   mechanisms, yet the CO2 is not susceptible to leakage through failed
   seals.
   In this paper, the effects of the injection rate, anisotropy, formation
   dip, aquifer types and residual gas saturation on the LCT
   saturation/mass were systematically investigated including the injection
   period. The domain with heterogeneous capillary pressure was generated
   by using geostatistical permeability realization and Leverett-J function
   to assign an individual drainage curve to each grid block. After
   injection, leakage was simulated that represents localized caprock
   breach induced by geochemical process or by stress/strain variation
   within the reservoir/caprock. The trend of the fraction of CO2 above
   residual that remains trapped after seal rupture was evaluated. Residual
   and dissolution trapping were assessed and compared to LCT over time
   during and after injection.
   Results indicate that local capillary traps in the near-well region can
   be fully filled during injection in the domain. Moreover, they remain
   filled after post-injection buoyancy-driven flow ends. The flow regimes
   are dependent on the injection rate, but LCT mass fraction is almost
   insensitive to the CO2 injection rate (gravity number). This implies
   that local capillary trapping is primarily determined by the geological
   model. Anisotropy does not change the LCT structures although it has
   some impact on the LCT CO2 saturation and plume dynamics. Formation dip
   angle is demonstrated to be the most influential parameters on the
   structures and mass fraction of injected CO2 held in LCT, as it changes
   the effective horizontal permeability correlation length. The key
   finding from this research is that LCT could be as significant as
   residual trapping in immobilizing CO2 during the intermediate period in
   the open aquifer. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

   forms on CO 2 emissions in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow River

   organic N (urea-N: glycin-N = 1: 1), and the level of N addition was 8 g
   N M-2 yr(-1) . The CO2 emissions were measured in the growing season
   from April to October. The results showed that three types of N addition
   stimulated CO2 emissions (P < 0.05). Compared with the control
   treatment, nitrate, ammonium and organic N additions increased CO2
   emissions by 23.24\%, 32.92\% and 49.02\%, respectively. Nitrate and
   ammonium additions produced similar and positive effects on CO2
   emissions, whereas organic N addition had larger and positive effects on
   CO2 emissions than those of inorganic N addition (P < 0.05). This may be
   attributed to the following reasons. First, three types of N addition
   tended to increase soil 0-glucosidase activity and Q(10) value of CO2
   emissions, but only organic N addition significantly enhanced soil
   -glucosidase activity and Q(10) value (P < 0.05). Second, inorganic N
   addition had neutral and negative effects on the decomposition of soil
   organic carbon (SOC), whereas organic N addition increased SOC
   decomposition compared with control treatment (P < 0.05). Together,
   these findings highlight the significance of differentiating the
   influences of N forms on CO2 emissions.},

Abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in
   the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of
   global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks.
   The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of
   wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless
   underlie current approaches to the management of living marine
   resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide
   little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current
   management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of
   fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While
   open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for
   many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have
   access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas,
   the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting
   juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent
   stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal
   stocks often support recruitment.
   An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources
   seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the
   basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a
   broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the
   decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of
   marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to
   harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat
   restoration and conservation of genetic resources.
   The new management framework requires co-management and collective
   decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and
   pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that
   decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and
   precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least
   of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested
   in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to
   management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling
   occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce
   productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks
   imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or
   regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion.
   Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based
   systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established
   healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a
   favourable regime.
   In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after
   regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or
   economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be
   possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a
   stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and
   seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific
   access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of
   vessel operations, even offshore.
   More fundamentally, the basic axiom of `enlightened self interest'
   underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an
   increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

Abstract = {During the four years the Sample Preparation Laboratory (SPL) at the
   National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (NOSAMS) Facilty
   has been in operation we have accumulated much data from which we can
   assess our progress. We evaluate our procedural blanks here and describe
   modifications in our procedures that have improved our analyses of older
   samples. In the SPL, we convert three distinct types of
   samples-seawater, CaCO3 and organic carbon-to CO2 prior to preparing
   graphite for the accelerator and have distinct procedural blanks for
   each procedure. Dissolved inorganic carbon (Sigma CO2) is extracted from
   acidified seawater samples by sparging with a nitrogen carrier gas. We
   routinely analyze `'line blanks'' by processing CO2 from a C-14-dead
   source through the entire stripping procedure. Our hydrolysis blank,
   IAEA C-1, is prepared by acidifying in vacuo with 100\% H3PO4 at 60
   degrees C overnight, identical to our sample preparation. We use a dead
   graphite, NBS-21, or a commercially available carbon powder for our
   organic combustion blank; organic samples are combusted at 850 degrees C
   for 5 h using CuO to provide the oxidant. Analysis of our water
   stripping data suggests that one step in the procedure contributes the
   major portion of the line blank. At present, the contribution from the
   line blank has no effect on our seawater analyses (fraction modern (fm)
   between 0.7 and 1.2). Our hydrolysis blanks can have an fm value as low
   as 0.0006, but are more routinely between 0.0020 and 0.0025. The fm of
   our best organic combustion blanks is higher than those routinely
   achieved in other laboratories and we are currently altering our methods
   to reduce it.},

Abstract = {Coastal and marine environments face various perturbations which include
   a variety of industrial wastes and other toxic compounds accruing from
   shore line industries. Dumping of fly ash slurry and coolant water from
   thermal power plant is known to affect the physico-chemical nature of
   the estuarine environment and thereby cause severe damage to the benthic
   organisms. To combat this, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD)
   developed a suite of health indices, of which, the AMBI (AZTI- Marine
   Biotic Index) index is proved to be efficient in assessing the
   ecological status of marine environment by using the macro benthic
   communities. In this backdrop, the present study was made to ascertain
   the ecological health of Vellar and Ennore estuarine regions using AMBI
   and M-AMBI (Multivariate- AZTI Marine Biotic Index) indices. The AMBI
   values (0.391 to1.13) and M-AMBI (0.92 to 0.96) calculated for the
   Vellar estuary indicated relatively undisturbed nature and high
   ecological quality while the values calculated for Ennore estuary (AMBI:
   2.032 to 4.146 and M-AMBI: 0.27 to 0.76) signaled moderately disturbed
   nature and poor ecological quality of the system. The present study
   proves that there is an immense scope for application of AMBI \& M-AMBI
   in ecological health assessment studies.},

Abstract = {High-frequency seismic records from the Polynesian Seismic Network are
   used to investigate in detail the processes of conversion of acoustic
   (T-wave) energy from and to seismic waves at island shores. On the
   source side, we study the seismic-to-acoustic conversion based on T
   phases from Hawaiian events recorded at Polynesian stations located on
   the coral platter; on the receiver side, we study the
   acoustic-to-seismic conversion based on T phases from marine sources
   recorded across the Polynesian islands. In both instances, our results
   underline the importance of steep slopes (typically 50 degrees) in
   allowing an efficient conversion between P waves in the island structure
   and T waves in the water column. These slopes can be coral reefs or the
   heads of young, presumably unconsolidated, basalt flows. Under this
   geometry, modeling based on raytracing indicates that the seismic record
   of the T phase consists of a P wave at distances from the conversion
   point greater than 9 km; at shorter distances, S waves and surface waves
   are generated. In the absence of a steep slope, only surface waves are
   present. These models can be used to compute precise and predictable
   travel-time station corrections, allowing the use of seismometers
   located inland to exploit the superb detection and location capabilities
   of T waves.},

Abstract = {The crucial dependence on intermodal transport of an open island
   economy, where almost all external trade passes through the seaports, is
   examined. The rapid growth of the Irish economy puts great strains on
   the transport supply chains, particularly in the vicinity of the
   principal seaport in Dublin, where major congestion occurs. This
   adversely affects the competitiveness of small and medium-sized
   exporting companies. Increasing prosperity has resulted in an explosion
   in the numbers of private cars, which puts great strain on an inadequate
   internal infrastructure. A review of Irish ports confirms that
   congestion on the access routes to the Dublin port is the major
   bottleneck in the long transport chains for exporters. Relief from the
   freight traffic transiting the city center must await the completion of
   a dedicated port access tunnel, and interim solutions are needed. In the
   case of food exporters, globalization, the power of the retail
   conglomerates, and peripheral location demand a high level of supply
   chain efficiencies. A survey of export transport chains for selected
   products shows that transit costs can be a significant proportion of the
   total consignment value. At the level of the indigenous companies,
   supply chain management capabilities are shown to be below an acceptable
   standard in two-thirds of the firms surveyed. Possible solutions for
   facilitation of freight access in the vicinity of the port and for
   introduction of more sustainable solutions for goods deliveries in the
   historic city center are explored. Measures that can be taken to improve
   the logistics management capabilities in companies are also described.},

Abstract = {Salmonid fish often experience size-selective mortality when descending
   the river (i.e., seaward migration). However, it is unknown whether
   size-selective mortality is specific to this life history (i.e.,
   migrants), or is shared by an alternative life history (i.e.,
   residents). In this study, we investigated the size-dependent mortality
   patterns of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) migrants and residents
   during the migration period (i.e., April to June) in the Horonai River,
   northern Japan. By conducting an individual-based study using PIT tags
   and antennas, we show that larger migrants more likely survived the
   seaward migration than smaller migrants, but size-dependent survival was
   not detected in river residents during the same period. These results
   suggest that size-selective mortality is specific to the
   river-descending migrants in masu salmon in their seaward migration
   period. We attribute this finding to the presence of piscivorous fishes
   (e.g., brown trout Salmo trutta) which occupy the migration corridor and
   consume masu salmon migrants, whereas such piscivorous fish do not occur
   in the river section farther upstream inhabited by residents.},

Title = {Early Mediterranean pine recruitment in burned and unburned Pinus nigra

Abstract = {Forest sustainability depends on reliable tree regeneration but seedling
   survival is affected by climate change and disturbance. Based on seed
   introduction experiments, we compared recruitment of native pine species
   in central Spain in totally burned, thinned, and dense stands of Spanish
   black pine (Pinus nigra Am. ssp salzmannii). Seed sources included P.
   nigra from three elevations bracketing its range, as well as the
   fire-adapted species maritime pine (P. pinaster) and the mesic-adapted
   species Scots pine (P. sylvestris). In addition, seed predation effect
   was also tested. Small and large herbivores as well as rodents were
   excluded using cages. All seeds had high viability in laboratory
   germination tests and all displayed high emergence in field trials.
   However, unprotected seedlings and those that emerged in thinned or
   dense stands did not survive the first growing season. Surviving
   seedlings were only found in totally burned stands. Protected P. nigra
   seedlings had the highest survival, reaching 23\%. Protected seedlings
   of P. pinaster and P. sylvestris averaged 11.5\% and 10.9\%,
   respectively. Unprotected seedlings of any species had less than 2\%
   survival. The unexpected result of higher mortality under a sheltering
   canopy compared with open post-wildfire conditions may be due to wetter
   spring during the experiment. Overall, the results indicate that native
   species currently still regenerate best within the environment of their
   present range, even though future climate or fire disturbance may lead
   to distributional shifts. Protection is necessary for successful pine
   regeneration in the study region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Bioassay incubation experiments conducted with nutrients and local
   atmospheric aerosol amendments indicate that phosphorus (P) availability
   limited phytoplankton growth in the low-nutrient low-chlorophyll (LNLC)
   ocean off Barbados. Atmospheric deposition provides a relatively large
   influx of new nutrients and trace metals to the surface ocean in this
   region in comparison to other nutrient sources. However, the impact on
   native phytoplankton is muted due to the high ratio of nitrogen (N) to P
   (NO3:SRP>40) and the low P solubility of these aerosols. Atmospheric
   deposition induces P limitation in this LNLC region by adding more N and
   iron (Fe) relative to P. This favors the growth of Prochlorococcus, a
   genus characterized by low P requirements and highly efficient P
   acquisition mechanisms. A global three-dimensional marine ecosystem
   model that includes species-specific phytoplankton elemental
   quotas/stoichiometry and the atmospheric deposition of N, P, and Fe
   supports this conclusion. Future increases in aerosol N loading may
   therefore influence phytoplankton community structure in other LNLC
   areas, thereby affecting the biological pump and associated carbon
   sequestration.},

Abstract = {The organic carbon consumed by aquatic bacteria (BCC) is partitioned
   between bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR), but the factors
   that determine BCC and its partition into BP and BR are not well
   understood. We explored the coupling between BR, BR and BCC, and their
   links to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient availability in
   natural and restored tidal marshes and in the adjoining waters of
   Delaware Bay estuary. Labile DOC (LDOC) ranged from 3\% to 22\% of the
   DOC pool, and explained more of the variance in both BR and BCC than did
   bulk DOC. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highly variable
   (0.090.58), and natural Spartina alterniflora marshes had consistently
   higher BGE than both restoration marshes and tidal floodwaters. BGE was
   negatively related to the ratio of LDOC to total dissolved phosphorous,
   which was highest in natural marshes. The enhancement of BP observed in
   the marshes relative to the estuarine floodwaters had different origins:
   In natural marshes it was mostly due to increases in BGE, whereas in
   restored marshes it followed increased BCC. These results highlight the
   importance of P in regulating microbial metabolism in coastal areas, and
   the need to understand the pathways that lead to BP in these systems.},

Title = {Atmospheric Warming-Associated Phenological Earliness Does Not Increase
   the Length of Growing Season in Himalayan Trees},
Journal = {FOREST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},
Pages = {694-700},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present phenological data for two time periods (1985-1987 and
   2014-2016) on major tree species (Shorea robusta, Pinus roxburghii,
   Myrica esculenta, Quercus leucotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum,
   Quercus floribunda, and Machilus duthiei) occurring along an altitudinal
   gradient of 300-2,200 m asl of Himalayan forests (a data-deficient
   region identified by the IPCC, 2007), and show that bud break and
   leafing in trees has advanced at 0.20 days/year, which is associated
   with a significant (P < 0.001) increase in atmospheric temperature
   (0.038 degrees C/year) over the years in the study area. Also, the leaf
   drop period has advanced correspondingly (0.40 days/year); hence, the
   length of season (LOS) did not increase in these trees. This finding is
   contrary to the report of increase in LOS due to climatic warming from
   temperate latitudes of the world and satellitebased studies in Himalayan
   region. Arguably, phenomena such as bud break and leafing may not be
   captured by remote sensing, which is critical for determining the impact
   of climate change on the forest vegetation of the eco-sensitive
   Himalayan region. We suggest that this phenological earliness may alter
   forest structure and functioning and associated ecosystem services of
   these forests in the long run.
   Study Implications: This study suggests that bud break and leafing in
   trees has advanced, an advancement that is associated with the
   significant increase in atmospheric temperature over the years in the
   study area. However, the leaf drop period has advanced correspondingly;
   hence, the length of season of trees in the study area did not increase.
   Nonetheless, the earliness in the leafing and leaf drop have potential
   implications on forest ecosystem structure and functioning, such as
   photosynthesis, carbon assimilation, increased asynchrony in
   plant-pollinators and animal interactions, reproduction success, and
   herbivory that require further detailed investigation. Warming may also
   advance seed maturation and desiccation of seeds that may disrupt the
   synchrony between monsoon and tree seed germination, forest
   regeneration, and ensuing ecosystem services. Generalizations on a
   regional scale on the impact of climate change on annual patterns of
   growth of forests that are based on remote-sensing studies could mask
   the impact of the premonsoon period, when bud break and leafing take
   place. These impacts may not be captured by remote sensing; impacts
   which, in this study, we have found to be critical.},

Title = {Current-interchange tearing modes: Conversion of interchange-type modes
   to tearing modes},
Journal = {PHYSICS OF PLASMAS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {It is shown that, in addition to usual neoclassical tearing modes,
   another type of nonclassical tearing mode exists in tokamaks: viz.,
   current-interchange tearing modes (CITMs). CITMs are directly driven by
   unstable pressure-driven electromagnetic or electrostatic modes of the
   interchange type (e.g., interchange/ballooning modes, drift waves, etc.)
   due to the current gradient in tokamaks. Interchange-type modes exchange
   not only thermal and magnetic energies between flux tubes but also
   current. In a plasma with a current (or resistivity) gradient, such an
   interchange can create a current sheet at a mode resonance surface and
   result in the excitation of CITMs. Note that the interchange mode (i.e.,
   Rayleigh-Taylor instability) is fundamental to tokamak physics. This new
   theory has an effect on both resistive magnetohydrodynamic stability and
   transport theories. Instabilities of the interchange type could be
   directly converted into CITMs, alternative to forming turbulent eddies
   through nonlinear coupling as in conventional transport theories. In
   particular, our CITM theory fills in the component in the transport
   theory of Rechester and Rosenbluth {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 40, 38 (1978)]
   for the origin of magnetic island structure in axisymmetric tokamaks.

Abstract = {The transport sector imposes enormous challenges for energy consumption
   and CO2 emission reduction. Using data from 30 provinces in China, this
   paper adopted the Tapio decoupling index to examine the relationship
   between the development of the transport sector and its CO2 emissions
   from provincial perspective. Additionally, we employed the logarithmic
   mean divisia index method to explore the effect of several factors on
   the state of decoupling. The results showed that the under-developed
   provinces were more likely to present a weak decoupling state than the
   developed and coastal provinces. Income level was the major influential
   factor limiting the development of decoupling in the transport sector.
   The population scale had a very small negative role in the development
   of decoupling. Moreover, the effects of CO2 emissions efficiency,
   transport intensity and industry structure varied across provinces. By
   offering a provincial perspective on decoupling states and its driving
   factors, this study can provide a reference for governments in proposing
   carbon-reduction policies and promoting low carbon development of the
   transport sector.},

Title = {Shoreline Change Prediction for Integrated Coastal Erosion Management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Number = {114},
Pages = {121-125},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The mechanism of sediment transport occurring in littoral zone shows
   complex patterns. Establishing an accurate longshore sediment budget
   prediction is difficult. Littoral drift flowing into and out of the
   coast shows sensitive responses to natural and anthropogenic changes in
   the surrounding area. In particular, at the coast where rivers are
   located, the littoral drift is significantly affected by the inflow of
   sediment from the upstream. However, the sediment management at the
   coast has been conducted by respective measures established in different
   areas, such as mountains in the upstream region, dams, rivers, and
   coasts, and thus, measures are established without an appropriate
   feedback between these different areas. Therefore, determining the exact
   causes of erosion occurring in the coastal zone is challenging. In
   addition, for accurate prediction of sediment budget in coastal areas,
   it is necessary to construct a model with mixed particle size
   distribution that can consider the properties of sediment inflow from
   the river and the sediment constituting the sea area. Thus, for
   integrated coastal erosion management, based on the determination of
   sediment transport mechanism flowing into the coastal zone, accurate
   estimation of sediment transport rate and sediment budget prediction
   according to the shoreline changes affected by waves play an important
   role. In this study, a series of mechanism of sediment transport flowing
   into the sea area through the river was analyzed, and the sediment
   budget according to the shoreline change occurring in the sea area was
   estimated. The sediment load flowing into the sea area and the
   representative wave acting on the sea area were calculated to construct
   the IN-MPS (INje-Mixture Particle Shoreline) model considering the
   sediment particle size distribution in mixed condition. The accuracy of
   the model was evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the model
   with those of long-term observations by calculating the exact sediment
   budget in the coastal zone, and when the inflow from the river and the
   mixed particle size distribution of sediment were considered, the
   accuracy in the shoreline change prediction was improved.},

Title = {Diffuse CO2 degassing and volcanic activity at Cape Verde islands, West
   Africa},
Journal = {EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {67},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Diffuse CO2 emission surveys were carried out at Sao Vicente, Brava, and
   Fogo islands, Cape Verde, archipelago to investigate the relationship
   between diffuse CO2 degassing and volcanic activity. Total amounts of
   diffuse CO2 discharged through the surface environment of the islands of
   Sao Vicente, Brava, and Fogo were estimated in 226, 50, and 828 t d(-1),
   respectively. The highest CO2 efflux values of the three volcanic
   islands systems were observed at the summit crater of Pico do Fogo (up
   to 15.7 kg m(-2) d(-1)). Statistical graphical analysis of the data
   suggests two geochemical populations for the diffuse CO2 emission
   surveys. The geometric mean of the peak population, expressed as a
   multiple of the geometric mean of the background population, seems to be
   the best diffuse CO2 emission geochemical parameter to correlate with
   the volcanic activity (age of the volcanism) for these three island
   volcanic systems at Cape Verde. This observation is also supported by
   helium isotopic signature observed in the Cape Verde's fluids,
   fumaroles, and ground waters. This study provides useful information
   about the relationship between diffuse CO2 degassing and volcanic
   activity at Cape Verde enhancing the use of diffuse CO2 emission as a
   good geochemical tool, for volcanic monitoring at Cape Verde as well as
   other similar volcanic systems.},

Abstract = {The S<<\^{}>>4 reactor has a sectored, Mo-14\%Re solid core for
   avoidance of single point failures in reactor cooling and Closed Brayton
   Cycle (CBC) energy conversion. The reactor is loaded with UN fuel,
   cooled with a He-Xe gas mixture at similar to 1200 K and operates at
   steady thermal power of 550 kW. Following a launch abort accident, the
   axial and radial BeO reflectors easily disassemble upon impact so that
   the bare reactor is subcriticial when submerged in wet sand or seawater
   and the core voids are filled with seawater. Spectral Shift Absorber
   (SSA) additives have been shown to increase the UN fuel enrichment and
   significantly reduce the total mass of the reactor. This paper
   investigates the effects of SSA additions on the temperature and burnup
   reactivity coefficients and the operational lifetime of the S<<\^{}>>4
   reactor. SSAs slightly decrease the temperature reactivity feedback
   coefficient, but significantly increase the operating lifetime by
   decreasing the bumup reactivity coefficient. With no SSAs, fuel
   enrichment is only 58.5 wt\% and the estimated operating lifetime is the
   shortest (7.6 years) with the highest temperature and bumup reactivity
   feedback coefficients (-0.2709 cent/K and -1.3470 \$/atom\%). With
   europium-151 and gadolinium-155 additions, the enrichment (91.5 and 94
   wt\%) and operating lifetime (9.9 and 9.8 years) of the S<<\^{}>>4
   reactor are the highest while the temperature and bumup reactivity
   coefficients (-0.2382 and -0.2447 cent/K; -0.9073 and 0.8502 \$/atom\%)
   are the lowest.},

Abstract = {Fisheries have historically focused on single-species management, but
   there is a global movement to incorporate ecosystem-based processes.
   Marine protected areas (MPAs) offer an important management tool for
   enhancing ecosystem structure and function. This study investigated
   whether a non-lethal indicator of trophic position (TP) could be used to
   evaluate fishery health in southern California MPAs. We hypothesized
   that a common predator, kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), would occupy
   a higher TP and smaller niche space inside MPAs than at fished reference
   sites, and that these patterns would be supported by trends in abundance
   and gut contents. Stable isotope analysis of nitrogen (delta N-15) and
   carbon (delta C-13) were used to estimate the TP and niche space of kelp
   bass (N = 125) collected inside and outside of four MPAs during summer
   2016-2017. Although all MPA sites supported a significantly higher
   biomass of kelp bass than reference sites, there was no consistent
   pattern in TP and niche space inside versus outside of MPAs. Gut
   contents showed that exploitation of ephemeral pelagic foods may reduce
   localized effects of MPAs on prey availability for this species. Our
   findings suggest that MPAs will not have consistent impacts on food web
   dynamics for higher level generalist predators and that ecosystem-level
   responses to protection may vary across locations within a bioregion.
   These results emphasize the importance of accounting for site-specific
   differences in food web structure before applying ecosystem-based
   metrics to fishery management.},

Title = {Marine bacterioplankton biomass, activity and community structure in the

Abstract = {We studied marine bacterioplankton in the Scotia Sea in June 2008 and in
   the northwest Weddell Sea in March to mid April 2009 in waters proximal
   to three free-drifting icebergs (SS-1, A-43k, and C-18a), in a region
   with a high density of smaller icebergs (iceberg alley), and at stations
   that were upstream of the iceberg trajectories designated as far-field
   reference sites that were between 16-75 km away. Hydrographic parameters
   were used to define water masses in which comparisons between
   bacterioplankton-associated characteristics (abundance, leucine
   incorporation into protein, aminopeptidase activities and community
   structure) within and between water masses could be made. Early winter
   Scotia Sea bacterioplankton had low levels of cells and low
   heterotrophic production rates in the upper 50 m. Influences of the
   icebergs on bacterioplankton at this time of year were minimal, if not
   deleterious, as we found lower levels of heterotrophic production near
   A-43k in comparison to stations > 16 km away. Additionally, the results
   point to small but significant differences in cell abundance,
   heterotrophic production, and community structure between the two
   icebergs studied. These icebergs differed greatly in size and the
   findings suggest that the larger iceberg had a greater effect. In the NW
   Weddell Sea in March-mid April bacterioplankton were twice as abundant
   and had heterotrophic productions rates that were 8-fold higher than
   what we determined in the Scotia Sea, though levels were still quite
   low, which is typical for autumn. We did not detect direct
   iceberg-related influences on the bacterioplankton characteristics
   studied here. Clues to understanding bacterioplankton responses may lie
   in the details of community structure, as there were some significant
   differences in community structure in the winter water and underlying
   upper circumpolar deep-water masses between stations occupied close to
   C-18a and at stations 18 km away (i.e. Polaribacter and
   Pelagibacter-related 16S rRNA gene fragments were at low levels at the
   18 km stations), though higher resolution, high throughput profiling
   tools will be needed to pinpoint specific organisms and ecological
   types. Likewise, a better understanding of local to regional scale
   structure of bacterioplankton communities is necessary. The relationship
   between bacterioplankton abundance and heterotrophic production
   suggested bottom up processes were controlling bacterioplankton during
   March - mid-April in the NW Weddell Sea, and that variation in
   temperature may play a role in substrate utilization. Trophic linkages
   seen between phytoplankton and zooplankton were mirrored by tight
   coupling between primary production and heterotrophic production in the
   waters immediately surrounding C-18a and in iceberg alley (but not at
   stations 18 and 75 km away), suggesting that indirect effects on
   bacterioplankton may also be important. Overall, the results show that
   bacterioplankton, dominated by Rhodobacteracae Pelagibacter, and
   uncultivated Gammaproteobacteria groups were minimally influenced by
   icebergs in the regions and seasons studied here - at least directly -
   though further work addressing different scales, sizes of icebergs, and
   seasons is needed to better understand bacterioplankton-associated

Abstract = {Wave-generated flows, associated hydrodynamic forces, and disturbances
   created by them play critical roles in determining the structure and
   health of near-shore coastal ecosystems. Oscillatory motions produced by
   waves increase delivery of nutrients and food to benthic organisms, and
   can enhance vertical mixing to facilitate delivery of larvae and spores
   to the seafloor. At the same time, wave disturbances can remove
   individuals and biomass with far-reaching effects on critical coastal
   ecosystems and the biodiversity within them. Commercial instruments
   designed to measure wave characteristics and the effects of wave energy
   can be expensive to purchase and deploy, limiting their use in large
   quantities or in areas where they may be lost. We have developed an
   inexpensive open-source pressure transducer data logger based on an
   Arduino microcontroller that can be used to characterize wave conditions
   for deployments lasting multiple months. Our design criteria centered
   around simplicity, longevity, low cost, and ease of use for researchers.
   Housed in ubiquitous polyvinylchloride (PVC) plumbing and constructed
   primarily with readily available materials, the Open Wave Height Logger
   (OWHL) can be fabricated in a college setting with basic shop tools. The
   OWHL performs comparably to commercial pressure-based wave height data
   loggers during tests in the field, creating the opportunity to expand
   the use of these sensors for applications where sufficient spatial
   replication or risk of instrument loss would otherwise be cost
   prohibitive.},

Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {The operation of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants is
   systematically optimized with the objective to reduce the electricity
   charges, which constitute the largest portion of the operation costs.
   Variable operating conditions and a time-of-use electricity tariff rate
   schedule are considered. A well-established model is extended to model a
   reverse osmosis (RO) system equipped with highly efficient pressure
   exchangers (PXs) and variable frequency drives (VFDs). All major
   performance factors are considered, including membrane's permeability,
   concentration polarization, temperature effects, membrane fouling, and
   efficiency dependency of the VFD on the loading conditions. The proposed
   formulation minimizes the electricity cost per day, given a desired
   daily production rate. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer
   nonlinear program (MINLP), allowing for periods without operation. The
   time domain (24 h) is discretized into 0.5 h increments, and a pseudo
   steady-state assumption is used. The optimal operation plan resulting in
   maximum electricity cost-savings is established with standard global
   optimization tools. The results show significant electricity and
   production cost-saving potentials. More savings in electricity can be
   achieved by oversizing the plant, thus allowing shutting-off at periods
   of high electricity cost. The cost-saving potentials are particularly
   promising in electricity markets in which the electricity rate schedule
   is widely distributed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Infiltration systems are increasingly used in urban areas for
   groundwater recharge. The reduction of sediment permeability by physical
   and/or biological processes is a major problem in management of
   infiltration systems often requiring expensive engineering operations
   for hydraulic performance maintenance. To reduce these costs and for the
   sake of sustainable development, we proposed to evaluate the ability of
   ecological engineering approaches to reduce the biological clogging of
   infiltration basins. A 36-day field-scale experiment using enclosures
   was performed to test the influences of abiotic (light reduction by
   shading) and biotic (introduction of the macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis
   (L.) or the gastropod Viviparus viviparus (Linnaeus, 1758)) treatments
   to limit benthic biofilm biomass and to maintain or even increase
   hydraulic performances. We coupled biological characterization of
   sediment (algal biomass, bacterial abundance, total organic carbon,
   total nitrogen, microbial enzymatic activity, photosynthetic activity,
   and photosystem II efficiency) with hydraulic conductivity measurements
   to assess the effects of treatments on sediment permeability. The grazer
   Viviparus viviparus significantly reduced benthic bioffim biomass and
   enhanced hydraulic conductivity. The other treatments did not produce
   significant changes in hydraulic conductivity although Vallisneria
   spiralis affected photosynthetic activity of biofilm. Finally, our
   results obtained with Viviparus viviparus are promising for the
   development of ecological engineering solutions to prevent biological
   fouling in infiltration systems.},

Abstract = {Porous CNT sponge (CNTS) and aligned CNT array (CNTA) were used as light
   absorbers to generate water vapor by harvesting solar energy. To improve
   the wettability of water on superhydrophobic CNTs and enhance water
   transport in porous CNT materials, CNTs were decorated with a
   hydrophilic silk fibroin (SF) protein coating. Water rapidly infiltrates
   the porous SF-modified CNT materials. Importantly, strong water-SF
   interactions via the hydrogen bonding between SF protein molecules and
   CNT sidewalls resulted in a reduction in the vaporization enthalpy of
   water in the SF-modified CNT materials, which facilitated vapor
   generation. Additionally, the SF-modified CNT light absorbers exhibit
   excellent vapor generation performance over a wide pH range of 2 to 12
   and good stability. The SF-modified CNT materials thus have the
   advantage of being potentially applicable to the purification of
   wastewater and desalination of brackish water with high or low pH
   values. SF-CNTA light absorbers with vertically aligned CNTs, which are
   of great benefit in water transport and vapor escape, achieved a water
   evaporation rate of 3.2 kg m(-2) h(-1) under one sun irradiation with an
   energy transfer efficiency of 94\%. After a desalination treatment, the
   concentrations of primary ions in seawater are greatly decreased and
   meet the requirements for drinking water.},

Abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen isotopes in sediments collected from the Manwan and
   Dachaoshan Reservoirs, which were created by cascade dams along the
   Lancang-Mekong River, were measured to preliminarily analyse their
   organic matter sources.
   Sediment samples were collected from the Manwan and Dachaoshan
   Reservoirs twice during both the rainy and dry seasons by using a
   gravitational bottom sampler. One set of samples was collected from the
   river centres of each reservoir, and the other set was collected from
   the river edges, 5 m from each bank. Sediments were divided by wet
   sieving into three classes of water-stable aggregates based on sizes,
   including macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt and clay. At the
   same time, terrestrial plants (Phragmites) and surface soil samples (0-5
   cm) were collected from the river bank. The total organic carbon (TOC),
   total nitrogen (TN), stable carbon isotope (delta C-13), and stable
   nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) were measured for sediments, soils, and
   plants to preliminarily analyse the sources of organic matter in the
   sediments.
   Because of the presence of dams, a greater amount of the fine fraction
   was deposited in the reservoirs, which adsorbed and preserved more
   organic matter. Although terrestrial sources of organic matter dominate
   in riverine systems, aquatic sources have been shown to act as new
   organic matter sources in the Manwan Reservoir. Input from C-3 plants
   was the major new organic matter source in the Dachaoshan Reservoir,
   which also had strong inputs from aquatic sources. In the dry season,
   C-3 plant input was significantly reduced and less fine fraction was
   found in the sediments. The high nitrogen isotope values of the
   sediments collected during the dry season indicated that strong organic
   matter decomposition decreased the storage of organic matter.
   The cascade dams permanently changed the aquatic environment and
   modified regional carbon flows resulting in the diversification of
   organic matter sources. The major source of sedimentary organic matter
   was terrestrial, including from plants, soils, and particle organic
   matter, with the new organic matter absorbed by macroaggregates
   primarily stemming from aquatic organisms and C-3 plants. Samples
   collected during the dry season exhibited strong decomposition, which
   further weakened the preservation of organic carbon in sediments.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to compare and contrast C dynamics
   within plots occupied by Phragmites australis, Typha spp., and
   Sagittaria latifiolia in a Lake Erie coastal wetland (Ohio, USA). The
   effect of each species on above- and belowground biomass, soil C pools,
   soil labile C, litter decomposition rates, and microbial catabolic
   response profiles were analyzed. Phragmites australis and Typha spp.
   produced significantly more aboveground biomass (1,522 +/- 464 and 1,177
   +/- 164 g DM m(-2), respectively) than S. latifolia (500 +/- 80 g DM
   m(-2)), although no difference was observed in terms of belowground
   biomass. After 208 days in the field, litter of S. latifolia had lost
   72\% of its initial mass while only 47\% of the litter of Typha spp. and
   P. australis had decomposed. This coupled process of high primary
   production and slow litter decomposition within P. australis and Typha
   spp. communities did not translate into greater accumulation of C in the
   soil. In fact, we observed lower rates of C mineralization and greater
   biomass of methanogens in the S. latifolia plots. Despite similar water
   level, soil conditions in the S. latifolia community was more saturated,
   which might have limited availability of C for microbial consumption in
   these plots. Microbial catabolic responses to 24 substrates demonstrated
   distinct differences in the respiration responses of the soil microbial
   communities of the three macrophyte species. The microbial community
   found in the rhizosphere of P. australis was particularly responsive to
   phenolic acids. Few differences in C fluxes and pools were observed
   between plots occupied by P. australis and Typha spp., but the
   replacement of S. latifolia by one of the two other species could have a
   significant effect on the C cycle in the Great Lakes coastal wetlands.},

Title = {Elevated carbon dioxide and reduced salinity enhance mangrove seedling
   establishment in an artificial saltmarsh community},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},

Volume = {192},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The global phenomenon of mangrove encroachment into saltmarshes has been
   observed across five continents. It has been proposed that this
   encroachment is driven in part by rising atmospheric CO2 concentration
   and reduced salinity in saltmarshes resulting from rising sea levels
   enhancing the establishment success of mangrove seedlings. However, this
   theory is yet to be empirically tested at the community-level. In this
   study, we examined the effect of CO2 and salinity on seedling growth of
   two mangrove species, Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicennia marina, grown
   individually and in a model saltmarsh community in a glasshouse
   experiment. We found that the shoot (210\%) and root (91\%) biomass of
   the saltmarsh species was significantly greater under elevated CO2. As a
   result, both mangrove species experienced a stronger competitive effect
   from the saltmarsh species under elevated CO2. Nevertheless, A. marina
   seedlings produced on average 48\% more biomass under elevated CO2 when
   grown in competition with the saltmarsh species. The seedlings tended to
   allocate this additional biomass to growing taller suggesting they were
   light limited. In contrast, A. corniculatum growth did not significantly
   differ between CO2 treatments. However, it had on average 36\% greater
   growth under seawater salinity compared to hypersaline conditions.
   Avicennia marina seedlings were not affected by salinity. From these
   results, we suggest that although CO2 and salinity are not universal
   drivers determining saltmarsh-mangrove boundaries, it is likely that
   rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced salinity associated
   with sea level rise will enhance the establishment success of mangrove
   seedlings in saltmarshes, which may facilitate mangrove encroachment in
   the future.},

Title = {A Novel Islanding Detection Technique for a Resilient Photovoltaic-Based
   Distributed Power Generation System Using a Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform
   and an Artificial Neural Network},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Finding an appropriate technique to detect an islanding issue is one of
   the major challenges associated with the design of a resilient
   grid-linked photovoltaic-based distributed power generation (PV-DPG)
   system. In general, the technique used for islanding detection must be
   able to sense the disruptions from the electric grid and quickly
   disconnect PV-DPG from the grid. The quick disconnection of PV-DPG
   mostly avoids power quality problems, damage to power assets, voltage
   stability issues, and frequency instability. In this paper, a new
   islanding detection technique that is based on tunable Q-factor wavelet
   transform (TQWT) and an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for
   PV-DPG. The proposed approach consists of two steps: in the first step,
   the vital detection parameters are computed by performing simulations
   considering all possible switching transients, islanding events, and
   faults from the grid side. Then, the decomposition of obtained signals
   is done using TQWT on different levels. Using the obtained coefficients,
   at each level, features such as range, minimum, mean, standard
   deviation, maximum, energy, and log energy entropy are computed. The
   optimal feature set was selected as the input for the second step. The
   classification of the non-islanding and islanding states for PV-DPG is
   made using the ANN classifier in the second step, which achieved an
   accuracy of 98\%. The results representing the efficiency of the
   proposed approach in noisy and non-noisy environments are also
   explained. Overall, it is understood that the proposed islanding
   detection technique would provide suitable insights to detect an
   islanding issue.},

Abstract = {During the spring and summer, the climatological northerly flow along
   the U.S. west coast is occasionally interrupted by transitions to
   southerly how that have a limited offshore scale and appear to be
   manifestations of marine-layer flow that is rotationally trapped by the
   coastal mountains. Existing climatological and observational studies
   suggest that a synoptic-scale offshore flow initiates these coastally
   trapped disturbances (CTDs). Using idealized simulations produced with a
   3D nonhydrostatic model, the authors find that an imposed offshore how
   will produce CTDs in idealized coastal environments. The imposed flow
   first weakens the prevailing northerly flow in the marine layer and
   lowers the pressure at the coast. The marine-layer flow around this low
   pressure evolves toward geostrophic balance, but is retarded as it
   encounters the coastal mountains to the south of the low and
   subsequently deepens the marine layer in this region. The elevated
   marine layer then begins progressing northward as a Kelvin wave and
   later may steepen into a bore or gravity current, this progression being
   the CTD. Many observed features accompanying CTDs are found in the
   numerical simulations, including the formation of a mesoscale pressure
   trough offshore and deep southerlies in the CTD at the coast. Stability
   in the atmosphere above the marine layer can give rise to
   topographically trapped Rossby waves and stronger CTD winds. In these
   stable conditions, propagation of wave energy away from the disturbance
   does not preclude strong, quasi-steady, propagating CTDs.},

Abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that spatial interactions between sedentary
   organisms can structure communities and promote landscape complexity in
   many ecosystems. Here we tested the hypothesis that reef-forming mussels
   (Mytilus edulis L.), a dominant intertidal ecosystem engineer in the
   Wadden Sea, promote abundances of the burrowing bivalve Cerastoderma
   edule L. (cockle) in neighboring habitats at relatively long distances
   coastward from mussel beds. Field surveys within and around three mussel
   beds showed a peak in cockle densities at 50-100 m toward the coast from
   the mussel bed, while cockle abundances elsewhere in the study area were
   very low. Field transplantation of cockles showed higher survival of
   young cockles (2-3 years old) and increased spat fall coastward of the
   mussel bed compared to within the bed and to areas without mussels,
   whereas growth decreased within and coastward of the mussel bed. Our
   measurements suggest that the observed spatial patterns in cockle
   numbers resulted from (1) inhibition effects by the mussels close to the
   beds due to preemptive algal depletion and deteriorated sediment
   conditions and (2) facilitation effects by the mussels farther away from
   the beds due to reduction of wave energy. Our results imply that these
   spatial, scale-dependent interactions between reef-forming ecosystem
   engineers and surrounding communities of sedentary benthic organisms can
   be an important determinant of the large-scale community structure in
   intertidal ecosystems. Understanding this interplay between neighboring
   communities of sedentary species is therefore essential for effective
   conservation and restoration of soft-bottom intertidal communities.},

Title = {Modeling wave attenuation by submerged flexible vegetation with XBeach
   phase-averaged model},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {257},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Understanding and modeling wave attenuation by flexible vegetation have
   emerged as essential issues in coastal and ocean engineering. Given that
   the existing XBeach phase-averaged wave model can only simulate wave
   attenuation by rigid vegetation, and previous studies of wave energy
   dissipation by vegetation are mainly restricted to linear wave theory.
   This study aims to extend the XBeach phase-averaged wave model to
   simulate wave attenuation by both homogeneous and heterogeneous
   submerged flexible vegetation, and determine wave attenuation simulation
   deviation based on different wave theories. Hence, the existing flexible
   vegetation dynamic model is incorporated into the XBeach phase-averaged
   wave model. The reliability of the coupled model in simulating wave
   attenuation by both homogeneous and heterogeneous submerged flexible
   vegetation is revealed. Simulation results also demonstrate that the
   computed wave attenuation rate based on Stokes second-order wave theory
   is larger than that based on linear wave theory within the parameters
   used in this investigation. Meanwhile, wave attenuation simulation
   deviation between these two wave theories enlarges as the Ursell number
   increases within the parameters used in this investigation. This study
   can broaden the application of the XBeach model and lay the technical
   foundation for future engineering practice of nature-based coastal
   defence.},

   events due to a reduced susceptibility to bleaching. We investigated the
   relationship between bleaching susceptibility and expression of five
   metabolically related genes of Symbiodinium spp. from the coral Porites
   astreoides originating from an inshore and offshore reef in the Florida
   Keys. The acclimatization potential of Symbiodinium spp. to changing
   temperature regimes was also measured via a two-year reciprocal
   transplant between the sites. Offshore coral fragments displayed
   significantly higher expression in Symbiodinium spp. genes PCNA, SCP2,
   G3PDH, PCP and psaE than their inshore counterparts (p<0.05), a pattern
   consistent with increased bleaching susceptibility in offshore corals.
   Additionally, gene expression patterns in Symbiodinium spp. from site of
   origin were conserved throughout the two-year reciprocal transplant,
   indicating acclimatization did not occur within this multi-season time
   frame. Further, laboratory experiments were used to investigate the
   influence of acute high temperature (32 degrees C for eight hours) and
   disease (lipopolysaccharide of Serratia marcescens) on the five
   metabolically related symbiont genes from the same offshore and inshore
   P. astreoides fragments. Gene expression did not differ between reef
   fragments, or as a consequence of acute exposure to heat or heat and
   disease, contrasting to results found in the field. Gene expression
   reported here indicates functional variation in populations of
   Symbiodinium spp. associated with P. astreoides in the Florida Keys, and
   is likely a result of localized adaptation. However, gene expression
   patterns observed in the lab imply that functional variation in
   zooxanthellae observed under conditions of chronic moderate stress is
   lost under the acute extreme conditions studied here.},

Title = {How supportive are existing national legal regimes for multi-use marine
   spatial planning?-The South African case},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {72-79},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Over the past six years international interest in multi-use marine
   spatial planning (MSP), as a practical process to launch integrated
   coastal management (ICM), exploded. This paper explores the extent to
   which existing national legal frameworks can support this process,
   focusing on the coastal marine environment. First the characteristics of
   an appropriate legal regime for multi-use MSP are explored by
   interrogating secondary data sourced from literature reviews and case
   studies. Key paradigms are distilled as a means of dissecting this
   complex process into a suite of characteristic determinants that
   disclose the underpinning environmental management approaches or
   principles. These criteria are then used to assess the compatibility of
   national legal regimes for multi-use MSP in this instance the South
   African legal framework. Although multi-use MSP has not been explicitly
   adopted as a process within South Africa's broader ICM implementation,
   existing legislation does reveal support. The department responsible for
   the environment is viewed as the most appropriate agency to house the
   statutory mechanism for multi-use MSP at national and provincial levels,
   but delegating local multi-use MSP processes to local government
   agencies. The political will to deploy and dedicate duties and resources
   to effective implementation of multi-use MSP, however, remains critical.
   Finally, the approach adopted here is proposed as a means to assess the
   compatibility of other national legal regimes for multi-use MSP,
   although the suite of characteristic determinants may need to be
   reviewed from time to time, as new learning emerges from practice. (C)

Title = {Mature and developing kelp bed community composition in a glacial
   estuary},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {501},
Pages = {26-35},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The assembly and maintenance of biological communities is influenced by
   environmental factors, which are predicted to shift with climate change.
   Glaciers are melting at increasing rates, delivering sediment and fresh
   water to coastal habitats. We hypothesized that environmental factors
   related to glacial discharge would be correlated to the initial
   recruitment and colonization of sessile communities in kelp beds, and to
   the abundance of mobile epibenthic invertebrates and adult kelp. To test
   these hypotheses, cleared rocks were placed at six sites at 10-m depth
   across a gradient of glacial-influence in Kachemak Bay, Alaska and the
   percent cover of the initial recruitment and the subsequent progression
   of the sessile community was monitored over 18 months. Small mobile
   invertebrates (such as limpets and chitons) were also monitored on these
   rocks for 18 months. Lastly, larger invertebrates (such as sea stars)
   and adult kelp were surveyed over the same time period along transects
   in the immediate vicinity of the cleared rocks. Environmental factors
   (sedimentation rates, salinity, temperature, irradiance, and nutrient
   concentration) were concurrently monitored at each site. Recruitment and
   subsequent colonization varied along the glacial gradient. At sites with
   higher sedimentation rates, recruitment and the subsequent developing
   community was dominated by barnacles with little or no kelp recruits and
   other macroalgae and high temporal variation in availability of bare
   space. At more oceanic sites, these communities were characterized by a
   slow increase in cover of encrusting and upright macroalgae, also with
   high variability among sites. Mobile invertebrates and adult kelp were
   more abundant at oceanic sites than the glacial sites. Using
   distance-based linear models, inorganic sedimentation rate was
   correlated to patterns of kelp bed recruitment and colonization and to
   the abundance of mobile invertebrates and adult kelp; in the surrounding
   area. Changes in inorganic sedimentation with climate change may alter
   how kelp beds are distributed and structured in glacial estuaries.},

Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {248-255},
Abstract = {Knowledge on Mediterranean monk seal distribution throughout the
   central-eastern Mediterranean Moroccan coasts is not abundant and has
   not been consistently assessed throughout time. Results of a
   questionnaire survey directed at 205 artisanal fishers operating out of
   18 landing sites of central-eastern Morocco, and extending over 210 km
   of coast, are hereby reported. The information on reported monk seal
   sightings amounts to 141 observations reported for the period 1971 to
   2005, with the highest number of reported sightings for the year 2004
   amounting to 32. More than 58\% of the study area is characterized by
   rocky cliffs of alternating height, and monk seal sighting frequency was
   mostly reported for four subareas. However, only two of these, Cap Trois
   Fourches and Ras Kebdana, seem to be utilised in recent times and seem
   to be areas where immediate conservation actions should be enacted in
   order to safeguard remaining seal nuclei. The remoteness of these sites
   and the presence of the nearby nature reserve in the Chafarinas Islands
   may contribute to the protection of a nucleus of monk seals, which is
   likely to benefit from the proximity to the nearby Algerian border where
   monk seals could survive. Immediate conservation actions should be
   enacted in the identified subareas, and a regional strategy, including
   the nearby Algerian areas as well as the western Moroccan area of the Al
   Hoceima National Park, should be implemented so as to avoid further
   population fragmentation in this area of the western Mediterranean.},

Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {292},
Number = {1-2},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The Triassic Jurassic (T-J) boundary interval coincides with enhanced
   extinction rates in the marine realm and pronounced changes in
   terrestrial ecosystems on the continents. It is further marked by
   distinct negative excursions in the delta C-13(org) and delta C-13(carb)
   signature that may represent strong perturbations of the global carbon
   cycle. We present integrated geochemical, stable-isotope and
   palynological data from the Kuhjoch section, the Global boundary
   Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Jurassic
   (Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria). We show that the initial carbon
   isotope excursion (CIE), coinciding with the marine extinction interval
   and the formation of black shales in the western Tethys Eiberg Basin, is
   marked by only minor changes in kerogen type, which is mainly of
   terrestrial origin. Increased Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentrations
   of 9\% at the first half of the initial CIE coincide with Hydrogen Index
   (HI) values of over 600 mg HC/g TOC. The high correlation (with R-2 =
   0.93) between HI values and terrestrial Cheirolepidiaceaen conifer
   pollen suggests a terrestrial source for the hydrogen enriched organic
   compounds. The lack of major changes in source of the sedimentary
   organic matter suggests that changes in the delta C-13(org) composition
   are genuine and represent true disturbances of the global C-cycle. The
   sudden decrease in total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations likely
   represents the onset of a biocalcification crisis. It coincides with a
   4.5 parts per thousand negative shift in delta C-13(org) values and
   possibly corresponds to the onset of CAMP related volcanic activity. The
   second half of the initial CIE is marked by the dramatic increase of
   green algae remains in the sediment. The simultaneous increase of the
   C-org/N-tot ratio suggests increased marine primary production at the
   final stage of black shale formation. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Pressure tolerance of deep-sea enzymes can be evolved through increasing
   volume changes in protein transitions: a study with lactate

Abstract = {We explore the principles of pressure tolerance in enzymes of deep-sea
   fishes using lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) as a case study. We compared
   the effects of pressure on the activities of LDH from hadal snailfishes
   Notoliparis kermadecensis and Pseudoliparis swirei with those from a
   shallow-adapted Liparis florae and an abyssal grenadier Coryphaenoides
   armatus. We then quantified the LDH content in muscle homogenates using
   mass-spectrometric determination of the LDH-specific conserved peptide
   LNLVQR. Existing theory suggests that adaptation to high pressure
   requires a decrease in volume changes in enzymatic catalysis.
   Accordingly, evolved pressure tolerance must be accompanied with an
   important reduction in the volume change associated with
   pressure-promoted alteration of enzymatic activity (
   Delta VPP circle
   ). Our results suggest an important revision to this paradigm. Here, we
   describe an opposite effect of pressure adaptation-a substantial
   increase in the absolute value of
   Delta VPP circle
   in deep-living species compared to shallow-water counterparts. With this
   change, the enzyme activities in abyssal and hadal species do not
   substantially decrease their activity with pressure increasing up to 1-2
   kbar, well beyond full-ocean depth pressures. In contrast, the activity
   of the enzyme from the tidepool snailfish, L. florae, decreases nearly
   linearly from 1 to 2500 bar. The increased tolerance of LDH activity to
   pressure comes at the expense of decreased catalytic efficiency, which
   is compensated with increased enzyme contents in high-pressure-adapted
   species. The newly discovered strategy is presumably used when the
   enzyme mechanism involves the formation of potentially unstable excited
   transient states associated with substantial changes in enzyme-solvent
   interactions.},

Title = {Size-fecundity relationships for Cancer pagurus and Necora puber in the
   Shetland Islands, Scotland: how is reproductive capacity facilitated?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {87},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Successful management of fishery resources is dependent on understanding
   the exploited species' reproductive potential, which, in turn, requires
   spatially relevant estimates of the size at maturity and the
   size-fecundity relationship. This information is used by fisheries
   managers to implement regional maturity based legal landings sizes and
   seasonal fishery closures aimed at protecting the spawning stock and
   maintaining the reproductive output of the Fished population at a
   sustainable level, despite exploitation. Crab fisheries in particular
   depend on such information, which is often limited, even in
   long-established fisheries. To address this Issue, size-fecundity
   relationships were obtained for two commercially exploited crabs in
   waters around the Shetland Islands (60 degrees N 01 degrees W). These
   species were Cancer pagurus and Necora puber. A statistically
   significant positive size-fecundlity relationship was found for C.
   pagurns which describes a mean reproduction potential ranging from
   similar to 0.78 million eggs in females of 129 mm carapace width (CW) to
   similar to 2.4 million eggs in females of 212 mm CNV. The positive
   size-fecundity relationship found for C. puber was not statistically
   significant, but describes a mean reproduction potential ranging from
   similar to 0.16 million eggs in females of 56 mm CW to similar to 0.19
   million eggs in females of 96 rum CNV. Morphometric assessments of
   reproductive capacity in C. pagurus support the notion that positive
   size-fecundity relationships are attributable to the combined capacities
   of specific morphological features, each of which contributes to a
   female's spawning output ability. Statistically significant positive
   linear relationships were found between the natural logarithms of crab
   size (MV) and pleopod capacity, sperm plug mass, spermathecae capacity
   and gonad capacity. Respectively, these structures are crucial for
   successful egg attachment and incubation, sperm retention and
   protection, sperm storage and oogenesis.},

Title = {Rising sea level, temperature, and precipitation impact plant and
   ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 on a Chesapeake Bay wetland: review
   of a 28-year study},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3329-3343},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {An ongoing field study of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on a
   brackish wetland on Chesapeake Bay, started in 1987, is unique as the
   longest continually running investigation of the effects of elevated CO2
   on an ecosystem. Since the beginning of the study, atmospheric CO2
   increased 18\%, sea level rose 20cm, and growing season temperature
   varied with approximately the same range as predicted for global warming
   in the 21st century. This review looks back at this study for clues
   about how the effects of rising sea level, temperature, and
   precipitation interact with high atmospheric CO2 to alter the physiology
   of C3 and C4 photosynthetic species, carbon assimilation,
   evapotranspiration, plant and ecosystem nitrogen, and distribution of
   plant communities in this brackish wetland. Rising sea level caused a
   shift to higher elevations in the Scirpus olneyi C3 populations on the
   wetland, displacing the Spartina patens C4 populations. Elevated CO2
   stimulated carbon assimilation in the Scirpus C3 species measured by
   increased shoot and root density and biomass, net ecosystem production,
   dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, and methane production. But
   elevated CO2 also decreased biomass of the grass, S.patens C4. The
   elevated CO2 treatment reduced tissue nitrogen concentration in shoots,
   roots, and total canopy nitrogen, which was associated with reduced
   ecosystem respiration. Net ecosystem production was mediated by
   precipitation through soil salinity: high salinity reduced the CO2
   effect on net ecosystem production, which was zero in years of severe
   drought. The elevated CO2 stimulation of shoot density in the Scirpus C3
   species was sustained throughout the 28years of the study. Results from
   this study suggest that rising CO2 can add substantial amounts of carbon
   to ecosystems through stimulation of carbon assimilation, increased root
   exudates to supply nitrogen fixation, reduced dark respiration, and
   improved water and nitrogen use efficiency.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {293-324},
Abstract = {Dissolved gas in liquid is able to power violent eruptions. Two kinds of
   such gas-driven eruptions are known in nature: explosive volcanic
   eruptions driven by dissolved H2O in magma at high temperatures and lake
   eruptions driven by dissolved CO2 in water at low temperatures. There
   are two known occurrences of lake eruptions, one in 1984 (Lake Monoun)
   and one in 1986 (Lake Nyos), both in Cameroon, Africa. The erupted CO2
   gas asphyxiated similar to 1700 people in the Lake Nyos eruption and 3 7
   people at Lake Monoun. Here we review experimental simulations of
   CO2-driven water eruptions and dynamic models of such eruptions, and a
   bubble plume theory is applied to the dynamics of lake eruptions. Field
   evidence, experimental results, and theoretical models show that lake
   eruptions can be violent, and theoretical calculations are consistent
   with the high exit velocities and eruption columns inferred from
   observations. Furthermore, the dynamics of lake degassing experiments
   are consistent with theoretical models. Other kinds of gas-driven
   eruptions are possible and may have occurred in nature in the past. A
   concentrated and large release of methane gas or hydrate from marine
   sediment may result in an ocean eruption. Furthermore, injection of
   liquid CO2 into oceans might also lead to ocean eruptions if care is not
   taken. The various kinetic and dynamic processes involved are examined
   and quantified.},

Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The ocean's ability to take up and store CO(2)is a key factor for
   understanding past and future climate variability. However, qualitative
   and quantitative understanding of surface-to-interior pathways, and how
   the ocean circulation affects the CO(2)uptake, is limited. Consequently,
   how changes in ocean circulation may influence carbon uptake and storage
   and therefore the future climate remains ambiguous. Here we quantify the
   roles played by ocean circulation and various water masses in the
   meridional redistribution of carbon. We do so by calculating
   streamfunctions defined in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and latitude
   coordinates, using output from a coupled biogeochemical-physical model.
   By further separating DIC into components originating from the
   solubility pump and a residual including the biological pump, air-sea
   disequilibrium, and anthropogenic CO2, we are able to distinguish the
   dominant pathways of how carbon enters particular water masses. With
   this new tool, we show that the largest meridional carbon transport
   occurs in a pole-to-equator transport in the subtropical gyres in the
   upper ocean. We are able to show that this pole-to-equator DIC transport
   and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)-related DIC
   transport are mainly driven by the solubility pump. By contrast, the DIC
   transport associated with deep circulation, including that in Antarctic
   bottom water and Pacific deep water, is mostly driven by the biological
   pump. As these two pumps, as well as ocean circulation, are widely
   expected to be impacted by anthropogenic changes, these findings have
   implications for the future role of the ocean as a climate-buffering
   carbon reservoir.},

   sulphate as a ni-trogen source with maximum efficiency. The same
   optimized operational conditions were further employed in batch
   fermentation over a time span of 72 h. Interestingly higher cell dry
   weight of 21.52 g/L with PHB yield of 12.18 g/L and 56.59\% polymer
   content was observed in batch fermentation studies at 64 h. The chemical
   nature of the extracted polymer was validated with physio-chemical
   experiments and was at par with the commercially available PHB. This
   study will spotlight M. luteus as a potential source for large-scale
   industrial production of PHB with reducing environmental pollutions.},

Title = {Hurricane-Induced Sedimentation Improves Marsh Resilience and Vegetation

Abstract = {During the next century coastal marsh sustainability will largely depend
   on whether or not marshes can keep pace with rising sea levels while
   weathering more frequent and/or intense storms. In particular,
   hurricanes have the potential to inflict widespread damage to coastal
   systems, but can also deliver nourishing inorganic sediment. To
   determine if hurricane-induced sedimentation can enhance marsh condition
   and promote marsh sustainability, even in regions of high relative sea
   level rise (RSLR), we experimentally assessed primary productivity and
   marsh resilience in marshes that were subject to various levels of
   hurricane-induced sedimentation in 2005 and 2008 in coastal Louisiana,
   where RSLR is accelerated due to land subsidence. Primary production and
   marsh resilience, i.e., recovery rate of plant cover after an
   experimental disturbance, increased in response to hurricane-induced
   sedimentation. Sedimentation led to a more oxidized soil environment,
   reduced porewater sulfide concentrations, and increased porewater
   phosphorus and exchangeable soil iron and manganese concentrations.
   Improved soil physicochemical conditions were likely responsible for the
   increased productivity and resilience, even with the high rates of RSLR
   the area experiences. This suggests that when storm-induced
   sedimentation is sufficient, stability of coastal marshes may be
   enhanced, at least for some time, helping to cope with sea level rise.},

Abstract = {In an effort to better understand the impacts of high penetrations of
   photovoltaic (PV) generators on distribution systems, Arizona Public
   Service and its partners are implementing a multi-year project to
   develop the tools and knowledge base needed to safely and reliably
   integrate high penetrations of utility-and residential-scale PV.
   Building on the APS Community Power Project-Flagstaff Pilot, this
   project investigates the impact of PV on a representative feeder in
   northeast Flagstaff. To quantify and catalog the effects of the
   estimated 1.3 MW of PV that will be installed on the feeder (both
   smaller units at homes, as well as large, centrally located systems),
   high-speed weather and electrical data acquisition systems and digital
   ``smart{''} meters were designed and installed to facilitate monitoring
   and to build and validate comprehensive, high-resolution models of the
   distribution system. These models are being developed to analyze the
   impacts of PV on distribution circuit-protection systems (including
   coordination and anti-islanding), predict voltage regulation and
   phase-balance issues, and develop voltlVAr control schemes.
   This paper expands upon a paper presented at the 2013 IEEE PV SC
   conference that described updated results from the data acquisition
   effort, newly developed graphical analysis tools, continued feeder
   modeling, utility-scale PV integration and performance, and continued
   model validation. This paper presents results from Phases 3 and 4 of the
   project. Specifically, the paper discusses feeder model evaluation and
   extended application for advanced scenario analysis, specifically feeder
   reconfiguration, smart-grid device interaction study, smart inverter
   grid, and support functionality.},

Abstract = {The eustatic sea-level rise due to global warming is predicted to be
   about 18-59 cm by the year 2100, which necessitates identification and
   protection of vulnerable sections of coasts. In this study, the
   classification of the south coast of the Gulf of Corinth according to
   the vulnerability to the anticipated future sea-level rise is attempted
   by applying the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) and utilizing GIS
   technology. The length of the coastline investigated is 148 km, and is
   oriented along the WNW-ESE direction. CVI allows the six following
   physical variables: geomorphology, coastal slope, relative sea-level
   rise rate, shoreline erosion or accretion rate, mean tidal range and
   mean wave height, to be related in a quantitative manner. In each
   variable a relative risk value is assigned based on potential magnitude
   of its contribution to physical changes on the coast as sea-level rises.
   For every section of the coastline is assigned a risk ranking based on
   each specific data variable and the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) is
   calculated as the square root of the product of the ranked variables
   divided by the total number of variables. Following this a CVI map is
   produced for the studied coastline. This map showed that an extensive
   length of the coast (115.9km - 78.5\%) is characterized as highly and
   very highly vulnerable mainly due to the low topography and the presence
   of susceptible to erosion landforms. Area of high CVI values hosts
   socio-economically important land uses and activities.},

Abstract = {Political support for renewable energy development, especially offshore
   renewables, is particularly conspicuous in Scotland and is a centrepiece
   of SNP policy. However, this is built on something of a paradox because,
   put simply, without the subsidies paid by electricity consumers in the
   rest of the UK, the Scottish Government's ambitious targets for
   renewable energy would be politically unachievable. We argue in this
   paper that if Scotland does move towards independence, then there could
   be little reason for the UK to continue paying (much) of the subsidies
   since the resulting renewable generation would no longer contribute
   towards UK renewable energy targets. We suggest that the potential
   scenarios, and their implications, needs to be far better considered in
   the arguments around the Scottish constitutional position and the
   broader aims of UK energy policy.},

Abstract = {Evidence for low pO(2) and a ferruginous ocean characterize the
   mid-Proterozoic (1.8-0.8Ga). Considerations of redox sources and sinks
   imply that generation of O-2 via organic carbon (C-org) burial must be
   low to maintain a low pO(2) atmosphere for geologically long intervals,
   yet low oxygen should result in increased C-org preservation. Marine
   export production must therefore be low to limit C-org burial and O-2
   generation. Formation of ferrous phosphate can buffer deepwater
   phosphate (P-i) to levels an order of magnitude or more below those in
   the modern ocean, limiting export production. Low deepwater P-i is
   consistent with the hiatus in sedimentary phosphorite deposits during
   the mid-Proterozoic, and low pO(2) limits formation of sedimentary iron
   deposits (BIF). We propose that low pO(2) was maintained by P limitation
   resulting from ferrous phosphate buffering. The near-absence of BIF and
   phosphorite deposition is direct and indirect consequences of the low
   pO(2), respectively.},

Abstract = {Benthic algae are a major source of carbon supporting aquatic food webs
   in northern Australia, but little is known about the factors that
   regulate algal production. We surveyed benthic algal biomass in mainstem
   habitats of an unregulated sandy tropical river (the Fitzroy River)
   during a base-flow period. We used predictive models to reveal the
   physical and chemical parameters controlling algal biomass in mainstem
   habitats. We found that water velocity was an important driver-algal
   biomass was lower at higher water velocities. Subsurface flow was also
   influential-algal biomass increased in locations where groundwater
   upwelling occurred, as evident by a positive relationship between algal
   biomass and elevated radon and ammonium concentrations. In this sand-bed
   river, it is likely that high water velocity destabilises the sandy
   substrate reducing the establishment of algal biofilms. However, where
   water velocity is low enough for algal establishment, groundwater
   upwelling likely promotes algal growth by delivering limiting resources
   and/or creating stable conditions that promote algal production. The
   importance of surface and subsurface-flow conditions to benthic algal
   biomass means that any modification to the Fitzroy River catchment that
   alters dry-season longitudinal flows (via river regulation) or
   groundwater levels (via groundwater extraction) may directly influence
   river algal production.},

Title = {Environmental degradation and loss of traditional agriculture as two
   causes of conflicts in shrimp farming in the southwestern coastal
   Bangladesh: Present status and probable solutions},

Abstract = {An interview survey was conducted among some of the stakeholders in the
   shrimp value chain on the south-western coast of Bangladesh. The study
   was conducted in four subdistricts. Eight negative influences were
   treated as conflict generating factors. The following two hypotheses
   were tested: `environmental degradation is the main cause of the
   conflict' and `loss of traditional agriculture is another main cause of
   the conflict'. Attitudes towards seven of the eight conflict generating
   factors varied significantly among the four sub-districts. Differences
   between sub-districts and differences in land use histories were the
   significant contributors to the explanation of the variation in the
   attitudes towards the conflicts. In our study, we found a trend that
   attitude conflict-generating factors were more prominent where brackish
   water intrusion and brackish water shrimp farming were dominant.
   Landless people and marginal farmers were the two pioneer groups most
   intensively involved in these conflicts. Two of the most popular
   suggestions towards sustainable farming and conflict resolution were to
   `maintain proper outlet and inlet systems' and to `maintain alternate
   farming of shrimp and rice'. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Calibration of CFD Numerical Model for the Analysis of a Combined
   Caisson},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The purpose of this work is the calibration of a numerical model for
   simulating the interaction of waves with a composite caisson having an
   internal rubble mound to dissipate incident sea wave energy. In
   particular, the analysis focused on the reflection coefficient and the
   pressure distribution at the caisson vertical walls. The numerical model
   is based on the Volume-Average Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (VARANS)
   equations. Through three closure terms (linear, nonlinear, and
   transition), such equations take into account some phenomena that cannot
   be dealt when the volume-average method is used (i.e., frictional
   forces, pressure force, and added mass). To reproduce properly the real
   phenomena, a calibration process of such terms is necessary. The
   reference data used in the calibration process were obtained from an
   experimental campaign carried out at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the
   University of Messina. The calibration process allowed the proper
   prediction of certain phenomena to be expressed as a function of
   different closing terms. In particular, it was estimated that the
   reflection coefficient and the wave loading at the frontal wall are
   better reproduced when all three terms are considered, while the force
   at the rear wall is better simulated when the effects of such terms are
   neglected.</p>},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Solar generation technology is considered to be one of the most
   promising seawater desalination methods. To achieve a high and stable
   water production rate, the absorber structure and salt deposition are
   two key problems to be solved. As an effective salt-rejecting structure,
   a Janus structure can promote steam generation efficiency by reducing
   heat loss compared with traditional superhydrophilic structures. Here,
   we designed a Janus biomass carbon/sponge (JBCS) evaporator composed of
   carbonized original leaf particles and commercial melamine sponge
   seamlessly integrated with each other by a simple ``soak-dip{''} method.
   The upper hydrophobic carbon sponge provides excellent salt-rejection
   and good heat-localization, while the seamless hydrophilic melamine
   sponge underneath ensures a continuous water supply. The synergistic
   advantages of the Janus structure allow the evaporator to maintain a
   stable photothermal conversion efficiency of 86.5\% without salt
   deposition in 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution under 1 sun. Therefore, the
   sustainable JBCS can be used as a promising option to obtain clean fresh
   water resources to meet the needs of water-scarce areas.},

Title = {The Effects of Historical Housing Policies on Resident Exposure to
   Intra-Urban Heat: A Study of 108 US Urban Areas},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heat waves due to
   human-caused climate change puts historically underserved populations in
   a heightened state of precarity, as studies observe that vulnerable
   communities-especially those within urban areas in the United States-are
   disproportionately exposed to extreme heat. Lacking, however, are
   insights into fundamental questions about the role of historical housing
   policies in cauterizing current exposure to climate inequities like
   intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between
   ``redlining{''}, or the historical practice of refusing home loans or
   insurance to whole neighborhoods based on a racially motivated
   perception of safety for investment, with present-day summertime
   intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial
   analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two questions:
   (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate to current
   patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these patterns vary by US
   Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that 94\% of studied areas
   display consistent city-scale patterns of elevated land surface
   temperatures in formerly redlined areas relative to their non-redlined
   neighbors by as much as 7 degrees C. Regionally, Southeast and Western
   cities display the greatest differences while Midwest cities display the
   least. Nationally, land surface temperatures in redlined areas are
   approximately 2.6 degrees C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While
   these trends are partly attributable to the relative preponderance of
   impervious land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also
   examine, other factors may also be driving these differences. This study
   reveals that historical housing policies may, in fact, be directly
   responsible for disproportionate exposure to current heat events.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an experimental and analytical study to investigate
   the effect of shape on the pull-out capacity of shallow horizontal plate
   anchors in sand under drained loading conditions. Novel dynamically
   penetrating plate anchor concepts have been proposed for use in the
   offshore energy sector. These anchor concepts may have shapes that are
   atypical, and the analysis of pull-out capacity of these shapes may be
   needed for design. Most of the research on the capacity of shallow
   horizontal anchors has focused on square, rectangular or circular
   shapes. Physical and analytical modelling was used to study the capacity
   of circular, square, triangular and kite-shaped plate anchors. The 1g
   physical model results indicated that the circular anchor had the
   highest capacity, which was up to two times higher than the square
   anchor, which had the lowest capacity of all shapes included in this
   study. The equilateral triangle and kite shapes had capacities that fell
   between the circle and the square shapes. A new generalised
   non-associated flow limit equilibrium model was developed to predict the
   pull-out capacity of shallow plate anchors with convex polygon anchor
   shapes. The model was most accurate at embedment ratios of 4 or less,
   with a bias of less than 10\%.},

Abstract = {Large-landscape conservation is an emerging paradigm responding to the
   growing effects of landscape-scale stressors on the environment with the
   goal to balance multiple socio-ecological objectives. Wetlands provide a
   disproportionate wealth of ecosystem services given their generally
   diminutive composition across the landscape. A challenge for wetland
   scientists is to develop science to support this evolving landscape
   conservation approach and to integrate wetland services and benefits
   explicitly into regional conservation and adaptation planning. This
   special feature arose from a symposium held at the 2017 Society of
   Wetland Scientists meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico, USA entitled,
   ``Wetland Conservation in the 21(st) Century: Landscape Scale
   Interdisciplinary Approaches Addressing Multiple Objectives.{''} The
   nine papers that follow stem from that symposium and collectively
   provide examples of wetland science that address human well-being,
   ecological functioning, and future forecasting to support long-term
   landscape conservation planning. This special feature celebrates the
   critical role wetlands play in maintaining biodiversity and human
   well-being as well as the valuable role wetland scientists play
   informing landscape conservation decisions.},

   cool materials has been conducted a field test in Tianjin of China. A
   kind of PCM-eutectic mixture was prepared, which was encapsulated in the
   polyethylene of raised temperature resistance (PE-RT) pipe, for using in
   building roofs. Thermal performances such as the roof surface
   temperatures and heat fluxes have been studied. The results indicated
   that, compared with reference rooms, the novel energy efficiency roof
   has shown good effect on decreasing the peaks of temperature and heat
   flux, which means that the influence of the outdoor circumstance on
   indoor environment has been weakened. In conclusion, it has been proved
   that the novel roof has good thermal insulation effect and energy
   efficiency potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Solar desalination has been considered a sustainable method to obtain
   fresh water. However, its extended application is limited by low solar
   evaporation efficiency, poor salt rejection and durability. Herein,
   inspired by the structure of hair with black colour (black hair), a
   three-dimensional arched solar evaporator based on hydrophilic
   photothermal fibers is proposed for efficient water evaporation with
   long-term salt rejection. The formed liquid film on the solar evaporator
   based on hydrophilic photothermal fibers is composed of a confined water
   film for water supplementation and a free-flowing water film with
   ultrafast directional Marangoni convection and capillary effects for
   eliminating salt accumulation, which function cooperatively to endow the
   evaporator with all-in-one function including superior solar-driven
   water evaporation (1.39 kg m(-2) h(-1), 95.1\% efficiency for black
   hair; 1.38 kg m(-2) h(-1), 94.7\% efficiency for model material-oxidized
   carbon fibers), efficient solar desalination, and long-term
   salt-rejection properties (continuous outdoor evaporation of seawater
   for 20 days) without any post-cleaning treatment. The design strategy of
   the solar evaporator is provided for extending the application of
   superhydrophilic photothermal fibers and structure-design-induced liquid
   film control for salt rejection in the solar desalination field.},

Title = {Impact of wind turbine noise in The Netherlands},
Journal = {NOISE \& HEALTH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {55},
Pages = {459-463},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The Dutch government aims at an increase of wind energy up to 6 000 MW
   in 2020 by placing new wind turbines on land or offshore. At the same
   time, the existing noise legislation for wind turbines is being
   reconsidered. For the purpose of establishing a new noise reception
   limit value expressed in L den , the impact of wind turbine noise under
   the given policy targets needs to be explored. For this purpose, the
   consequences of different reception limit values for the new Dutch noise
   legislation have been studied, both in terms of effects on the
   population and regarding sustainable energy policy targets. On the basis
   of a nation-wide noise map containing all wind turbines in The
   Netherlands, it is calculated that 3 of the inhabitants of The
   Netherlands are currently exposed to noise from wind turbines above 28
   dB(A) at the faade. Newly established dose-response relationships
   indicate that about 1500 of these inhabitants are likely to be severely
   annoyed inside their dwellings. The available space for new wind
   turbines strongly depends on the noise limit value that will be chosen.
   This study suggests an outdoor A-weighted reception limit of L den = 45
   dB as a trade-off between the need for protection against noise
   annoyance and the feasibility of national targets for renewable energy.},

Title = {Factors affecting self-sealing of geological faults due to CO2-leakage},
Journal = {GREENHOUSE GASES-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-294},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Injecting anthropogenic CO2 into the subsurface is suggested for climate
   change mitigation. However, leakage of CO2 from its target storage
   formation is a concern. In the event of leakage, permeability in leakage
   pathways such as faults may get altered due to mineral reactions induced
   by CO2-enriched water, thus influencing the migration and fate of the
   CO2. An example of such fault permeability alteration is found in the
   Little Grand Wash Fault zone (LGWF), where the fault outcrops show
   fractures filled with calcium carbonate. To test the nature, extent, and
   time-frame of such fault `self-sealing', we developed reactive flow
   simulations based on hydrogeological conditions of the LGWF. We measured
   LGWF water chemistry and conducted an x-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
   analysis of the fault-rock to constrain the model geochemistry. We
   hypothesized that the choice of parameters for relative permeability,
   capillary pressure, and reaction kinetics will have a huge impact on the
   fault sealing predictions. Simulation results showed that precipitation
   of calcite in the top portion of the fault led to a decrease in porosity
   of the damage zone from a value of 40\% to similar to 2\%. Over a
   simulation time of 1000 years, porosity in the damage zone showed
   self-enhancing behavior in the bottom portion and self-sealing behavior
   in the top portion of the fault. We found that the results were most
   sensitive to the relative permeability parameters and the fault
   architecture. A major conclusion from this analysis is that, under
   similar conditions, some faults are likely to seal over time. (C) 2017

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the study of a novel design of turbine for
   tidal currents or fast-flowing streams, called the `Hunter Turbine'. The
   turbine consists of several flapping blades that are hinged on a
   revolving drum. Flow visualization experiments on a small model were
   conducted to provide some basic rules from which the movement of every
   flapping blade at every drum position could be determined.
   Two-dimensional quasi-steady CFD was then used to obtain detailed
   information about the flow field, including pressure and velocity
   contours, and the pressure distribution on the surface of the blades. It
   was found that the Hunter Turbine gives very satisfactory performance
   over a restricted range of flow coefficient. Under these conditions, the
   kinetic energy of the incident flow can be effectively transferred into
   the movement of the rotor, so that the average power coefficient (based
   on the projected area with an open blade) reaches a value of 0.19. Using
   the CFD results, a polynomial function is fitted to the dependence of an
   effective force coefficient for all blades on the rotational angle and
   the flow coefficient. The net forces acting on the surfaces of the
   blades can thus be interpolated between the calculated data points. (C)

Title = {Soil organic matter regulates molybdenum storage and mobility in forests},
Journal = {BIOGEOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {125},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-183},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The trace element molybdenum (Mo) is essential to a suite of nitrogen
   (N) cycling processes in ecosystems, but there is limited information on
   its distribution within soils and relationship to plant and bedrock
   pools. We examined soil, bedrock, and plant Mo variation across 24
   forests spanning wide soil pH gradients on both basaltic and sedimentary
   lithologies in the Oregon Coast Range. We found that the oxidizable
   organic fraction of surface mineral soil accounted for an average of 33
   \% of bulk soil Mo across all sites, followed by 1.4 \% associated with
   reducible Fe, Al, and Mn-oxides, and 1.4 \% in exchangeable ion form.
   Exchangeable Mo was greatest at low pH, and its positive correlation
   with soil carbon (C) suggests organic matter as the source of readily
   exchangeable Mo. Molybdenum accumulation integrated over soil profiles
   to 1 m depth (tau Mo-Nb) increased with soil C, indicating that soil
   organic matter regulates long-term Mo retention and loss from soil.
   Foliar Mo concentrations displayed no relationship with bulk soil Mo,
   and were not correlated with organic horizon Mo or soil extractable Mo,
   suggesting active plant regulation of Mo uptake and/or poor fidelity of
   extractable pools to bioavailability. We estimate from precipitation
   sampling that atmospheric deposition supplies, on average, over 10 times
   more Mo annually than does litterfall to soil. In contrast, bedrock
   lithology had negligible effects on foliar and soil Mo concentrations
   and on Mo distribution among soil fractions. We conclude that
   atmospheric inputs may be a significant source of Mo to forest
   ecosystems, and that strong Mo retention by soil organic matter limits
   ecosystem Mo loss via dissolution and leaching pathways.},

   evaporators with boosted water production efficiency},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Direct solar desalination exhibits considerable potential for
   alleviating the global freshwater crisis. However, the prevention of
   salt accumulation while maintaining high water production remains an
   important challenge that limits its practical applications because the
   methods currently employed for achieving rapid salt backflow usually
   result in considerable heat loss. Herein, we fabricate a solar
   evaporator featuring vertically aligned mass transfer bridges for water
   transport and salt backflow. The 3D open architecture constructed using
   mass transfer bridges enables the evaporator to efficiently utilize the
   conductive heat that would otherwise be lost, significantly improving
   the water evaporation efficiency without compromising on salt rejection.
   The fabricated evaporator can treat salt water with more than 10\%
   salinity. Moreover, it can continuously and steadily work in a real
   environment under natural sunlight with a practical solar-to-water
   collection efficiency of >40\%. Using the discharged water from reverse
   osmosis plants and sea water from the Red Sea, the evaporator
   demonstrates a daily freshwater generation rate of similar to 5 L/m(2),
   which is sufficient to satisfy individual drinking water requirements.
   With strong salt rejection, high energy efficiency, and simple
   scalability, the 3D evaporator has considerable promise for freshwater
   supply for water-stressed and off-grid communities.},

Abstract = {Late winter-to-summer changes (April to July) in ocean acidification
   state, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation for aragonite (a{''}broken
   vertical bar (a)) and calcite (a{''}broken vertical bar (c)) and
   biogeochemical properties were investigated in 2013 and 2014 in
   Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. We investigated physical (salinity, temperature)
   and chemical (carbonate system, nutrient) properties in the water column
   from the glacier front in the fjord to the west Spitsbergen shelf. The
   average range of a{''}broken vertical bar (a) in the upper 50 m in the
   fjord in winter was 1.59-1.74 and in summer 1.65-2.66. The lowest
   a{''}broken vertical bar (a) (1.5) was close to the reported critical
   threshold for aragonite-forming organisms such as the pteropod Limacina
   helicina. In summer 2013, a{''}broken vertical bar (a), pH(T) and
   salinity were generally lower than in 2014 as a result of a larger
   influence of high-CO2 water from the coastal current and less Atlantic
   water. The inner fjord was influenced by glacial water in summer which
   decreased a{''}broken vertical bar (a) by 0.7. Biological CO2
   consumption based on a winter-to summer decrease in nitrate was larger
   in 2014 than in 2013, suggesting more primary production in 2014. The
   influence of freshwater decreased a{''}broken vertical bar (a) by the
   same amount as the biological effect increased a{''}broken vertical bar
   (a). The seasonal increase in temperature only played a minor role on
   the increase of a{''}broken vertical bar (a). The biological effect
   showed more inter-annual variability than the effect of freshwater.
   Based on this study, we suggest that changes in the inflow of different
   water masses and freshwater directly influence ocean acidification
   state, but also indirectly affect the biological drivers of carbonate
   chemistry in the fjord.},

Abstract = {Coastal lagoons are productive and highly vulnerable ecosystems, but
   their management is still problematic mostly because they constitute
   transitional interface between terrestrial and marine domains. The ``4th
   European Conference on Coastal Lagoon Research - Research and Management
   for the conservation of coastal lagoon ecosystems, South North
   comparisons{''}, was focused on the scientific research on coastal
   lagoons and the management for their conservation and sustainable use.
   Selected contributions were considered in this special issue of
   Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science ``Research and Management for the
   conservation of coastal lagoon ecosystems{''} as they deal with three
   important aspects for coastal lagoons management: (1) the design of
   monitoring programmes using biological compartments, (2) the ecosystem
   functioning and the impacts of perturbations and (3) ecosystem
   trajectories particularly after ecosystem restoration. Here we introduce
   the selected papers published in this issue, place these contributions
   in the perspective of the science-management interface and discuss new
   issues for coastal lagoon management. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Through observation and numerical experiments, this study investigated
   the variation in the spring precipitation of the Songhua River Basin
   (SRB) for 1979-2020 and its relationship with the simultaneous northern
   Tropical Atlantic (NTA) sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). The
   results show that the main features of atmospheric circulation related
   to the SRB precipitation were anomalous vorticity over the SRB and the
   intensity and north boundary position of the West Pacific subtropical
   high (WPSH). A profound positive relationship existed between SRB
   precipitation and NTA SSTA during the spring. Further analysis indicated
   that the divergent wind induced by positive NTA SSTA could generate a
   Rossby wave source (RWS) over the equatorial and subtropical northern
   Atlantic. Consequently, a Rossby wave train was excited by the RWS over
   Eurasia, delivering anomalous wave energy to the SRB and western North
   Pacific, with two negative anomalous centers in the East European Plain
   and Northeast China and two positive anomalous centers in the Pamir and
   West Pacific in the upper troposphere. Thus, the SRB was covered by
   anomalous cyclones at 850 hPa, and the WPSH became intense and moved
   northward. As a result, the precipitation over SRB increased. Our
   results suggest that the spring NTA SSTA can be a potential signal in
   the prediction of spring SRB precipitation.},

Title = {Responses of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises to impact and
   vibration piling noise during harbor construction},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The development of risk assessments for the exposure of protected
   populations to noise from coastal construction is constrained by
   uncertainty over the nature and extent of marine mammal responses to
   man-made noise. Stakeholder concern often focuses on the potential for
   local displacement caused by impact piling, where piles are hammered
   into the seabed. To mitigate this threat, use of vibration piling, where
   piles are shaken into place with a vibratory hammer, is often encouraged
   due to presumed impact reduction. However, data on comparative responses
   of cetaceans to these different noise sources are lacking. We studied
   the responses of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises to both impact
   and vibration pile driving noise during harbor construction works in
   northeast Scotland, using passive acoustic monitoring devices to record
   cetacean activity and noise recorders to measure and predict received
   noise levels. Local abundance and patterns of occurrence of bottlenose
   dolphins were also compared with a five-year baseline. The median
   peak-to-peak source level estimated for impact piling was 240 dB re 1
   lPa (single-pulse sound exposure level {[}SEL] 198 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s),
   and the r.m.s. source level for vibration piling was 192 dB re 1 lPa.
   Predicted received broadband SEL values 812 m from the piling site were
   markedly lower due to high propagation loss: 133.4 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s
   (impact) and 128.9 dB re 1 lPa2 s (vibration). Bottlenose dolphins and
   harbor porpoises were not excluded from sites in the vicinity of impact
   piling or vibration piling; nevertheless, some small effects were
   detected. Bottlenose dolphins spent a reduced period of time in the
   vicinity of construction works during both impact and vibration piling.
   The probability of occurrence of both cetacean species was also slightly
   less during periods of vibration piling. This work provides developers
   and managers with the first evidence of the comparative effects of
   vibration and impact piling on small cetaceans, enabling more informed
   risk assessments, policy frameworks, and mitigation plans. In
   particular, our results emphasize the need for better understanding of
   noise levels and behavioral responses to vibration piling before
   recommending its use to mitigate impact piling.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {12},
Pages = {11461-11470},

Abstract = {Despite the strong representativeness of streams in the Amazon basin,
   their role in the accumulation of coarse particulate organic carbon
   (CPOC), fine particulate organic carbon (FPOC), and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) in transport, an important energy source in these
   environments, is poorly known. It is known that the arboreal vegetation
   in the Amazon basin is influenced by soil fertility and rainfall
   gradients, but would these gradients promote local differences in
   organic matter in headwater streams? To answer this question, 14
   low-order streams were selected within these gradients along the Amazon
   basin, with extensions that varied between 4 and 8 km. The efficiency of
   the transformation of particulate into dissolved carbon fractions was
   assessed for each stream. The mean monthly benthic organic matter
   storage ranged between 1.58 and 9.40 t ha(-1) month(-1). In all
   locations, CPOC was the most abundant fraction in biomass, followed by
   FPOC and DOC. Rainfall and soil fertility influenced the distribution of
   the C fraction (p = 0.01), showing differentiated particulate organic
   carbon (POC) storage and DOC transportation along the basin.
   Furthermore, the results revealed that carbon quantification at the
   basin level could be underestimated, ultimately influencing the global
   carbon calculations for the region. This is especially due to the fact
   that the majority of studies consider only fine particulate organic
   matter and dissolved organic matter, which represent less than 50 \% of
   the stored and transported carbon in streambeds.},

Title = {Limitations of an optimum sustainable population or potential biological

Abstract = {Decision rules are the agreed-upon points at which specific management
   interventions are initiated. For marine mammal management under the U.S.
   Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), decision rules are usually based on
   either a numeric population or biological-removal approach. However, for
   walrus and other ice-associated pinnipeds, the inability to reliably
   assess population numbers or biological removals highlights a
   significant gap in the MMPA, particularly when the Arctic environment is
   rapidly changing. We describe the MMPA's ecosystem-based management
   goals, and why managers have bypassed these goals in favor of an
   approach that depends upon numerical population assessment. We then
   revisit the statute's primary goals in light of current knowledge about
   the Pacific walrus ecosystem and new developments in environmental
   governance. We argue that to monitor and respond to changes in the
   walrus ecosystem, decision rules should be based on scientific criteria
   that depend less on the currently-impractical goal of accurately
   enumerating population size and trends, or removals from that
   population. Rather, managers should base decisions on ecological needs
   and observed ecological changes. To implement this approach would
   require an amendment to the MMPA that supports filling the gap in
   management with achievable decision rules. Alternatively, walrus and
   other ice-associated pinnipeds will remain largely unmanaged during a
   period of profound environmental change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Robust hollow glass microspheres-based solar evaporator with enhanced
   thermal insulation performance for efficient solar-driven interfacial
   evaporation},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Solar-driven interfacial evaporation is a green and efficient technology
   with wide applications, such as seawater desalination, wastewater
   treatment and electrical generation, and so on. Herein, we report a
   novel composite aerogel (PI-MWCNT-MHGM) using
   (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane modified hollow glass microspheres
   (MHGM), carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), and
   water-soluble polyamide via simple directional freezing and
   freeze-drying methods for solar-driven interfacial evap-oration. Owing
   to the directional freezing method, the hollow structure of HGM, and
   strong chemical interactions in PI-MWCNT-MHGM, the PI-MWCNT-MHGM
   composite aerogel exhibits porous structure with vertically aligned
   channels, strong mechanical properties, low thermal conductivity, and
   excellent thermal insulation, as well as broadband light absorption. As
   expected, the PI-MWCNT-MHGM evapo-rator shows a high evaporation rate
   (1.506 kg m(-2) h(-1)) under 1 kW m(-2) solar irradiation and excellent
   salt resistance, e.g., even when 1 g of NaCl was placed on the surface
   of the PI-MWCNT-MHGM, it could dissolve within 10 min. Moreover, the
   PI-MWCNT-MHGM possesses self -floating ability, combined with its
   eco-friendly, facile, and potentially scalable preparation method, the
   prepared aerogel may hold great potential for real applications. (c)

Note = {6th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies,

Abstract = {We observed that a CO2 droplet was not often covered with hydrate
   membrane until its complete dissolution, even in a hydrate-forming
   region, and the dissolution rate was higher than the case with a hydrate
   membrane. The difference of dissolution rates increases in proportion to
   the subcooling from the dissociation temperature, and the dissolution
   rate with hydrate membrane becomes a third of the case without hydrate
   at 2 Celsius. On the other hand, the measured CO2 Solubility with
   hydrate shows the same temperature dependence as the dissolution rate of
   a CO2 droplet covered with hydrate membrane, and the temperature
   dependence of the dissolution rate of a CO2 droplet without hydrate
   membrane is similar to that of the published solubility data for
   non-hydrate forming regions. It can be pointed out that there are two
   different solubilities in hydrate forming regions, that is, the
   solubility Of CO2 gas phase which can be extrapolated from the published
   data, and the solubility of CO2 hydrate of which data has already been
   obtained by the authors' experiment. The above-mentioned dual nature of
   CO2 solubility in hydrate-forming regions exerts a great influence on
   the evaluation Of CO2 ocean sequestration methods proposed so far.
   Especially in the dissolution method, in which CO2 is released as
   droplets in the ocean shallower than 2000 meters, this nature of
   solubility influences on the dissolution rate directly. Here, the
   authors attempt to clarify the dual nature of CO2 solubility in
   hydrate-forming regions, to propose the hypothesis of its mechanism and
   to discuss how to probe it.},

Title = {Oil dispersion and aggregation with suspended particles in a wave tank},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Suspended particulate matter (SPM) in marine environments plays an
   important role in determining the fate of spilled oil via the generation
   of oil-particle aggregates (OPAs). A series of mesoscale wave tank
   experiments and sedimentation tests were conducted to fill the knowledge
   gap on how the turbulent mixing, temperature, and oil type affect the
   dispersion of spilled oil and properties of OPAs. Generally, the oil
   dispersing efficiency was significantly enhanced by high wave energy,
   which also led to effective oil sinking, large size of OPAs and wide
   distribution of trapped oil. Nonlinear fitting results indicated that
   the oil sinking efficiency followed an exponential growth over time. The
   effect of temperature on oil dispersion and formation of OPAs is
   primarily attributed to its influence on oil viscosity and interfacial
   tension. Viscous oils are more likely to interact with particles above
   25 degrees C. However, below 20 degrees C, a specific oil viscosity that
   will bring about the maximum OPAs exists. Excessive oil viscosity will
   lead to a weak binding between oil and SPM and a centralized
   distribution of trapped oil. Furthermore, spilled oil with a high
   asphaltene can interact more effectively with particles. Our finding
   suggested that early prevention of offshore oil sinking is key in
   summer.},

Abstract = {In Korea, in particular the south coast, the marine industry has been
   gradually damaged by red tide. The pollution of offshore regions and the
   death of wild and offshore fish-farm fishes have resulted in significant
   economic losses to fishermen. The primary approach employed to remove
   red tide domestically is to spray red clay. However, not only is it hard
   to find the effect, but phosphorus and a trace quantities of metal in
   red clay promote the proliferation of red-tide algae. Therefore, the use
   of red clay is not ideal. In this study, a laboratory-sized mock-up test
   is performed to predict the efficiency of red-tide removal, water
   current, and flow velocity in the case where an artificial float with
   its membrane filled with ceramic carriers is installed around the
   perimeter of an offshore underwater fish farm. Mock-up devices are
   classified as circular and scaled-down types. Based on the test with the
   circular type, the flow velocity had a reduction rate of 78\% after the
   passage of layer 1, and it had increased to 81 similar to 82\% after the
   passage of layer 2. The reduction rate of red tide was initially 2000
   cell/ml at the time it passed layer 1, and had reduced to between 400
   cell/ml and 800 cell/ml after passing layer 2. In the test with the
   scaled-down type, the reduction pattern of the flow velocity was the
   same as that of the circular type. In conclusion, the artificial float
   with a ceramic membrane was effective at removing red tide and reduced
   the flow velocity between membrane layers to increase the stay time of
   red tide. It was verified that an actual artificial float could secure a
   sufficient time to remove red tide by causing the red tide to remain for
   a longer time between layers to increase the concentration, pumping
   red-tide microorganisms, and then removing the red tide through a filter
   press. It is expected that the use of artificial floats will become an
   effective measure to remove red tide.},

Abstract = {Shallow mountain lakes and ponds may function as reference systems for
   monitoring the effects of global climate change. A survey of
   phytobenthos and phytoplankton communities was conducted dong an
   altitudinal gradient of Canadian Rocky Mountain lakes and ponds to
   relate patterns in algal abundance and community composition to
   catchment and climate-related variables. Algal abundance and community
   composition were quantified using pigments as analyzed by high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Regression analyses revealed
   that the abundance of rock-attached algae (epilithon) was negatively
   correlated (r(2) = 0.54, p < 0.001) to lake elevation and positively
   correlated to conductivity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content
   (r(2) = 0.52, p(cond.) < 0.03, p(DOC) < 0.01). Redundancy analysis (RDA)
   showed that elevation, conductivity, and DOC were also significant
   predictors of epilithon community composition. Epilithic diatoms
   (diatoxanthin diadinoxanthin, fucoxanthin) declined disproportionately
   with increasing water transparency and decreasing chemical
   concentrations. in contrast, patterns in sediment-dwelling algal
   (epipelon) abundance and community composition were not well-explained
   by the suite of measured environmental variables. Phytoplankton
   community composition, but not abundance, was best predicted by
   zooplankton biomass and elevation as cryptophytes (alloxanthin) were
   favored in low-elevation, montane lakes and ponds containing abundant
   zooplankton. Also, elevated conductivity and low DOC content were
   associated with a compositional shift away from planktonic cryptophytes
   and green algae (lutein violaxanthin) towards siliceous algae
   (fucoxanthin, chlorophyll c) and colonial cyanobacteria
   (mycoxanthophyll). These comparative results corroborate experimental
   findings that suggest epilithon is regulated by DOG, inorganic
   nutrients, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) in alpine littoral
   habitats. Thus, epilithon appears better suited than either
   phytoplankton or epipelon as a bioindicator of climatically induced
   variations in the abiotic environments of shallow mountain lakes and
   ponds.},

Abstract = {The coral reefs and associated ecosystems of Cayos Cochinos, Honduras
   were briefly surveyed in early May 1995. The north coasts of the larger
   islands are exposed to greater wave energy and the reefs, dropping
   steeply to sandy slopes at approximately 30m, were dominated by often
   massive colonies of the various forms of Montastraea annularis commonly
   forming ramparts. The reefs surrounding the tiny carbonate islands in
   the lee were dominated by Agaricia tenuifolia and were more diverse in
   coral species. The shallow shelf extending towards the mainland 25 km to
   the west had scattered A. tenuifolia patch reefs, sand lenses, and sea
   grasses. There were extensive beds of sea grasses dominated by Thalassia
   testudinum and Syringodium filiforme to the south east and south west of
   Isla Cochino Pequeno. Benthic algae, primarily the brown algae Dictyota
   spp. and Lobophora variegata, were abundant at all sites surveyed,
   sometimes over-growing living corals. Algal abundance was highest
   nearest to dense human populations. The most likely human disturbances
   are over-fishing and nutrification, perhaps acting in synergy with
   periodic storm damage. The Cayos Cochinos Biological Reserve will be an
   important experiment on the impact of fishing and other human
   disturbances on the balance of corals and algae on coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Age and growth of the black seabream Acanthopagrus schlegelii (family
   Sparidae) from the northern South China Sea (NSCS) were studied by
   reading growth rings in sectioned sagittal otoliths. Ring formation
   frequency was determined to be annual by using marginal increment
   analysis. The von Bertalanffy growth function parameters were estimated
   as: L-infinity = 43.7 cm L-S; K = 0.22 year; t(0) = -1.59years.
   Functional males are significantly younger than functional females, with
   sexually transitional individuals between the modal ages of males and
   females supporting protandry in this species. Males become sexually
   mature within 1 year and 50\% age at sex change is at 2 years. The
   maximum age recorded for both males and females sampled was 9 years
   which is lower than for conspecifics elsewhere and may reflect high
   fishing pressure in the study area when compared with conspecifics in
   other areas or could reflect latitudinal effects. Otolith mass was
   significantly and positively related to age, providing a cheap and quick
   alternative method for approximating age. Acanthopagrus schlegelii is a
   relatively fast-growing and rapidly maturing species attaining a similar
   asymptotic length to conspecifics. A need for fishery management is
   indicated to protect both young juveniles and older adults, especially
   females, to increase reproductive output and safeguard fishery
   production.},

   influences carbon flux and partitioning in control and fertilized
   mini-plots of Pinus radiata in New Zealand. Cien. Inv. Agr. 38(2):
   277-289. Patterns of carbon flux and partitioning were examined in
   highly stocked (40,000 stems ha(-1)) control and fertilized mini-plots
   of Pinus radiata D. Don at five sites, which covered a wide climatic and
   edaphic gradient on the South Island of New Zealand. The gross-primary
   productivity (GPP) and the partitioning of the GPP to the above- and
   below-ground productivity and respiration were determined using a carbon
   budget approach. All of the components of the GPP, the above-ground net
   primary productivity (ANPP {[}r(2) = 0.67, P <= 0.01]), above-ground
   plant respiration (APR {[}r(2) = 0.66, P <= 0.01]), and total
   below-ground carbon flux (TBCF {[}r(2) = 0.41, P <= 0.01]) significantly
   increased with the GPP, but the ANPP:GPP, APR:GPP and TBCF:GPP ratios
   were not significantly correlated to the GPP (P > 0.41). The TBCF:GPP
   ratio significantly increased with the soil C:N ratio (r(2) = 0.93, P <=
   0.01), with a concomitant decrease in the APR:GPP ratio (r(2) = -0.88, P
   <= 0.001) without a significant effect on the ANPP:GPP ratio (P > 0.32).
   None of these fractions were correlated to the soil total or extractable
   phosphorus (P> 0.32). Although periodic and intensive measurements were
   required to determine the whole carbon budget in the ten plots, by
   necessity, the number of sites was limited, and, therefore, our results
   would require further confirmation using whole carbon budgets from a
   wider range of soil and environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {In this work the authors investigate possible changes in the intensity
   of rainfall events associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) under
   idealized forcing scenarios, including a uniformly warmer climate, with
   a special focus on landfalling storms. A new set of experiments designed

   Hurricane Working Group allows disentangling the relative role of
   changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide from that played by sea surface
   temperature (SST) in changing the amount of precipitation associated
   with TCs in a warmer world. Compared to the present-day simulation, an
   increase in TC precipitation was found under the scenarios involving SST
   increases. On the other hand, in a CO2-doubling-only scenario, the
   changes in TC rainfall are small and it was found that, on average, TC
   rainfall tends to decrease compared to the present-day climate. The
   results of this study highlight the contribution of landfalling TCs to
   the projected increase in the precipitation changes affecting the

Title = {The Dredge Disposal Sediment Index ((DSI)-S-2): A new specific
   multicriteria index to assess the impact of harbour sediment dumping},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {At present, there are few operational indexes to assess the impact of a
   given human pressure taken alone. Nevertheless, the current challenge in
   the management of coastal marine environments in the framework of
   cumulative impacts and climatic change is to identify the relative
   contribution of each activity on ecosystem functioning. The objective of
   the present study is to propose an integrative approach to assess the
   environmental impacts of dumping operations, via the development of a
   new index, the Dredge Disposal Sediment Index ((DSI)-S-2). From the
   selection of two types of station: impacted and unimpacted, (DSI)-S-2
   integrates six sub-indices considering the biological and physical
   changes generated by dredge disposal on the seabed. A final score is
   proposed, according to the five classes of the European Water Framework
   Directive. The initial development of (DSI)-S-2 was conducted on the
   experimental dumping site of Machu (Bay of Seine), by applying a BACI
   (Before-After-Control-Impact) approach. An additional implementation
   ((DSI2)-S-2) is used in the case of absence of data on ichthyofaunal or
   biological traits of life of macrobenthic fauna, which yields a
   comparable assessment of dumping pressure.
   In the future, the (DSI)-S-2 or (DSI2)-S-2 indexes should be tested on
   other dumping sites with a view to comparing the assessment of this
   dumping activity.},

Title = {The spatial-temporal patterns of East Asian climate in response to
   insolation, CO2 and ice sheets during MIS-5},
Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {293},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, between about 130 and 70 ka BP, is
   characterized by climate oscillations consisting of three interstadials
   and two stadials. Many climate simulations have been performed for the
   warmest MIS-5e period, but few has been made to cover the entire MIS-5
   to investigate the climate variability during this long period. In this
   study, two sets of snapshot simulations by a step of 2 ka covering the
   whole MIS-5 period are performed with the model HadCM3 to investigate
   the relative impacts of insolation, CO2 and Northern Hemisphere ice
   sheets on the East Asian climate variability. Our results show that
   precipitation and temperature in different subregions in East Asia have
   different sensitivity to astronomical forcing, CO2 and ice sheets, in
   particular when seasonal and mean annual changes are concerned. The
   variability of temperature and precipitation within MIS-5 is mainly
   controlled by precession but their magnitudes are modulated by CO2 and
   ice sheets. The impact of ice sheets on summer precipitation vary
   between subregions and is sensitive to ice sheet configurations and
   background insolation. The summer precipitation in southern China is
   more sensitive to ice sheets than in northern China. Moisture budget
   analysis show that insolation and CO2 affect the summer precipitation by
   the dynamic and thermodynamic processes, respectively, and the impact of

Abstract = {Trifluoroacetic acid (IFA) is an atmospheric decomposition product of a
   new generation of refrigerants that will replace current ozone-depleting
   CFCs. The effect of trifluoroacetic acid on microbial methanogenesis was
   assessed using environmental samples from four distinct methanogenic
   systems: the anaerobic digestor, the rumen, freshwater sediments, and
   marine sediments. TFA exhibited no toxcity, as evidenced by the rare of
   methanogenesis, at concentrations up to 10 mM. {[}1-C-14]TFA was used to
   test for biodegradation (release of (CO2)-C-14) in methanogenic marine
   sediments. No significant release of (CO2)-C-14 was observed. As a
   control, the toxic monofluoroacetate (MFA), which is not an atmospheric
   degradation product of CFC replacements, was found to inhibit
   methanogenesis in freshwater and anaerobic digestor samples al or above
   concentrations of 0.1 mM. We conclude that TFA is inert in these
   methanogenic systems and there is no evident toxicity to either the
   methanogenic or fermentative populations.},

Abstract = {Microbiologically driven ecosystem processes can be profoundly altered
   by alien plant invasions. There is limited understanding of the
   ecological mechanisms orchestrating different microbial constituents and
   their roles in emerging functional properties under plant invasions.
   Here, we investigated soil microbial communities and functions using
   high-throughput amplicon sequencing and GeoChip technology,
   respectively, along a chronological gradient of smooth cordgrass
   invasion in salt marshes located in the Yellow River Estuary, China. We
   found a positive correlation between microbial diversity and the
   duration age of invasion, and both bacterial and fungal communities
   showed consistent changes with invasion. Soil microbial metabolic
   potential, as indicated by the abundance of microbial functional genes
   involved in biogeochemical cycling, decreased in response to invasion.
   As a consequence, declining soil microbial metabolisms as a result of
   plant invasion facilitated carbon accumulation in invaded salt marshes.
   Bacteria and fungi exhibited distinct contributions to assembly
   processes along the invasion gradient: bacterial communities were mainly
   driven by selection and dispersal limitation, while fungi were
   dramatically shaped by stochastic processes. Soil microbial-mediated
   functions were taxon-specific, as indicated by community-function
   relationships. This study demonstrates the distinct contributions of
   microbial constituents to microbial community assembly and functions and
   sheds light on the implications of plant invasion on microbiologically
   driven ecosystem processes in coastal wetlands.},

Abstract = {The currently available microcalorimeter technologies are all affected
   by the difficulty of multiplexing large numbers of pixels (>1000).
   Microwave kinetic inductance detectors, on the other hand, are
   intrinsically highly multiplexible. We have recently shown that it is
   possible to use a superconducting resonator as a thermometer for a
   microcalorimeter (TKID). The moderate sensitivity of the resonator of a
   TKID requires a low heat capacity absorber (e.g. like Tantalum, Tin) in
   order to achieve sufficient signal to noise and absorption efficiency.
   These materials are often characterized by poor thermalization
   properties, which give rise to a position dependent response. In this
   work we introduce a new design solution based on a bilayer of Tantalum
   and Gold grown on a perforated SiN island that provides better
   thermalization properties and reduces the position dependence, while
   maintaining a small total heat capacity.},

Abstract = {Root crops, in particular ginger, taro and sweet potato, have a place in
   commercial and smallholder Fijian agriculture, and they fit readily into
   crop rotations involving other vegetables. As population pressure in the
   Fiji Islands and elsewhere increases, root crops may assume a more
   significant role in both local and export markets due to their ease of
   cultivation, short growth duration habits, high yields, and good eating
   and keeping qualities. Opportunities exist to study these and other root
   crops in both commercial and smallholder farming systems. An
   understanding of their mineral nutrition and the ability to
   cost-effectively diagnose any nutrition limitations (by soil test,
   foliar analysis or pictorial representation) will be vital as Fiji aims
   for greater export earnings, greater acceptance of a wider variety of
   root crops on local markets and more sustainable agricultural production

Title = {Monitoring and analysis of ocean swell fields from space: New methods
   for routine observations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {114},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations can provide a
   global view of ocean swell fields when using a specific ``wave mode{''}
   sampling. A methodology is presented to routinely derive integral
   properties of the longer-wavelength ( swell) portion of the wave
   spectrum from SAR level 2 products and both monitor and predict their
   evolution across ocean basins. SAR-derived estimates of swell height and
   energy-weighted peak period and direction are validated against buoy
   observations, and the peak directions are used to project the peak
   periods in one dimension along the corresponding great circle route,
   both forward and back in time, using the peak period group velocity. The
   resulting real-time data set of great circle-projected peak periods
   produces two-dimensional maps that can be used to monitor and predict
   the spatial extent and temporal evolution of individual ocean swell
   fields as they propagate from their source region to distant coastlines.
   The result is found to be consistent with the dispersive arrival of peak
   swell periods at a midocean buoy. The simple great circle propagation
   method cannot project the swell heights in space like the peak periods,
   because energy evolution along a great circle is a function of the
   source storm characteristics and the unknown swell dissipation rate. A
   more general geometric optics model is thus proposed for the far field
   of the storms. This model is applied here to determine the attenuation
   over long distances. For one of the largest recorded storms,
   observations of 15 s period swells are consistent with a constant
   dissipation rate that corresponds to a 3300 km e-folding scale for the
   energy. In this case, swell dissipation is a significant term in the
   wave energy balance at global scales.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {84},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {This paper presents results of an ongoing survey on the association
   between muon excesses at ground level, registered by the Tupi
   telescopes, and transient solar events, whose gamma-ray and x-ray
   emissions were reported by the Fermi Gamma Burst Monitor and the
   Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 14, respectively. We
   show that solar flares of small scale, those with prompt x-ray emission
   classified by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite as
   C-Class with power 10(-6) to 10(-5) Watts m(-2) at 1 AU, may give rise
   to muon excess probably associated with solar protons and ions emitted
   by the flare and arriving at the Earth as a coherent particle pulse. The
   Tupi telescopes are within the central region of the South Atlantic
   Anomaly, where the geomagnetic field intensity is the lowest on the
   Earth. Here we argue for the possibility of a ``scale-free'' power-law
   energy spectrum of particles accelerated by solar flares. For energies
   around and exceeding the pion production, large and small scale flares
   have the same power-law energy spectrum. The difference is only in the
   intensity. The Tupi events give support to this conjecture.},

Abstract = {The wave energy density spectrum provides useful information for both
   coastal engineering practice and applied sciences. However, it is not
   always available at desired location which can be far away from the
   observation stations, and should be achieved using approximated
   approaches. Nevertheless, the spectrum at the desired location may
   differ significantly from the approximated one due to nonlinear effects.
   In this paper, long duration and large-scale evolutions of the wave
   spectrum in shallow water is investigated numerically. Direct
   simulations of random seas are carried out by using the weakly nonlinear
   KdV equation and the fully nonlinear Enhanced Spectral Boundary Integral
   (ESBI) model respectively. Due to nonlinear effects, the spectral shape
   is modified and the energy is redistributed after a long-duration (1000
   peak periods) and large-scale (similar to 128 peak wave lengths)
   evolution. The results obtained by using fully nonlinear ESBI model here
   demonstrate that the flatness occurs only when both the conditions,
   i.e., large Ursell number and large wave steepness, are satisfied; It
   will not happen if the Ursell number is large but the steepness is
   small. This is different from the existing understanding in literature,
   i.e. spectra tended to become flat (or nearly uniformly distributed) in
   low frequency part as long as Ursell number is sufficiently large.},

Title = {Experimental investigation of SiC nanofluids for solar distillation
   system: Stability, optical properties and thermal conductivity with

Abstract = {Modified solar distillation system with different nanofluids was an
   emerging application area, which added various nanoparticles in saline
   water to enhance the ability of solar energy absorption and storage.
   However, there are lacked of exploration with the performance of
   nanofluids with saline water. Therefore, the stability, optical
   properties and thermal conductivity of SiC/saline water based nanofluids
   were systematically investigated in this study. The experimental results
   showed that SiC nanofluids have good effects for enhancing the thermal
   conductivity with respect to base fluids (>6\% increase at 0.4 vol\% SiC
   nanofluids) and have good capacity of solar absorption (<1\%
   luminousness at 0.4 vol\% SiC nanofluids). With increase of salt
   concentration, some negative effects will affect nanofluids both in
   stability and thermal conductivity. Therefore, an appropriate salt
   concentration range and nanoparticles load should be measured in
   practical application. Moreover, 0.4 vol\% SiC nanofluid was prepared
   with natural seawater and had sufficient stable period. The thermal
   conductivity of seawater based nanofluid was enhanced about 5.2\% with
   respect to base fluid. Good stability, low luminousness and effective
   thermal property of SiC nanofluids confirmed the feasibility of
   nanofluids application in solar distillation system. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {The surface wave effects on the performance and the loading of a tidal
   turbine},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {120-134},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {When tidal turbines are utilized in the most energetic waters where
   there are significant waves, the assessment of the surface wave effects
   are of great concerns. The objective of this paper is to contribute to a
   fundamental understanding of surface wave effects on tidal turbines. A
   numerical model was developed based on the modified Blade Element
   Momentum theory with an inclusion of added mass effects, wave excitation
   forces and a one degree-of-freedom (DOF) simulation for turbine
   rotational motion. The experiments on a 1:25 scaled tidal turbine were
   performed in a towing tank. It is shown that the surface waves did not
   affect the average loads and power output, but caused severe periodical
   oscillations. The amplitudes of the cyclic thrust and torque could reach
   up to 50\% of the mean value induced by the incident waves with period
   of 1.6 s and height of 14 cm. Non-dimensional response amplitude
   operators (RAOs) of thrust and torque were proved to be sensitive to
   submergence of the turbine. The wave induced torque and thrust tend to a
   fixed value when the incident wave length is much longer than the water
   depth, which provides an approximate assessment of the surface wave
   effects on tidal turbines.},

Title = {Dominant frazil ice production in the Cape Darnley polynya leading to
   Antarctic Bottom Water formation},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {42},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) occupies the abyssal layer of the world
   ocean and contributes to the global over-turning circulation. It
   originates from dense shelf water, which forms from brine rejection
   during sea ice production. An important region of AABW formation has
   been identified off the Cape Darnley polynya. However, it remains
   unclear why and how high ice production leads to AABW formation. Using
   moored acoustic measurements and a satellite microwave algorithm, we
   reveal that underwater frazil ice dominates in the polynya. This
   underwater ice formation prevents heat-insulating surface-cover ice
   forming, thereby enabling efficient ice production. The high ice
   production in the nearshore and longer residence times create
   high-salinity source water for the AABW. Underwater frazil ice occurs as
   long as strong winds continue and occasionally penetrates depths of at
   least 80 m. Deep-penetrating frazil ice is particularly prominent in
   this polynya, while it also occurs in other Antarctic coastal polynyas.},

Abstract = {An atmosphere-ocean climate box model is used to examine the influence
   of cloud feedback on the equilibria of the climate system. The model
   consists of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which are
   simplified forms of the first law of thermodynamics for the atmosphere
   and ocean and the continuity equation for the atmospheric component of
   the hydrological cycle. The mass continuity equation expresses the cloud
   liquid water content as a function of the evaporation rate from the
   ocean surface and the precipitation rate. Cloud formation releases
   latent heat. The model clouds also absorb solar energy at a rate
   consistent with recent findings. The model simulates snow-ice albedo
   feedback, water vapour feedback and cloud feedback. The global mean
   precipitation and surface temperature are analysed as they respond to
   enhanced greenhouse warming. Model results show that cloud feedback can
   lead to the occurrence of multiple climate equilibria. Some of these are
   warmer than the present equilibrium, with increased precipitation, while
   others are colder, with reduced precipitation. If the cloud feedback is
   weak, enhanced greenhouse forcing leads to a small alteration of the
   present equilibrium. If the cloud feedback is strong enough, the climate
   system can be forced into a warmer and wetter equilibrium.},

Abstract = {Wave interferometry is a remote sensing technique, which is increasingly
   employed in helioseismology, seismology, and acoustics to retrieve
   parameters of the propagation medium from two-point cross-correlation
   functions of random wavefields. Here we apply interferometry to yearlong
   records of seafloor pressure at 28 locations off New Zealand's South
   Island to investigate propagation and directivity properties of
   infragravity waves away from shore. A compressed cross-correlation
   function technique is proposed to make the interferometry of dispersive
   waves more robust, decrease the necessary noise averaging time, and
   simplify retrieval of quantitative information from noise cross
   correlations. The emergence of deterministic wave arrivals from cross
   correlations of random wavefields is observed up to the maximum range of
   692 km between the pressure sensors in the array. Free, linear waves
   with a strongly anisotropic distribution of power flux density are found
   to be dominant in the infragravity wavefield. Lowest-frequency
   components of the infragravity wavefield are largely isotropic. The
   anisotropy has its maximum in the middle of the spectral band and
   decreases at the high-frequency end of the spectrum. Highest anisotropy
   peaks correspond to waves coming from portions of the New Zealand's
   shoreline. Significant contributions are also observed from waves
   propagating along the coastline and probably coming from powerful
   sources in the northeast Pacific. Infragravity wave directivity is
   markedly different to the east and to the west of the South Island. The
   northwest coast of the South Island is found to be a net source of the
   infragravity wave energy.},

Title = {Scale dependence of the thermodynamic forcing of tropical monsoon
   clouds: Results from TRMM observations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1511-1524},
Abstract = {Clouds exert a thermodynamic forcing on the ocean-atmosphere column
   through latent heating, owing to the production of rain, and through
   cloud radiative forcing, owing to the absorption of terrestrial infrared
   energy and the reflection of solar energy. The Tropical Rainfall
   Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite provides, for the first time,
   simultaneous measurements of each of these processes on the spatial
   scales of individual clouds. Data from TRMM are used to examine the
   scale dependence of the cloud thermodynamic forcing and to understand
   the dominant spatial scales of forcing in monsoonal cloud systems. The
   tropical Indian Ocean is chosen, because the major monsoonal cloud
   systems are located over this region. Using threshold criteria, the
   satellite data are segmented into rain cells (consisting of only
   precipitating pixels) and clouds (consisting of precipitating as well as
   nonprecipitating pixels), ranging in scales from 10(3) km(2) to 10(6)
   km(2). For each rain cell and cloud, latent heating is estimated from
   the microwave imager and radiative forcing is estimated from the Cloud
   and the Earth's Radiant Energy System radiation budget instrument.
   The sizes of clouds and rain cells over the tropical Indian Ocean are
   distributed lognormally. Thermodynamic forcing of clouds increases with
   rain cell and cloud area. For example, latent heating increases from
   about 100 W m(-2) for a rain cell of 10(3) km(2) to as high as 1500 W
   m(-2) for a rain cell of 10(6) km(2). Correspondingly, the liquid water
   path increases tenfold from 0.3 to nearly 3 kg m(-2), the longwave cloud
   forcing from 30 to 100 W m(-2), and the diurnal mean shortwave cloud
   forcing from -50 to -150 W m(-2). Previous studies have shown that in
   regions of deep convection, large clouds and rain cells express greater
   organization into structures composed of convective core regions
   attached to stratiform anvil cloud and precipitation. Entrainment of
   moist, cloudy air from the stratiform anvil into the convective core
   helps to sustain convection against the entrainment of unsaturated air.
   Thus large clouds produce more rain, trap more terrestrial radiation,
   and reflect more solar energy than do smaller clouds. The combined
   effect of increased forcing and increased spatial coverage means that
   larger clouds contribute most of the total forcing. Rain cells larger
   than 10(5) km(2) make up less than 2\% of the rain cell population, yet
   contribute greater than 70\% of the latent heating. Similarly, the
   clouds larger than 10(5) km(2), in which the largest rain cells are
   embedded, make up less than 3\% of clouds, yet are the source of greater
   than 90\% of the total thermodynamic forcing. Significant differences
   are apparent between the scales of latent heating and radiative forcing,
   as only about 25\% of cloud area is observed to precipitate. The
   fraction of clouds that contain some rain increases dramatically from
   about 5\% for the smaller scale (10(3) km(2)) to as high as 90\% for the
   largest scale considered here (10(6) km(2)). The fractional area of the
   precipitating cloud ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 with a hybrid-scale
   dependence. Greater than one-half of radiative forcing is provided by
   nonprecipitating anvil portions of deep convective cloud systems. The
   results presented here have significant implications for the
   parameterization of clouds and rain in GCMs and washout of solute trace
   gases and aerosols in chemistry and transport models.},

Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {97-108},
Abstract = {In order to elucidate the regional export variation of particulate
   organic carbon in the western Arctic Ocean, samples vertically
   integrated between 0 and 100 m. depth or between 0 and 30 m/40 m depth
   were collected for total Th-234 measurements and those from 30 m/40 m or
   100 m depth were collected for particulate Th-234 measurements during
   the Second Chinese Arctic Expedition in July-September 2003. The removal
   fluxes and residence time of Th-234 in the upper water column were
   calculated by using irreversible steady-state scavenging model. The
   results showed that, total Th-234 was deficit relative to its parent
   U-238 in the western Arctic Ocean except in the western Chukchi shelf
   and the slope regions around 160 degrees W, indicating that scavenging
   and removal processes play an important role in element biogeochemical
   cycle in the Arctic Ocean. In the western Chukchi shelf and the slope
   regions around 160 degrees W, total Th-234 was excess relative to U-238,
   ascribing to the horizontal input of Th-234 adsorbed by ice-rafted
   sediments. Thorium-234 removal fluxes decreased from the shelf to the
   deep ocean, while the residence time of Th-234 increased from shelf to
   offshore, demonstrating that particle scavenging and removal processes
   are more active in the shelf regions. The estimated POC export fluxes
   from 40 m in the shelf regions and from 100 m. in the slope and deep
   ocean varied between 1.6 and 27.5 mmol/(m(2).d), and between 1.8 and
   14.4 mmol/(m(2).d), respectively. The averaged POC export fluxes over
   the entire water column decreased from the shelf to the deep ocean,
   indicating that the Chukchi shelf is an important region for organic
   carbon sequestration. The high ThE ratios (ratio of POC export flux
   derived from (234)Tn/U-238 disequilibria to primary production) in the
   western Arctic Ocean suggested that the biological pump runs actively in
   high-latitudes.},

Title = {High microbial gas potential of Pleistocene lacustrine deposits in the
   central Qaidam Basin, China: An organic geochemical and petrographic
   assessment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {245},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Thick Pleistocene fine-grained rocks in the central Qaidam Basin, China,
   are regarded as the principal source rocks for microbial gas there.
   Here, for the first time, a detailed investigation on the organic
   geochemistry and petrology of this sedimentary sequence is presented.
   Two different, immature, lacustrine source rocks facies are present in
   the study area. Organic facies A samples with high TOC (4.1-25.3 wt\%)
   and TS (1.5-3.7 wt\%) contents mainly developed under a suboxic to
   anoxic freshwater column at the lake margins. This shallow water
   fluvio-lacustrine facies, accounts for only a small proportion of the
   whole sedimentary sequence, but has the highest petroleum generation
   potential. In contrast, organic facies B samples having lower TOC
   (0.5-1.1 wt\%) and TS (0.14-1.0 wt\%) contents were deposited in a more
   oxic, brackish-lacustrine water body. However, exceptionally, anoxic
   conditions were present in sediments that were sealed by algae mats. The
   majority of the interval is comprised of gas prone, mixed type II-III
   kerogen derived mainly from aquatic plants. Organic facies A is
   interpreted to be derived from abundant macrophytes (e.g. non-marine
   algae, sub-merged angiosperms) around the lake margin. By contrast, the
   organic matter in organic facies B mainly stems from saltwater algae,
   with some additional bacterial contribution. Terrestrial higher plants
   are subordinate in both organic facies. The organic carbon accumulation
   rate was high compared to organic matter-rich Quaternary marine
   sediments. Cold and dry climate conditions and high burial rates favored
   methanogenesis via carbonate reduction in the sediments.},

Title = {Persistent organic pollutants in the polar regions and the Tibetan
   Plateau: A review of current knowledge and future prospects},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {248},
Pages = {191-208},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Due to their low temperatures, the Arctic, Antarctic and Tibetan Plateau
   are known as the three polar regions of the Earth. As the most remote
   regions of the globe, the occurrence of persistent organic pollutants
   (POPS) in these polar regions arouses global concern. In this paper, we
   review the literatures on POPS involving these three polar regions.
   Overall, concentrations of POPs in the environment (air, water, soil and
   biota) have been extensively reported, with higher levels of
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)
   detected on the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial distribution of POPS in
   air, water and soil in the three polar regions broadly reflects their
   distances away from source regions. Based on long-term data, decreasing
   trends have been observed for most ``legacy POPs{''}. Observations of
   transport processes of POPs among multiple media have also been carried
   out, including air-water gas exchange, air soil gas exchange, emissions
   from melting glaciers, bioaccumulations along food chains, and exposure
   risks. The impact of climate change on these processes possibly enhances
   the re-emission processes of POPs out of water, soil and glaciers, and
   reduces the bioaccumulation of POPs in food chains. Global POPs
   transport model have shown the Arctic receives a relatively small
   fraction of POPs, but that climate change will likely increase the total
   mass of all compounds in this polar region. Considering the impact of
   climate change on POPs is still unclear, long-term monitoring data and
   global/regional models are required, especially in the Antarctic and on
   the Tibetan Plateau, and the fate of POPs in all three polar regions
   needs to be comprehensively studied and compared to yield a better
   understanding of the mechanisms involved in the global cycling of POPs.

Title = {Tourism and sustainable water supply in Mallorca: a geographical

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Problems of sustainability of water supply in tourist resorts are
   becoming an increasingly common and important issue in applied geography
   and environmental management. This paper examines the relationships
   between tourism and water supply on the Mediterranean island of
   Mallorca, discussing both the scale of the problem and recent measures
   to find a solution, particularly the proposed Hydrological Plan for the
   Balearic Islands (published in 1998/9). Since Mallorca lies in an area
   likely to be seriously affected by future climate change, its potential
   effects are discussed and evaluated. One of the most critical problems
   relates to the coarse spatial resolution of general circulation models
   for predicting precipitation in an area where precipitation regimes
   grade steeply from semi-arid to humid temperate. However, it is likely
   that a continuation of the marked inter-annual and decadal-scale
   variability in precipitation seen during the recent past probably poses
   a greater threat to Mallorca's water supply than the more gradual,
   progressive change typically predicted to accompany future global
   warming. Similarly, continued over-exploitation of coastal aquifers will
   be more critical to water quality issues than the direct impacts of any
   future sea level rise, although the latter would undoubtedly exacerbate
   these effects. The conclusion discusses the controversial new ecotasa
   ('ecotax'), due to be imposed on Mallorca's tourist industry in 2002,
   which is likely to represent only a partial solution to the long-term
   water supply problem. As the physical, cultural and economic
   environments of Mallorca are typical of much of the Mediterranean
   region, the implications of this issue extend well beyond the island's
   shores. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research is to study the economic life cycle (LCC) Life
   Cycle Cost in addition to the indicators of economic efficiency of the
   Board of the Coast photovoltaic station in Tartous Governorate with a
   capacity of 300 kilowatts connected to the national electricity grid.
   The entire electrical energy produced from the station for a period of
   (25) years, at a price of (0.106) euro per kilowatt hour.
   The study of the economic life cycle was carried out using reliable
   simulation software (Pv Syst) by entering the technical and economic
   parameters of the studied station in addition to the solar radiation
   data of the studied site, Where we found that the cost of (LCC) was
   (743626) euro over the life of the project, and the operating and
   maintenance costs amounted to (4)\% of the foundation costs (248900)
   euro, and the cost of installing a kilowatt capacity (829.6) euro, i.e.
   (0.3\%) of Set-up costs, the cost of producing a kilowatt hour (0.04)
   euro, Economic indicators were also calculated for the year (2019), as
   the results showed that the economic efficiency index (2.4) is an
   excellent indicator, and the coastal board project can recover the
   capital within (6.8) years, and the annual profit for the year (2019)
   reached (38,480) euro.},

   frontal zone; the cross-shelf flow tends to be surface (bottom)
   intensified by a large internal circulation cell at the diurnal
   (semidiurnal) frequency. At a summer front, the diurnal internal tide is
   still trapped, but a semidiurnal internal tide propagates out of the
   frontal zone in the offshore direction while arrested at the inshore
   boundary. The presence of the shelf-slope front enhances the generation
   of internal tides, and it also causes an amplification of the
   semidiurnal internal tide by trapping its energy in the frontal zone.
   This amplification is most prominent at the offshore boundary of the
   winter front and the inshore boundary of the summer front, where strong
   tidal refraction takes place. Internal tides can cause significant
   mixing and dispersion in the frontal zone, with the semidiurnal internal
   tide being most effective toward the frontal boundaries, and the diurnal
   internal tide more effective near the site of generation.},

   the two extreme cases of zero and maximum recovery ratios) on the
   performance have been investigated. Power needed to drive a PV-RO
   desalination system of a given output is calculated. Osmotic pressure
   needed for different locations and the minimum PV area are calculated:
   the corresponding initial cost is estimated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Slow Recovery of Major Soil Nutrient Pools during Reclamation in a
   Sub-Alpine Copper Mine Area, Southeastern Edge of the Tibetan Plateau,
   Sichuan Province, SW China},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Improvement of soil nutrients is crucial for the long-term development
   and stability of restored ecosystems in mine areas. However, knowledge
   about the variation in soil nutrients and their influencing factors
   during the reclamation of sub-alpine metal mine soil is still scarce. We
   assess the status of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), N
   fractions, total phosphorus (TP), and available P in reclaimed soil at a
   copper mine site (2702 m above sea level) in the southeastern edge of
   the Tibetan Plateau, southwest China. The mine area had been reclaimed
   by distributing stockpiled topsoil (15 cm) in 2008, sowing seeds of
   ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in 2009, and planting seedlings of A.
   ferdinandi-coburgii and Rosa omeiensis f. pteracantha in 2010. We found
   that, eight years after the reclamation, although the concentrations of
   SOC (24.3 g kg(-1)) and TN (2.21 g kg(-1)) in the reclaimed soil
   increased by 25\% and 29\% compared with the stockpiled topsoil,
   respectively, they only accounted for about half of the levels in the
   undisturbed topsoil. In contrast, the concentration of TP (498-570 mg
   kg(-1)) did not significantly change between the reclaimed and
   stockpiled topsoil. The concentrations of NH4-N (30.1 g kg(-1)), NO3-N
   (17.2 g kg(-1)), and available P (11.1 mg kg(-1)) in the reclaimed soil
   were 2.2, 1.3, and 1.6 times the levels in stockpiled topsoil,
   respectively, but still lower than those in undisturbed soil. The
   concentrations of microbial C, N, and P in the reclaimed soil had a
   similar variation pattern to the available nutrients. The soil C:P and
   N:P ratios and microbial biomass C:P and N:P ratios in the reclaimed
   soil were significantly lower than the levels in the undisturbed forest
   soil. The average accumulation rates of SOC and TN in the reclaimed soil
   were 85.3 and 11.4 g m(-2) year(-1), respectively. The rates are much
   lower than those of reclaimed mine soils with similar reclaim duration
   but better climate conditions. Relatively slow development of vegetation
   and soil microorganisms and leaching due to a freeze-thaw cycle
   controlled by the sub-alpine climate are likely responsible for the slow
   recovery of soil SOC and TN.},

Title = {Saharan dust inputs and high UVR levels jointly alter the metabolic
   balance of marine oligotrophic ecosystems},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {The metabolic balance of the most extensive bioma on the Earth is a
   controversial topic of the global-change research. High ultraviolet
   radiation (UVR) levels by the shoaling of upper mixed layers and
   increasing atmospheric dust deposition from arid regions may
   unpredictably alter the metabolic state of marine oligotrophic
   ecosystems. We performed an observational study across the south-western
   (SW) Mediterranean Sea to assess the planktonic metabolic balance and a
   microcosm experiment in two contrasting areas, heterotrophic nearshore
   and autotrophic open sea, to test whether a combined UVR x dust impact
   could alter their metabolic balance at mid-term scales. We show that the
   metabolic state of oligotrophic areas geographically varies and that the
   joint impact of UVR and dust inputs prompted a strong change towards
   autotrophic metabolism. We propose that this metabolic response could be
   accentuated with the global change as remote-sensing evidence shows
   increasing intensities, frequencies and number of dust events together
   with variations in the surface UVR fluxes on SW Mediterranean Sea.
   Overall, these findings suggest that the enhancement of the net carbon
   budget under a combined UVR and dust inputs impact could contribute to
   boost the biological pump, reinforcing the role of the oligotrophic
   marine ecosystems as CO2 sinks.},

Abstract = {Crop rotation effects, due to emerging soil ecological interactions and
   processes that occur with time, can have a major impact on crop
   productivity and soil health. 2-year potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)
   rotation studies were conducted during an 11-year period on a fine sandy
   loam (Orthic Podzol) under a cool, humid climate in Prince Edward Island
   in eastern Canada. Rotation partners included Italian ryegrass (Lolium
   multiflorum Lam.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and barley
   (Hordeum vulgare L.). The study objective was to assess trends in yield
   parameters, populations and diversity in nematodes and soil-borne
   pathogens, and soil structural stability and organic matter retention
   with time. Italian ryegrass had the largest biomass of both herbage (6.5
   Mg ha(-1)) and roots (4.8 Mg ha(-1)), compared to red clover or barley.
   Averaged across 9 years, potato tuber yield was highest under Italian
   ryegrass (35.0 Mg ha(-1)) and lowest under red clover (31.1 Mg ha(-1))
   rotations. Differences in tuber yield among rotations was associated
   with soil N limitation and nematode activity, but was not evident until
   Year 6. Population densities of specific plant parasitic nematodes
   recovered from roots and soil were generally low and varied according to
   host plant. Root lesion (Protylenchus spp.) and root-knot (Meloidogyne
   spp.) nematodes were more prevalent under red clover compared to other
   rotational crops. Stunt (Merlinius spp. and Tylenchorhynchus spp.)
   nematodes were more common under Italian ryegrass. The main organisms
   associated with tuber-borne disease were Rhizoctonia solani,
   Streptomyces spp., Fusarium spp., and Helminthosporium solani. The
   greatest reduction in tuber-borne diseases occurred with the potato-red
   clover rotation but significant differences were infrequent. Soil
   structural form throughout the soil profile (to 30 cm depth) was not
   adversely affected by the rotational treatments during the duration of
   the study, while soil structural stability at the soil surface (0-10 cm)
   was significantly improved. Losses of soil organic C, during the 11-year
   period ranged from marginal (4\%) for rotations with Italian ryegrass,
   to significant (16\%) under the barley rotation. Computer simulations,
   using the Century model, illustrated the importance of C inputs to
   maintain soil organic matter levels. Overall, potato crop productivity
   and soil organic C were generally maintained in rotations that contained
   Italian ryegrass, but declined under rotations with red clover and
   barley. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A linked simulation-optimization model using artificial neural networks
   (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) is developed for deriving multiple
   objective management strategies for coastal aquifers. The GA-based
   optimization approach is especially suitable for externally linking a
   numerical simulation model within the optimization model. However, the
   solution of a linked simulation-optimization model is computationally
   intensive, as a very large number of iterations between the optimization
   and the simulation models are necessary to arrive at an optimal
   management strategy. Computational efficiency and feasibility for such
   linked models can be enhanced by simplifying the simulation process by
   an approximation. A possible approach for such approximation is the use
   of an ANN model. In this paper, an ANN model is developed initially as
   an approximate simulator of the three-dimensional density dependent flow
   and transport processes in a coastal aquifer. A simulation-optimization
   model is then developed by linking the ANN model with a GA-based
   optimization model for solving multiple objective saltwater management
   problems. The performance of the optimization models is evaluated using
   an illustrative study area. For comparison of the solution results, a
   multiple objective management model is also solved using embedded
   formulation and classical nonlinear optimization technique. The
   comparison of results shows potential feasibility of the proposed
   methodology in solving multiple objective management model for coastal
   aquifers.},

Abstract = {One of the consequences of climate change is an increase in the
   temperature of the oceans, which is considered to be one of the greatest
   impacts on biodiversity. Fish may respond to this impact in several
   ways, including shifts in their patterns of occurrence. The present
   study investigated the variation in the structure of a H. reidi
   population between 2015 and 2017 in the northern Guaiba Island area,
   highlighting a possible relationship to thermal anomaly associated with
   the El Nino phenomenon. The seahorse population monitoring was performed
   monthly, recording sex ratio, abundance, juvenile and adult proportion,
   depth of occurrence, total length and the holdfast which the seahorse
   were found attached. The influence of the El Nino event on the study
   population was evaluated by the correlation of the thermal anomaly data
   reported for the Tropical South Atlantic Index. Seahorse density on
   northern Guaiba island was positively and significantly correlated with
   water temperature, but the sex ratio and number of juveniles were not.
   The diversity of holdfasts used increased over the study period and was
   inversely proportional to the thermal anomaly. These results suggest
   that the thermal anomalies caused by the El Nino in the South Atlantic
   might trigger migration behaviour in the study species, providing a
   large aggregation during that period in Guaiba island.},

Abstract = {The future impacts of anthropogenic global change on marine ecosystems
   are highly uncertain, but insights can be gained from past intervals of
   high atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure. The long-term
   geological record reveals an early Cenozoic warm climate that supported
   smaller polar ecosystems, few coral-algal reefs, expanded shallow-water
   platforms, longer food chains with less energy for top predators, and a
   less oxygenated ocean than today. The closest analogs for our likely
   future are climate transients, 10,000 to 200,000 years in duration, that
   occurred during the long early Cenozoic interval of elevated warmth.
   Although the future ocean will begin to resemble the past greenhouse
   world, it will retain elements of the present ``icehouse{''} world long
   into the future. Changing temperatures and ocean acidification, together
   with rising sea level and shifts in ocean productivity, will keep marine
   ecosystems in a state of continuous change for 100,000 years.},

Title = {Interactive effects of food availability and aerial body temperature on

Abstract = {Intertidal organisms must episodically contend with the rigors of both
   the terrestrial and the marine environments. While body temperatures
   during high tide are driven primarily by water temperature, aerial body
   temperatures are driven by multiple environmental factors such that
   temperature of an organism during low tide is usually quite different
   from air temperature. Thus, whereas decades of research have
   investigated the effects of water temperature on intertidal species,
   considerably less is known about the physiological impacts of
   temperature during aerial exposure at low tide, especially with regard
   to the interaction of aerial body temperature with other stressors. We
   examined the interactive effects of aerial body temperature and food
   supply on the survival of two intertidal blue mussels, Mytilus
   galloprovincialis and Mytilus trossulus. Survival was monitored for nine
   weeks using a simulated tidal cycle, with two levels of food and three
   levels of aerial body temperature (30, 25, and 20 degrees C). Decreased
   food supply significantly reduced the survival of mussels, but only
   under the 30 degrees C treatment. In the other two thermal regimes there
   were no significant effect of food on survival. When aerial body
   temperatures are high, food availability may have a greater effect on
   intertidal organisms. Decreases in ocean productivity have been linked
   to increased in ocean temperatures, thus intertidal organisms may become
   more susceptible to thermal stress as climates shift. Published by

Abstract = {Almost 80 \% of Algerian territory is appropriate for the exploitation
   of solar energy. The Algerian energetic strategy provides a substantial
   injection of PV electricity to the national grid. Currently, about 344
   MWp of PV arrays which corresponds approximately to 2,34 km(2) of module
   surfaces, are connected on electricity grid over the national territory.
   The Algerian Northern regions are characterized by strong pollution and
   high humidity. These phenomena affect the energetic productivity of PV
   generator. The objective of our study is to analyze experimental grid
   connected PV system power in coastal locations. Hence, experiments have
   been conducted on three identical PV systems to determine the electrical
   performances. Transformer-less inverters are the most attractive for the
   ground-based photovoltaic (PV) system due to their efficiencies, reduced
   cost and weight. Besides, the absence of the galvanic isolation
   generates problems of capacitive leakage current on the AC side and the
   degradation of the insulation resistance on the DC side of the inverter.
   In this work, experimental study of the behavior of single-phase
   inverters without transformers is presented. The main objective of this
   work is to study the degradation of the insulation resistance at the
   input of the inverter, and the capacitive leakage current at the output
   of the inverter. This study was achieved at the CDER on a rainy day of
   15/03/2017, on the first PV plant connected to the low voltage network
   in Algeria. This investigation can help forecasting the PV array
   energetic production by taking into account natural conditions.},

Abstract = {The anadromous alewife is a commercially fished clupeid in Atlantic
   Canada, whose oceanic migration is poorly understood. Migration of
   alewives is presently investigated from the lower reaches of Gaspereau
   River into Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy. Seventy-five post-spawning adults
   were tagged on their downstream migration; within two days of being
   tagged, most alewives had left Gaspereau River and 57 entered into the
   Southern Bight of Minas Basin. Thirty-one alewives were detected in
   Minas Passage and their average time from tagging to final detection was
   28 days with standard deviation of 11 days. None of the alewives were
   detected in Minas Passage until day 20 after the start of tagging. After
   day 20, the residence timescale in Minas Basin was only 8.8 days with
   95\% CI of 8.4-9.3 days. Fast tidal currents prevail in much of the
   study area, and alewives travelled many large tidal excursions in Minas
   Basin and Minas Passage. Separation distances between pairs of alewives
   increased greatly after day 20, indicating tidal mixing over large
   distances within the study area. Offshore movement was associated with
   seasonal warming, with alewives moving down the spatial temperature
   gradient and into deeper waters. Offshore, larger tidal displacements
   widely dispersed tagged alewives through Minas Basin and to Minas
   Passage. During transit of Gaspereau River, 18 +/- 2 alewives were lost
   with corroborating evidence of mortality for 4 of these. By day 20, the
   apparent mortality within Minas Basin was <= 10 alewives. Individual
   alewives were observed to make many transits through Minas Passage
   during their migration, where they may become exposed to in-stream tidal
   turbines.},

Abstract = {A regional ecological risk assessment was conducted for the Kaipara
   Harbour catchment in New Zealand. The Relative Risk Model was used to
   prioritize management of the sources of stress and habitats of concern
   in the basin. Semi-structured interviews with 25 representative
   stakeholders were conducted to obtain the resource-users' perspectives
   and to identify the regional stressor sources and receptor habitat data
   for the model. For this risk analysis we divided the catchment into nine
   ecological districts. Mixed-methodological approaches including content
   analysis, geospatial analysis, and source documentation were used to
   categorize source and habitat rankings, based on the relative abundance
   of each in the nine ecological districts. Risk characterization revealed
   that fishing pressure and tidal energy pose the largest sources of
   perceived risk to the catchment; shellfish and Maui dolphin habitats are
   the receptors estimated to be at greatest risk; and the Kaipara and
   Rodney ecological districts are the sub-regions estimated with the
   greatest combined risk. A Monte Carlo analysis confirmed the source
   inputs and revealed greater uncertainty than the estimated habitat input
   results. The results of this assessment can be used by policy-makers,
   conservation groups, and municipalities to inform the future management
   efforts in the harbor and catchment.},

Title = {Upwelling buffers climate change impacts on coral reefs of the eastern
   tropical Pacific},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {101},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Corals of the eastern tropical Pacific live in a marginal and
   oceanographically dynamic environment. Along the Pacific coast of
   Panama, stronger seasonal upwelling in the Gulf of Panama in the east
   transitions to weaker upwelling in the Gulf of Chiriqui in the west,
   resulting in complex regional oceanographic conditions that drive
   differential coral-reef growth. Over millennial timescales, reefs in the
   Gulf of Chiriqui recovered more quickly from climatic disturbances
   compared with reefs in the Gulf of Panama. In recent decades, corals in
   the Gulf of Chiriqui have also had higher growth rates than in the Gulf
   of Panama. As the ocean continues to warm, however, conditions could
   shift to favor the growth of corals in the Gulf of Panama, where
   upwelling may confer protection from high-temperature anomalies. Here we
   describe the recent spatial and temporal variability in surface
   oceanography of nearshore environments in Pacific Panama and compare
   those conditions with the dynamics of contemporary coral-reef
   communities during and after the 2016 coral-bleaching event. Although
   both gulfs have warmed significantly over the last 150 yr, the annual
   thermal maximum in the Gulf of Chiriqui is increasing faster, and ocean
   temperatures there are becoming more variable than in the recent past.
   In contrast to historical trends, we found that coral cover, coral
   survival, and coral growth rates were all significantly higher in the
   Gulf of Panama. Corals bleached extensively in the Gulf of Chiriqui
   following the 2015-2016 El Nino event, whereas upwelling in the Gulf of
   Panama moderated the high temperatures caused by El Nino, allowing the
   corals largely to escape thermal stress. As the climate continues to
   warm, upwelling zones may offer a temporary and localized refuge from
   the thermal impacts of climate change, while reef growth in the rest of
   the eastern tropical Pacific continues to decline.},

Title = {Significant wave height forecasting using hybrid ensemble deep
   randomized networks with neurons pruning},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},

Abstract = {The reliable control of wave energy devices highly relies on the
   forecasts of wave heights. However, the dynamic characteristics and
   significant fluctuation of waves' historical data pose challenges to
   precise predictions. Neural networks offer a promising solution to
   forecast the wave heights by extracting meaningful features from
   historical observations. This paper proposes a novel hybrid random
   vector functional link network with the ensemble and deep learning
   benefits. Hierarchical stacks of hidden layers are constructed to
   enforce the deep representations of the time series. Individual output
   layers follow all enhancement layers to adopt ensemble learning. A
   neuron pruning strategy is proposed to remove the noisy information from
   the random features and boost the network's performance. Besides, the
   proposed network is further utilized to forecast the additive and
   multiplicative residuals from the ARIMA method. Finally, the ensemble of
   additive-ARIMA-edRVFL, multiplicative-ARIMA-edRVFL, and edRVFL achieves
   the best average rankings around two for three forecasting horizons. The
   proposed ensemble achieves an average ranking of 1.33 on four-hours
   ahead of forecasting in terms of root mean square error and mean
   absolute scaled error. Extensive experiments are conducted on twelve
   time series of the significant wave height. The comparative results
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over other
   state-of-the-art methods. The source codes are available on

Title = {Algal diversity of Zempoala Lagoons National Park, Mexico, except
   diatoms},
Journal = {HIDROBIOLOGICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {Background. The Parque Nacional Lagunas de Zempoala (PNLZ) is located in
   a transitional zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, and
   harbors a great phycofloristic diversity. The lakes studied were
   Zempoala, Compila, Tonatihua and Prieta, and the stream that flows into
   Zempoala lake. With the exception of Zempoala lake, the others are
   studied for the first time. Goals. To study of phycofloristic
   composition of aquatic environments of the PNLZ. Methods. The samples
   (23) were collected in March-April 2011, using a towed net of 20 mu m.
   Ten L of water were filtered and algae mixed with aquatic plants were
   collected. The samples were fixed with 4\% formalin. Water temperature
   pH, and conductivity were measured. Samples were observed under light
   microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results. The pH
   of the studied lakes was 7.1-8.8, the surface water temperature was
   recorded between 14.2-17 degrees C and the conductivity varied between
   112-124 mu S cm(-1). Fifty-five species were identified, with a
   dominance of Chlorophyceae (13), Cyanophyceae (12), Trebouxiophyceae
   (9), Euglenophyceae (7) and Zygnematophyceae (6). Some common bluegreens
   were Woronichinia and Planktolyngbya. Others such as Cryptomonas
   (Cryptophyta), Ceratium and Peridinium (Dinoflagellata) were abundant.
   Chlorophyta encompassed the entire study area (Scenedesmus, Eudorina,
   Botryococcus and Lagerheimia). They emphasize Staurastrum and Cosmarium
   (Charophyta). Three benthic genera Prasiola, Chara and Nitella were
   recorded in PNLZ. Other green algae grew as metaphytes and epiphytes.
   39.3\% of the species are cosmopolitan; others have tropical and neartic
   affinities. Ten new registries were determined for Mexico. Conclusions.
   Compared to other Mexican lakes, those studied here can be considered of
   high richness and diversity, particularly with respect to phytoplankton.
   The lack of knowledge and the disturbance of the continental aquatic
   environments, threaten the survival of the phytoplankton community, so
   it is important to integrate studies that include various areas of
   biology, as well as public policies for their management and
   conservation.},

   political economy: The fusion of regimes of accumulation?},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {214-223},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Indian government's economic development program is predicated on
   increasing electricity generating capacity. Coal fired power and removal
   of obstacles to private corporations investing in generating capacity
   are core elements in this program. With difficulties in boosting
   national coal production, the state-owned Coal India Limited and energy
   corporations have spearheaded a range of global coal sourcing
   endeavours, including investing in offshore deposits. Energy security
   has become reflected in engineering global supply chains, securing
   control of coal, with two of the largest projects involving Adani and
   GVK proposing to develop mines in the Galilee Basin in Queensland,
   Australia. These investments become the institutional and organisational
   architecture that locks in demand, a global demand which helps to
   explain successive Australian governments support for and approval of
   the projects. Notwithstanding considerable environmental opposition, and
   questions about the economic merits and commercial viability of the
   projects, Australian governments are wedded to the conviction that
   expanded development of the economy is tied to extracting and exporting
   fossil fuels, to consolidating Australia as an `energy superpower'.

Title = {Application of a long-range camera to monitor fishing effort on an
   offshore artificial reef},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {228},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A land-based long-range camera was developed and tested at an artificial
   reef site in south-east (SE) Australia to monitor levels of recreational
   fishing effort across a range of 9 km. The camera had 50x magnification
   and was operated remotely through a 4 G-LTE network, including the
   ability to focus and program time intervals between images. The camera
   was powered by a 12 V system charged through 3 x 180 W solar panels. The
   camera was tested over an 8-month period where photographs were taken
   every 15 min during daylight hours, imagery taken at this time was used
   to estimate fishing effort (vessel hours day(-1)). The long-range camera
   was successful in producing photographs of boats fishing on the
   artificial reef across the 9 km range. This capability was
   ground-truthed by placing a research vessel on the reef at known times
   and cross referencing this in photographs taken during these periods.
   Camera performance did diminish at times during the first few hours
   after sunlight, particularly during the warmer months, this was most
   likely caused by atmospheric turbulence occurring across the 9 km range.
   Although not the primary focus of the study, it was found that fishing
   effort at the study site varied between weekdays and weekends, with
   increased activity occurring during the latter. The long-range camera is
   likely useful beyond monitoring artificial reefs and would provide
   opportunities for monitoring offshore infrastructure such as aquaculture
   leases, or fishing effort in marine protected areas.},

Title = {Bacteriohopanepolyol distribution in Yenisei River and Kara Sea
   suspended particulate matter and sediments traces terrigenous organic
   matter input},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {174},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) are ubiquitous bacterial membrane lipids,
   encountered in soils, river and marine suspended particulate matter
   (SPM) and sediments. Their abundance and distribution provides a direct
   means to identify bacterial inputs and can be used to trace soil-derived
   bacterial organic matter (OM) and in some cases the presence of
   bacterial groups and their activities in aquatic systems. We have
   studied the BHP distribution in the SPM of a major Siberian River
   (Yenisei River) that crosses a large latitudinal gradient, draining a
   large part of Mongolia and Siberian Russia. The Yenisei River is the
   main river to flow into the Kara Sea, a shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean.
   We show that the BHP distribution and concentration of SPM and surface
   sediments of the Yenisei Outflow in the Kara Sea allow to trace
   soil-marker BHPs and evaluate the performance of the R-soil' index, a
   proxy developed to trace bacterial soil-derived OM. Soil-marker BHPs are
   present in the Yenisei River, and their concentration decreases from the
   Yenisei River Outflow into the offshore marine sediments. The R-soil'
   correlates well with an independent proxy for bacterial OM, the
   BIT-index (r(2) = 0.82) and has a moderate correlation with the delta
   C-13(org) values, a bulk OM proxy for terrigenous input (r(2) = 0.44).
   Consequently, the R-soil' index performs well in the Kara Sea,
   strengthening its application for tracing bacterial OM in the Arctic
   Ocean, both in modern and downcore sediments. Furthermore, a suite of
   BHPs that are characteristic for methanotrophic bacteria, i.e.
   35-aminobacteriohopane-30,31,32,33,34-pentol (aminopentol) and
   35-aminobacteriohopane-31,32,33,34-tetrol (aminotetrol), is encountered
   in the Yenisei Outflow sediments. These components are partly sourced
   from terrigenous sources, but are likely also produced in-situ in the
   marine sediments. The distribution of the pentafunctionalized cyclitol
   ether BHP in the marine systems is noteworthy, and indicates that it can
   possibly be applied as a marker for cyanobacterial biomass in marine
   sediments. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The main phase of lifting the Sirt Basin (Libya) had ceased by the
   mid-Cretaceous bur Alpine-related tectonic pulses in the late Eocene
   resulted in northward tilting of the basin. In the Maragh Trough (SE
   Sirt basin), a regional unconformity consequently separates Eocene
   carbonates from the overlying Oligocene succession. The unconformity
   marks a change from Eocene carbonate sedimentation to move mixed
   shallow-marine deposition in the Oligocene. A regional transgression
   re-established fully marine conditions in the Miocene.
   Deeply-buried (Triassic) source rocks in the Maragh Trough reached peak
   oil generation during the Oligocene. Two potential reservoir intervals
   have been identified: zipper Eocene rudstones of the Augila Formation,
   and unconformably-overlying sandstones of the Lower Oligocene Arida
   Formation. Mid-Oligocene shales provide a regional seal.
   Facies distributions and reservoir properties are related to

Abstract = {Direct numerical simulations are performed to investigate the generation
   of internal waves by tide-topography interaction in a lab-scale model.
   The bottom topography is a triangular ridge with two critical slopes.
   With increasing tidal forcing, subhar-monic instabilities are
   identified, which cause internal wave beams to become unstable and
   turbulent. Kinetic energy densities in the upward going beams from the
   ridge top are stronger than those from the ridge bottom, whereas the
   reverse is true for the energy flux. This disparity between energy and
   energy flux is due to the existence of strong pressure disturbances near
   the ridge bottom. On each side of the critical ridge, there exists an
   amphidromic point, from which internal wave beams are emitted in
   opposite directions. The calculated energy conversion rate scales
   linearly with the square of the forcing amplitude and agrees within 13\%
   of theoretical prediction, even when turbulence occurs. The fraction of
   radiated baroclinic energy becomes saturated in the range of low
   excursion parameter considered, which agrees with the behavior in
   large-scale systems wherein mixing parameterizations must be used. The
   present work enriches the studies on the generation of internal waves
   over a critical triangular ridge.},

Volume = {35},

Pages = {353-368},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Large freshwater contributions to the Arctic Ocean from a variety of
   sources combine in what is, by global standards, a remarkably small
   ocean basin. Indeed, the Arctic Ocean receives similar to 11\% of global
   river discharge while accounting for only similar to 1\% of global ocean
   volume. As a consequence, estuarine gradients are a defining feature not
   only near-shore, but throughout the Arctic Ocean. Sea-ice dynamics also
   play a pivotal role in the salinity regime, adding salt to the
   underlying water during ice formation and releasing fresh water during
   ice thaw. Our understanding of physical-chemical-biological interactions
   within this complex system is rapidly advancing. However, much of the
   estuarine research to date has focused on summer, open water conditions.
   Furthermore, our current conceptual model for Arctic estuaries is
   primarily based on studies of a few major river inflows. Future
   advancement of estuarine research in the Arctic requires concerted
   seasonal coverage as well as a commitment to working within a broader
   range of systems. With clear signals of climate change occurring in the
   Arctic and greater changes anticipated in the future, there is good
   reason to accelerate estuarine research efforts in the region. In
   particular, elucidating estuarine dynamics across the near-shore to
   ocean-wide domains is vital for understanding potential climate impacts
   on local ecosystems as well as broader climate feedbacks associated with
   storage and release of fresh water and carbon.},

Abstract = {The upper millimeters of sediments are considered major locations of
   microbial colonization and activity. The goal of our study was to
   investigate variations of microbial communities in the uppermost
   sediment layers of the coastal Baltic Sea with emphasis on the complex
   interplay between microbiology and physico-chemical sediment properties.
   We selected a high-resolution methodological approach that combined the
   cryolanding sampling technique (spatial resolution of 250 mu m) with
   microsensor-, spectrophotometric and microscopic analyses. While the
   oxygen penetration depths in dark conditions ranged from 1.4 mm to 2.6
   mm during the study period, this zone expanded by about 1 mm in light
   and could be divided into three micro-horizons: (i) an upper zone with a
   high net O-2 production, (ii) an intermediate zone with increased O-2
   consumption on account of light-stimulated respiration and (iii) a lower
   zone with lower O-2 consumption. Time-series experiments revealed a
   rapid response of the benthic microbial community to altered light
   intensities. In May and July, the net O-2 budget in the porewater of
   sediments was positive within 35 and 22 min after illumination,
   respectively, whereas in June O-2 production exceeded O-2 consumption
   after 112 min. The thickness of the O-2 production and O-2 consumption
   micro-zones decreased from May to July coinciding with an increase in
   temperature. In May, sites of enhanced O-2 consumption were closely
   associated with subsurface maxima of microbial numbers and enzymatic
   activities indicating a tight coupling between photoautotrophic and
   heterotrophic processes between 1- and 2-mm depth. In June and July, the
   microbial abundance and enzymatic activity hardly varied with depth.
   Spatial and temporal microheterogeneity of microbial distribution and
   activity in O-2 gradients was seen as a reflection of the complex
   interplay between microbiology and physico-chemical sediment properties.},

Abstract = {Extreme climatic events can reshape the functional structure of
   ecological communities, potentially altering ecological interactions and
   ecosystem functioning. While these shifts have been widely documented,
   evidence of their persistence and potential flow-on effects on ecosystem
   structure following relaxation of extreme events remains limited. Here,
   we investigate changes in the functional trait structure - encompassing
   dimensions of resource use, thermal affinity, and body size - of
   herbivorous fishes in a temperate reef system that experienced an
   extreme marine heatwave (MHW) and subsequent return to cool conditions.
   We quantify how changes in the trait structure modified the nature and
   intensity of herbivory-related functions (macroalgae, turf, and sediment
   removal), and explored the potential flow-on effects on the recovery
   dynamics of macroalgal foundation species. The trait structure of the
   herbivorous fish assemblage shifted as a result of the MHW, from
   dominance of cool-water browsing species to increased evenness in the
   distribution of abundance among temperate and tropical guilds supporting
   novel herbivory roles (i.e. scraping, cropping, and sediment sucking).
   Despite the abundance of tropical herbivorous fishes and intensity of
   herbivory-related functions declined following a period of cooling after
   the MHW, the underlying trait structure displayed limited recovery.
   Concomitantly, algal assemblages displayed a lack of recovery of the
   formerly dominant foundational species, the kelp Ecklonia radiata,
   transitioning to an alternative state dominated by turf and Sargassum
   spp. Our study demonstrates a legacy effect of an extreme MHW and
   exemplified the value of monitoring phenotypic (trait mediated) changes
   in the nature of core ecosystem processes to predict and adapt to the
   future configurations of changing reef ecosystems.},

Title = {Alternative neutralisation materials for acid mine drainage treatment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {46-58},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study reports the novel use of alkaline waste material from the
   alumina refining industry (Bayer liquor and precipitates formed by the
   seawater neutralisation of Bayer liquor), for the neutralisation of acid
   mine drainage (AMD) water. The hypothesis was that utilization of waste
   to treat waste can potentially result in environmental and economic
   benefits. The performance of Bayer liquor and Bayer precipitate was
   compared with conventional alkalis used for AMD neutralisation such as
   lime (Ca(OH)(2)), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and sodium carbonate
   (Na2CO3). Target ions to remove from the AMD solution included Al (1233
   mg/L), Cu (77.26 mg/L), Fe (16.7 mg/L), Ni (1.54 mg/L), Mn (161.5 mg/L)
   and Zn (48.89 mg/L)). Both alumina industry wastes were shown to produce
   treated water with acceptable discharge limits for all metals except Mn.
   Nevertheless, Bayer precipitate was shown to have an enhanced ability to
   remove manganese at lower pH (6.5-7.5) relative to lime, with residual
   Mn concentrations of 32.30 and 85.40 mg/L, respectively. Manganese
   discharge limits were challenging to meet due to pH values > 9 being
   required wherein not only aluminium species redissolved but also the pH
   was not compatible with discharge regulations. Mechanistically, larger
   precipitates were found to positively influence the removal of heavy
   metals, with lime and Bayer precipitates forming the largest
   precipitates. Overall, Bayer precipitate was found to be a potential
   alternative for the treatment of AMD water.},

Title = {Silviculture in Forested Wetlands: Summary of Current Forest Operations,
   Potential Effects, and Long-Term Experiments},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {21-36},

Abstract = {Bottomland hardwoods (BLH) and wet mineral flats (WMF) are common
   forested wetlands in the southeastern U.S. coastal plain (Virginia to
   Texas) that are often manipulated silviculturally, yet silvicultural
   forest operations are infrequently reported. This document summarizes
   forest operations in wetlands, consolidates reviews of silvicultural
   effects, and summarizes long-term research. BLH typically receive lower
   intensity management. Forest operations involve planning silvicultural
   operations and adapting harvest operations to wet site conditions.
   Clearcutting with natural regeneration is favored for BLH, but
   alternative silvicultural systems may be viable options, depending on
   stand characteristics and landowner objectives. WMF are frequently
   managed intensively as pine plantations. Following clearcut harvests,
   WMF may be mechanically and chemically site-prepared and planted.
   Intermediate silvicultural operations may include chemical competition
   control, fertilization, prescribed burning, and thinning operations.
   Reviews of effects in forested wetlands indicate wet-site harvesting can
   cause significant soil disturbances. Long-term research on effects of
   harvest disturbances on BLH and WMF are limited, but indicate effects of
   wet site harvests are ephemeral and sites recover due to natural factors
   and artificial amelioration. Overall, silvicultural operations in these
   forested wetlands are compatible with long-term sustainability when
   appropriate silvicultural systems, forest operations, and forestry best
   management practices (BMPs) are applied.},

Abstract = {The Yellow River Delta is one of the most abundant offshore energy areas
   in China, and the construction of offshore projects is rapidly
   developing. In this paper, four typical regions of the Yellow River
   Delta in different periods were selected as research objects. In-situ
   cone penetration tests (CPTs), geotechnical testing, electron microscope
   scanning testing, and soil type indexing (I-c) was used to classify and
   identify the soil layers. At the same time, a modified calculation model
   based on CPT for the shear wave velocity of fine-grained seabed soil was
   sought and verified with the measured values. The results showed that:
   (1) the obtained soil layers are mainly classified by clay and silty
   soil, which is in line with the conclusions of previous scholars on the
   classification of the Yellow River Delta soil layer. (2) The measured
   shear wave velocity is generally between 100 m/s and 250 m/s, and it
   gradually increases with depth. (3) The depth, cone resistance, and soil
   behavior index are directly related to the calculation of the shear wave
   velocity in this area. (4) Discrete analysis of measured and calculated
   shear wave velocity provides theoretical support for the change of shear
   wave velocity under different conditions.},

Abstract = {Microbial mats are common in polar streams and often dominate benthic
   biomass. Climate change may be enhancing the variability of stream flows
   in the Antarctic, but so far studies investigating mat responses to
   disturbance have been limited in this region. Mat regrowth was evaluated
   following disturbance by experimentally scouring rocks from an ephemeral
   McMurdo Dry Valley stream over two summers (2001-02 and 2012-13). Mats
   were sampled at the beginning and resampled at the end of the flow
   season. In 2012-13, mats were additionally resampled mid-season along
   with previously undisturbed controls. In 2001-02 rocks regained 47\% of
   chlorophyll a and 40\% of ash-free dry mass by the end of the summer,
   while in 2012-13 rocks regrew 18\% and 27\%, respectively. Mat
   stoichiometry differed between summers, and reflected differences in
   biomass and discharge. Oscillatoria spp. were greatest on scoured rocks
   and Phormidium spp. on undisturbed rocks. Small diatoms Humidophila and
   Fistulifera spp. increased throughout the summer in all mats, with the
   latter more abundant in scoured communities. Collectively, these data
   suggest that mats are variable intra-annually, responsive to hydrology
   and require multiple summers to regrow initial biomass once lost. These
   results will aid the interpretation of long-term data, as well as inform
   Antarctic Specially Managed Area protocols.},

Title = {Numerical Characterization of Viscous Heat Dissipation Rate in
   Oscillatory Air Flow},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {142},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The effect of viscous heat dissipation (VHD) in raising the temperature
   field of incompressible oscillatory air flow is studied numerically. A
   threshold is established for when the viscous heat dissipation term in
   the thermal energy equation changes or does not change the temperature
   field for the case of oscillatory air flow in a tube connecting two
   reservoirs. This new criterion has not been specified clearly in earlier
   oscillatory flow research. According to the defined threshold and when
   VHD is important, the effect of dissipative bulk heating can be
   described by a proposed correlation in terms of Womersley number (Wo)
   and axial tidal displacement (Delta Z) of the oscillatory fluid. These
   results are determined using two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulations
   of laminar oscillatory air flow (Pr=0.7) for different adiabatic
   unconductive tube-reservoirs' systems configurations over a wide range
   of oscillatory frequencies and tidal displacements. It is found that the
   low amount of fluid kinetic energy, which is converted into internal
   energy, is not sufficient to significantly heat up the fluid at a low
   rate of the viscous work. Therefore, the effect of viscous heat
   dissipation in oscillatory air flow can be ignored only below a specific
   limit of unsteadiness depending on Womersley number and axial tidal
   displacement. Also, the results showed that the VHD becomes more
   significant with increasing (Wo) and (Delta Z).},

Title = {Dolomitization of the Miocene carbonates in Gebel Abu Shaar El Qiblie

Abstract = {The shallow marine Miocene carbonates of Gebel Abu Shaar El Qiblie and
   Salum escarpment, Egypt have been extensively dolomitized. Different
   dolomite textures are identified in the two areas: mimic replacive
   dolomite with uni- to polymodal size distribution and high preservation
   of the grain fabrics, non-mimic replacive crystalline dolomite with
   relatively uniform crystal size distribution, and partial dolomitization
   with polymodal size distribution and planar crystal boundaries. Minor
   cavity-filling dolomite cement is also observed. The development of
   non-planar crystal boundaries, stoichiometric characteristic, Sr content
   (92-245 ppm), negative delta O-18 values (-9.34 to 1.59 aEuro degrees)
   of Abu Shaar dolomites and their association with Fe-Mn ore deposits
   suggest that these dolomites formed from partial recrystallization and
   modification of early formed normal marine dolomites by the influence of
   hydrothermal fluid evolved during rifting of Red Sea. However,
   recrystallization by freshwater-dominated fluid during meteoric water
   diagenesis can be supposed. Alternatively, the non-stoichiometric
   composition, delta O-18 values (2.15-3.19 aEuro degrees) of marine
   signature and Sr content (73-204 ppm) of Salum dolomites indicate that
   dolomitization was probably mediated by seawater or slightly modified
   seawater within the subtidal zone during early stage of diagenesis. The
   delta C-13 values (-1.03 to 0.7 aEuro degrees for Abu Shaar, and -0.23
   to 1.69 aEuro degrees for Salum dolomites) reflect normal marine-derived
   carbon source and are probably inherited from the precursor marine
   limestones. The negative values of some Abu Shaar dolomites may be
   attributed to minimal contribution of carbon derived from soil-derived
   CO2 or from oxidation of methane derived from deep hydrocarbon reservoir
   via fractures during rifting of Red Sea.},

Title = {Effect of Reinforcement on Compacting Characteristics of
   Aluminum/10-Al2O3/Fly Ash Metal Matrix Composite},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aluminum metal matrix composites are attractive and effective materials
   because of their unique properties. These properties include high
   specific strength, light weight, high specific stiffness, excellent wear
   resistance, good corrosion resistance, and greater elastic modulus
   compared with the base alloy. They are used in aerospace, automotive,
   marine, mining, and mechanical structures. Fly ash, an inexpensive waste
   by-product obtained after the combustion of coal in thermal power
   plants, is considered as a reinforcement particle in the present study.
   The aim is to investigate the effect of fly ash in Al-10 weight
   percentage (wt\%) aluminum oxide (Al2O3) metal matrix composites using
   statistical optimization techniques. One factor and Taguchi approaches
   are used in planning and designing the experiments. Al/10 wt\% Al2O3
   with 0, 5, 10, and 15 wt\% fly ash composites are prepared with the
   powder metallurgy technique at 300, 400, and 500 MPa compaction pressure
   with 90, 120, and 150-mu m fly ash particle sizes. The wt\% of fly ash,
   compaction pressure, and particle size are the process parameters.
   Performance parameters such as ejection force and green density,
   hardness, and compressive strength are considered. The ejection force
   and green density decreased with the increase in the weight percent of
   fly ash. Hardness increased with the increase in fly ash content.
   Compressive strength increased with the increase in fly ash up to 5 wt\%
   and subsequently decreased.},

Title = {Assessing model parameter uncertainties for rising velocity of CO2
   droplets through experimental design},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {283-289},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The risk and environmental impact assessments required for geological
   CO2 storage projects will have to rely on different types of numerical
   models, which will have to be calibrated and validated against
   measurements. Available measurements from ongoing demonstration projects
   are limited, hence it is necessary to turn to analog processes or
   laboratory experiments to estimate model parameters. In any case,
   parameter estimates will have uncertainties that will be important to
   assess when predicting future scenarios.
   We study a model for the rise velocity of droplets in the ocean, an
   important process sub-model for simulating gas seeps into marine waters.
   As the origin we use the parameters estimation study by Bigalke et al.
   (2010) based on a tank experiment. We illustrate how Linearized
   Covariance Analysis (LCA) can be used to assess the parameter
   uncertainties, and how to design a similar experiment that reduces these
   uncertainties. The linearity assumption underlying LCA is assessed using
   curvature measures. It is shown that up to similar to 63\% reduction in
   uncertainties is achieved by choosing the right droplet size
   distribution; by extending the range of droplet sizes to include larger
   droplets the uncertainties are reduced by another similar to 88\%. (c)

Title = {Modelling the response of stable water isotopes in Greenland
   precipitation to orbital configurations of the previous interglacial},
Journal = {TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {66},
Abstract = {The relation between delta O-18 of precipitation and temperature has
   been used in numerous studies to reconstruct past temperatures at ice
   core sites in Greenland and Antarctica. During the past two decades, it
   has become clear that the slope between delta O-18 and temperature
   varies in both space and time. Here, we use a general circulation model
   driven by changes in orbital parameters to investigate the Greenland
   delta O-18-temperature relation for the previous interglacial, the
   Eemian. In our analysis, we focus on changes in the moisture source
   regions, and the results underline the importance of taking the
   seasonality of climate change into account. The orbitally driven
   experiments show that continental evaporation over North America
   increases during summer in the warm parts of the Eemian, while marine
   evaporation decreases. This likely flattens the Greenland delta O-18
   response to temperature during summer. Since the main climate change in
   the experiments occurs during summer this adds to a limited response of
   delta O-18, which is more strongly tied to temperature during winter
   than during summer. A south-west to north-east gradient in the delta
   O-18-temperature slope is also evident for Greenland, with low slopes in
   the south-west and steeper slopes in the north-east. This probably
   reflects the proportion of continental moisture and Arctic moisture
   arriving in Greenland, with more continental moisture in the south-west
   and less in the north-east, and vice versa for the Arctic moisture.},

Title = {The wind-wave tunnel test of a tension-leg platform type floating
   offshore wind turbine},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In this work, a tension-leg platform (TLP) type floating offshore wind
   turbine (FOWT) system was proposed, which was based on the National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MW offshore wind turbine model. Taking the
   coupled effect of dynamic response of the top wind turbine, support
   tower structure, and lower mooring system into consideration, the 1/60
   scale model test for investigating the coupled wind-wave effect on
   performance of the floating wind turbine system was done in Harbin
   Institute of Technology's wind tunnel and wave flume joint laboratory.
   In addition, numerical simulations corresponding to the scale model
   tests have been performed by advanced numerical tools. The results of
   model tests and numerical simulations have a good agreement, so the
   availability of the numerical model has been verified. Furthermore, to
   improve the performance of the TLP system, one tentative strategy adding
   mooring lines to the TLP system was proposed, and the model test results
   of the two TLP systems were compared with each other. As a result, the
   motion responses of the floating platform and the force levels of
   tension legs were effectively reduced by the additional mooring chains.
   The new TLP FOWT system might play an active and instructive role in the
   development of future FOWT system. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Title = {The effect of Fe and Al substitution on the compressibility of
   MgSiO3-perovskite determined through single-crystal X-ray diffraction},
Journal = {PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {173},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A compressibility study on three well characterized single crystals of
   magnesium silicate perovskite containing variable proportions of iron
   and aluminium has been carried out using X-ray diffraction in a diamond
   anvil cell in order to access the effect of varying chemical composition
   on perovskite elastic properties. The single crystals were synthesized
   using a multianvil apparatus at 25 GPa and 1800-2000 degrees C. It was
   found that the substitution of Fe2+ for Mg2+ in Al-bearing perovskite
   increases the ambient pressure unit-cell volume to a larger extent than
   when the same substitution occurs in Al-free perovskite. Equation of
   state measurements were performed up to pressures of 9 GPa at room
   temperature. With increasing Fe and Al incorporation perovskite exhibits
   a modest increase in compressibility compared to MgSiO3-perovskite over
   the pressure range investigated. A 3rd order Birch-Murnaghan equation of
   state fit to the compression data indicates that the bulk modulus (K-0),
   decreases from 243 to 234 GPa while K' increases from 5.0 to 6.3 as the
   Fe and Al contents increase from approximately 5 to 17 and from 2 to 8
   wt.\%, respectively. The high values of K' will result in Fe-Al-bearing
   perovskites becoming less compressible than MgSiO3 perovskite at
   pressures > 10 GPa. Extrapolating these results to lower mantle
   conditions indicates a pronounced effect of composition on density in
   the upper portions of lower mantle, with perovskites formed in subducted
   oceanic crust, i.e. with higher Fe and Al contents, being substantially
   denser than those formed within a primitive mantle composition. This
   density contrast diminishes, however, with increasing pressure, which
   also contributes to a stronger dependence of bulk sound velocity on
   composition towards the base of the lower mantle. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The resonant interaction of surface and internal waves produces a
   nonlinear mechanism for energy transfer among wave components in oceans,
   lakes, and estuaries. In many field situations, the stratification may
   be well approximated by a two-layer fluid with a diffuse interface. The
   growth and damping rates of sub-harmonic interfacial waves generated by
   a surface wave through a three-wave resonant interaction are measured in
   the laboratory. These measurements are compared with theoretical
   predictions. A diffuse interface reduces the damping rate and increases
   the growth rate. The predicted growth rate provides excellent comparison
   with the laboratory measurements. The inclusion of the effects of a
   diffuse interface significantly improve the comparison.},

Abstract = {We measured field abundances, feeding rates, swimming behavior, and
   particle colonization of two harpacticoids, the pelagic Microsetella
   norvegica and the semibenthic Amonardia normanni, to examine (1) if
   aggregates have a significant role in harpacticoid nutrition and (2) if
   harpacticoids contribute significantly to aggregate degradation. Neither
   of the harpacticoids was able to feed efficiently on suspended food,
   while both grazed well on attached food, indicating that pelagic
   harpacticoids depend on food attached to surfaces, such as those offered
   by marine aggregates. We estimated that the two harpacticoids are able
   to search substantial volumes of water for aggregates (up to 1.2 L
   d(-1)), and that during bloom conditions in the North Sea, reported
   aggregate concentrations allow M. norvegica to daily encounter about
   three aggregates. High short-term hunger-induced feeding rates observed
   in A. normanni indicate that at least some harpacticoid species can fill
   their gut during few short visits to aggregates. Harpacticoids may cause
   substantial degradation of aggregates of < 1 cm (5-100\%) when their
   abundance exceeds 10(5) m(-2), which is not atypical during summer in
   temperate waters.},

Abstract = {Today's rate of fossil fuel consumption rapidly depletes fuel reserves
   and leads to a number of adverse environmental effects. Although the
   scope of these effects has yet to be fully realized, it is clear that
   the development of alternative energy sources is very important. A
   relatively new form of alternative energy known as reverse
   electrodialysis (RED) appears to be one of the promising energy sources
   of the future. This technology harvests the energy stored in the
   salinity gradient between two different liquids, and converts it
   directly into electric power. This power is generated by pumping water
   through an array of alternating pairs of cation and anion exchange
   membranes called cells. Various academic sources calculate the available
   energy to be 1.5 MJ for every cubic meter of sea and river water mixed,
   making all river basins a potential location for power production.
   Small prototype systems using 50 cells with areas of 100 cm(2) were
   assembled by a group in the Netherlands, but larger stacks remain to be
   tested. An understanding of the feasibility of RED as a possible energy
   source relies on testing of cells with larger membrane area and
   different numbers of membrane pairs. An experimental system was designed
   with cells 61 cm x 16.5 cm, which will increase the output by nearly a
   factor of 10. Along with having much larger dimensions than previous
   systems, the design has an adjustable number of cells in the stack,
   allowing users obtain test results at a variety of settings. Comparing
   the output of systems with few cells to systems with many cells will
   help us to optimize the stack size in terms of hydrodynamic losses.
   Initial testing of the system resulted in a positive result. The tests
   showed that the system produced power, and the 1.98 volts measured was
   83\% of the predicted value. Leakage of the electrode rinse solution
   contaminated the membranes, and prevented more testing. Once the
   electrode rinse system is redesigned, more testing will be done.},

Abstract = {Understanding the synergies between the Urban Heat Island (ICU)
   phenomenon and one of the extreme climatic events such as heat waves has
   become one of the great challenges of society that seeks to improve the
   quality of life. In this research, the Terrestrial Surface Temperature
   (TST) and the Urban Surface Heat Island (ICUS) have been determined
   using Sentinel-3 images of the city of Granada (Spain) during the months
   of July and August of the years 2019 and 2020. The purpose is to
   determine the possible synergies between both phenomena in an area
   classified as highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Using
   the Data Panel statistical analysis method, multivariate relationships
   were obtained during the heat wave periods. The results obtained, in
   line with previous research, indicate that TST and ICUS are intensified
   under heat wave conditions (Daytime: TST=2.2 degrees C and ICUS=0.2
   degrees C; Nighttime: TST=4.4 degrees C and ICUS= 0.3 degrees C) and
   there are relationships between ICUS and wind direction and solar
   radiation that intensify in periods of heat wave.},

Abstract = {Tidal creeks have attracted considerable attention in estuary wetland
   conservation and restoration with diverse micro-habitats and high
   hydrological connectivity. Bacterial communities act effectively as
   invisible engines to regulate nutrient element biogeochemical processes.
   However, few studies have unveiled the bacterial community structures
   and diversities of micro-habitats soils on the tidal creek section. Our
   study selected three sections cross a tidal creek with obviously
   belt-like habitats ``pluff mudflat - bare mudflat - Tamarix chinensis
   community - T. chinensis-Suaeda salsa community- S. salsa community{''}
   in the Yellow River estuarine wetland. Based on soil samples, we
   dissected and untangled the bacterial community structures and special
   bacterial taxa of different habitats on the tidal creek section. The
   results showed that bacterial community structures and dominant
   bacterial taxa were significantly different in the five habitats. The
   bacterial community diversities significantly decreased with distance
   away from tidal creeks, as well as the dominant bacteria Flavobacteriia
   and delta-Proteobacteria, but in reverse to Bacteroidetes and
   Gemmatimonadetes. Moreover, the important biomarkers sulfate-reducing
   bacteria and photosynthetic bacteria were different distributions within
   the five habitats, which were closely associated with the sulfur and
   carbon cycles. We found that the bacterial communities were
   heterogeneous in different micro-habitats on the tidal creek section,
   which was related to soil salinity, moisture, and nutrients as well as
   tidal action. The study would provide fundamental insights into
   understanding the ecological functions of bacterial diversities and
   biogeochemical processes influenced by tidal creeks.},

Abstract = {Within a landscape developed on the deeply weathered, dominantly
   granitic rocks of the Yilgarn Craton in southwestern Australia, there is
   strong evidence of prior aeolian activity. Multiple arrays of clayey
   saltation deposits occur as clay dunes or lunettes extending up to 5 km
   to the southeast of playas, and quartzose sand dunes and sheets occur in
   a 2-km wide band that extends 10 km southeast of an ephemeral creek
   line. Parabolic dunes Occur within some clayey lunettes. The parallel
   orientation of these diverse features and the elliptical shape of the
   playas suggest that the winds that have created these geomorphic
   entities have been from the northwest. Multiple lunette arrays with up
   to seven members have not been previously reported in this region.
   There is evidence for a more widespread, but more subtle, aeolian
   influence on the soils. Dust deposits appear to mantle parts of the
   landscape and are inferred to be coeval with the clayey saltation
   deposits. Although these do not occur as a discrete layer, evidence
   includes a plume of calcareous and illitic soils southeast of the major
   playa, in a landscape otherwise characterised by acidic, kaolinitic
   soils. Similarly, the occurrence of deep sandy soils on many slopes with
   a southeasterly aspect may indicate the interference of topography on
   the transport of saltating sands during an and climatic phase. The
   presence of such aeolian deposits has implications for agricultural
   management, mineral exploration and the interpretation of ecological
   gradients in similar undisturbed landscapes.
   Current desertification, in the form of salinization and wind erosion,
   has precedence in this landscape. The aeolian deposits provide a means
   of interpreting landscape-scale responses to previous climate change and
   a key to predicting possible outcomes of both desertification and future
   climate change. Assuming that Bowler's theory that clay dunes require an
   adjacent salinized playa bed to form is correct, the arrays of clayey
   lunettes together with vegetated former playas indicate that the
   landscape has undergone Multiple cycles of salinization and recovery.
   The lunettes may thus provide a means of predicting landscape
   hydrological responses to the widespread removal of natural vegetation
   for fanning. Dating of the various sequences is required to provide a
   time scale for these landscape processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The impact of the cyclonic activity can be measured based on annual
   frequency, maximum sustained intensity, landfall, duration, surge
   height, accumulated cyclone energy and power dissipative index of
   cyclones. `Power dissipative index' (PDI) is function of duration,
   frequency and maximum sustained intensity of cyclone (Emanuel 2005). PDI
   can represent the cyclonic threat better than storm frequency or
   intensity alone as PDI measures the cyclonic energy dissipation over the
   basin during a cyclonic event (Emanuel, 2005). PDI of the tropical
   cyclone over the North Atlantic Ocean basin was related to the climate
   change by correlating the PDI to sea surface temperature (SST) (Emanuel,
   2005). In the present study, an attempt has been made to establish a
   correlation between the climate change and the cyclonic activities in
   the North Indian Ocean (NIO) basin. The PDI over the North Indian Ocean
   basin and individually over Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal basins were
   calculated. The PDIs over these basins were correlated to SST obtained
   from the HadISST1 dataset for these basins. An increasing trend in the
   SST and tropical cyclone PDI was observed for the past 30 year time
   period in the North Atlantic Ocean basin by Emanuel (2005). A similar
   analysis of the cyclonic activity over the North Indian Ocean basin is
   carried out with the help of available best-tracks of the cyclones from
   Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) for a period of 23 years
   (1990-2013). The SST was calculated on temporal period as annual,
   pre-monsoon and post-monsoon period for study basins. Correlation
   coefficients for the SSTs over these temporal periods and the PDI of
   basins were obtained. It was concluded from the study that the SST was
   not sufficient to establish the changing climate for the cyclonic
   activities in NIO region for the future. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {River warming poses an existential threat to many Pacific salmon
   (Oncorhynchus spp) populations. However, temperature-mediated risks to
   salmon are often complex and addressing them requires species-and
   population specific data collected over large spatial and temporal
   scales. In this study, we combined radiotelemetry with archival depth
   and temperature sensors to collect continuous thermal exposure histories
   of 21 adult spring-and summer-run Chinook salmon (0. tshawytscha) as
   they migrated hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Columbia River
   basin. Salmon thermal histories in impounded reaches of the Columbia and
   Snake rivers were characterized by low daily temperature variation but
   frequent and extensive vertical movements. Dives were associated with
   slightly cooler salmon body temperatures (similar to 0.01 to 0.02 C/m),
   but there was no evidence for use of cool-water thermal refuges deep in
   reservoirs or at tributary confluences along the migration route. In
   tributaries, salmon were constrained to relatively shallow water, and
   they experienced similar to 2-5 degrees C diel temperature fluctuations.
   Differences in migration timing and among route-specific thermal regimes
   resulted in substantial among-individual variation in migration
   temperature exposure. Bioenergetics models using the collected thermal
   histories and swim speeds ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 body-lengths/s
   predicted median energetic costs of similar to 24-40\% (spring-run) and
   37-60\% (summer-run) of initial reserves. Median declines in total mass
   were similar to 16-24\% for spring-run salmon and similar to 19-29\% for
   summer-run salmon. A simulated + 2 degrees C increase in water
   temperatures resulted in 4.0\% (spring-run) and 6.3\% (summer-run) more
   energy used per fish, on average. The biotelemetry data provided
   remarkable spatial and temporal resolution on thermal exposure.
   Nonetheless, substantial information gaps remain for the development of
   robust bioenergetics and climate effects models for adult Chinook
   salmon.},

Abstract = {The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) was applied to the Australian
   North-West Shelf (NWS) to hindcast the ocean response to four intense
   historical tropical cyclones (TCs). While the four cyclones had very
   different trajectories across the NWS, all passed within 150 km of a
   long-term vertical mooring located on the continental shelf in 125 m
   depth. The observed ocean response at this relatively shallow, Southern
   Hemisphere shelf site was characterized by the development of a peak in
   the counter-clockwise (CCW) near-inertial kinetic energy, mixed layer
   deepening, and subsequent restratification. Strong near-inertial
   isotherm oscillations were also observed following two of the cyclones.
   ROMS reproduced these features and also showed that the peak in the
   near-inertial CCW kinetic energy was observed on the left side of each
   cyclone trajectory. The time rate of change of near-inertial kinetic
   energy depended strongly on the storm Rossby number, i.e., defined based
   on the storm speed, the storm length scale, and the Coriolis frequency.
   The shallow water depth on the NWS resulted in first, a more rapid decay
   of near-inertial oscillations than in the deep ocean, and second a
   generation efficiency (the ratio of near-inertial power to the rate of
   wind work) of up to 10\%, smaller than found for cyclones propagating
   across deeper water. The total energy put into near-inertial motions is
   nevertheless large compared to the background tidal energy. The rapid
   decay of near-inertial motions emphasizes the importance of frictional
   effects in characterizing the response to cyclone forcing in shallow
   seas.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal characterization of long-term solar resource using
   spatial functional data analysis: Understanding the variability and

Abstract = {Understanding the spatio-temporal variability of the solar resource is
   crucial to effectively support solar power utilization. Unfortunately,
   long-term and high-resolved measurements of solar irradiance are
   generally scarce, challenging the characterization for larger areas. In
   this paper, we propose a methodology to characterize the spatio-temporal
   variability of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a regional scale
   using long-term satellite-derived data. Spatial functional data analysis
   (sFDA) is used to identify areas with similar intra-annual variability
   patterns. The methodology is applied to a 21-year period data on Ecuador
   retrieved from the National Solar Radiation Database. Being the first
   time that sFDA is used for this purpose, the results indicate that it
   provides an appropriate basis for the interannual variability and
   complementarity analyses. In Ecuador's mainland, twenty-two subregions
   with four seasonal patterns are identified. The highest GHI potential
   (5.4 kWhm(-2)d(-1)) with the lowest variability (3.4\%) is found in the
   Inter-Andean valleys. Further, seasonal complementarities between the
   coast and western Andes are identified. In Galapagos, high values are
   found over all islands (>= 4.8 kWhm(-2)d(-1)), characterized by three
   subregions with one seasonal pattern. Our findings provide the first
   comprehensive spatio-temporal characterization of GHI in Ecuador, which
   aims at supporting a sustainable energy transition in the country. (C)

Title = {Identification of linear response functions from arbitrary perturbation
   experiments in the presence of noise - Part 2: Application to the land
   carbon cycle in the MPI Earth System Model},

Abstract = {The response function identification method introduced in the first part
   of this study is applied here to investigate the land carbon cycle in
   the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model. We identify
   from standard C4MIP 1 \% experiments the linear response functions that
   generalize the land carbon sensitivities beta and gamma. The
   identification of these generalized sensitivities is shown to be robust
   by demonstrating their predictive power when applied to experiments not
   used for their identification. The linear regime for which the
   generalized framework is valid is estimated, and approaches to improve
   the quality of the results are proposed. For the generalized gamma
   sensitivity, the response is found to be linear for temperature
   perturbations until at least 6 K. When this sensitivity is identified
   from a 2xCO(2) experiment instead of the 1 \% experiment, its predictive
   power improves, indicating an enhancement in the quality of the
   identification. For the generalized beta sensitivity, the linear regime
   is found to extend up to CO2 perturbations of 100 ppm. We find that
   nonlinearities in the beta response arise mainly from the nonlinear
   relationship between net primary production and CO2. By taking as
   forcing the resulting net primary production instead of CO2, the
   response is approximately linear until CO2 perturbations of about 850
   ppm. Taking net primary production as forcing also substantially
   improves the spectral resolution of the generalized beta sensitivity.
   For the best recovery of this sensitivity, we find a spectrum of
   internal timescales with two peaks, at 4 and 100 years. Robustness of
   this result is demonstrated by two independent tests. We find that the
   two-peak spectrum can be explained by the different characteristic
   timescales of functionally different elements of the land carbon cycle.
   The peak at 4 years results from the collective response of carbon pools
   whose dynamics is governed by fast processes, namely pools representing
   living vegetation tissues (leaves, fine roots, sugars, and starches) and
   associated litter. The peak at 100 years results from the collective
   response of pools whose dynamics is determined by slow processes, namely
   the pools that represent the wood in stem and coarse roots, the
   associated litter, and the soil carbon (humus). Analysis of the response
   functions that characterize these two groups of pools shows that the
   pools with fast dynamics dominate the land carbon response only for
   times below 2 years. For times above 25 years the response is completely
   determined by the pools with slow dynamics. From 100 years onwards only
   the humus pool contributes to the land carbon response.},

Title = {Lessons from seru production on manufacturing competitively in a high

Abstract = {High capital and labor costs, coupled with high rates of technological
   and competitive change, present challenges for manufacturers in
   developed countries, often spurring them to offshore production to low
   cost sources. However, the electronics industry provides an exception to
   this trend, where dynamic, high cost conditions have given rise to a new
   production system - seru - a cellular assembly approach. Seru evolved as
   an alternative to lean systems approaches, manifesting important
   differentiated system design choices that appear to offer promise for
   manufacturing in dynamic, high-cost markets. This paper reports the
   results of in-depth, longitudinal case studies of two electronics giants
   who have implemented seru. The case studies describe seru's fundamental
   extensions to, and departures from, lean production, agile production,
   and group technology-based cellular manufacturing. We explain how Sony
   and Canon have applied sent to improve productivity, quality, and
   flexibility in ways that have enabled them to remain competitive. In
   addition, our findings elaborate the theory of swift, even flow, with
   implications for future research of trade-offs related to production
   efficiency, responsiveness, and competitiveness in high-cost,
   technologically dynamic markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {There are many external influences that may control the path that
   nuclear power deployment follows. In the next 50 years several events
   may unfold. Fear of the consequences of the greenhouse effect may
   produce a carbon tax that would make nuclear power economically superior
   very quickly. This, in turn, would increase the rate at which uranium
   reserves diminish due to the increased rate of nuclear power deployment.
   However, breakthroughs in the extraction of uranium from the sea of
   deployment of fast breeder reactors would greatly extend the uranium
   reserves and, as well, utilize the thorium cycle.
   On the other hand, carbon sequestering technology breakthroughs could
   keep fossil fuels dominant for the remainder of the century. Nuclear
   power may only then continue, as today, in a lesser role or even
   diminish. Fusion power or new developments in solar power could
   completely displace nuclear power as we know it today.
   Even more difficult to predict is when the demand for mobile fuel for
   transportation will develop such that hydrogen and hydrogen rich fuel
   cells will be in common use. When this happens, nuclear power may be the
   energy source of choice to produce this fuel from water or methane. In a
   similar vein, the demand for potable and irrigation water may be another
   driver for the advent of increased deployment of nuclear power.
   With all these possibilities of events that could happen it appears
   impossible to predict with any certainty which path nuclear power
   deployment may take. However, it is necessary to define a strategy that
   is flexible enough to insure that when a technology is needed, it is
   ready to be deployed.
   For the next few decades there will be an evolutionary improvement in
   the performance of uranium oxide and mixed uranium oxide-plutonium oxide
   (MOX) LWR fuels. These improvements will be market driven to keep the
   cost of fuel and the resulting cost of nuclear power electricity as
   competitive as possible. The development of fuels for accelerator
   transmutation and for reactor transmutation with inert matrix fuels is
   in its infancy. A great deal of research has been initiated in a number
   of countries, which has been summarized in recent conferences. In Europe
   the work on these fuels is directed at the same problem as their
   utilization of MOX; namely to reduce the inventory of separated
   plutonium, minor actinides, and Long Lived Fission Products (LLFP). In
   the United States there is no reprocessing and thus no inventory of
   separated civilian plutonium. However, in the United States there is a
   resistance to a permanent spent fuel repository and thus accelerator
   transmutation presents a possible alternative. If nuclear power does
   have a long-term future, then the introduction of the fast reactor is
   inevitable. Included in the mission of the fast reactors would be the
   elimination of the inventory of separated plutonium while generating
   useful energy. The work that is ongoing now on the development of fuel
   concepts for assemblies that, contain actinides and LLFP would be useful
   for fast reactor transmutation.
   There is still a great deal of work required to bring the fast breeder
   reactor option to maturity. Fortunately there is perhaps a fifty-year
   period to accomplish this work before fast breeders are necessary. With
   regard to fast reactor fuel development, future work should be
   considered in three stages. First, all the information obtained over the
   past forty years of fast reactor fuel development should be completely
   documented in a manner that future generations can readily retrieve and
   utilize the information. Fast reactor development came to such an abrupt
   halt world-wide that a great deal of information is in danger of being
   lost because most of the researchers and facilities are rapidly
   disappearing. Secondly, for all of the existing fast reactor fuels, and
   this includes, oxides, carbides, nitrides, and metallic fuels, the
   evolutionary work was far from being completed. Although mixed oxide
   fuels were probably the furthest advanced, there were many concepts for
   improved claddings and advanced fabrication methods that were never
   fully explored. Finally, with such an extended period before fast
   reactors are needed there is ample time for truly innovative fuels to be
   developed that are capable of performing over a wide range of conditions
   and coolants. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   activities decreased with time since available organic compounds
   decreased. A good correlation among enzyme activities and different

Abstract = {Observations of the depth integrated and time averaged sediment
   transport on a mixed sand and gravel (MSG) beach are presented and
   analysed to examine the performance of a new portable streamer trap.
   Measurement of the longshore sediment transport rate in the surf zone
   remains one of the great challenges in coastal engineering and coastal
   sciences. Sediment traps for sand beaches have proven useful in the
   past, but are not suitable for MSG beaches. This paper describes a
   portable depth-integrated streamer trap designed to measure the
   depth-integrated combined bed load and suspended longshore sediment
   transport on MSG beaches. The device consists of a polyester sieve cloth
   mounted into a rectangular holding frame. The stability of the device is
   achieved by gravity: the combined weight of the device and the operator,
   who is standing on and down-current of the device. The device has been
   tested in the field under moderate wave conditions at Minsmere, UK. We
   show that the observed suspended and bed load sediment transport are
   proportional to the wave energy flux, as formulated in the standard
   theoretical model, CSHORE. The data suggest that the empirical
   efficiency of wave breaking and bed load parameter are several orders of
   magnitude larger than that previously observed for uniform fine sand
   values.},

Title = {Differential manganese and iron recycling and transport in continental
   margin sediments of the Northern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {229},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Pore water and solid phase geochemical profiles of sediment cores
   collected along two transects on the western and eastern sides of the
   Mississippi River mouth in the northern Gulf of Mexico were incorporated
   into a reactive transport model to determine the role of manganese and
   iron in the remineralization of carbon. Reactive transport model
   calculations indicate that sedimentation rates control the intensity of
   anaerobic carbon remineralization and select for the dominant anaerobic
   carbon remineralization pathways. Although sulfate reduction dominates
   the shelf station (65 m water depth), denitrification and microbial
   manganese reduction appear equally significant anaerobic respiration
   processes along the continental slope the closest to the Mississippi
   River, whereas microbial iron reduction does not represent an important
   process in these sediments. These findings suggest that the differential
   kinetics of manganese and iron redox transformations influence carbon
   remineralization processes on the continental slope. The fast kinetics
   of Fe2+ oxidation near the sediment-water interface and high
   sedimentation rates maintain Fe under the form of Fe(III) oxides and
   thermodynamically prevent sulfate reduction from dominating carbon
   remineralization processes on the slope, whereas the much slower Mn2+
   oxygenation kinetics allows diffusion of Mn2+ across the sediment-water
   interface of the shelf station closest to the river mouth. Exposure to
   oxygenated bottom waters and entrainment within mobile muds typical of
   deltaic sediments during high riverine discharge likely promote the
   formation and downslope transport of Mn (III/IV) oxides within the
   nepheloid layer. This phenomenon appears to form a manganese `conveyor
   belt' that selectively enriches Mn(III/IV) oxides relative to Fe(III)
   oxides in the deep sediment. In contrast, the intensity of anaerobic
   carbon remineralization processes along the eastern continental slope
   the farthest from the Mississippi River plume is much lower due to the
   low organic and lithogenic inputs, and denitrification dominates
   anaerobic respiration. Overall, these findings suggest that manganese
   cycling and its role in carbon remineralization processes in continental
   slope sediments exposed to large riverine inputs may be more important
   than previously considered.},

Title = {Physiological responses of Bos taurus and Bos indicus cattle to
   prolonged, continuous heat and humidity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {84},
Number = {4},
Pages = {972-985},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to investigate the physiological
   responses of Bos taurus (Angus cross, n = 6) and Bos indicus (Brahman, n
   = 6) cattle to prolonged heat and humidity, as can occur during live
   export by sea. Each experiment was carried out in climate-controlled
   rooms, where heifers were exposed to 15 d of sustained heat and
   humidity. The treatment was designed to be representative of a
   long-haul, live-export voyage leaving a southern Australian winter and
   traveling to a Middle Eastern summer. Wet bulb temperature (WBT) was
   used to give a combined measure of dry bulb temperature and relative
   humidity and was increased over several days, culminating in 5 d at 32
   degrees C WBT between d 7 and 11. By d 11, the respiratory rate and core
   body temperature increased (P < 0.001) compared with values at lower
   ambient temperature on d 1 and 2 when climate-controlled rooms were not
   operating. Feed intake of Bos taurus was reduced (P < 0.001) by d 11,
   whereas that of Bos indicus did not change (P = 0.14). Despite no
   diurnal variation in climatic conditions, core body temperature of both
   Bos taurus and Bos indicus continued to show a circadian amplitude of
   approximately 1 degrees C throughout the hottest period. This amplitude
   increased during the recovery period after heat was removed (up to 1.8
   degrees C for Bos indicus and 1.6 degrees C for Bos taurus). Water
   intake for both Bos taurus and Bos indicus increased when WBT increased
   (P < 0.01 on d 11). Significant acid-base and blood electrolyte
   imbalances occurred in both Bos taurus and Bos indicus, with changes in
   Bos taurus being more substantial and prolonged. The increase in
   respiratory rate coincided with a decrease in the partial pressures of
   carbon dioxide and bicarbonate in venous blood. However, during the
   hottest period, average daily venous blood pH remained unchanged. When
   the heat load was reduced after d 11, the blood pH decreased, indicating
   metabolic acidosis. Blood pH declined from 7.44 to 7.36 for Bos taurus
   (P < 0.001) and from 7.44 to 7.38 for Bos indicus (P < 0.001). Other
   parameters measured include heart rate; packed cell volume; plasma and
   urine Na, K, and Cl; urine pH; and specific gravity. Our results suggest
   that Bos taurus cattle experience significant physiological changes
   during exposure to prolonged and continuous high heat and humidity, with
   alterations persisting for some days after the heat-stress conditions
   subside. Bos indicus experience similar but less pronounced
   physiological changes.},

Title = {Analysis of Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical Coupling of Coal and Gas with
   Absorption/Desorption Thermal Effect},
Journal = {SHOCK AND VIBRATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Coal adsorption/desorption gas can cause temperature changes. Moreover,
   the pressure difference between the high gas pressure area and the low
   gas pressure area in the coal may affect the coal adsorption/desorption
   gas thermal effect. To study the effect of adsorption/desorption thermal
   effect on the evolution law of coal and gas outburst precursor
   information under different pressure differences, the
   adsorption/desorption thermal effect experiments were carried out. And
   the thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling model was established, which
   reflects the interaction between coal and gas. Under the action of
   ground stress, pore pressure, adsorption expansion stress, and thermal
   expansion stress, the model includes the dynamic evolution of coal
   porosity and permeability, gas adsorption-desorption-diffusion-seepage,
   and energy accumulation and dissipation. Using the coupling model, the
   mechanism of adsorption/desorption thermal effect on the evolution of
   outburst precursor information and the mutual coupling relation between
   coal and gas is analyzed. The experimental results show that the
   relation between pressure difference and coal sample temperature
   variation is linear, and the pressure difference has a quadratic
   parabolic relation with the temperature accumulation of coal sample. As
   the pressure difference increases, the temperature variation of the coal
   sample gradually increases, but the temperature accumulation gradually
   decreases. Numerical simulation results show that as the pressure
   difference increases, the changes in coal temperature and gas pressure
   gradually decrease, and the thermal expansion strain caused by the
   adsorption/desorption thermal effect decreases, and the permeability
   increases. Comparing the calculation results with or without the
   adsorption/desorption thermal effect, the volumetric strain,
   temperature, and permeability of the coal have significant changes when
   the adsorption/desorption thermal effect is considered, and the gas
   drainage volume increases as the pressure difference increases. The
   effect of thermal expansion strain caused by adsorption/desorption
   thermal effect on gas seepage is greater than the effect of temperature
   change on gas seepage.},

Abstract = {Changing Arctic climate may alter freshwater ecosystems as a result of
   warmer surface waters, longer open-water periods, reduced wintertime
   lake ice growth, and altered hydrologic connectivity. This study aims to
   characterize zooplankton community composition and size structure in the
   context of hydrologic connectivity and ice regimes in Arctic lakes.
   Between 2011 and 2016, we sampled the phytoplankton, zooplankton, and
   fish communities from a set of representative lakes on the Arctic
   Coastal Plain (ACP) of northern Alaska to determine potential food web
   responses to changing Arctic ecosystems. Multivariate analyses showed
   that time from ice-out had a strong influence on zooplankton community
   structure and that seasonal succession of zooplankton differed between
   lakes with varying hydrologic connectivity. Trends were observed
   suggesting that large-bodied zooplankton (Daphnia, calanoid copepods)
   may be more prevalent in poorly connected lakes with low fish diversity.
   Large-bodied zooplankton displayed higher biomass in lakes with high
   occurrences of bedfast ice, while small-bodied zooplankton (Bosmina,
   rotifers) displayed highest biomass in deeper lakes with low occurrences
   of bedfast ice. Our results contribute to limited knowledge of
   zooplankton in remote lakes of the ACP and suggest that the anticipated
   changes to aquatic ecosystems in the Arctic may include energetically
   less efficient plankton food webs.},

Abstract = {Uptake, efflux and utilization of inorganic carbon were investigated in
   the marine eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis sp. grown under an air level
   of CO2. Maximal photosynthetic rate was hardly affected by raising the
   pH from 5.0 to 9.0. The apparent photosynthetic affinity for dissolved
   inorganic carbon (DIC) was 35 mu M DIC between pH 6.5 to 9.0, but
   increased approximately threefold at pH 5.0 suggesting that HCO3- was
   the main DIC species used from the medium. No external carbonic
   anhydrase (CA) activity could be detected by the pH drift method.
   However, application of ethoxyzolamide (an inhibitor of CA) resulted in
   a significant inhibition of photosynthetic O-2 evolution and carbon
   utilization, suggesting involvement of internal CA or CA-like activity
   in DIC utilization. Under high light conditions, the rate of HCO3-
   uptake and its internal conversion to CO2 apparently exceeded the rate
   of carbon fixation, resulting in a large bak of CO2 from the cells to
   the external medium. When the cells were exposed to low DIC
   concentrations, the ratio of internal to external DIC concentration was
   about eight. On the other hand, in the presence of 2 mM DIC, conditions
   prevailing in the marine environment, the internal concentration of DIC
   was only 50\% higher than the external one.},

   photocatalysts were designed and constructed through a Cu2+ ions
   adsorption-reduction strategy with Cu2O nanospecies decorated on/within
   mesoporous TiO2 microspheres. Narrow band gap of Cu2O favors visible
   light absorption. The mesoporous structure stabilizes Cu2O nanospecies
   and benefits the efficient charge carrier mobility and light harvest.
   The high specific surface area provides more photocatalytic active sites
   for both Cu2O and TiO2 components. Oxygen vacancy stimulated all-solid
   direct Z-scheme electron transport mechanism was proposed to explain the
   high activity and stability of the hybrid catalyst. The catalyst behaves
   enhanced hydrogen evolution rate of 11 mmol h(-1) g(-1) in water and 5.1
   mmol h(-1) g(-1) in seawater, respectively. The highest AQY of hydrogen
   production is 15.1\% in water (and 8.4\% in seawater) at 365 nm. The
   work will provide new insight for controllable creation of Z-scheme
   photocatalysts for practical hydrogen evolution from water and seawater
   splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The isotopic composition of organic carbon buried in marine sediments is
   an appealing proxy for palaeo CO2 concentrations due to the
   well-documented effect of CO2 concentrations on carbon fractionation by
   phytoplankton. However, a number of factors, in addition to CO2
   concentrations, influence this fractionation. Included among these
   factors are cell geometry, in particular surface/volume ratios, growth
   rate, and the presence of CO2 concentrating mechanisms. Other
   potentially confounding factors are calcification, diagenesis, and the
   nature of the growth-rate-limiting factor, e.g. light vs nutrients.
   Because of these confounding factors, palaeoreconstructions based on the
   isotopic composition of organic carbon (delta(13)C) will almost
   certainly have to be based on the isotopic signatures of organic
   compounds that can be associated with a single species, or group of
   physiologically similar species. Long-chain alkenones produced by
   certain species of coccolithophores may provide a suitable diagnostic
   marker. By combining the delta(13)C of the alkenone carbon with the
   delta(13)C of coccolith carbon and the Sr/Ca ratio of the coccoliths, it
   is possible to calculate the extent of carbon fractionation (epsilon(p))
   and estimate growth rates. However, active transport of inorganic carbon
   tends to make epsilon(p) insensitive to CO2 concentrations when the
   ratio of growth rate to CO2 concentration exceeds similar to 0.285/r kg
   mol(-1) d(-1), where r is the effective spherical radius of the cell in
   microns. Palaeo CO2 concentrations calculated from alkenone and
   coccolith delta(13)C data capture the gross features of CO2
   concentrations in the Vostok ice core, but explain only 30-35\% of the
   variance in the latter. The absence of a higher correlation may in part
   reflect the impact of active transport, particularly during glacial
   times. The impact of active transport may have been less severe prior to
   the Pleistocene, since CO2 concentrations are believed to have been
   higher than present-day values during most of Phanerozoic time.},

Abstract = {Within the context of integrated coastal area management (ICAM), this
   research investigates the complexity of horizontal and vertical
   institutional relationships in the case of Croatia. There are three
   aspects, namely sectors, areas and levels that represent a basis for
   developing a methodological approach for evaluating ICAM approaches. It
   is questioned, if this specific management approach adds to the
   complexity of development management in general or does it contribute to
   better and more sustainable implementation of existing plans in coastal
   areas. The main thesis of this research is that coastal area management
   approaches should rather concentrate on implementation of concrete
   strategic projects and contribute to implementation of existing plans.
   The creation of just another plan or strategy, which is not implemented,
   should be avoided. Due to the complex management requirements, ICAM
   calls for an evolutionary and process oriented approach. Only visible
   results that derive from implemented projects can enable institutions to
   learn how to plan and manage development in coastal areas more carefully
   in an integrated manner considering also a longer term perspective.},

Abstract = {Ice cores provide temporal records of surface mass balance (SMB).
   Coastal areas of Antarctica have relatively high and variable SMB, but
   are under-represented in records spanning more than 100 years. Here we
   present SMB reconstruction from a 120 m-long ice core drilled in 2012 on
   the Derwael Ice Rise, coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. Water
   stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) stratigraphy is supplemented by
   discontinuous major ion profiles and continuous electrical conductivity
   measurements. The base of the ice core is dated to AD1759 +/- 16,
   providing a climate proxy for the past similar to 250 years. The core's
   annual layer thickness history is combined with its gravimetric density
   profile to reconstruct the site's SMB history, corrected for the
   influence of ice deformation. The mean SMB for the core's entire history
   is 0.47 +/- 0.02m water equivalent (w.e.) a(-1). The time series of
   reconstructed annual SMB shows high variability, but a general increase
   beginning in the 20th century. This increase is particularly marked
   during the last 50 years (1962-2011), which yields mean SMB of 0.61 +/-
   0.01m w.e. a(-1). This trend is compared with other reported SMB data in
   Antarctica, generally showing a high spatial variability. Output of the
   fully coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM) suggests that,
   although atmospheric circulation is the main factor influencing SMB,
   variability in sea surface temperatures and sea ice cover in the
   precipitation source region also explain part of the variability in SMB.
   Local snow redistribution can also influence interannual variability but
   is unlikely to influence long-term trends significantly. This is the
   first record from a coastal ice core in East Antarctica to show an
   increase in SMB beginning in the early 20th century and particularly
   marked during the last 50 years.},

Abstract = {Sediment accumulation threatens the viability and hydrologic functioning
   of many naturally formed depressional wetlands across the interior
   regions of North America. These wetlands provide many ecosystem services
   and vital habitats for diverse plant and animal communities. Climate
   change may further impact sediment accumulation rates in the context of
   current land use patterns. We estimated sediment accretion in wetlands
   within a region renowned for its large populations of breeding waterfowl
   and migrant shorebirds and examined the relative roles of precipitation
   and land use context in the sedimentation process. We modeled rates of
   sediment accumulation from 1971 through 2100 using the Revised Universal
   Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with a sediment delivery ratio and the Unit
   Stream Power Erosion Deposition model (USPED). These models predicted
   that by 2100, 21-33 \% of wetlands filled completely with sediment and
   27-46 \% filled by half with sediments; estimates are consistent with
   measured sediment accumulation rates in the region reported by empirical
   studies. Sediment accumulation rates were strongly influenced by size of
   the catchment, greater coverage of tilled landscape within the
   catchment, and steeper slopes. Conservation efforts that incorporate the
   relative risk of infilling of wetlands with sediments, thus emphasizing
   areas of high topographic relief and large watersheds, may benefit
   wetland-dependent biota.},

Title = {Protozoan parasites in group-living primates: testing the biological

Volume = {74},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A series of articles by W.J. Freeland published in the 1970s proposed
   that social organization and behavioral processes were heavily
   influenced by parasitic infections, which led to a number of intriguing
   hypotheses concerning how natural selection might act on social factors
   because of the benefits of avoiding parasite infections. For example,
   Freeland {[}1979] showed that all individuals within a given group
   harbored identical gastrointestinal protozoan faunas, which led him to
   postulate that social groups were akin to biological islands and suggest
   how this isolation could select specific types of ranging and dispersal
   patterns. Here, we reexamine the biological island hypothesis by
   quantifying the protozoan faunas of the same primate species examined by
   Freeland in the same location; our results do not support this
   hypothesis. In contrast, we quantified two general changes in protozoan
   parasite community of primates in the study area of Kibale National
   Park, Uganda, over the nearly 35 years between sample collections: (1)
   the colobines found free of parasites in the early 1970s are now
   infected with numerous intestinal protozoan parasites and (2) groups are
   no longer biological islands in terms of their protozoan parasites.
   Whatever the ultimate explanation for these changes, our findings have
   implications for studies proposing selective forces shaping primate
   behavior and social organization. Am. J. Primatol. 74:510517, 2012. (c)

Title = {Degradation of organic compounds in hypersaline wastewater concentrate
   by a supercritical oxidation approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY},
Abstract = {Hypersaline wastewater is a typical industrial wastewater produced by
   iron and steel metallurgy, food material processing and other
   industries. Aiming at a waste liquid produced by mechanical vapour
   recompression evaporation and concentration in Tianjin coastal
   industrial zone, an environment-friendly supercritical water oxidation
   technology was used to efficiently remove the high-content organic
   matter in the hypersaline wastewater concentrate (HWC). A comparison of
   the degradation effects of various oxidants in the supercritical state
   showed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) could be used as a suitable agent
   for processing the HWC. The reaction parameters were systematically
   optimised by single-factor experiment and response surface design. The
   degradation mechanism and reaction characteristics were analyzed using
   gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Solid residues were characterised
   by field emission scanning electron microscope. The results indicated
   that when the dosage of hydrogen peroxide was 6.39\%, the reaction
   temperature was 380 degrees C, the reaction time was about 90 min and
   the optimal total organic carbon removal rate was 96.22\%. Furthermore,
   it was found that hydroxyl radicals produced by hydrogen peroxide
   initiated the bond breaking and ring-opening reactions in organic
   matter, which eventually degraded organic matter into water and carbon
   dioxide.},

Title = {Modelling of fermentative bioethanol production from indigenous Ulva
   prolifera biomass by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NFCCI1248 using an
   integrated ANN-GA approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {791},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Third generation biomass (marine macroalgae) has been projected as a
   promising alternative energy resource for bioethanol production due to
   its high carbon and no lignin composition. However, the major challenge
   in the technologies of production lies in the fermentative bioconversion
   process. Therefore, in the present study the predictive ability of an
   integrated artificial neural network with genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) in
   the modelling of bioethanol production was investigated for an
   indigenous marine macroalgal biomass (Ulva prolifera) by a novel yeast
   strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae NFCCI1248 using six fermentative
   parameters, viz., substrate concentration, fermentation time, inoculum
   size, temperature, agitation speed and pH. The experimental model was
   developed using one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) method to analyze the
   effects of the fermentative parameters on bioethanol production and the
   obtained regression equation was used as a fitness function for the
   ANN-GA modelling. The ANN-GA model predicted a maximum bioethanol
   production at 30 g/L substrate, 48 h fermentation time, 10\% (v/v)
   inoculum, 30 degrees C temperature, 50 rpm agitation speed and pH 6. The
   maximum experimental bioethanol yield obtained after applying ANN-GA was
   0.242 +/- 0.002 g/g RS, which was in close proximity with the predicted
   value (0.239 g/g RS). Hence, the developed ANN-GA model can be applied
   as an efficient approach for predicting the fermentative bioethanol
   production from macroalgal biomass. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A survey on electrical appliance use and energy consumption in
   Vietnamese households: Case study of Tuy Hoa city},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {229-241},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The domestic sector is responsible for approximately a third of total
   energy consumption in Vietnam. However, research on the details of
   energy consumption in this sector is relatively poor and there is a lack
   of data on actual energy use in households. This study attempts to fill
   the gap by providing an analysis of appliance penetration, usage
   behavior, and actual energy consumption of Vietnamese homes. Data were
   collected from a survey of 60 households in Tuy Hoa City on the
   South-Central Coast of Vietnam in 2017. The result shows that the
   average energy consumption was 4492 kWh per household per year, in which
   electricity and liquefied petroleum gas accounted for 74.4\% and 25.6\%
   respectively. The breakdown of current energy consumption revealed that
   cooling was the primary consuming end-use with 31.9\% of the total,
   followed by cooking gas with 25.6\% and kitchen appliances with 18.5\%.
   Energy consumption for typical households with various ownership levels
   of air conditioner were also predicted. The results of this study are
   therefore a valuable reference for policy makers, energy planners and
   Vietnamese households themselves to understand the existing energy
   consumption characteristics and identify potential ways to improve
   energy efficiency in dwellings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The influence of typical geochemical parameters on living foraminiferal
   assemblages was examined and compared in two estuaries from northern
   Portugal: Minho and Lima. Seawater, river waters and interstitial waters
   from tidal marshes were analyzed for the following parameters: pH,
   electric conductivity, Redox potential, salinity, alkalinity (field
   measurements), sulphate, chloride, fluoride, bromide, sodium, potassium,
   calcium and magnesium. Field and laboratory data enabled the estimation
   of solubility equilibrium conditions, specifically the saturation index
   (SI) for calcite. Although both rivers drain the same region, the
   results indicate distinctive conditions concerning geochemically
   relevant parameters, such as SI for carbonates and Mg/Ca ratios. In
   Minho tidal marsh, interstitial waters are strongly undersaturated with
   respect to carbonate phases (SIcalcite between -3,98 and -1,14).
   Accordingly, in this environment there is an incidence of agglutinated
   species. Calcareous species are only present in the estuary mouth and
   showing clear evidences of destruction in its calcium carbonate tests.
   On the other hand, in Lima estuary calcareous species are the dominant
   ones exhibiting well preserved tests without evidences of dissolution,
   as predicted by the geochemical conditions, namely Slcalcite>0,01 and
   Mg/Ca ratio<2,28. In combining both abiotic data and information on
   foraminiferal assemblages, this comparative study demonstrates a
   methodology for identifying the main geochemical controls on
   foraminiferal distribution trends.},

Title = {REE, Mn, Fe, Mg and C, O Isotopic Geochemistry of Calcites from Furong
   Tin Deposit, South China: Evidence for the Genesis of the Hydrothermal
   Ore-forming Fluids},
Journal = {RESOURCE GEOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Pages = {18-34},
Abstract = {The Furong tin deposit in the central Nanling region, South China,
   consists of three main types of mineralization ores, i.e. skarn-,
   altered granite- and greisen-type ores, hosted in Carboniferous and
   Permian strata and Mesozoic granitic intrusions. Calcite is the dominant
   gangue mineral intergrown with ore bodies in the orefield. We have
   carried out REE, Mn, Fe, and Mg geochemical and C, and O isotopic
   studies on calcites to constrain the source and evolution of the
   ore-forming fluids. The calcites from the Furong deposit exhibit middle
   negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu{*} = 0.311-0.921), except for one which has
   an Eu/Eu{*} of 1.10, with the total REE content of 5.49-133 ppm. The
   results show that the calcites are characterized by two types of REE
   distribution patterns: a LREE-enriched pattern and a flat REE pattern.
   The LREE-enriched pattern of calcites accompanying greisen-type ore and
   skarn-type ore are similar to those of Qitianling granite. The REE, Mn,
   Fe, and Mg abundances of calcites exhibit a decreasing tendency from
   granite rock mass to wall rock, i.e. these abundances of calcites
   associated with altered granite-type and greisen-type ores are higher
   than those associated with skarn-type ores. The calcites from primary
   ores in the Furong deposit show large variation in carbon and oxygen
   isotopic compositions. The delta 13C and delta 18O of calcites are -0.4
   to -12.7 parts per thousand and 2.8 to 16.4 parts per thousand,
   respectively, and mainly fall within the range between mantle or
   magmatic carbon and marine carbonate. The calcites from greisen and
   altered granite ores in the Furong deposit display a negative
   correlation in the diagram of delta 13C versus delta 18O, probably owing
   to the CO2-degassing of the ore-forming fluids. From the intrusion to
   wall-rock, the calcites display an increasing tendency with respect to
   delta 13C values. This implies that the carbon isotopic compositions of
   the ore-bearing fluids have progressively changed from domination by
   magmatic carbon to sedimentary carbonate carbon. In combination with
   other geological and geochemical data, we suggest that the ore-forming
   fluids represent magmatic origin. We believe that the fluids exsolved
   from fractionation of the granitic magma, accompanying magmatism of the
   Qitianling granite complex, were involved in the mineralization of the
   Furong tin polymetallic deposit.},

Title = {Accumulation and intense bioturbation of bioclastic muds along a
   carbonate-platform margin: Dry Tortugas, Florida},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {315},
Pages = {44-57},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {A sedimentological study was undertaken in the Dry Tortugas, lowermost
   Florida Keys, to examine processes influencing the accumulation and
   sedimentary-fabric characteristics of carbonate muds along the shallow
   margin of a carbonate platform. Sedimentological studies (physical
   properties, Th-234 and Pb-210 geochronology) were coordinated with
   observations of benthic biology and benthic-boundary-layer dynamics.
   Sampling was concentrated around a mud depocenter in Southeast Channel,
   a reentrant 20-30 m deep in the southern edge of the Dry Tortugas
   platform.
   In the depocenter of Southeast Channel, accumulation rates of 0.10-0.32
   cm y(-1) are estimated from Pb-210 profiles. Likely sources of sediment
   are in shallower water, and include reefs and beds of calcareous green
   algae. Fine sediment (silt- and clay-sized) is advected to the seabed of
   Southeast Channel by a combination of tidal and storm-driven currents.
   Flows from shallow water decelerate upon entering deeper water in
   Southeast Channel, producing conditions favorable to long-term
   accumulation.
   Once deposited, sediment in Southeast Channel is subjected to
   bioturbation by a two-tiered benthic community. The surface zone (0-5
   cm) is mixed biodiffusively by a surface community of small bivalves and
   polychaetes (D-b approximate to 9 cm(2) yr(-1)) over periods of weeks to
   months, and is characterized by mm-scale mottling. Other near-surface
   structures include biodeposited fecal mounds of deep-deposit feeders and
   ephemeral physical stratification as thin (1-5 cm) layers of fine
   sediment Below -5 cm, the dominant post-depositional process is
   bioadvective mixing by a deep-deposit-feeding community of callianassid
   shrimp and notomastid polychaetes. The upper 10-15 cm is mixed
   completely every 6-21 years, and bioturbation below this depth is
   slower.
   Even though the study area has been hit by >10 major hurricanes in the
   last 120 years (winds >190 km h(-1)), sediments preserved (i.e., below 5
   cm depth) in Southeast Channel during this period reveal wholly biogenic
   sedimentary fabric produced by the deep callianassid/notomastid
   community. Bioturbation is thus capable of erasing the stratigraphic
   signature of the most extreme sediment-transport events over decadal
   time scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Scattering of oblique waves by permeable vertical flexible membrane wave
   barriers},
Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {156-168},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The interaction of obliquely incident surface gravity waves with a
   vertical flexible permeable submerged membrane wave barrier is
   investigated in the context of three-dimensional linear water wave
   theory. From the general forfnulation of the submerged membrane barrier,
   the performance of bottom-standing, surface-piercing and fully extended
   membrane wave barriers are analyzed for various values of wave and
   structural parameters. The analytic solution of the physical problem is
   obtained using eigenfunction expansion method and a coupled boundary
   element-finite difference method has been used to get the numerical
   solution. In the boundary element method, since the boundary condition
   on the membrane barrier is not known a priori, the membrane response and
   velocity potentials are solved simultaneously using appropriate
   discretization with the help of finite difference scheme. The
   convergence of the analytic and numerical solution techniques is
   discussed. The study reveals that for suitable combination of wave and
   structural parameters, approximately (45-50)\% incident wave energy can
   be dissipated irrespective of membrane barrier configurations. Further,
   in certain situations, nearly full wave reflection and zero transmission
   occur for all barrier configurations. The study will be useful in the
   design of flexible permeable membrane to act as an effective wave
   barrier for creation of tranquility zone in the marine environment. (C)

Title = {Long-term permeability evolution of shale seal rocks with argon and
   scCO(2)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {104},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We conducted a suite of experiments to evaluate the long-term
   permeability evolution of shale rocks under constant effective stress,
   before, during, and after interaction with supercritical carbon dioxide
   (scCO(2)). To do so, we measured the time-dependent evolution of argon
   permeabilities for the pre- and post-reacted samples (i.e., before and
   after long-term interaction with scCO(2)). In addition, we obtained
   permeability evolution during longterm interaction with scCO(2). The
   samples showed either relatively constant permeabilities or a moderate
   decrease during pre-reaction long-term argon tests. The permeability
   evolution during long-term CO2 tests showed continuous increase,
   continuous decrease, or cycles of increase/decrease in permeability. The
   long-term response of the samples to CO2 included phenomena such as (i)
   salt precipitation, (ii) swelling-induced cracks, and (iii) carbonate
   dissolution. While it is obvious that salt precipitation and
   swelling-induced cracks decrease and increase the permeability,
   respectively, the sample response to carbonate dissolution proved to be
   more complex and may increase or decrease the permeability. The
   permeability evolution during post-reaction longterm argon injection is
   also affected by the contribution of each of these three phenomena,
   during long-term interaction with CO2. We observe increase, decrease,
   and constant permeability evolution during post-reaction argon tests.
   Our experiments reveal that the initial permeability of the samples
   plays a significant role on the long-term permeability response of
   shales in the presence argon and scCO(2) fluids. This study shows that
   when shales are hydraulically fractured with CO2 their initial
   permeability has a more significant role than their permeability
   evolution over time.},

Title = {Return of large fin whale feeding aggregations to historical whaling
   grounds in the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) of the Southern Hemisphere were
   brought to near extinction by twentieth century industrial whaling. For
   decades, they had all but disappeared from previously highly frequented
   feeding grounds in Antarctic waters. Our dedicated surveys now confirm
   their return to ancestral feeding grounds, gathering at the Antarctic
   Peninsula in large aggregations to feed. We report on the results of an
   abundance survey and present the first scientific documentation of large
   fin whale feeding aggregations at Elephant Island, Antarctica, including
   the first ever video documentation. We interpret high densities,
   re-establishment of historical behaviours and the return to ancestral
   feeding grounds as signs for a recovering population. Recovery of a
   large whale population has the potential to augment primary productivity
   at their feeding grounds through the effects of nutrient recycling,
   known as `the whale pump'. The recovery of fin whales in that area could
   thus restore ecosystem functions crucial for atmospheric carbon
   regulation in the world's most important ocean region for the uptake of
   anthropogenic CO2.},

Title = {Ecophysiology of the tall coconut growing under different coastal areas
   of northeastern Brazil},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {232},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Coconut palm is an important crop explored as a rich source of oil,
   fiber, milk, and water in most tropical areas. Brazil is the fifth
   largest producer in the world, and extensive coastal areas of
   Northeastern Brazil are planted with tall coconut. However, the
   sustainability of these coconut plantations can be affected by different
   abiotic stresses, including drought, mineral nutrition, and salinity.
   So, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the
   ecophysiological responses of tall coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) adult
   plants in cultivated and semi-extrativist areas on coast of Ceara state,
   in Northeastern Brazil. The study was carried out in four areas:
   Irrigated, Rainfed, Foreiro (coconut trees on coastland owned by the
   Navy and temporarily rented to private individuals) and Preamar (coconut
   trees in high-tide areas owned by the Navy). The evaluations (leaf gas
   exchanges, Na+ on leaf surfaces, leaf concentrations of soluble
   carbohydrates, N, K, P, and Na, soil moisture, and soil electrical
   conductivity) were carried out in the dry and rainy seasons, between
   2015 and 2017. Our results indicated that tall coconut palms were
   subjected to abiotic constraints in three of the four evaluated areas.
   Salinity and water-logging were evident in Preamar plants; water deficit
   in Rainfed plants; and nutritional stress limited the crop yield in
   Rainfed, Preamar, and Foreiro areas. Coconut plants that grew in Foreiro
   area, despite the proximity to the ocean, were not subjected to salt
   stress, and the higher moisture in lower soil layers significantly
   reduced the effect of the dry season on photosynthetic rates. Seawater
   spray caused accumulation of Na+ on coconut leaf surfaces, mainly in the
   areas close to the sea. The repeated salinity stress and waterlogging in
   high-tide area caused a permanent hindrance for carbon assimilation
   rate, limiting the capacity of fruit production by plants. Current
   climatic changes leading to the elevation of sea level and intrusion of
   sea water enhance the general concern on how to maintain these coconut
   plantations as source of fiber and nutrition to future generations.},

Title = {Worm control practice against gastro-intestinal parasites in Norwegian
   sheep and goat flocks},
Journal = {ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {53},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Background: Anthelmintic treatment is the most common way of controlling
   nematode infections in ruminants. However, several countries have
   reported anthelmintic resistance (AR), representing a limitation for
   sustainable small ruminant production. The knowledge regarding worm
   control management represents a baseline to develop a guideline for
   preventing AR. The aim of the present study was therefore to improve our
   knowledge about the worm control practices in small ruminant flocks in
   Norway.
   Methods: A questionnaire survey regarding worm control practices was
   performed in small ruminant flocks in Norway. Flocks were selected from
   the three main areas of small ruminant farming, i.e. the coastal, inland
   and northern areas. A total of 825 questionnaires, comprising 587 sheep
   flocks (return rate of 51.3\%) and 238 goat flocks (52.6\%) were
   included.
   Results: The results indicated that visual appraisal of individual
   weight was the most common means of estimating the anthelmintic dose
   used in sheep (78.6\%) and goat (85.1\%) flocks. The mean yearly
   drenching rate in lambs and ewes were 2.5 +/- 1.7 and 1.9 +/- 1.1,
   respectively, whereas it was 1.0 (once a year) in goats. However, these
   figures were higher in sheep in the coastal area with a rate of 3.4 and
   2.2 in lambs and ewes, respectively. Benzimidazoles were the predominant
   anthelmintic class used in sheep flocks (64.9\% in 2007), whereas
   benzimidazoles and macrocyclic lactones were both equally used in dairy
   goat flocks. In the period of 2005-2007, 46.3\% of the sheep flocks
   never changed the anthelmintic class. The dose and move strategy was
   practiced in 33.2\% of the sheep flocks.
   Conclusions: The present study showed that inaccurate weight calculation
   gives a risk of under-dosing in over 90\% of the sheep and goat flocks
   in Norway. Taken together with a high treatment frequency in lambs, a
   lack of anthelmintic class rotation and the common use of a
   dose-and-move strategy, a real danger for development of anthelmintic
   resistance (AR) seems to exist in Norwegian sheep and goat flocks. This
   risk seems particularly high in coastal areas where high treatment
   frequencies in lambs were recorded.},

Title = {Intelligent Navigation for a Solar Powered Unmanned Underwater Vehicle},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {In this paper, an intelligent navigation system for an unmanned
   underwater vehicle powered by renewable energy and designed for shadow
   water inspection in missions of a long duration is proposed. The system
   is composed of an underwater vehicle, which tows a surface vehicle. The
   surface vehicle is a small boat with photovoltaic panels, a methanol
   fuel cell and communication equipment, which provides energy and
   communication to the underwater vehicle. The underwater vehicle has
   sensors to monitor the underwater environment such as sidescan sonar and
   a video camera in a flexible configuration and sensors to measure the
   physical and chemical parameters of water quality on predefined paths
   for long distances. The underwater vehicle implements a biologically
   inspired neural architecture for autonomous intelligent navigation.
   Navigation is carried out by integrating a kinematic adaptive
   neuro-controller for trajectory tracking and an obstacle avoidance
   adaptive neuro-controller. The autonomous underwater vehicle is capable

Title = {Technology legitimation and strategic coupling: A cross-national study
   of floating wind power in Norway and Scotland},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Building upon recent work in sustainability transitions studies and
   economic geography, this paper is concerned with the process of
   legitimation by which emerging technologies are aligned with broader
   societal rules and norms. Challenging the assumption of earlier research
   that legitimation occurs within regional and national borders, the paper
   views legitimation as set of transregional processes whereby the actors
   behind emerging technologies seek support from different regional and
   national organizations on an international basis. Inspired by the Global
   Production Networks (GPN) approach, the paper argues that technology
   legitimation can be un-derstood as a trans-regional process of strategic
   coupling between the strategic needs of the industrial actors advancing
   new technologies and the efforts of national and regional organizations
   to promote their territories as leading nodes in emerging production
   networks. Empirically, the paper adopts a micro-level focus on the
   legitimation of a particular renewable energy technology: the Hywind
   floating wind power (FWP) technology, developed by the Norwegian energy
   firm, Equinor. The paper shows that the FWP technology was gradually
   legitimated in a pragmatic sense over the three stages of Hywind. The
   demonstration phase generated a tem-porary and conditional form of
   legitimacy at an intra-national scale, while the next phase, Hywind
   Scotland, generated a stronger and more durable form of legitimacy as
   the world's first floating wind farm. This led to the internalisation of
   legitimacy from outside into the Norwegian energy regime (absorption) in
   the third stage of Hywind Tampen.},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems world-wide will be affected by Ocean Acidification(
   OA) and the accompanying changes to carbonate concentrations. Here we
   consider how OA might impact echinoderms by considering two contrasting
   reproductive strategies in sea urchins: planktotrophic larvae, and the
   brooded young of deep-sea Antarctic echinoids. In planktotrophic sea
   urchins previous research has shown that larvae developing in elevated
   CO2 are smaller, with skeletal abnormalities at high {[}CO2]. Recent
   research with Lytechinus pictus using gene expression profiling further
   shows that numerous genes central to energy metabolism and
   biomineralization are down-regulated in high CO2 conditions. Skeletal
   formation in adult Antarctic sea urchins, and their developing broods,
   is also likely to be affected by shallowing of the high Mg-calcite
   saturation horizon, potentially impacting growth, bathymetric
   distribution and local population persistence. Thus, OA will affect sea
   urchins with both brooding and larval developmental modes, suggesting
   broad-scale impacts on other calcified echinoderm classes.},

Title = {Thermal-hydraulic analysis of a lead-bismuth small modular reactor under
   moving conditions},
Journal = {ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The application of lead-bismuth small modular reactor (SMR) has unique
   advantages in offshore engineering. Moving conditions caused by ocean
   environment are important for the security analysis of nuclear system.
   In this paper, the models including core neutronics, reactor thermal
   hydraulics and moving conditions for a natural circulation lead-bismuth
   reactor with thermal power of 5 MW are established. The calculation
   results show that (a) inclination causes core flowrate reduction and
   coolant temperature rise at the core outlet, maximum of which can be
   20\% and 20 degrees C. (b) Heaving and rolling conditions both result in
   fluctuation of core mass flow rate and fuel cladding temperature while
   pattern of each differs. Flowrate fluctuation larger than 10\% of the
   steady state happens under large heaving condition. Backflow appears in
   the heat exchanger if the rolling condition is strong enough. (c)
   Lead-bismuth SMR is influenced more intensely under heaving and rolling
   condition compared with small PWR. 18\% larger mass flowrate fluctuation
   appears in the lead-bismuth SMR under heaving acceleration of 0.5 g.
   Opposite trend of time-domain average core flowrate appears for two
   reactors under rolling condition. This study provides theoretical basis
   for the thermal-hydraulic system analysis of lead-bismuth SMR under
   moving conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Earth's climate has undergone dramatic shifts between glacial and
   interglacial time periods, with high-latitude temperature changes on the
   order of 5-10 degrees C. These climatic shifts have been associated with
   major rearrangements in the deep ocean circulation and stratification,
   which have likely played an important role in the observed atmospheric
   carbon dioxide swings by affecting the partitioning of carbon between
   the atmosphere and the ocean. The mechanisms by which the deep ocean
   circulation changed, however, are still unclear and represent a major
   challenge to our understanding of glacial climates. This study shows
   that various inferred changes in the deep ocean circulation and
   stratification between glacial and interglacial climates can be
   interpreted as a direct consequence of atmospheric temperature
   differences. Colder atmospheric temperatures lead to increased sea ice
   cover and formation rate around Antarctica. The associated enhanced
   brine rejection leads to a strongly increased deep ocean stratification,
   consistent with high abyssal salinities inferred for the last glacial
   maximum. The increased stratification goes together with a weakening and
   shoaling of the interhemispheric overturning circulation, again
   consistent with proxy evidence for the last glacial. The shallower
   interhemispheric overturning circulation makes room for slowly moving
   water of Antarctic origin, which explains the observed middepth
   radiocarbon age maximum and may play an important role in ocean carbon
   storage.},

Abstract = {A satellite port has been proposed about 14.8 km north of Madras port on
   the east coast of India. As the interference of a satellite port with
   the existing pattern of longshore sediment transport will generate
   coastal imbalance in the region, a numerical model study involving
   sediment transport and combined wave refraction-diffraction was
   conducted to predict the shoreline behaviour, A realistic approach to
   the study was made to meet the objectives by considering wave
   height-wave period distributions in the region and duration and sequence
   of their occurrence during major monsoon seasons. This method of
   analysis enabled us to predict: (i) the extent of general shoreline
   advancement, particularly in front of a tidal inlet-a source of the
   cooling water requirement for an existing thermal power plant; (ii) the
   extent of the coastal region that will be affected owing to recession of
   shoreline and its impact on: (a) the fishing community living along the
   coastal stretch; (b) the national highway running along the coast; and
   (c) the changes in nearshore bathymetry. Based on the studies,
   management plans were drawn to safeguard the coastal region from
   imbalances that will arise out of construction of the satellite port.
   This paper highlights the effects of a satellite port on the coastal
   region and the need for proper management. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

   the Fe/Mn oxide phase in oxic sediments (such as the Rumney Formation)
   is remobilised during iron reduction and reprecipitated in other phases
   such as authigenic carbonates (as in the Wentlooge). Since many metal

Title = {Submarine canyons represent an essential habitat network for krill
   hotspots in a Large Marine Ecosystem},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Submarine canyon systems are ubiquitous features of marine ecosystems,
   known to support high levels of biodiversity. Canyons may be important
   to benthic-pelagic ecosystem coupling, but their role in concentrating
   plankton and structuring pelagic communities is not well known. We
   hypothesize that at the scale of a large marine ecosystem, canyons
   provide a critical habitat network, which maintain energy flow and
   trophic interactions. We evaluate canyon characteristics relative to the
   distribution and abundance of krill, critically important prey in the
   California Current Ecosystem. Using a geological database, we conducted
   a census of canyon locations, evaluated their dimensions, and quantified
   functional relationships with krill hotspots (i.e., sites of
   persistently elevated abundance) derived from hydro-acoustic surveys. We
   found that 76\% of krill hotspots occurred within and adjacent to
   canyons. Most krill hotspots were associated with large shelf-incising
   canyons. Krill hotspots and canyon dimensions displayed similar
   coherence as a function of latitude and indicate a potential regional
   habitat network. The latitudinal migration of many fish, seabirds and
   mammals may be enhanced by using this canyon-krill network to maintain
   foraging opportunities. Biogeographic assessments and predictions of
   krill and krill-predator distributions under climate change may be
   improved by accounting for canyons in habitat models.},

Title = {Experimental Study on the Effect of CO2 on Phase Behavior
   Characteristics of Condensate Gas Reservoir},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {In this paper, the DBR all-visible mercury-free high-temperature and
   high-pressure multifunctional formation fluid PVT analyzer developed and
   produced by Schlumberger company is used to conduct an experimental
   study on phase behavior characteristics of one offshore high CO2
   condensate gas wells. The experiments include two-phase flash
   experiment, constant composition expansion experiment (CCE experiment),
   and constant volume depletion experiment (CVD experiment). Experimental
   results show that the higher the CO2 content in the condensate gas
   system, the higher the gas-oil ratio of condensate gas, the greater the
   density of condensate oil, the higher the dew point pressure of
   condensate gas, the greater the relative volume of condensate gas, the
   smaller the amount of retrograde condensate oil. And the higher the CO2
   content in the condensate gas system, the phase diagram is shifted to
   the left and up, the critical point of the phase diagram is shifted to
   the lower left, the smaller the area of the two-phase envelope, the
   lighter the condensate gas system, the condensate oil recovery is
   higher. The above experimental results revealed that CO2 is well soluble
   with condensate gas, the expansion capacity of the condensate gas system
   was slightly enhanced, and because CO2 has a good extraction capacity,
   the light components of condensate gas were constantly extracted, the
   retrograde condensate rate of condensate oil decreases, and the maximum
   retrograde condensate volume also decreased. However, the condensate oil
   was produced along with the natural gas, and the higher the CO2 content,
   the stronger the extraction, the more condensate oil was produced. It is
   mainly because CO2 has the strong gasification and extraction capacity,
   on the one hand, the retrograde condensation of condensate gas was
   inhibited, and on the other hand, reverse evaporation of condensate oil
   was enhanced. The above experimental results indicate the law of the
   effect of CO2 on the phase behavior characteristics of condensate gas
   reservoirs, providing theoretical basis and guidance for the efficient
   development of condensate gas reservoirs at sea.},

   Challenges},
Journal = {APPLIED MECHANICS REVIEWS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this paper, the advantages, state-of-the-art, and current challenges
   in the field of adaptive composite marine propulsors and turbines are
   reviewed. Adaptive composites are used in numerous marine technologies,
   including propulsive devices and control surfaces for marine vessels,
   offshore platforms, unmanned surface and underwater vehicles, and
   renewable energy harvesting devices. In the past, most marine propulsors
   and turbines have been designed as rigid bodies, simplifying the design
   and analysis process; however, this can lead to significant performance
   decay when operating in off-design conditions or in spatially or
   temporally varying flows. With recent advances in computational
   modeling, materials research, and manufacturing, it is possible to take
   advantage of the flexibility and anisotropic properties of composites to
   enable passive morphing capabilities to delay cavitation and improve
   overall energy efficiency, agility, and dynamic stability. Moreover,
   active materials can be embedded inside composites to enable energy
   harvesting, in situ health and condition monitoring, mitigation and
   control of flow-induced vibrations, and further enhancements of system
   performance. However, care is needed in the design and testing of
   adaptive composite marine propulsors and turbines to account for the
   inherent load-dependent deformations and to avoid potential material
   failures and hydroelastic instabilities (resonance, parametric
   excitations, divergence, flutter, buffeting, etc.). Here, we provide a
   summary of recent progress in the modeling, design, and optimization of
   adaptive composite marine propulsors and turbines, followed by a
   discussion of current challenges and future research directions.},

Abstract = {Marine diagenetic calcite with both a calcitic (low-to-intermediate Mg)
   and aragonitic origin was examined from the middle Ordovician buildups
   of the Chazyan Group in Vermont. All marine phases have elevated Sr (up
   to 1800 ppm) compared with that observed from marine precipitates in
   other middle Ordovician units. Stromatoporoids (Iabechiids), which were
   originally aragonitic, have higher Sr values than phases with an
   original calcite mineralogy (trilobites, marine cement). Additional
   evidence supporting precursor mineralogy interpretations includes
   elevated Mg values (up to 3.6 mole\% MgCO3) and the presence of
   microdolomite in interpreted calcitic phases. Originally aragonitic
   precipitates have lower Mg Values and most significantly lack
   microdolomite. This study demonstrates the presence of elevated Sr
   values in marine precipitates that formed during a period when calcite,
   not aragonite, was the dominant physiochemically precipitated calcium
   carbonate mineralogy that formed from sea water. Elevated Sr is
   attributable to at least a partially open system diagenetic
   stabilization of biogenic aragonite. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {Functional forms for approximating the relative optical air mass},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {This article constitutes a review and systematic comparison of
   functional forms for approximating the air mass from the zenith to the
   horizon. Among them, we find the most meaningful forms in atmospheric
   optics, geophysics, meteorology, and solar energy science, as well as
   several forms arising from the study of the atmospheric delay of
   electromagnetic signals, whose relationship with the air mass was
   recently proved by the authors. In total, we have compared 26 functional
   forms, and the fits have been done for three atmospheric profiles, an
   observer at sea level, and the median wavelength of the Sun's spectral
   irradiance (0.7274 mu m). As a result, the best of the uniparametric
   forms has more than three centuries of history; the best of the
   biparametric forms was recently introduced by one of the authors; the
   best of the tri- and tetraparametric forms were originally proposed for
   modeling the atmospheric delay of radio signals; and the best of the
   forms with more than four parameters is used here for the first time. On
   the basis of these, for the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere (USSA-76), we
   provide one-, two-, three-, four-, and five-parameter formulas whose
   maximum deviations are 1.70, 2.91 x 10(-1), 3.28 x 10(-2), 2.49 x
   10(-3), and 3.24 x 10(-4), respectively.},

Journal = {ACTA PALAEONTOLOGICA POLONICA},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-88},
Abstract = {The small solitary coral dominated, Grypophyllum-Chostophyllum
   association, a pioneer coral community, is widely distributed at the
   base of the Givetian Burdekin Formation of north Queensland in the mixed
   arkose-carbonate sediments. It is succeeded by fasciculate coral
   dominated, Dendrostella trigemme association, which is mainly associated
   with wackestone or bioclastic calcirudite of inner shelf, lagoonal or
   protected environments. The Australophyllum-Sanldophyllum association,
   Blysmatophyllum-Iowaphyllum schIueteri association, and Spongophyllum
   association, all dominated by in situ, large massive coral colonies,
   formed biostromal deposits on the margins of the basin. They developed
   in nearshore environments during the maximum flooding in the region. The
   Aphyllum salmoni-Stringophyllum (Neospongophyllum) bipartitum
   association indicates relatively deeper, mid-outer shelf environments
   connected with maximum flooding in the depocentre and least terrigenous
   influx. The massive coral dominated Endophyllum columna-Stringophyllum
   (Stringopyllum) isactis association, developed in the initial regressive
   phase, forms a distinctive biostromal unit at the top of the Burdekin
   Formation. The Lekanophyllum association developed at the base of the
   Cultivation Gully Formation in a very shallow nearshore environment with
   a large terrigenous influx as a result of the basin wide, relatively
   rapid regression. It is characterised by the abundant occurrence of
   solitary corals and large sized, cerioid Endophyllum columna, which
   often formed micro-atolls. Rugose corals were better adapted than
   stromatoporoids to survive of mud influx.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},

Abstract = {Here we compare the global-scale morphology of Earth's the
   Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) emissions observed by NASA's Global-scale
   Observations of Limb and Disk (GOLD) mission to those modeled using the
   Global Airglow (GLOW) code with atmospheric parameters provided by
   Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model
   (TIEGCM). The (OS)-S-5 oxygen (135.6 nm) and N(2)Lyman-Birge-Hopfield
   (LBH) emissions are observed over the Western hemisphere every 30 min by
   the GOLD instrument. The FUV brightness of the thermosphere-ionosphere
   is expected to vary in systemic ways with respect to geophysical
   parameters, solar energy input from above, and terrestrial weather input
   from below. In this paper we examine the (OS)-S-5 oxygen emission and
   the N2LBH emission brightnesses with local time, latitude, season,
   tides, geomagnetic activity, and solar activity based on GOLD
   observations and GLOW modeling. Early GOLD observations indicate that
   the model effectively reproduces the brightness variations with local
   time and latitude but is biased low in magnitude. However, the TIEGCM is
   unable to accurately represent the extraordinary nighttime equatorial
   ionization anomaly observed by GOLD. It is also expected from these
   results that the signal from geomagnetic storms may obscure tidal
   signals.},

Title = {Projected changes to moisture loads for design and management of
   building exteriors over Canada},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {170},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Atmospheric moisture loading affects the performance and durability of
   building exteriors. In a changing climate, designing for historical
   moisture loads may no longer be adequate. This study investigates
   potential climate change impacts on the moisture index used in the
   design and management of buildings over Canada. Projections are obtained
   for future periods experiencing different global warming levels (+1
   degrees C, +2 degrees C, etc.) with respect to 1986-2016 baseline using
   outputs from a 15-member initial condition ensemble of the CanRCM4, a
   Canadian regional climate model at 50-km resolution. CanRCM4
   overestimates wetting potential, underestimates drying capacity, and
   hence overestimates moisture loads for the baseline period. To obtain
   unbiased moisture indices, a simple linear bias adjustment scheme is
   applied to the baseline simulation and future projections. Significant
   increases in future moisture loads are found over the western and
   eastern coastal regions of Canada due to increases in rainfall amounts,
   driven by increases in precipitation and a warming-induced shift from
   snow to rain. Conversely, CanRCM4 projects significant decreases in
   future moisture loads over south-central and northern Canada due to
   increases in drying capacity, driven by increases in future near surface
   air temperature that are accompanied by nearly unchanged relative
   humidity. Internal variability of the moisture load due to the natural,
   chaotic variability of the climate system, is modest compared to the
   magnitude of the projected change signal - signal-to-noise ratio is
   high. The projected changes suggest that moisture protection could be a
   concern for designing and managing building exteriors over western and
   eastern coastal regions of Canada.},

Abstract = {With the development of society, human's demand for energy sources has
   been increasing, so the integrated energy system (IES), which can
   effectively reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency has
   been widely used for that non-renewable fossil energy is running out. As
   the ocean has been deeply developed and utilized, the independent
   integrated energy system (TIES), which is closely related to the marine
   production process such as offshore oil platforms, oceanic islands and
   large ships has been gradually developed. In order to better plan and
   schedule the system which is an area far from the coast and needs a
   variety of energy sources like electric heating, how to reasonably
   evaluate the IES has become a key issue(1).
   Based on the existing evaluation system of large-scale IES, this paper
   constructs an energy efficiency evaluation system of the IIES, and
   establishes an energy efficiency evaluation method on the basis of
   combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with hundred-mark system.
   Taking an offshore oil platform as an example, the energy efficiency
   evaluation method of the IIES is calculated and analyzed.},

Title = {Subtropical carbonates in a temperate realm: Modern sediments on the
   southwest Australian shelf},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH},

Pages = {1297-1321},

Abstract = {The southwestern continental margin of Australia (19 degrees S-22
   degrees S) in the western Indian Ocean is transitional between
   cool-water and warm-water carbonate realms. It comprises the incipiently
   rimmed, flat-topped, steep-fronted Rottnest Shelf in the south, the
   uniform subtropical starved Carnarvon Ramp off Shark Bay, and the
   Ningaloo fringing reef in the north. The margin is strongly influenced
   by the poleward-flowing, warm, nutrient-poor Leeuwin Current, which
   promotes overall downwelling and strong summer equatorward-blowing
   winds, which generate local seasonal upwelling.
   The structurally quiescent northern part of the Rottnest Shelf, with
   minimum accommodation, is characterized by luxuriant stands of
   seagrasses and macrophytes growing on coralline-encrusted hardgrounds
   and rooted in sediments rich in coralline algae and larger,
   symbiont-bearing foraminifers together with abundant cool-water elements
   such as bryozoans, molluscs, and small foraminifers, Halimeda is poorly
   calcified and does not contribute to the sediment, Azooxanthehate
   corals, although present, are not common, Such a sediment pattern has
   many analogs in the geologic record, especially the early Cenozoic, The
   incipient rim is a morphologically complex linear ridge system
   interpreted to be a buried mid Pleistocene barrier reef or beach-dune
   complex. The northern part of the ridge complex is capped by the Houtman
   Abrolhos reef platforms. Subphotic sediments on the deep, outer shelf
   and upper slope, affected by seasonal upwelling, are typical cool-water,
   poorly sorted, bryozoan dominated deposits rich in small foraminifers
   and sponge spicules,
   The inner part of the more structurally active Carnarvon,Ramp ranges
   from steep eolianite cliffs to hypersaline environments of Shark Bay to
   the Ningaloo fringing reef. Mid-ramp sediment, especially off Shark Bay,
   is mostly relict or stranded and foraminifer-dominated sand with
   abundant Mg-calcite-cemented intraclasts. These sediments, accumulating
   on a relatively barren seafloor, likely represent attenuated carbonate
   production brought about by downwelling and episodic incursions of
   saline, Shark Bay-derived waters onto the ramp. The outer ramp is either
   planktic foraminiferal sand, sorted by strong bottom currents, or
   spiculitic mud.
   Such sedimentation patterns should typify the western margins of targe
   ocean basins during those periods in geologic history when circumglobal
   equatorial circulation was active, and equatorial gateways narrow, in
   contrast to eras of supercontinents, when cool water carbonate
   sedimentation and upwelling prevailed in similar settings. Furthermore,
   because low-latitude trade winds relax during glacial epochs and the
   cool-water, upwelling belt moves equatorward into otherwise tropical
   realms, temperate and subtropical sedimentation patterns in these
   regions should oscillate at the 100 ky scale in the stratigraphic
   record.},

Abstract = {The condition of three intertidal Paracentrotus lividus populations,
   which inhabit an area between Rabat and Casablanca (Morocco) known by
   its high wave energy and its substantial anthropogenic disturbances were
   described. The growth rate of the juvenile sea urchins in this
   intertidal zone was low compared with more sheltered populations. A
   sharp increase in the gonad index was observed between January and March
   at the beginning of a period of algal production, and was concomitant
   with increases in seawater temperature and food consumption rate. This
   gonad index increase was followed by a single spawning period occurring
   between March and June, probably triggered by the phytoplankton bloom
   induced by upwelling conditions. Larval development in all three
   populations was severely inhibited and could be explained, in part, by
   high and generalized Cu contamination throughout the region. Specific
   contamination of particular populations by Pb or Hg was attributed to
   local industries and the incomplete dispersion of pollutants in spite of
   the high hydrodynamics along the Moroccan Atlantic coast. One of the
   three populations studied showed strong indications of abnormal
   development; the degradation of its condition appeared to be due to the
   presence of a wadi (temporary river) which can seasonally reduce the
   salinity, directly affecting the sea urchin physiology and indirectly
   enhancing the metal toxicity.},

Title = {Evidence for large-amplitude biome and climate changes in Atlantic

Journal = {QUATERNARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {79},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Last interglacial and mid Wisconsinan pollen data from sedimentary
   sequences of Cape Breton Island in Atlantic Canada were analyzed to
   reconstruct biome and climate conditions. Our results show warm and
   humid climate with mean annual temperature 6-7 degrees C higher than
   today, up to 15-20\% more sunshine and significantly longer growing
   season that fostered growth of temperate trees during the optimum of the
   last interglacial. The northern limit of the deciduous forest biome was
   then about 500 km north of its modern limit. Towards the end of the
   interglacial the deciduous forest was replaced by conifer/hardwood
   forest and boreal forest. Climate was then similar to modern. The
   transition from interglacial to glacial was marked by a change towards
   coniferous forest related to colder and dryer conditions. During the mid
   Wisconsinan, the development of forest tundra to boreal forest reflects
   migration of the Arctic Front and significant cooling with mean annual
   temperature anomalies of -8 to -12 degrees C. The overall time series
   reflect large amplitude climate changes that point to high sensitivity
   of the southeastern Canadian margins, likely as a response to
   latitudinal shifts of the Gulf Stream and variable strength of the
   Labrador Current together with changes in large-scale atmospheric
   circulation pattern. (c) 2012 University of Washington. Published by

Title = {Photoinhibition and recovery of the kelp Laminaria saccharina at optimal
   and superoptimal temperatures},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {125},
Number = {4},
Pages = {639-648},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Effects of high irradiance on photosynthetic characteristics were
   examined in sporophytes of the kelp Laminaria saccharina Lamour. from
   1992 to 1994. Exposure to high irradiance (700 mu mol photons
   m(-2)s(-1)) for 1 h at optimal temperature (12 degrees C) caused a 40 to
   60\% decline in photosynthetic efficiency (alpha), quantum yield, and
   the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m), an
   indicator of Photosystem II efficiency. Although the photoinhibition
   effects were partly attributable to protective mechanisms, a concurrent
   increase in minimal fluorescence (F-o) indicated damage to Photosystem
   II reaction centers. The magnitude of photoinhibition was proportional
   to irradiance and duration; however, F-v/F-m was significantly reduced
   after exposure to irradiances as low as 40 to 50 mu mol photons
   m(-2)s(-1) for 1 h, or to 700 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-1) for only 5 min.
   In contrast, photosynthetic capacity (P-max) was affected only at much
   higher irradiance. Superoptimal temperatures up to 24 degrees C did not
   exacerbate high-light effects. At 25 degrees C, however, alpha and P-max
   were more susceptible to photoinhibition than at lower temperatures.
   Recovery from photoinhibition was examined by following F-v/F-m and F-o
   for 24 h after exposure to high light. Recovery of F-v/F-m was fastest
   during the first 1 to 3 h, and slowed or ceased after 6 to 12 h, while
   recovery of F-o was relatively constant over 12 h. Dithiothreitol, which
   blocks formation of energy-dissipating xanthophylls, reduced both the
   initial rate and extent of recovery. Chloramphenicol, which blocks
   chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis, had little effect on initial
   rates of recovery, but stopped recovery after 3 h. Thus, L. saccharina
   appears to rely on the xanthophyll cycle to protect the photosynthetic
   apparatus, and reversal of this protective mechanism causes the rapid
   initial recovery in F-v/F-m. Longterm recovery depends on repair of
   damaged reaction centers. Both the rate and extent of recovery were
   temperature-dependent. The initial rate was higher at 18 to 22 degrees C
   than at 12 degrees C, but the extent of recovery over 24 h declined with
   increasing temperature. High temperatures, therefore, appear to enhance
   protective mechanisms, but disrupt repair processes. L. saccharina from
   Long Island Sound, an ecotype adapted to low light and high temperature,
   showed slightly but consistently greater effects of photoinhibition than
   plants from the Atlantic coast of Maine, but exhibited faster recovery
   at superoptimal temperatures.},

Title = {A Mechanism Study of Reflectance Spectroscopy for Predicting Soil Total
   Nitrogen},
Journal = {SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Reflectance spectroscopy has been widely used for predicting soil
   properties due to its rapidity and convenience. In past decades, the
   application of soil spectroscopy on soil science studies has increased
   exponentially. The total nitrogen (TN) content in soil is an important
   index for soil fertility and the rapid prediction of TN content with
   spectroscopy serves an important function in precision agriculture.
   However, whether the TN content in soil is predicted through its
   relationship with soil organic carbon (SOC) or on its specific
   absorption is still debatable. The objective of this study was to
   explore the mechanism of reflectance spectroscopy for predicting TN in
   soils. Soils used for calibration were sampled from coastal soil in the
   north of Jiangsu province. Partial least squares regression (PLSR)
   analysis was used for the calibration datasets with different TN content
   when the sample number is the same in every dataset. In order to explore
   the mechanism of reflectance spectroscopy for predicting total nitrogen
   in soil, the changes of model accuracies and the correlation of TN and
   SOC were analyzed. The results indicated that the contents of TN and SOC
   in soil were relatively lower because the soil was derived from coastal
   sediments in the past 1 000 years and formed during cultivation. There
   was strong correlation between TN and SOC (R=0. 98). The prediction
   accuracy of TN increased at first and then decreased slightly with the
   increase of mean, standard deviation of TN content. Meanwhile, the
   changes of prediction accuracy comply well with coefficients of
   variation. In conclusion, when the TN content is relatively low (mean
   TN<0. 27 g . kg(-1)), the correlation coefficient between TN and SOC was
   moderately-high and TN was predicted on the basis of N absorbers. When
   the TN content is relatively high (mean TN>0. 29 g . kg(-1)), strong
   correlation coefficients were obtained for TN and SOC and the model
   accuracy of SOC were better than TN. The effect of SOC to spectroscopy
   enhanced with the increase of SOC content, which masked the spectral
   features of N. Therefore, TN was predicted through the correlation with
   SOC when the TN content is high. This study revealed the mechanism of
   reflectance spectroscopy for predicting TN in soil and it could provide
   a theoretical basis for predicting soil TN content rapidly using
   reflectance spectroscopy.},

   Marine species are moving rapidly in response to warming, often in
   different directions and with variations dependent on location and
   depth. Given the current impetus to increase the area of protected ocean
   to 30\%, conservation planning must include the 64\% of the ocean beyond
   national jurisdictions, which in turn requires associated design
   challenges for conventional conservation to be addressed. Here we
   present a planning approach for the high seas that conserves
   biodiversity, minimizes exposure to climate change, retains species
   within reserve boundaries and reduces conflict with fishing. This is
   developed using data from across four depth domains, considering 12,932
   vertebrate, invertebrate and algal species and three climate scenarios.
   The resultant climate-smart conservation areas cover 6\% of the high
   seas and represent a low-regret option that provides a nucleus for
   developing a full network of high-seas marine reserves.},

Title = {Pelagic harmful algal blooms and climate change: Lessons from nature's
   experiments with extremes},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Time series now have sufficient duration to determine harmful algal
   bloom (HAB) responses to changing climate conditions, including warming,
   stratification intensity, freshwater inputs and natural patterns of
   climate variability, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Against the context of time series, such as
   those available from phytoplankton monitoring, dinoflagellate cyst
   records, the Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys, and shellfish toxin
   records, it is possible to identify extreme events that are significant
   departures from long-term means. Extreme weather events can mimic future
   climate conditions and provide a ``dress rehearsal{''} for understanding
   future frequency, intensity and geographic extent of HABs. Three case
   studies of extreme HAB events are described in detail to explore the
   drivers and impacts of these oceanic outliers that may become more
   common in the future. One example is the chain-forming diatom of the
   genus Pseudo-nilzschia in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and its response to
   the 2014-16 northeast Pacific marine heat wave. The other two case
   studies are pelagic flagellates. Highly potent Alexandrium catenella
   group 1 dinoflagellate blooms (up to 150 mg/kg PST in mussels; 4 human
   poisonings) during 2012-17 created havoc for the seafood industry in
   Tasmania, south-eastern Australia, in a poorly monitored area where such
   problems were previously unknown. Early evidence suggests that changes
   in water column stratification during the cold winterspring season are
   driving new blooms caused by a previously cryptic species. An expansion
   of Pseudochattonella cf. verruculosa to the south and A. catenella to
   the north over the past several years resulted in the convergence of
   both species to cause the most catastrophic event in the history of the
   Chilean aquaculture in the austral summer of 2016. Together, these two
   massive blooms were colloquially known as the ``Godzilla-Red tide
   event{''}, resulting in the largest fish farm mortality ever recorded
   worldwide, equivalent to an export loss of USD\$800 million which when
   combined with shellfish toxicity, resulted in major social unrest and
   rioting. Both blooms were linked to the strong El Nino event and the
   positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode, the latter an indicator of
   anthropogenic climate change in the southeastern Pacific region. For
   each of these three examples, representing recent catastrophic events in
   geographically distinct regions, additional targeted monitoring was
   employed to improve the understanding of the climate drivers and
   mechanisms that gave rise to the event and to document the societal
   response. Scientists must be poised to study future extreme HAB events
   as these natural experiments provide unique opportunities to define and
   test multifactorial drivers of blooms.},

Title = {High fatty acid oxidation capacity and phosphorylation control despite

   muscle mitochondria},

Volume = {217},
Number = {16},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are extreme,
   hypoxia-adapted endotherms that rely largely on aerobic metabolism
   during extended breath-hold dives in near-freezing water temperatures.
   While many aspects of their physiology have been characterized to
   account for these remarkable feats, the contribution of adaptations in
   the aerobic powerhouses of muscle cells, the mitochondria, are unknown.
   In the present study, the ontogeny and comparative physiology of
   elephant seal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function was investigated
   under a variety of substrate conditions and respiratory states. Intact
   mitochondrial networks were studied by high-resolution respirometry in
   saponin-permeabilized fiber bundles obtained from primary swimming
   muscles of pup, juvenile and adult seals, and compared with fibers from
   adult human vastus lateralis. Results indicate that seal muscle
   maintains a high capacity for fatty acid oxidation despite a progressive
   decrease in total respiratory capacity as animals mature from pups to
   adults. This is explained by a progressive increase in phosphorylation
   control and fatty acid utilization over pyruvate in adult seals compared
   with humans and seal pups. Interestingly, despite higher indices of
   oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, juvenile and adult seals also
   exhibit a similar to 50\% greater capacity for respiratory `leak'
   compared with humans and seal pups. The ontogeny of this phenotype
   suggests it is an adaptation of muscle to the prolonged breath-hold
   exercise and highly variable ambient temperatures experienced by mature
   elephant seals. These studies highlight the remarkable plasticity of
   mammalian mitochondria to meet the demands for both efficient ATP
   production and endothermy in a cold, oxygen-limited environment.},

Title = {Potamoplankton and primary productivity in the River Danube},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {729},
Number = {1},
Pages = {209-227},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Autochthonous production of potamoplankton has recently attracted
   greater interest as it was incorporated into expanded river concepts
   such as the flow pulse concept or the riverine productivity model (RPM).
   This review assembles data on primary production from the River Danube
   to evaluate the importance of productivity in large rivers. Results
   indicate positive net production in the middle reach of the river and in
   impoundments. These sections are characterised by favourable conditions
   for algal growth. Reduction in flow, reduced concentrations of suspended
   solids and improved under-water light result in significant increase in
   plankton biomass. Maximum chlorophyll concentrations were below 20 mg
   m(-3) in 2007 but concentrations up to 130 mg m(-3) have been recorded
   in the past. Since nutrients are not limiting, as in most large rivers,
   net primary production is largely controlled by availability of
   photosynthetic active radiation under water, chlorophyll-a, water depth
   and discharge. Hourly carbon uptake rates of 3-130 mg C m(-3) h(-1)
   observed in the Danube are well within the range of 0-790 mg C m(-3)
   h(-1) for large rivers of the world. Autochthonous autotrophic
   production must be regarded as an important feature of large rivers
   supporting the RPM concept.},

Abstract = {The over-exploitation both of natural and enhanced sturgeon stocks for
   caviar production along with serious habitat deteriorations has led to
   drastic declines in the natural populations. As a consequence, IUCN in
   1997 listed all commercially utilised sturgeon species world-wide in
   Annex II of the CITES regulations, thus requiring internationally agreed
   quotas for trade in order to promote protection. Demands for caviar on
   traditional export markets (Europe, US, Japan, Russia, and China) based
   on trade data from the 1980s and 1990s were extrapolated into the future
   to range from 300 tonnes to a maximum of 2000 tonnes annually.
   Historically, international trade comprised 500 tonnes per year with a
   marked proportion of resale over 2 years following the catch. If these
   trade figures are a realistic reflection of the market, the future of
   caviar trade will mainly be determined by demand-driven price
   structures. The feasibility of caviar production from aquaculture was
   already assessed in the 1980s, predicting an increasing importance on
   world markets. Russia, Iran, the European Union, and USA were among the
   major producers and consumers in the past. New entities in the range
   states as well as outside are increasingly contributing to the market,
   resulting in a substantial influence on the structure of the industry.
   The present total output of about 80-100 tonnes of caviar from
   aquaculture is now already exceeding the 2006 legal caviar yield from
   fisheries in the Caspian area (primarily supported by ocean ranching)
   while being close to the 2007/2008 quotas. Future trends for large scale
   caviar production are discussed, taking into account some of the
   scenarios the industry is most likely to face, including uncertainties
   in the market (e. g. rapid production increase and market sensitivities
   to overproduction with price structure effects, stress effects in
   production costs, reduced profit margins, product diversification;
   growing competition from alternative products) and opportunities
   (decreasing pressures on natural stocks; improved image) of this
   relatively new branch of aquaculture.},

Title = {Export flux of POC in the main stream of the Kuroshio},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {{[}1] Particulate organic carbon (POC) export fluxes were measured using
   both a drifting sediment trap and a (234)Th approach ( ratio of
   POC/(234)Th multiple (234)Th flux) in the main steam of the Kuroshio in
   August, 2006. The POC fluxes measured by sediment traps and the (234)Th
   approach at 65, 90, 120 and 140 m ranged from 20 to 54 mg m(-2) d(-1),
   and 26 to 67 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The results show that using
   POC/(234)Th ratios in intermediate particles ( 10-53 mu m) and sinking
   particles is more comparable to the POC flux measured by sediment traps.
   Therefore, the POC export fluxes within the euphotic zone estimated by
   sediment trap and (234)Th approaches are complementary methods for
   measuring POC flux in the Kuroshio.},

Title = {Endangered Species Act listing: three case studies of data deficiencies
   and consequences of ESA `threatened' listing on research output},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {15-21},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Determining whether a species warrants listing as threatened or
   endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act depends on the
   government's assessment of the species' extinction risk, usually in
   response to a petition. Deciding whether data are sufficient to make a
   listing determination is a challenging part of the process. We examined
   three case studies involving corals. A petition for deep-sea corals was
   rejected for full status review of the species, based on insufficient
   information on population trends and threats. Information on threats for
   82 tropical corals was sufficient to propose listing of 66 species.
   Significant population declines and identified threats resulted in
   listing two Atlantic Acropora corals as `Threatened'. There was no
   decrease in journal publication rate on the Acropora species after that
   listing, and no decrease in research permit applications in marine
   protected areas. However, the effects of listings on research that might
   help to sustain or recover species remains largely unknown.},

Title = {Structurally controlled hydrocarbon seeps on a glaciated continental

Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {252},
Number = {3-4},

Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {This paper describes structurally controlled gas seeps and their
   influence on seafloor morphology at sites within Queen Charlotte Basin
   (QCB); a sedimentary basin situated offshore British Columbia, western
   Canada. Numerous surficial and shallow sediment features related to both
   ice cover and shallow gas have been identified in high-resolution
   multichannel seismic, Huntec deep-towed seismic, multibeam bathymetry
   and backscatter, and piston core data that were acquired over a 10 km by
   10 km grid in an eastern part of QCB. Pockmarks, seafloor mounds and
   iceberg ploughmarks are visible in the multibeam data; small-scale
   folds, vertical blank zones and acoustic turbidity are observed in the
   Huntec data. The multichannel seismic data show a faulted-anticline,
   phase-reversed bright spots, zones of low instantaneous frequency and
   velocity pull-ups. One seafloor mound lies directly above a shallow
   fault that offsets an asymmetric fold. The remaining mounds lie either
   above or in close proximity to asymmetric folds that are faulted. Bright
   spots are observed along some fault traces and within a cut and fill
   sequence at two-way travel times between 0.42 and 1.0 s. Velocity
   pull-ups are observed in the multichannel data below gas expansion voids
   present in piston cores. Backscatter data show that seafloor mounds are
   highly reflective compared to the surrounding seafloor. These
   observations indicate that gas has been migrating upward through the
   rock column and expelled into the shallow sediments. The shallow gas has
   been biologically mediated to form carbonate sediments within and around
   seafloor mounds; shallow gas has also deformed surficial sediments into
   positive relief mounds and negative relief pockmarks. Crown Copyright

Title = {Nonlinear Response of Tension Leg Platform Subjected to Wave, Current

Abstract = {Tension leg platform (TLP) superstructure and submerged areas are being
   subjected to wind and wave forces during their lifetime, yet the
   magnitude of each respective energy density affects the TLP response.
   The present work aims to study the influence of possible load
   combinations on the response of the TLP. In order to achieve this
   objective, the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) spectrum and Simiu
   and Leigh wind spectrum were used for the computation of wave and wind
   spectral densities. Airy wave theory and Morison equation were adopted
   for the calculation of wave kinematics and forces on the platform. The
   variable submergence, drag force in the Morison equation, tension
   fluctuation from large displacement were the sources of nonlinearities
   considered. Subsequently, mathematical formulation for the dynamic
   analysis of intact and a tether-missing TLP was developed in FORTRAN
   software. The nonlinear equation of motion was solved using Newmark-Beta
   scheme coded in the software. From our findings, the sea state with high
   significant wave height and wave period suppressed the effect of current
   and wind loads on the TLP motion response as compared to the sea state
   with low sea state parameters. The effect of wind drag force increases
   the surge and heave responses, but the overall influence of the current
   drag depends on the magnitude of the wave energy spectrum. There was no
   abrupt behaviour when a tether was missing although the loss of tether's
   stiffness slightly affects the TLP motion and tension variation.},

Title = {Microstructural and electrochemical characterization of coatings used in
   energy field applications},
Journal = {METALLURGIA ITALIANA},
Year = {2010},
Number = {10},
Pages = {13-20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Research and development is very important in energy field as far as the
   available technologies are too expensive and show some problems
   regarding the corrosion resistance. The exploited energy reservoirs
   contain an high amount of aggressive chemical species, for this reason
   the mechanical components, employed in power plants, require high
   mechanical strength, thermal stability and high resistance to aggressive
   environments.
   The aim of this work was the comparison of different coatings, possible
   candidates for energy field applications, by means of microstructure and
   corrosion resistance.
   These coatings were deposited on ASTM 387 grade 22 steel, an alloy with
   high creep strength but low corrosion resistance. The selected coatings
   were deposited with three different technologies: 2 thermal spray
   processes and Ni-P electroless deposition. In particular the steel
   substrate was coated with: Ni-P coatings obtained by electroless
   process, cermet or metal alloy coatings sprayed with HVOF technology and
   ceramic coatings sprayed with APS technology. The tested coated systems
   configuration were: substrate+coating, substrate+interlayer+coating and
   some of this systems were also treated with epossidic resin to seal the
   porosity and increase the corrosion resistance of the coated steel.
   The various samples were morphologically characterized with optical
   microscope, determining the coating thickness and the porosity; the
   microstructure and chemical composition was verified with SEM EDXS and
   the average micro hardness was acquired.
   The corrosion resistance was evaluated by polarization curves. These
   curves were acquired using a potentiostat with a three electrode
   configuration in sulphide and chloride containing media. The solution
   composition simulate an aggressive environment, similar to petrochemical
   or geothermical one.},

Volume = {63},

Pages = {693-696},
Abstract = {The 11 March 2011 Tohoku Earthquake ruptured the interplate boundary
   off-shore of east Japan, with fault displacements of up to 40 m and a
   rupture duration of 150-160 s. W-phase inversion indicates a moment of
   3.9 x 10(22) N m (M(w) 9.0) and a centroid time of 71 s. We invert
   teleseismic P waves and broadband Rayleigh wave observations with
   high-rate GPS recordings from Japan to characterize the rupture. The
   resulting rupture model begins with a steady increase of moment rate for
   the first 80 s, and a rupture speed of 1.5 km/s. Then the rupture
   expands southwestward at a speed of about 2.5 km/s. The model's primary
   slip is concentrated updip from the hypocenter, with significant
   displacement extending to the trench. The seaward location of large slip
   is consistent with estimates of the tsunami source area from regional
   and remote tsunami observations. The region with large slip is
   approximately 150-km wide by 300-km long, which is relatively compact
   compared with the 200-km wide, 500-km long aftershock region. The
   model's initial updip rupture expansion and the location of most slip
   updip of the hypocenter differs from P-wave array back-projections,
   which map high-frequency radiation along the downdip of the hypocenter,
   closer to the coast.},

Title = {Permafrost Degradation within Eastern Chukotka CALM Sites in the 21st
   Century Based on CMIP5 Climate Models},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Permafrost degradation caused by contemporary climate change
   significantly affects arctic regions. Active layer thickening combined
   with the thaw subsidence of ice-rich sediments leads to irreversible
   transformation of permafrost conditions and activation of exogenous
   processes, such as active layer detachment, thermokarst and thermal
   erosion. Climatic and permafrost models combined with a field monitoring
   dataset enable the provision of predicted estimations of the active
   layer and permafrost characteristics. In this paper, we present the
   projections of active layer thickness and thaw subsidence values for two
   Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) sites of Eastern Chukotka
   coastal plains. The calculated parameters were used for estimation of
   permafrost degradation rates in this region for the 21st century under
   various IPCC climate change scenarios. According to the studies, by the
   end of the century, the active layer will be 6-13\% thicker than current
   values under the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 2.6 climate
   scenario and 43-87\% under RCP 8.5. This process will be accompanied by
   thaw subsidence with the rates of 0.4-3.7 cm.a(-1). Summarized surface
   level lowering will have reached up to 5 times more than current active
   layer thickness. Total permafrost table lowering by the end of the
   century will be from 150 to 310 cm; however, it will not lead to
   non-merging permafrost formation.},

Abstract = {A study was undertaken to assess the morphological variations during the
   period 1969-2018 in the twenty-one islands in Gulf of Mannar, southeast
   India, using Survey of India Toposheet, Google Earth images and field
   survey techniques. The results show that two of the islands have eroded
   and submerged, fifteen islands area cover has reduced and four have
   their area expanded during the last 49 years. Overall, the Tuticorin
   group of islands has experienced the highest percentage of land cover
   reduction (78.55\%), followed by Keelakarai (43.49\%), Vembar (36.21\%)
   and Mandapam (21.84\%) groups. The exceptions are the four islands of
   the Mandapam group viz. Hare, Manoli, Krusadai and Shingle, whose area
   covers have increased (16.44\%). A small change in the area of an island
   induces a greater change in its morphology. From the Island Change Ratio
   plot, it is observed that islands with an area cover of 10-30 ha have
   suffered loss of more area cover and undergone mobility from the core
   area. The constant changes undergone and the mobility exhibited by these
   islands clearly indicate that they are dynamic. The main factors that
   are responsible for the current changes in their extent and position are
   coral mining and sea level rise. Thus, it is clear that the low-lying
   reef islands of Gulf of Mannar are very dynamic, and that their
   expansion, loss in area cover and mobility are mainly controlled by
   coral mining and climate change. Immediate conservation action is
   necessary to prevent the islands from submergence.},

Abstract = {Food and medication security is an unseen battle occurring during the
   outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sustainable rice supplies are crucial
   during a pandemic period, especially in Southeast Asian countries (SEA
   countries). This study analyzes the vulnerability level of SEA countries
   regarding rice supply, with alternative import strategies recommended.
   By employing RCA, CAaA, and XCA indexes, the comparative advantage and
   competitiveness of rice-exporting countries are analyzed. The study
   shows that Malaysia and Singapore are highly vulnerable regarding rice
   crisis, while Indonesia, Philippines, and Brunei are moderately
   vulnerable. Thailand and Vietnam supply 76.74\% of SEA countries' rice
   imports. SEA importers should consider alternative import strategies in
   order to reduce their high-risk dependency on the supply of rice from
   Thailand and Vietnam. XCA analysis results show that India, Thailand,
   Pakistan, Vietnam, China, and the USA are more competitive and have
   better comparative advantages as compared to other rice exporters with a
   high supply volume or lower prices. The alternative rice-exporting
   suppliers that could be considered by SEA countries are Paraguay,
   Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Additionally, this paper introduces the
   XCA index and CAaA index to complement the bias of the RCA index.},

Title = {Productivity and nutrient dynamics of tropical sea-grass communities in

Pages = {411-417},

Abstract = {Tropical sea-grass ecosystems are among the most productive submerged
   systems to be found. This productivity supports, through dependent
   species of epiphytes and associated fauna, large numbers of fish which
   are important protein sources for the inhabitants of tropical coastal
   areas. In Puttalam Lagoon, Sri Lanka, one such ecosystem, with an
   important fish harvest to support the coastal population, was studied in
   two consecutive years during the monsoon season, October 1993 and
   November 1994. The meadows consisted predominantly of two species of sea
   grasses, Cymodocea rotundata and Enhalus acoroides. Oxygen production
   and consumption measurements using benthic chambers placed over the
   sea-grass communities revealed gross production to be between 574 and
   1518 g C m(-2) yr(-1). All measurements showed community P:R ratios to
   be > 1.0, suggesting net export and/or burial of carbon in the system.
   The two years showed different patterns, but the variation in production
   rates was best explained by light penetration and salinity. Nutrient
   measurements showed phosphate uptake (17-82 mg P m(-2) day(-1)) while
   nitrogen fluxes displayed both release and uptake (-110 to 207 mg N
   m(-2) day(-1)). Analyses of nutrient dynamics as related to production
   rates indicated a dependency of the communities on sediment nutrient
   sources and internal nutrient recycling, despite elevated levels of
   water column nutrients (42-168 mu g N L(-1), 57-184 mu g P L(-1)).
   Production levels were low compared to other similar ecosystems and this
   is thought to be due to factors including dense epiphytic growth and
   high water turbidity resulting from the high nutrient levels, and
   seasonality.},

Abstract = {Excessive usage of nonrenewable resources to meet global energy
   requirements has become a serious concern from the energy and
   environmental perspective. The continuous emission of CO2 in the
   environment from fossil fuels has become a major cause of global
   warming. Green hydrogen generation through seawater electrolysis has
   been an emergent technology that can play a prominent role in replacing
   conventional energy sources. Electrolysis of seawater using renewable
   sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal generates green hydrogen
   which has almost negligible harmful byproducts. Different ions present
   in seawater such as chlorides and sulfates impose serious corrosion
   problems during the electrolysis process as chloride ions penetrate the
   metal electrode surface and oxidize it and also liberate chlorine gas at
   the anode. For the electrolysis processes, catalysis plays a challenging
   task to reduce the kinetic barrier for the conversion of water molecules
   to hydrogen and oxygen products. Photoelectrocatalysts are another kind
   of semiconductor-based catalyst in which band gap, exchange charge
   carrier, and surface area play key roles in the water-splitting process.
   Two-dimensional nanomaterials offer many advantages like high specific
   surface area for electron transfer, high tunable functionalities, and
   flexible structural properties that make them suitable for different
   applications. Layered double hydroxide (LDH) as a highly efficient
   catalyst has the potential to perform the hydrogen production process as
   per the industrial application. LDH has many advantages in an effective
   water-splitting mechanism that includes easy synthesis methods, flexible
   morphology, long-term stability, and adaptability to different
   applications. Another major advantage is the corrosion inhibition
   property of LDH by different mechanisms like adsorption of corrosion
   responsible ions, self-healing technique, and protective film formation
   which are discussed briefly in this review. This review provides a
   state-of-the-art analysis about the various important strategies to be
   adopted for effective seawater electrolysis. Finally, we examine the new
   challenges and the novel approaches to suppress corrosion processes
   during seawater electrolysis.},

Title = {An approach to incorporating inferred connectivity of adult movement
   into marine protected area design with limited data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools that can
   support the resilience of marine ecosystems. Many countries, including
   Canada, have committed to protecting at least 10\% of their marine areas
   under the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11, which
   includes connectivity as a key aspect. Connectivity, the movement of
   individuals among habitats, can enhance population stability and
   resilience within and among MPAs. However, little is known about
   regional spatial patterns of marine ecological connectivity,
   particularly adult movement. We developed a method to assess and design
   MPA networks that maximize inferred connectivity within habitat types
   for adult movement when ecological data are limited. We used the
   Northern Shelf Bioregion in British Columbia, Canada, to explore two
   different approaches: (1) evaluating sites important for inferred
   regional connectivity (termed hotspots) and (2) assessing MPA network
   configurations based on their overlap with connectivity hotspots and
   interconnectedness between MPAs. To assess inferred connectivity via
   adult movement, we used two different threshold distances (15 and 50 km)
   to capture moderate home ranges, which are most appropriate to consider
   in MPA design. We applied graph theory to assess inferred connectivity
   within 16 habitat and depth categories (proxies for distinct ecological
   communities), and used novel multiplex network methodologies to perform
   an aggregated assessment of inferred connectivity. We evaluated inferred
   regional connectivity hotspots based on betweenness and eigenvector
   centrality metrics, finding that the existing MPA network overlapped a
   moderate proportion of these regional hotspots and identified key areas
   to be considered as candidate MPAs. Network density among existing MPAs
   was low within the individual habitat networks, as well as the
   multiplex. This work informs an ongoing MPA planning process, and
   approaches for incorporating connectivity into MPA design when data are
   limited, with lessons for other contexts.},

Abstract = {Microbial communities are ubiquitous in marine intertidal environments.
   These communities, which grow preferentially as biofilms on natural and
   artificial surfaces, carry out key processes contributing to the
   functioning of coastal environments and providing valuable services to
   human society, including carbon cycling, primary productivity, trophic
   linkage, and transfer and removal of pollutants. In addition, their
   surface-associated life style greatly influences the integrity and
   performance of marine infrastructure and archaeological heritage
   materials. The fluctuating conditions of the intertidal zone make it an
   extreme environment to which intertidal biofilm organisms must adapt at
   varying levels. This requirement has probably favored the development
   and spread of specific microorganisms with particular physiological and
   metabolic processes. These organisms may have potential biotechnological
   utility, in that they may provide novel secondary metabolites,
   biopolymers, lipids, and enzymes and even processes for the production
   of energy in a sustainable manner.},

Abstract = {Aquaculture is an increasingly relevant sector in the exploitation of
   natural resources; therefore, it is appropriate to propose various
   models that include the fundamental variables for its economic-financial
   valuation from a business point of view. The objective of this paper is
   to analyze different models for the valuation of investment projects in
   a company in the aquaculture sector in order to conclude whether there
   is a model that represents a better valuation. Therefore, in this study,
   four valuation models have been applied, three classical models (net
   present value, internal rate of return, and payback) and a more recent
   model, real options (RO) for a company producing and marketing seaweed
   in Galicia (region located in the northwest of Spain). The results
   obtained, RO ((sic) 5,527,144.04) and net present value ((si)
   5,479,659.19), conclude that the RO model estimates a higher added value
   by taking into account in its calculations the flexibility given by the
   expansion option. Future lines of research include the application of
   valuation models that have been applied to companies belonging to the
   same sector in order to compare whether the results found are similar.},

Title = {Sea or summit? Wild reindeer spatial responses to changing high-arctic
   winters},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Because of climate change, wildlife is facing altered environments,
   including profound shifts in temperature and precipitation regimes. In
   snow-dominated ecosystems, winter warming and resulting changes in
   snowpack properties impact forage accessibility for ungulates-often for
   the worse. The potential of individuals and populations to buffer
   negative fitness effects of harsh winters with ``basal ice{''} (i.e.,
   ice on the ground) and/or a harder or deeper snowpack depends on their
   ability to adjust behaviorally through changes in diet, dispersal, or
   small-scale habitat use. Here, we use ten years of late winter snowpack
   monitoring and population census data from three neighboring,
   semi-isolated coastal populations of high-arctic wild Svalbard reindeer
   to explore small-scale space use responses to annual variation in late
   winter-foraging conditions. Based on location data from the population
   censuses, we roughly classified individuals' spatial foraging strategy
   (i.e., habitat use) during late winter into ``tundra{''} (foraging on
   tundra plains), ``mountain{''} (foraging at high elevations, with low
   plant biomass but less snow and ice), or ``shore{''} (foraging along the
   seashore, subsidizing terrestrial food with kelp and seaweed). Using
   multinomial logistic regression, we modeled the probability of reindeer
   adopting either of these strategies as a function of density-dependent
   winter severity. Our results suggest that effects of winter severity on
   habitat use are density-dependent and that snowpack depth and hardness
   (excluding basal ice, measured as ``integrated ram hardness,{''} IRH)
   have stronger influence on reindeer foraging behavior than basal ice, at
   least at such spatial scales. Particularly, high IRH increased the
   probability of reindeer seeking high-elevation and steep terrain instead
   of tundra lowlands, but not at low population density, that is, when
   competition for food is negligible. This strategy was most pronounced
   among adult males, possibly reflecting their risk-prone behavior and/or
   reduced competitiveness related to lack of antlers during winter. This
   study demonstrates important patterns of temporal, spatial, and
   demographic variation in reindeer's winter-foraging strategies, adding
   novel, nuanced insights into how climate change affects spatial
   processes in isolated ungulate populations. The results add to the
   impression of considerable behavioral flexibility, which may aid
   buffering the negative fitness effects of complex changes in foraging
   conditions due to environmental changes.},

Abstract = {This work presents a simple dynamical solar-thermal modelling and
   cost-optimized solution for heating houses in maritime climates by using
   many vacuum-tube solar collectors together with one small well-insulated
   aboveground water tank and the underfloor hot-water heating system. This
   was performed for a single house in the cold-maritime climate of
   Bariloche (13,000 kWh/y), which could be fully satisfied by using ten
   collectors on 70 degrees-inclined roof and 4.6 m(3) tank, costing
   euro12,900. This cost is noticeably lower than for previous large
   projects in cold-continental climates, what is supported by four key
   factors: (1) solar resource and heating demand in maritime climates are
   more distributed than in continental climates; (2) small aboveground
   tanks can get noticeably higher efficiencies and lower costs that huge
   underground tanks; (3) vacuum-tube collectors get higher performances
   than flat collectors during winters; (4) high winter solar yield is
   achieved by installing collectors on high tilt angles (or half on
   low-inclined roofs and half on walls). These four factors will be
   discussed by solar-thermal and cost analyses, by comparing the system
   performance for climatic conditions of Bariloche and Okotoks.},

Title = {Coupling between primary production and pelagic consumption in temperate

Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {49},
Number = {20},

Abstract = {Three fates potentially consume primary production occurring on ocean
   margins: portions can be oxidized within the water column, portions can
   sediment to shelf/slope depots, and portions can be exported to the
   interior ocean. Zooplankton mediate all three of these processes and
   thus can alter the pathway and residence time of particulate organic
   carbon. As part of both US DOE- and NSF-sponsored studies on the Cape
   Hatteras and South Atlantic Bight (SAB) shelves, the role of
   microzooplankton in these processes was determined by measuring
   phytoplankton production and its consumption by microzooplankton.
   Grazing and growth rates were measured during 46 dilution incubation
   experiments using chlorophyll a (chl a) as a proxy for phytoplankton
   (prey) biomass. Chl a production and grazing were determined for the <
   200 gm phytoplankton community and also the < 8 gm size class. Primary
   production at Cape Hatteras was determined using (HCO3-)-C-14
   incubations during two Lagrangian drifter studies lasting several days
   in March and July 1996. From similar measurements during cross-shelf
   transects over larger spatial scales, primary production was also
   calculated for the Hatteras study area using a wavelength-resolved
   bio-optical model. Primary production during the Lagrangian studies was
   generally 0.5-1.0gC/m(2)/d in March and 0.5-2.0 gC/m(2)/d in July.
   Modeled estimates of primary production for the larger Hatteras study
   region in March and July averaged 1.8 gC/m(2)/d . Typically, < 8 mum
   cells contributed one-half or more of primary production. Positive
   linear regressions described relationships between phytoplankton
   production measured as changes in chl a and its grazing by
   microzooplankton. In the dilution experiments conducted throughout the
   SAB and Hatteras shelves, microzooplankton grazed 65\% of <200 mum chl a
   production, and 81\% of < 8 mum chl a production. These relationships
   were temperature-dependent: losses of chl a production in both size
   fractions to microzooplankton herbivory increased with increasing
   temperature. Higher grazing rates were found in the < 8 mum compared to
   the < 200 mum size class. Model regressions were used to estimate the
   impact of microzooplankton grazing on (HCO3-)-C-14-derived estimates of
   primary production in Cape Hatteras shelf waters. Integrated water
   column grazing removed 40\% and 58\% of <200 mum and <8 mum primary
   production, respectively, during the Lagrangian experiment in March, and
   61 \% and 74\% in July. Averaged over larger spatial scales using a
   bio-optical model, microzooplankton ingested 42\% and 61 \% of primary
   production in March and July, respectively, with an overall mean of
   52\%. These data generally support the notion that, contrary to
   traditional paradigms about shelf ecosystems, small autotrophs
   contributed significantly to production, and that this carbon was
   actively incorporated into the microbial food web. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {EPINEPHRINE OR GV-26 ELECTRICAL STIMULATION REDUCES INHALANT ANESTHESTIC
   RECOVERY TIME IN COMMON SNAPPING TURTLES (CHELYDRA SERPENTINA)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Prolonged anesthetic recovery times are a common clinical problem in
   reptiles following inhalant anesthesia. Diving reptiles have numerous
   adaptations that allow them to submerge and remain apneic for extended
   periods. An ability to shunt blood away from pulmonary circulation,
   possibly due to changes in adrenergic tone, may contribute to their
   unpredictable inhalant anesthetic recovery times. Therefore, the use of
   epinephrine could antagonize this response and reduce recovery time.
   GV-26, an acupuncture point with reported beta-adrenergic and
   respiratory effects, has reduced anesthetic recovery times in other
   species. In this prospective randomized crossover study, six common
   snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) were anesthetized with inhalant
   isoflurane for 90 min. Turtles were assigned one of three treatments,
   given immediately following discontinuation of isoflurane: a control
   treatment (0.9\% saline, at 0.1 ml/kg i.m.), epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg
   i.m.), or acupuncture with electrical stimulation at GV-26. Each turtle
   received all treatments, and treatments were separated by 48 hr. Return
   of spontaneous ventilation was 55\% faster in turtles given epinephrine
   and 58\% faster in the GV-26 group versus saline (P < 0.001). The times
   to movement and to complete recovery were also significantly faster for
   both treatments than for saline (P < 0.02). Treated turtles displayed
   increases in temperature not documented in the control (P < 0.001).
   Turtles administered epinephrine showed significantly increased heart
   rates and end-tidal CO2 (P < 0.001). No adverse effects were noted in
   the study animals. The mechanisms of action were not elucidated in the
   present investigation. Nevertheless, the use of parenteral epinephrine
   or GV-26 stimulation in the immediate postanesthetic period produces
   clinically relevant reductions in anesthetic recovery time in common
   snapping turtle. Further research is necessary to evaluate the effects
   of concurrent GV-26 and epinephrine administration and to assess
   responses in other reptilian species.},

Abstract = {Marine sponges are key players in the transfer of carbon from the
   pelagic microbial food web into the benthos. Selective uptake of
   prokaryotic picoplankton (<2 mu m) by a demosponge (Callyspongia sp.),
   and carbon flux through this process, were examined for the first time
   in the oligotrophic coastal waters of southwestern Australia, where
   sponge abundance and biodiversity ranks among the highest in the world.
   Water sampling and flow rate measurements were conducted over five
   sampling occasions following the InEx method of Yahel et al. (2005),
   with heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic Synechococcus cyanobacteria
   identified and enumerated by flow cytometry. Callyspongia sp.
   demonstrated high filtration efficiencies, particularly for high DNA
   (HDNA) bacteria (up to 85.3\% in summer 2008) and Synechococcus (up to
   91.1\% in autumn 2007), however efficiency varied non-uniformly with
   time and food type (p < 0.01). Overall filtration efficiency for
   Synechococcus (86.6 +/- 6.3\%; mean +/- s.d.) was always significantly
   higher (p < 0.05) than for low DNA (LDNA) bacteria (40 +/- 17.2\%),
   except during winter 2007 (p = 0.14) when ambient Synechococcus
   concentrations were lowest. When compared to ambient abundances of the
   different food types, Callyspongia sp. exhibited consistently negative
   selectivity for LDNA bacteria and positive selectivity for
   Synechococcus, while HDNA bacteria was generally a neutral or positive
   selection. The total carbon removal rate (sum of all prokaryotic
   picoplankton cells), calculated on a per unit area basis, varied
   significantly with time (p, < 0.01), with lowest rates recorded during
   the winter (0.5 +/- 0.4-0.6 +/- 0.8 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and highest values
   recorded in summer (3.5 +/- 1.9 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). These flux estimates
   quantify the role of a demosponge species in the ultimate fate of
   prokaryotic picoplankton within the nearshore food webs of southwestern
   Australia, and support the conclusion that sponges actively select food
   particles that optimise their nutritional intake. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Regional extinction risks for marine bony fishes occurring in the
   Persian/Arabian Gulf},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {230},
Pages = {10-19},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Persian/Arabian Gulf (hereafter, `the Gulf') is an environmentally
   extreme sea that is being increasingly affected by climate change and
   anthropogenic stressors, and concern is growing about the future of
   marine biodiversity in the region. However, identification of species
   and habitats most in need of conservation is challenging as
   comprehensive information on species-specific threats and population
   statuses is lacking. Through application of the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List methodology - the global accepted
   standard for classifying extinction risk at the species level - we
   evaluated the regional conservation status of 471 species of marine bony
   fishes in the Gulf. The best estimate of the proportion of regionally
   threatened marine bony fishes, based on all species for which sufficient
   data were available for assessment, is 8.2\%; this is at least twice the
   proportion of other regions where such assessments have been undertaken.
   Primary threats include those related to fisheries and harvesting and
   those related to coastal development and loss of habitat, impacting 47\%
   and 32\% of marine bony fishes, respectively. Such threats are
   particularly acute in nearshore areas where spatial analyses indicated
   high species richness. The future of Gulf ecosystems, and the survival
   of the marine bony fishes, will depend on concerted, collaborative
   efforts among all Gulf States to develop efficient and effective local
   and regional marine conservation practices and policies, particularly
   for species assessed as regionally threatened.},

Title = {Comparative life cycle assessment of heterotrophic microalgae
   Schizochytrium and fish oil in sustainable aquaculture feeds},
Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Fish oil is primarily extracted from small marine pelagic fishes,
   reducing their availability for marine wildlife forage and artisanal
   fishing catches that support food security in lower income coastal
   nations. A primary use of fish oil is in feeds for aquaculture, the
   world's fastest growing food sector. Efforts to transition fed
   aquaculture to sustainability includes replacing fish oil in aquafeeds
   with more environmentally responsible alternative ingredients. The
   heterotrophic marine microalga Schizochytrium sp., one of the first
   commercialized alternatives, lacks an open-access, systematic analysis
   of environmental impacts of substituting fish oil with heterotrophic
   microalgae from biorefineries. This study compared the ``cradle to
   factory-gate{''} life cycle impacts of fish oil to whole-cell or
   extracted oil of Schizochytrium combined with canola oil. We conducted
   an attributional life cycle assessment using inventory data collected
   from published literature and patents and received feedback on
   commercial relevance of model assumptions from industry advisors. We
   examined sugar from a Brazilian sugarcane biorefinery and sucrose from
   U.S. sugar beets as feedstocks for heterotrophic cultivation of
   Schizochytrium; and compared life cycle impacts of extracting
   Schizochytrium oil using solvent-free microwave extraction to
   conventional solvent extraction. Results were that: cultivation
   processes had the largest overall effect for both products in both
   regions; whole-cell Schizochytrium combined with canola oil had
   significantly lower environmental impacts, in all assessed categories,
   than Schizochytrium oil blended with canola oil; and conventional
   solvent extraction had significantly lower environmental impacts
   compared to solvent-free microwave extraction except global warming
   potential. Schizochytrium products, compared to fish oil, had
   substantially lower biotic resource depletion and, in the case of whole
   cells combined with canola oil, had significantly lower global warming
   potential but higher impacts for all other categories, primarily because
   commercial Schizochytrium production used sugar feedstocks as carbon and
   energy sources. The mix of lower and higher environmental impacts of
   Schizochytrium products illustrates the importance of openly identifying
   environmental trade-offs to inform evidence-based decisions for
   commercial practices. Environmental impacts should also be weighed
   against potential human health benefits of maintaining omega- 3 fatty
   acids and avoiding contaminants in fish flesh when considering
   alternatives to fish oil.},

Abstract = {The thermal protection system is an essential part of any launch
   vehicle. Standoff metallic thermal protection system (TPS) panels
   protect the vehicle from the hostile environment on the panel exterior;
   consequently, the panels are exposed to a variety A loads including high
   temperature thermal stresses, thermal shock, acoustic pressure, and
   foreign object impact. These loads can cause degradation in the health
   of mechanically attached metallic TPS panels in the form of, for
   example, face sheet buckling, deformation/cracking of standoff bolts and
   standoffs or wrinkling to thermal sea's. In this work, two sets of
   experiments were performed. The first experiment aimed to partially
   recreate the acoustic environment that the TPS experiences during
   service by subjecting the panel to broadband noise broadcast from a
   loudspeaker. In this set of experiments, ``damage{''} was introduced
   into the TPS by loosening standoff fasteners to represent cracked or
   warped bolts and a transmissibility-based damage index was implemented
   to detect and locate damage. The second experiment was designed to
   examine the variation in damage indices when the panel is subjected to
   combined thermo-acoustic loading. In this set of experiments, the panel
   was not subjected to any `{''}damage{''}; instead, the exterior of the
   panel was heated with an infrared heat lamp while being excited by
   acoustic noise. It is demonstrated that the transmissibility-based
   damage indicator is a viable method for detecting and locating damage in
   the TPS panel. it is also shown that damage present in the panel may
   become more or less identifiable while the system is subjected to
   thermal loading. This paper was approved for unlimited public release on
   February 18, 2005; LA-UR-05-1192.},

Title = {Slalom: Coasting Through Raw Data via Adaptive Partitioning and Indexing},

Abstract = {The constant flux of data and queries alike has been pushing the
   boundaries of data analysis systems. The increasing size of raw data
   files has made data loading an expensive operation that delays the
   data-to-insight time. Hence, recent in-situ query processing systems
   operate directly over raw data, alleviating the loading cost. At the
   same time, analytical workloads have increasing number of queries.
   Typically, each query focuses on a constantly shifting yet small -
   range. Minimizing the workload latency, now, requires the benefits of
   indexing in in-situ query processing.
   In this paper, we present Slalom, an in-situ query engine that
   accommodates workload shifts by monitoring user access patterns. Slalom
   makes on-the-fly partitioning and indexing decisions, based on
   information collected by lightweight monitoring. Slalom has two key
   components: (i) an online partitioning and indexing scheme, and (ii) a
   partitioning and indexing tuner tailored for in-situ query engines. When
   compared to the state of the art, Slalom offers performance benefits by
   taking into account user query patterns to (a) logically partition raw
   data files and (b) build for each partition lightweight
   partition-specific indexes. Due to its lightweight and adaptive nature,
   Slalom achieves efficient accesses to raw data with minimal memory
   consumption. Our experimentation with both micro-benchmarks and
   real-life workloads shows that Slalom outperforms state-of-the-art
   in-situ engines (3 - 10x), and achieves comparable query response times
   with fully indexed DBMS, offering much lower (similar to 3x) cumulative
   query execution times for query workloads with increasing size and
   unpredictable access patterns.},

Title = {Application of Water Quality Index as a vulnerability indicator to
   determine seawater intrusion in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers in a
   tropical coastal region of Sri Lanka},
Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal freshwater aquifers are under threat and in many cases gradually
   decline due to climate change and over -extraction of water with the
   rapidly expanding human activities including agriculture and tourism. In
   this study, coastal sedimentary aquifer systems in northern Sri Lanka
   were characterized by integrated approaches such as mass balance
   calculations, Seawater Mixing Index (SMI) and Water Quality Index (WQI).
   A total of 34 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for field
   parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dis-solved oxygen and
   temperature) their major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, SO42???, NO???3
   , HCO???3) and selected trace elements (Sr, Ba, B) as well as stable
   water isotopes (delta 18OH2O and delta 2HH2O). The EC in investigated
   groundwater samples ranged from 81 to 5690 mu S/cm (mean -1260 mu S/cm)
   and served as the first indication of seawater intrusion. The study
   region consists of predominantly Ca2+-HCO???3 and Na+-Cl- water types
   indicating freshening and seawater intrusions as revealed by a
   Hydrogeochemical Facies Evaluation (HFE) diagram. The WQI and SMI
   approach indicated that in the study region, 50-58\% of samples are
   affected by seawater intrusion. Up to 28\% of seawater admixture was
   noted based on the mass balance calculation using Cl- (0.55-156 meq/L)
   as a conservative tracer. This result significantly correlates with the
   calculated WQI (r = +0.944; p < 0.000). Water isotope values indicated
   that most of the groundwater in the area is recharged directly from
   precipitation while some samples showed influences of evaporation and
   also mixing with seawater. In summary, the investigated coastal
   sedimentary aquifer system in the northern part of Sri Lanka is already
   severely affected by seawater intrusion. However, as marked by the
   dissolution of carbonate minerals under the influence of monsoonal rains
   leads to the freshening of groundwater. This study showed that WQI
   combined with mass balance calculations is useful in assessing the
   vulnerability of coastal aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions.},

Title = {Triangular nexus between foreign direct investment, international
   tourism, and energy consumption in the Chinese economy: accounting for

Abstract = {Recently, China is named among the most carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting
   countries in the world after the United State of America (USA). A major
   part of Chinese carbon dioxide emissions is as a result of offshore
   industrial activities which come into the economy as foreign direct
   investment (FDI). Following this, the present study seeks to investigate
   the nexus between CO2 emissions, FDI, energy use, and tourism arrivals,
   and possibly to advise on who will bear the responsibility of offshore
   CO2 emissions. Utilizing ARDL-bound testing and Granger causality
   approaches for both short- and long-run effects the author found that
   economic growth (GDP) has a positive relationship with both tourism
   arrivals, energy use, FDI, and CO2.This contributes to heavy CO2
   emissions which the author classified as the outsourced/offshore
   CO(2)emissions in China's FDI. Tourism arrivals have a bi-directional
   (feedback) causal relationship with energy use and a uni-directional
   causal relationship with CO2(transmitting from tourism to CO2). Both FDI
   and energy use have a bi-directional (feedback) causal relationship;
   CO2, energy use, and tourism arrivals have a unidirectional relationship
   with GDP which established the triangular nexus causality among the
   variables and the impact on GDP. Hence, the policy implication should be
   geared towards implementing the policies and regulations that will
   checkmate and reduce the excesses of foreign firms to the environment
   quality of China and promote environmentally friendly economic
   activities.},

Journal = {TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {765-770},
Abstract = {Planet atmospheric compositions are determined by the availability of a
   gas species, its molecular weight and the mass (or gravity force) of a
   planet. Both Mercury and the Moon are not massive enough to hold any gas
   species to form an atmosphere. The observed atmospheric compositions of
   all other terrestrial planets (Venus, Earth, and Mars) are consistent
   with the calculated lower bounds of the critical mass (CM) for various
   atmospheric gas species. The proto-atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars
   during accretion should be composed primarily of CO2. The Martian mass
   is significantly smaller than the lower bound of CM for gaseous H2O.
   Thus, Mars is not capable of retaining H2O in its atmosphere. In terms
   of today's atmospheric compositions, the Earth appears to be the only
   ``abnormal{''} planet in our Solar System. This may suggest that the
   fate of the Earth might be unique among the terrestrial planets by the
   fact that the Earth has an over-massive Moon. The capture of the Moon by
   a giant impact process might produce Earth's indigenous hot
   supercritical H2O-CO2 ocean that quickly reacted with feldspar, the most
   abundant surface mineral, and eventually removed all CO2 from Earth's
   proto-atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Ice blisters were discovered forming in a small valley surrounded by
   alpine glaciers on southern Bylot Island, Nunavut. The entire valley
   floor is covered by either perennial or annual icings that originate
   from glacial melt water and precipitation. Stable isotope profiles with
   depth for a completely formed icing blister displayed a pattern of
   progressive downward freezing. This indicates that it was formed under
   near equilibrium conditions in a closed system environment. A rapid
   shift in the profiles, relative to the theoretical isotope curves,
   indicates that a rupture and partial water loss with no injection of
   additional water occurred during the freezing process. The isotopic data
   demonstrate that icing blisters develop in a similar manner to frost
   blisters. The icing blisters have no soil cover, but instead rely on
   previously formed aufeis to provide a confining layer for the injected
   water. Carbonate precipitate found within the basal zone of a blister,
   and the local geology, suggest that the source water for this blister
   was from groundwater discharging along the southern margin of the valley
   Other small snow-cored mounds discovered within the annual icing are not
   formationally related to the icing blisters.},

Title = {Optimal Environmental Conditions and Anomalous Ecosystem Responses:
   Constraining Bottom-up Controls of Phytoplankton Biomass in the
   California Current System},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {In Eastern Boundary Current systems, wind-driven upwelling drives
   nutrient-rich water to the ocean surface, making these regions among the
   most productive on Earth. Regulation of productivity by changing wind
   and/or nutrient conditions can dramatically impact ecosystem
   functioning, though the mechanisms are not well understood beyond
   broad-scale relationships. Here, we explore bottom-up controls during
   the California Current System (CCS) upwelling season by quantifying the
   dependence of phytoplankton biomass (as indicated by satellite
   chlorophyll estimates) on two key environmental parameters: subsurface
   nitrate concentration and surface wind stress. In general, moderate
   winds and high nitrate concentrations yield maximal biomass near shore,
   while offshore biomass is positively correlated with subsurface nitrate
   concentration. However, due to nonlinear interactions between the
   influences of wind and nitrate, bottom-up control of phytoplankton
   cannot be described by either one alone, nor by a combined metric such
   as nitrate flux. We quantify optimal environmental conditions for
   phytoplankton, defined as the wind/nitrate space that maximizes
   chlorophyll concentration, and present a framework for evaluating
   ecosystem change relative to environmental drivers. The utility of this
   framework is demonstrated by (i) elucidating anomalous CCS responses in
   1998-1999, 2002, and 2005, and (ii) providing a basis for assessing
   potential biological impacts of projected climate change.},

Title = {PAH transport by sinking particles in the open Mediterranean Sea: A 1

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {52},
Number = {5},
Pages = {560-571},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {One year time series of sinking particles were collected at two depths
   in the open Mediterranean Sea and analysed for polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH). Average total PAH concentrations were 593 +/- 284 ng
   g(-1) at 250 m and 551 +/- 198 ng g(-1) at 2850 m. Total PAH fluxes
   averaged 73 +/- 58 ng m(-2) d(-1) at 250 m and 53 +/- 39 ng m(-2) d(-1)
   at 2850 m. Contamination levels and, thus, exposure of marine organisms
   to PAH are comparable in surface and deep waters. Deep waters appear as
   a significant, yet overlooked, PAH sink. PAH temporal patterns show
   noticeable seasonality. This is partly due to varying levels of specific
   components such as the winter increase of pyrolytic PAR Downward
   transport processes and the nature of sinking particles also impact on
   PAH fluxes, as inferred during periods of increasing productivity.
   Different phase-associations and interactions with particulate organic
   carbon for low-MW fossil PAH and high-MW pyrolytic PAH influence their
   downward transport efficiency. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Antibiotics, such as oxolinic acid (OXA), in aquaculture effluents
   contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, which makes
   it urgent to develop efficient and sustainable processes for their
   removal. Aiming a photocatalytic degradation under solar radiation,
   different carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were produced in this work through
   a bottom-up hydrothermal methodology and incorporated into TiO2 by a
   simple calcination method. A total of thirteen materials were
   synthesized and tested for OXA photocatalytic removal from synthetic and
   real matrices. Among them, CQDs produced with citric acid and
   incorporated into TiO2 at 4\% (w/w) (TiO2/ CQDs-CA 4\% (w/w)) were the
   most efficient photocatalysts, providing an OXA half-life time (t1/2)
   decrease of 91\%, 79\% and 85\% in phosphate buffer solution (PBS),
   synthetic sea salts (SSS) and brackish aquaculture effluent (BAE),
   respectively. Therefore, the herein synthesized TiO2/CQDs-CA 4\% (w/w)
   composites have shown to be promising materials for a sustainable

   to a fixed-base offshore platform. The technology, already widely used
   to protect civil engineering structures like bridges, buildings and

   field of offshore oilrigs. In fact, more than a year has transpired
   since the Chirag 1 offshore oil platform located in the Caspian Sea, the
   first such seismically isolated offshore structure, has been
   operational.
   The seismic protection of this type of structures represents a further
   step toward the enhancement of structural safety under particularly
   adverse conditions, which can accrue important results in terms of
   preventing environmental disasters with associated human and economic

Title = {Accelerometry of Seabream in a Sea -Cage: Is Acceleration a Good Proxy
   for Activity?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Activity assessment of individual fish in a sea-cage could provide
   valuable insights into the behavior, but also physiological well-being
   and resilience, of the fish population in the cage. Acceleration can be
   monitored continuously with internal acoustic transmitter tags and is
   generally applied as a real-time proxy for activity. The objective of
   this study was to investigate the activity patterns of Gilthead seabream
   (Sparus aurata) by transmitter tags in a sea-cage and analyze
   correlations with water temperature, fish size and tissue weights.
   Experimental fish (N = 300) were transferred to an experimental sea-cage
   of which thirty fish (Standard Length SL = 18.3 +/- 1.7 cm; Body Weight
   BW = 174 +/- 39 g) were implanted with accelerometer tags. Accelerations
   were monitored for a period of 6 weeks (Nov.-Dec.) and were analyzed
   over the 6 weeks and 24 h of the day. At the end of the experimental
   period, tagged fish were again measured, weighed and dissected for
   tissue and filet weights, and correlations with accelerations were
   analyzed. Daily rhythms in accelerations under the experimental
   conditions were characterized by more active periods from 6 to 14 h and
   18 to 0 h and less active periods from 0 to 6 h and 14 to 18 h. This
   W-shaped pattern remained over the experimental weeks, even with diurnal
   accelerations decreasing which was correlated to the dropping
   temperature. The increase in activity was not during, but just before
   feeding indicating food-anticipatory activity. Activity patterning can
   be useful for timing feeding events at the start of active periods, in
   this study between 6 and 11 h, and between 18 and 22 h. Acceleration was
   negatively correlated to heart and mesenteric fat mass, which was the
   exact contrary of our expectations for sustainedly swimming seabream.
   These results suggest that acceleration is a proxy for unsteady swimming
   activity only and research is required into the accelerations occurring
   during sustained swimming of seabream at various speeds.},

Title = {The development and application of remote sensing to monitor sand dune
   habitats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Sand dunes are complex systems that contain several habitats, often as
   mosaics or transitions between types. Several of these habitats are
   afforded protection under European Legislation and in the UK nationally
   within Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Sites of Special
   Scientific Interest (SSSI). Natural England has a statutory duty to
   report to Europe on the conservation status and condition of sand dunes;
   and is required to report to the UK Government on designated sites. To
   achieve this we have sought ways of capturing, analysing and
   interpreting data on the extent and location of sand dune habitats. This
   requires an ability to be able to obtain data over large areas of
   coastline in an efficient way. Natural England and Environment Agency
   Geomatics have worked collaboratively for over 16 years, sharing data
   and ecological knowledge. In 2012 work started to evaluate the use of
   remote sensing to map UK BAP and Annex I sand dune habitats. A
   methodology has now been developed and tested to map sand dune habitats.
   The key objective was to provide an operational tool that will help to
   map these habitats and understand change on sites around England. This
   has been achieved through analysis of LIDAR and Compact Airborne
   Spectrographic Imager (CASI) data using Object Orientated Image
   Analysis. Quality Control (QC) and accuracy assessments have shown this
   approach to be successful and 11 sites have been mapped to date. These
   techniques are providing a new approach to monitoring change in coastal
   vegetation communities and informing management of protected sites.},

Title = {A Fast Algorithm for the Prediction of Ship-Bank Interaction in Shallow
   Water},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The hydrodynamic interaction induced by the complex flow around a ship
   maneuvering in restricted waters has a significant influence on
   navigation safety. In particular, when a ship moves in the vicinity of a
   bank, the hydrodynamic interaction forces caused by the bank effect can
   significantly affect the ship's maneuverability. An efficient algorithm
   integrated in onboard systems or simulators for capturing the bank
   effect with fair accuracy would benefit navigation safety. In this
   study, an algorithm based on the potential-flow theory is presented for
   efficient calculation of ship-bank hydrodynamic interaction forces.
   Under the low Froude number assumption, the free surface boundary
   condition is approximated using the double-body model. A layer of
   sources is dynamically distributed on part of the seabed and bank in the
   vicinity of the ship to model the boundary conditions. The sinkage and
   trim are iteratively solved via hydrostatic balance, and the importance
   of including sinkage and trim is investigated. To validate the numerical
   method, a series of simulations with various configurations are carried
   out, and the results are compared with experiment and numerical results
   obtained with RANSE-based and Rankine source methods. The comparison and
   analysis show the accuracy of the method proposed in this paper
   satisfactory except for extreme shallow water cases.},

Title = {Attraction and repulsion of mobile wild organisms to finfish and
   shellfish aquaculture: a review},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {924-949},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Knowledge of aquaculture-environment interactions is essential for the
   development of a sustainable aquaculture industry and efficient marine
   spatial planning. The effects of fish and shellfish farming on sessile
   wild populations, particularly infauna, have been studied intensively.
   Mobile fauna, including crustaceans, fish, birds and marine mammals,
   also interact with aquaculture operations, but the interactions are more
   complex and these animals may be attracted to (attraction) or show an
   aversion to (repulsion) farm operations with various degrees of effects.
   This review outlines the main mechanisms and effects of attraction and
   repulsion of wild animals to/from marine finfish cage and bivalve
   aquaculture, with a focus on effects on fisheries-related species.
   Effects considered in this review include those related to the provision
   of physical structure (farm infrastructure acting as fish aggregating
   devices (FADs) or artificial reefs (ARs), the provision of food (e.g.
   farmed animals, waste feed and faeces, fouling organisms associated with
   farm structures) and some farm activities (e.g. boating, cleaning). The
   reviews show that the distribution of mobile organisms associated with
   farming structures varies over various spatial (vertical and horizontal)
   and temporal scales (season, feeding time, day/night period).
   Attraction/repulsion mechanisms have a variety of direct and indirect
   effects on wild organisms at the level of individuals and populations
   and may have implication for the management of fisheries species and the
   ecosystem in the context of marine spatial planning. This review
   revealed considerable uncertainties regarding the long-term and
   ecosystem-wide consequences of these interactions. The use of modelling
   may help better understand consequences, but long-term studies are
   necessary to better elucidate effects.},

Title = {Restricted host use by the herbivorous amphipod Peramphithoe tea is
   motivated by food quality and abiotic refuge},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {151},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1831-1838},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {There is a growing list of marine invertebrate herbivores known to
   restrict their host choices to a subset of available species, yet the
   relative importance of the evolutionary forces that select for
   specialized feeding habits remain unclear. One such specialist is the
   gammaridean amphipod Peramphithoe tea (F. Ampithoidae) that restricts
   its distribution to the brown laminarian seaweed Egregia menziesii in
   Oregon. A field survey indicated that among available seaweeds in the
   low intertidal zone of Boiler Bay, Oregon, Egregia housed greater than
   90\% of P. tea individuals. A set of laboratory-based habitat and
   feeding choice assays revealed that this specialized host distribution
   is likely the consequence of choices made by adult P. tea. The
   restricted host choice is apparently maintained by at least two
   evolutionary forces. First, a juvenile performance assay indicates that
   both Egregia and the co-occurring seaweed Alaria marginata, provide high
   food quality relative to other seaweeds available in the low-intertidal
   zone. Second, a field transplantation experiment revealed that Egregia
   protects adult amphipods from becoming dislodged with wave energy more
   readily than did Alaria. Thus, Egregia's value as good quality food and
   refuge from abiotic stress together explain the restricted host use of
   P. tea. A comparison with previous studies suggests that use of Egregia
   is not consistent across the geographic range of P. tea, suggesting the
   possibility that the host preferences of local populations may respond
   evolutionarily to geographic shifts in seaweed communities.},

Abstract = {Energetic tidal-stream environments are characterized by frequent,
   variable, yet broadly predictable currents containing ephemeral flow
   structures that change across multiple spatio-temporal scales. Marine
   mammals and seabirds (marine megafauna) often frequent such sites, but
   increasingly these locations are targeted for renewable energy
   extraction; little is known, however, about how marine megafauna use
   these habitats and any potential impacts. This review aims to summarize
   existing knowledge concerning usage by marine megafauna and considers
   their wider ecological significance. The review describes the physical
   processes occurring within tidal-stream environments that generate the
   oceanographic structures of potential ecological relevance, such as
   jets, boils, eddies, and fronts. Important physical features of these
   environments include lateral transport, turbulence-driven 3-dimensional
   flow structure at various spatial scales, and upwelling. Foraging
   opportunities appear to be the main attractor to marine megafauna,
   likely driven by enhanced prey abundance, vulnerability, or diversity.
   Many megafauna associate with particular tidal phases, current
   strengths, and flow structures, most likely in response to tidally
   forced prey distribution and behaviours. Occupancy patterns,
   distributions, and foraging behaviours are discussed. Local site
   fidelity by `tidal-stream experts' suggest non-uniform conservation
   risks within larger metapopulations. The review discusses data-gathering
   techniques and associated challenges, the significance of scaling, and
   information gaps.},

Abstract = {The Shiretoko Peninsula was placed on the World Heritage List in July
   2005 as Japan's third Natural Heritage Site, being valued for its unique
   ecosystems formed by the interaction between marine and terrestrial
   environments. Prior to its listing, however, the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources requested the development
   of measures to allow for the free movement of salmonids through the
   nominated area via artificial in-stream structures. This report
   introduces a pioneering effort to modify check dams in order to improve
   ecosystem linkages. The River Construction Working Group has intensively
   discussed and implemented restoration projects for 3 years, and the
   results have been monitored after implementation. Of 44 streams within
   the Shiretoko World Natural Heritage Site, 14 streams have had one or
   more in-stream structure(s) built. A total of 123 structures, mainly
   soil conservation dams, are distributed sporadically in these streams.
   Following assessment, the Working Group concluded that it would be
   reasonable to modify 31 structures in five streams, including 18
   structures that were to be modified before listing. The most suitable
   design that met local stream conditions was selected, after accounting
   for salmon passage, adverse impacts on stream environments above and
   below the construction sites and on fishing grounds, efficiency of
   construction, and ease of postmodification maintenance. Working in
   cooperation with the group members and parties concerned, we succeeded
   in restoring salmonids' upstream runs and extending their spawning
   habitat in streams above some of the dams, while keeping the disaster
   prevention function of the dams intact.},

Title = {Recycling valuable cobalt from spent lithium ion batteries for
   controllably designing a novel sea-urchin-like cobalt nitride-graphene
   hybrid catalyst: Towards efficient overall water splitting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Along with the continuous consumption in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),
   the price of cobalt is inevitably going up in recent years. Therefore,
   recycling valuable Co element from spent devices, and boosting its
   service efficiency are becoming two indispensable approaches to promote
   the utilization of Co in various energy conversion/storage devices.
   Herein, we realize the recovery of Co from spent LIBs and synthesize a
   three-dimensional (3D) sea-urchin-like cobalt nitride composite material
   (labeled as CoN-Gr-2), which is used as a bi-functional catalyst for
   water splitting. Benefiting from the intrinsic high conductivity, larger
   surface area and unique 3D sea-urchin-like architecture, CoN-Gr-2 shows
   an excellent electron transfer efficiency, highly exposed active sites
   as well as the superior mass transport capacity. The CoN-Gr-2 catalyst
   exhibits low overpotentials of 128.9 mV and 280 mV for hydrogen
   evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are
   comparable to the commercial 20 wt\% Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Moreover,
   when adopting CoN-Gr-2 as both anode and cathode materials for overall
   water splitting (in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte), the assembled cell achieves
   a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V, which almost close to that
   of Pt/C parallel to RuO2 benchmark (1.60 V), demonstrating its superior
   water-splitting efficiency. Meanwhile, the CoN catalysts exhibit strong
   chemical interaction with the Gr support, suppressing the aggregation of
   CoN catalysts and maintains their high activity during HER and OER
   reactions. So, the cell exhibits a high current retention of 97.3\%
   after 40 h. This work successfully develops an industrial chain from
   recycling Co wastes in spent energy devices to controllably designing 3D
   sea-urchin-like CoN-Gr with high water splitting efficiency. Therefore,
   it could further promote the efficient utilization of valuable Co
   element in various energy devices. (C) 2021 Science Press and Dalian

Title = {Utilizing Th-234/U-238 disequilibrium to constrain particle dynamics in
   hydrothermal plumes in the Southwest Indian Ocean},
Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6},
Pages = {16-25},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Metal-enriched minerals have been widely observed near hydrothermal vent
   fields. However, the dynamics of particulate metals influenced by
   hydrothermal activities is poorly constrained. Here, radioactive Th-234
   in both dissolved and particulate phases were used to examine the
   kinetics of particle-reactive metal adsorption, removal, and residence
   in a newly found hydrothermal plume over the Southwest Indian Ridge. The
   results showed a relatively low value on Th-234/U-238 ratios (i.e.,
   0.73-0.88) compared to the deep oceans, indicating an enhanced
   adsorption of particle-reactive metals onto particulate matter in the
   plume. Based on the Th-234-U-238 disequilibria, the adsorption and
   sinking rate constants of Th-234 averaged (0.009 +/- 0.001) d(-1) and
   (0.113 +/- 0.024) d(-1) in the hydrothermal plume, corresponding to the
   residence times of (115 +/- 19) d and (16 +/- 5) d for dissolved and
   particulate Th-234, respectively. This timescale allows vent-discharged
   particle-reactive metals to disperse hundreds to thousands of miles
   away. Thus, hydrothermal activities might influence the metal
   distribution in deep ocean over a very large scope. Also, a high sinking
   flux of (36.2 +/- 5.4) Bq/(m(2)center dot d) for Th-234 was observed for
   the plume, suggesting an enrichment of metal in particles deposited
   close to the vent. The enhancement of particle sinking could also
   benefit the transport of organic carbon and nitrogen and fuel the
   benthic ecosystems under the plume regimes. Thus, hydrothermal plumes
   may have an impact on both the elemental geochemistry and/or ecosystem
   to the deep oceans interior than previous expectation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to identify the institutional
   differences of mangrove management according to the characteristics of
   the mangrove, the role of the stakeholders, and the implementation of
   related regulations. The sampling method used was snowball sampling on
   East Lampung Regency and Pesawaran Regency; thus, the data analysis
   method used was Institutional Analysis Development (IAD). The results
   showed that there were different management methods for mangrove
   sustainability, depending on its characteristic (Kajapah and Kahayan
   type), the stakeholders involved based on their interest and the
   regulations used. The mapping of the stakeholder role depends on the
   interaction of the stakeholder, resource characteristics, and the
   regulation used. On Kajapah type there were: i) the University of
   Lampung, the community around the forest, the local government, the
   Watershed Management Agency, and the Forestry District of Province as
   the key players; and ii) the Agency of National Agrarian, Electronic and

Abstract = {Marine natural gas hydrate has recently attracted global attention as a
   potential new clean energy source. Laboratory measurements of various
   physical properties of gas hydrate-bearing marine sediments can provide
   valuable information for developing efficient and safe extraction
   technology of natural gas hydrates. This study presents comprehensive
   measurement results and analysis of drilled hydrate-bearing sediments
   samples recovered from Qiongdongnan Basin in the South China Sea. The
   results show that the gas hydrate in the core samples is mainly methane
   hydrate with a methane content of approximately 95\%, and the other
   components are ethane and carbon dioxide. The saturation of the samples
   fluctuates from 2\%-60\%, the porosity is approximately 38\%-43\%, and
   the water content is approximately 30\%-50\%, which indicate that high
   water saturation means that timely drainage should be paid attention to
   during hydrate extraction. In addition, the median diameter of the
   sediment samples is mainly distributed in the range of 15 to 34 mu m,
   and attention should be paid to the prevention and control of sand
   production in the mining process. Moreover, the thermal conductivity is
   distributed in the range of 0.75 to 0.96 W/(m center dot K) as measured
   by the flat plate heat source method. The relatively low thermal
   conductivity of hydrates at this study site indicates that a combined
   approach is encouraged for natural gas production technologies. It is
   also found that clay flakes and fine particles are attached to the
   surface of large particles in large numbers. Such characteristics will
   lead to insufficient permeability during the production process.},

Title = {Ingestion and incorporation of freshwater diatoms by Daphnia pulicaria:

Abstract = {In order to explain differences in the growth and reproduction of
   Daphnia pulicaria fed various freshwater diatoms, we measured ingestion
   rates and carbon incorporation for six cultured diatom species: the
   single-celled Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Stephanodiscus minutulus and
   Cyclotella meneghiniana, and the colony-forming Asterionella formosa,
   Fragilaria capucina and Fragilaria sp. Two of the colony-forming
   species, when damaged, produced polyunsaturated aldehydes (oxylipins)
   that have been found to impair the reproduction of marine copepods. We
   tested two hypotheses: (i) feeding and incorporation rates are affected
   by diatom morphology; and (ii) polyunsaturated aldehydes act as feeding
   deterrents. Daphnia body length versus ingestion rate regressions
   differed for single-celled and colony-forming diatoms. Ingestion rates
   for single-celled diatoms showed clear size dependencies and high
   correlation coefficients, while the dependency was weak for
   colony-forming diatoms and individual variability was high. This
   difference was not observed for carbon incorporation rates, which showed
   low variability for all diatoms. Asterionella formosa yielded the lowest
   incorporation rates due to low incorporation efficiency, while all other
   diatoms were incorporated at similar rates. Thus, morphological
   differences of the diatoms had no effect on carbon uptake by Daphnia.
   The presence or absence of polyunsaturated aldehydes did not cause
   different ingestion rates; hence the aldehydes are not feeding
   deterrents.},

Title = {Insights into forming behavior and CO2 adsorption properties of graphene
   from Sargassum horneri by Fe(NO3)(3)/KOH activation},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macroalgae biomass as a graphene source shows great
   potential at large scale in an energy shortage era. To achieve a more
   moderate and economic graphene synthesis method, porous graphenes were
   synthesized using Sargassum horneri as precursor, in combination with
   Fe(NO3)(3) and KOH composite.
   RESULTS: The addition of 10 wt\% Fe(NO3)(3) obviously accelerated KOH
   activation and decreased KOH loading and reaction temperature.
   Meanwhile, the graphene synthesized by Fe(NO3)(3)/KOH had better
   regeneration performance than that activated merely by KOH, even under
   more moderate thermal condition. The porous graphene displayed high
   specific surface area (similar to 2311 m(2) g(-1)) and exhibited good
   CO2 uptake capacity (similar to 4.39 mmol g(-1)) at 30 degrees C and 1
   bar. The CO2 adsorption rate equations of the graphene were consistent
   with the intraparticle diffusion model, indicating that CO2 adsorption
   was mainly controlled by the pore structure and additionally influenced
   by the chemical functional groups.
   CONCLUSION: The present work focuses on the high value-added
   comprehensive utilization of macroalgae, which not only has important
   significance for on-scale preparation of bio-originated graphene and CO2
   adsorption, but also has positive benefits for macroalgae resource
   development. (C) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).},

Abstract = {We investigate the propagation of climatic events on ocean
   stratification, marine biology, and CO2 using a large-scale ocean
   general circulation model coupled to a simple biogeochemical model of
   plankton dynamics and the carbon cycle. The model was forced with
   satellite and reanalysis fields during 1979-1999. We focus on three
   climatic events: (1) the North Atlantic Oscillation, (2) El Nino events,
   and (3) the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. Such climatic events caused
   variability in ocean stratification, approximated by the mixing depth
   (MD), from +/-20 m in the subtropics to +/-100 s of meters at high
   latitudes. In the subtropics, deepening of the MD resupplied
   nutrient-impoverished surface waters and increased marine biomass by
   20-100\%. In contrast, at high latitudes, shoaling of the MD lengthened
   the growing season (i.e., the length of time that light is available for
   plankton growth) and increased marine biomass by 10-20\%. Variability in
   marine biology reached global peak-to-peak values of +/-0.01 mg m(-3)
   for surface chl a, +/-3.4 Pg C yr(-1) for primary production, and +/-0.3
   Pg C yr(-1) for export production and its contribution to CO2 fluxes.
   Our model results suggest that changes in ocean stratification driven by
   short-term climatic events could be used to understand and quantify the
   feedbacks from marine biology to CO2 and climate.},

Title = {Bjerknes compensation at high northern latitudes: The ocean forcing the
   atmosphere},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {20},
Number = {24},
Pages = {6023-6032},

Abstract = {The mechanisms for Bjerknes compensation of heat transport variations
   through the atmosphere and ocean on decadal time scales are
   investigated, using data output from a preindustrial control run of the
   Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model
   (HadCM3). It has recently been shown that Bjerknes compensation occurs
   on decadal time scales in a long preindustrial control run of HadCM3.
   This result is elaborated on by performing lead/lag correlations of the
   atmospheric and oceanic heat transports. By using statistical analysis,
   Bjerknes compensation is observed on decadal time scales at latitudes
   between 50 degrees and 80 degrees N. A maximum compensation rate of
   similar to 55\% occurs at 70 degrees N. At this latitude, the
   correlation rate peaks when the ocean leads the atmosphere by one year.
   The mechanisms by which Bjerknes compensation occurs at this latitude
   are investigated. Anomalies in oceanic heat transport appear to be
   associated with variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional
   overturning circulation (MOC). The associated sea surface temperature
   (SST) anomalies are in general too weak to assert a significant impact
   on the atmosphere. At 70 degrees N, however, such SST anomalies are a
   prelude to the transition from sea ice coverage to open water after
   which the associated changes in heat exchange with the atmosphere are
   strong enough to force an atmospheric response. Because of the presence
   of a strong MOC component in the Atlantic Ocean, this interaction is
   confined to the region where the northeast Atlantic and Arctic Oceans
   connect. The atmospheric response to increased (decreased) heating from
   below is a decreased (increased) poleward temperature gradient, leading
   to a decreased (increased) heat transport by baroclinic eddies. The
   anomalous thermal low that is set up by heating from the ocean is
   associated with anomalous advection of cold air from the Greenland
   landmass.},

Abstract = {Situated in the coral triangle, the Philippines hosts some of the
   world's most diverse coral reefs. Yet there are few national marine
   protected areas (MPAs) in place that coincide with these reefs.
   Municipal MPAs partially alleviate this issue but a controlled
   comparison of the effects of different small-scale management strategies
   on coral reefs is lacking. Danjugan Island Marine Reserve and
   Sanctuaries (DIMRS) is one of these community-based MPAs that
   encompasses a collection of small (0.3-0.34 km(2)) marine reserves
   situated in a larger MPA where fishing is regulated through permits. The
   unique juxtaposition of different management strategies within DIMRS was
   used as a model system to test whether reserves are better for corals
   than limited fishing permits by comparing ecosystem indicators (coral
   cover, bleaching, disease, and morphological diversity). Total and live
   hard corals were 169\% and 204\% more abundant inside than outside
   no-take zones in 2016. This distinction increased between 2002 and 2016
   as a result of a more marked decrease in coral cover over time in the
   partially protected zones. A 70\% higher coral community evenness
   outside the reserves further suggests that scleractinian coral
   communities on fished reefs are more disturbed. Live coral cover within
   the MPAs of DIMRS in 2016 (39 +/- 4\%) is above the current mean for
   Philippine reefs (23\%) and is comparable with the long-term average for
   reefs situated within Philippine MPAs (36\%). This study suggests that
   exceptionally small reserves may benefit hard corals more than
   regulation via fishing permits.},

Abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to the Bay of Bengal is an
   important groundwater discharge process to southern Asia as well as to
   the global oceans. Water-fluxes in these regions are not very well
   understood. The present study demonstrates the use of sea-bed porewater
   temperature as a tracer for delineating seasonal SGD from a shallow
   coastal aquifer to the Bay of Bengal. Porewater temperature mapping
   along with chemical profile of porewater column were used to delineate
   groundwater discharge zones for different seasons in a hydrologic year.
   While, the temperature profiles were used to evaluate total groundwater
   discharge (both terrestrial and marine), the salinity and total
   dissolved solids profiles were used to evaluate the component due to
   terrestrial (freshwater) discharge. Several springs and seeps were
   mapped to finger-print the freshwater discharge zones and identify the
   terrestrial sourced-SGD temperature windows. These zones are also
   identified to be enriched with algal mats, and hence may indicate the
   pathways of nutrient-solute discharge that enhance the primary
   productivity in the marine ecosystem. Assuming vertical flow in the
   seabed, simulated rates of discharged groundwater provided a good match
   with measured discharge rates. The porewater fluxes were estimated by
   applying analytical solutions of the heat conduction-advection equations
   to the observed vertical temperature profiles. High resolution thermal
   profiles to identify T-SGD signatures and chemical profiles along mapped
   transects reveal the nuances of 3-D seasonal hydrodynamics of
   groundwater-seawater interactions. The calculated vertical porewater
   fluxes through the seabed ranged from negligible to 2.45 x 10(-2)

   offshore, and represent the vertical porewater velocity and the average
   vertical porewater velocity is found as 8.2 x 10(-3) m(3)/m(2)/d(1).
   Approximations suggest that in present-day condition, total average
   annual SGD to Bay of Bengal is about 1.16 x 10(7) m(3)/y. Seasonal
   estimates suggest that the averages SGD during pre-monsoon and
   post-monsoon seasons are ranges 0.6-0.8 x 10(7) m(3)/y for pre-monsoon
   and 0.8-1.5 x 10(7) m(3)/y for post-monsoon, respectively. The findings
   suggest that monsoonal activity result in a significant porewater
   displacement from tidal flat sediments by increased groundwater
   discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of inland mined sand and offshore dredged
   sand for bench nourishment projects in North Carolina, focusing on the
   question of whether inland mined sand is economically preferential for
   hot-spot erosion control. Excavation, processing, and transport costs
   are presented, and cost efficiencies of hypothetical beach nourishment
   projects are compared. Cost analyses indicate that inland mined sand is
   economical for small projects (10,000-50,000 cubic yards), given that a
   clean sand source can be located within 15 miles of the nourishment
   site. The two factors primarily influencing per cubic yard costs of
   inland sand are overland transportation expenses and processing costs.
   The use of dredged offshore sand is less expensive for large projects
   (>100,000 cubic yards) due to the economies of scale affecting dredge
   mobilization. Large beach nourishment projects in North Carolina will
   most likely continue to utilize offshore dredged sand.},

Title = {Extreme ocean waves. Part I. The practical application of fully
   nonlinear wave modelling},
Journal = {APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {209-224},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper concerns the description of large surface water waves in
   realistic ocean spectra and explains how fully nonlinear wave modelling
   can be applied in practical design calculations. In particular, the
   proposed methodology incorporates: (i) the transitory nature of
   individual waves or wave groups arising in a random or irregular sea
   involving a significant spread of wave energy across the frequency
   domain; (ii) the short-crestedness of waves arising due to the
   directionality of the underlying wave components; and (iii) the
   nonlinearity associated with the evolution of the largest waves. The
   procedures outlined build directly upon two advances in wave modelling,
   reported by Bateman et al. {[}1,2]. By combining these solutions with
   initial or starting conditions originating from statistical theory
   describing the most probable shape of a large linear wave, fully
   nonlinear descriptions of extreme waves in realistic sea states can be
   achieved. Furthermore, such calculations can be undertaken with
   relatively modest computational effort and are directly relevant to a
   wide range of design wave calculations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {13248-13255},

Abstract = {Changing lake water total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations are of
   concern for lake management because of corresponding effects on aquatic
   ecosystem functioning, drinking water resources and carbon cycling
   between land and sea. Understanding the importance of human activities
   on TOC changes requires knowledge of past concentrations; however,
   water-monitoring data are typically only available for the past few
   decades, if at all. Here, we present a universal model to infer past
   lake water TOC concentrations in northern lakes across Europe and North
   America that uses visible-near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy on lake
   sediments. In the orthogonal partial least-squares model, VNIR spectra
   of surface-sediment samples are calibrated against corresponding surface
   water TOC concentrations (0.5-41 mg L-1) from 345 Arctic to northern
   temperate lakes in Canada, Greenland, Sweden and Finland. Internal
   model-cross-validation resulted in a R-2 of 0.57 and a prediction error
   of 4.4 mg TOC L-1. First applications to lakes in southern Ontario and
   Scotland, which are outside of the model's geographic range, show the
   model accurately captures monitoring trends, and suggests that TOC
   dynamics during the 20th century at these sites were primarily driven by
   changes in atmospheric deposition. Our results demonstrate that the lake
   water TOC model has multiregional applications and is not biased by
   postdepositional diagenesis, allowing the identification of past TOC
   variations in northern lakes of Europe and North America over time
   scales of decades to millennia.},

Title = {Vegetation and community changes of elm (Ulmus pumila) woodlands in
   Northeastern China in 1983-2011},
Journal = {CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {321-330},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Elm (Ulmus pumila), widely distributed in the north temperate zone,
   contributes to a special savanna-like woodland in typical grassland
   region in the northeastern China. This woodland performs a variety of
   ecological functions and environmental significance, such as decreasing
   soil erosion, stabilizing sand dunes, preserving species diversity.
   However, in the last approximate 30 years, the species composition,
   productivity and distribution area of elm woodland has decreased
   severely. A series of studies have been carried out to find out whether
   the climate changes or human disturbances caused the degradation of elm
   woodland and how these factors affected elm woodland. In this study,
   undisturbed, plowing and grazing elm woodland were investigated in 1983
   and 2011 by using Point-Centered Quarter method. The relationship
   between vegetation changes and environmental factors was analyzed by
   Bray-Curtis ordination. The results show that in 2011, species diversity
   and understory productivity of undisturbed elm woodland decrease
   slightly compared to those of undisturbed elm woodland in 1983. However,
   nearly 60\% of the species is lost in the plowing and grazing elm
   woodland relative to the species undisturbed elm woodland in 1983.
   Interestingly, plowing stimulates the growth of elm and certain
   understory species through furrowing soil and accelerating soil nutrient
   turnover rate. Grazing disturbance not only leads to species loss and
   productivity decrease, but also induces changes in elm growth (small,
   short and twisted). The mean age of the elm was 29 +/- 2 yr in
   undisturbed and plowing elm woodland, while only 15 yr in the grazing
   elm woodland. The results of Bray-Curtis ordination analysis show that
   all sample stands clustered to three groups: Group I including the
   undisturbed sample stands of 83UE (undisturbed elm woodland in 1983) and
   11UE (undisturbed elm woodland in 2011); Group II including sample
   stands of PE (elm woodland disturbed by plowing); Group III including
   samples stands of GE (elm woodland disturbed by grazing). The results
   indicate that the long time disturbance of the plowing and grazing have
   converted elm woodland to different community types. Climate change is
   not the primary reason causing the degradation of elm woodland, but
   plowing and grazing disturbance. Both plowing and grazing decrease the
   vegetation composition and species diversity. Grazing further decreases
   vegetation productivity and inhibits the growth of elm tree. Therefore,
   we suggest that reasonable plowing and exclusive grazing would be
   favorable for future regeneration of degraded elm woodland.},

Abstract = {A novel two chamber up-flow microbial desalination cell (UMDC) was
   designed for evaluating desalination of real seawater with simultaneous
   wastewater treatment and energy generation. Two UMDCs were hydraulically
   connected in continuous flow mode (cascade mode) and operated at ten
   different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) {[}120 h to 12 h] and salt
   retention times (SRTs) {[}40 h to 4 h] for improved performance of
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) and salt removal. These UMDCs were operated
   at different combinations of high power (higher external resistance) and
   high current (low external resistance) mode to find the most suitable
   conditions for obtaining higher COD removal, salt removal, power
   production and current generation. The optimum HRT and SRT were 60 h and
   40 h, respectively. The highest salt removal achieved was 72\% at SRT of
   40, while the highest COD removal was 83\% at a HRT of 60 h. A maximum
   current density of 2.375 A/m(2) was obtained, while the maximum power
   density was 5.879 W/m(2). The obtained results give an overlook for the
   scale up of UMDCs in the future. In the entire system, membrane fouling
   is still a major problem. As the operation time increases, this resulted
   in low power generation and low salt removal efficiency. The UMDCs can
   function as sustainable and alternative solution for real wastewater
   treatment and seawater desalination with resource recovery and power
   production.},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {471-484},
Abstract = {Y The subduction of an oceanic plate is studied as the motion of a
   high-viscosity Newtonian fluid. The sub ducting plate spreads along the
   670-km depth boundary under the influence of oppositely directed
   horizontal forces. These forces are due to oppositely directed
   horizontal temperature gradients. We consider the flow structure and
   heat transfer in the layer that includes both the oceanic lithosphere
   and the crust and moves underneath a continent. The heat flow is
   estimated at the contact between the subducting plate and the
   surrounding mantle in the continental limb of the subduction zone. Our
   study results show that the crustal layer of the subducting plate can
   melt and a thermochemical plume can form at the 670-km boundary. Our
   model of a thermochemical plume in the subduction zone shows the
   following: (1) formation of a plume conduit in the crustal layer of the
   subducting plate; (2) formation of a primary magmatic chamber in the
   area wherein the melting rate equals the rate of subduction; (3)
   origination of a vertical plume conduit from the primary chamber melting
   through the continent; (4) plume eruption through the crustal layer to
   the surface, i.e. formation of a volcano. Our experiments are aimed to
   model the plume conduit melting in an inclined flat layer above a local
   heat source. The melt flow structure in the plume conduit is described.
   Laboratory modeling have revealed that the mechanisms of melt eruption
   from the plume conduit differ depending on whether a gas cushion is
   present or absent at the plume roof.},

Abstract = {Contact zone of the land and water environment in Poland does not have a
   relevant system of integrated management. Water environment is very
   often a plane of opposite interests of companies interested in coastal
   zone resources. There is a need of protection of those natural resources
   to ensure their existence and sensible utilisation. The Polish National
   GIS Centre was created in Maritime Institute in Gdansk, Poland in order
   to realise the database for the purposes of Integrated Coastal Zone
   Management.
   The geographical structure of data has lead to the implementation of
   Geographical Information Systems (ArcInfo, ArcView and TNTMips) as a
   tool of data visualisation, analysis and serving through Internet. The
   database is generated and managed with an Oracle 8i.1.5. database
   management system. As an input materials data digitised from topographic
   maps, data from hydrogeological and hydroacoustic surveys, data from
   hydrodynamical and meteorological models were used.
   The complete model of the database has been prepared and implemented
   into Oracle system. Many tests on database functionality were carried on
   for the Wladyslawowo municipality pilot project. The complete database
   for that region including all relevant data has been already finished
   and is being served through Internet. The GIS centre in Gdansk still
   works at extending the database for the whole Polish coastal zone.
   The complete realisation of the project should finish with collecting
   all available information and organising them into a database to manage
   coastal zone in an efficient and advanced way. Decision system for
   protection of natural environment becomes much easier with adoption of
   analysis technologies offered by GIS systems. Combination of all
   provided methods gives a good way for Integrated Coastal Zone Management
   purpose.},

Abstract = {Three polar bear populations (Ursus maritimus) occur in the Russian
   Arctic: Spitsbergen-Novozemelskaya, Laptevskaya, and Chukchi-Alaska. The
   status and local condition of each population differs and requires
   different conservation and management approaches. The
   Spitsbergen-Novozemelskaya population in the early 1980s had
   approximately 3,000-6,700 animals. About 1,700-2,000 bears of this
   population inhabit the Svalbard, Norway, region and are considered by
   Norwegian specialists as a separate sub-population. No survey data are
   available to detect changes in population size, although Barents Sea
   resources were over-harvested during the 1980s. Because of these
   uncertainties, it has been recommended that this population be placed in
   the fourth category (undetermined status) in the Red Data Book of
   Animals of the Russian Federation (Eliseev 1983) when the next issue is
   published. This status allows use of the population for recreational
   viewing purposes and for capturing cubs for zoological gardens. The
   Frans-Josef Land Archipelago has been designated a federal refuge, which
   protects the polar bear population in the region. Additional protected
   territories and marine areas in the Novaya Zemlya region are planned and
   would provide additional protection for the Spitsbergen-Novozemelskaya
   polar bear population. The Laptevskaya population of approximately 1,000
   bears has been stable for decades. The comparatively small size and low
   density of this population justifies retaining it in the third category
   (rare status) of the Red Data Book of Animals of the Russian Federation
   (Eliseev 1983), which provides greater protection than other
   designations. In the denning areas of this population, the Severnaya
   Zemlya Archipelago and the Novosibirsk Islands, establishing natural
   protection territories has been recommended. Only recreational use
   (viewing) of this population is allowed. The Chukchi-Alaskan population
   numbers several thousand bears and is harvested only by Alaskan native
   people. A proposal is pending to move this population to the fifth
   category (restored or rehabilitated status) of the Red Data Book of
   Animals of the Russian Federation (Eliseev 1983). In Russia, hunting
   polar bears in this population for subsistence purposes by indigenous
   peoples is being considered. However, experts propose that legalized
   hunting be contingent upon elimination of the current illegal hunting
   that occurs in this region in Russia. For more effective protection of
   polar bears, it has been recommended that marine areas in the
   East-Siberian and Chukchi seas be added to the Wrangel Island State
   Nature Reserve and that an international protected marine area be
   established in the southern Chukchi Sea.},

Abstract = {In marine industries, the accumulation of organic matter and marine
   organisms on ship hulls and instruments limits performance, requiring
   frequent maintenance and increasing fuel costs. Current coatings
   technology to combat this biofouling relies heavily on the use of toxic,
   biocide-containing paints. These pose a serious threat to marine
   ecosystems, affecting both target and nontarget organisms. Innovation in
   the design of polymers offers an excellent platform for the development
   of alternatives, but the creation of a broad-spectrum, nontoxic material
   still poses quite a hurdle for researchers. Surface chemistry, physical
   properties, durability, and attachment scheme have been shown to play a
   vital role in the construction of a successful coating. This review
   explores why these characteristics are important and how recent research
   accounts for them in the design and synthesis of new environmentally
   benign antifouling and fouling release materials.},

Title = {Seasonal Dynamics of Trace Elements in Tidal Salt Marsh Soils as
   Affected by the Flow-Sediment Regulation Regime},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Soil profiles were collected in three salt marshes with different plant
   species (i.e. Phragmites australis, Tamarix chinensis and Suaeda salsa)
   in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) of China during three seasons (summer
   and fall of 2007 and the following spring of 2008) after the
   flow-sediment regulation regime. Total elemental contents of As, Cd, Cu,
   Pb and Zn were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic
   absorption spectrometry to investigate temporal variations in trace
   elements in soil profiles of the three salt marshes, assess the
   enrichment levels and ecological risks of these trace elements in three
   sampling seasons and identify their influencing factors. Trace elements
   did not change significantly along soil profiles at each site in each
   sampling season. The highest value for each sampling site was observed
   in summer and the lowest one in fall. Soils in both P. australis and S.
   salsa wetlands tended to have higher trace element levels than those in
   T. chinensis wetland. Compared to other elements, both Cd and As had
   higher enrichment factors exceeding moderate enrichment levels. However,
   the toxic unit (TU) values of these trace elements did not exceed
   probable effect levels. Correlation analysis showed that these trace
   elements were closely linked to soil properties such as moisture,
   sulfur, salinity, soil organic matter, soil texture and pH values.
   Principal component analysis showed that the sampling season affected by
   the flow-sediment regulation regime was the dominant factor influencing
   the distribution patterns of these trace elements in soils, and plant
   community type was another important factor. The findings of this study
   could contribute to wetland conservation and management in coastal
   regions affected by the hydrological engineering.},

Title = {Oxygen isotopic distribution along the otolith growth axis by secondary

Abstract = {This study using tuna otoliths as working standards established a high
   lateral resolution and precision analysis to measure delta O-18(otolith)
   by secondary ion mass spectrometry. This analytical approach of the ion
   probe was applied to deep-sea fishes to reconstruct the likely depths
   inhabited by the fishes at different life history stages based on the
   measured delta O-18(otolith) values as a proxy of water temperature.
   Dramatic increases up to 5-6 parts per thousand in delta O-18(otolith),
   representing a temperature decrease of approximately 20 degrees C, were
   detected in a blind cusk eel (Barathronus maculatus) otolith and in the
   otoliths of Synaphobranchus kaupii during leptocephalus metamorphosis to
   glass eel, inferred from the drop of otolith Sr/Ca ratios and increase
   of otolith growth increment width. delta O-18(otolith) profiles clearly
   divided the fish's life history into a planktonic stage in the mixed
   layer of the ocean and a benthic stage on the deep-sea ocean bottom. The
   habitat shift signal was recorded within a 150 um width of otolith
   growth zone, which was too narrow to be clearly detected by mechanical
   drilling and conventional isotopic ratio mass spectrometry. However,
   variations down to - 7 parts per thousand were found in delta
   O-18(otolith) Profiles as the result of Cs2+ beam sputter in the core
   and larval portions of the otoliths. Carbon mapping by electron probe
   microanalyzer and staining by toluidine blue suggested abundant proteins
   existed in the areas with anomaly negative delta O-18(otolith) values,
   which cannot be interpreted as a habitat change but due to the isotopic
   fractionation by O emission from the proteins. These results implied
   that careful design and understanding of the chemical composition of the
   analytical areas or tracks on the heterogeneous otolith was essential
   for highly accurate and precise analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Performances of solar dryers for the drying of medicinal and aromatic
   plants (MAP) in Africa were reviewed. Policy formulation indicators,
   including the economic and the environmental impact analysis that was
   lacking in almost all research, were presented in this study. Three
   countries, Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria, were used as case studies. Key
   indicators analyzed were the amount of money saved and CO2 reduction
   based on 10\% to 100\% rate of utilization and cost of a kWh of energy
   in each country. Results showed that as the rate of usage increased from
   10\% to 100\% for drying Lemongrass in Egypt, the amount of money saved
   increased from \$102.5 - \$1025/year. While, in the same country at the
   same drying condition and mass, it increased from \$123.5 -
   \$1235.44/year for drying Oregano. Drying of Chilli in the coastal area
   of Nigeria saved more money than drying of Basil in Egypt under the same
   rate of usage. About 40702.38-407023.8 kg of CO2 per year can be reduced
   in the drying of Grape in Egypt, while 2308.5-23085 kg of CO2 can be
   reduced for drying of Chilli in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {During a spring bloom primarily composed of the centric diatom
   Thalassiosira pacifica in Dabob Bay, Washington, an unarmored
   dinoflagellate, Gyrodinium sp., phagocytized chains of Thalassiosira.
   The diatoms were egested in peritrophic membrane-bound fecal pellets
   that were collected in sediment traps. The dinoflagellate pellets
   accounted for an average of 29\% (SD = 16\%) of the volume of fecal
   pellet flux at 50 m. The diatoms in the pellets were intact but void of
   plasma content, thus reducing the flux of both POC and pigments per
   volume of fecal pellets, as was apparent in the sediment trap
   measurements. Grazing by these dinoflagellates on the large diatoms and
   the export of relatively carbon- and pigment-deplete pellets have much
   different implications for organic material cycling than if the diatoms
   were consumed by mesozooplankton or if they sank.},

Title = {Fate of organic matter in faecal pellets egested by epifaunal
   mesograzers in a Sargassum forest and implications for biogeochemical
   cycling},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {352},
Pages = {101-112},
Abstract = {Fate of organic matter of the faecal pellets produced by epifaunal
   mesograzers in a Sargassum forest was elucidated by determination of the
   organic carbon and nitrogen flux and fatty acid composition of the 3
   types of faecal pellets, i.e. fresh, sinking and precipitated. The
   organic carbon contents of those 3 types averaged 21.4, 6.0 and 5.5\%
   dry weight, respectively, showing a marked difference between the fresh
   and sinking types. The same trend was found for their organic nitrogen
   content. A dissolution-decomposition experiment ascertained the rapid
   loss of organic matter after the pellets were egested. The ratio of the
   unsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids (UFA:TFA) decreased in the
   order of the fresh, sinking and precipitated pellets, whereas the
   bacterial biomarker fatty acids increased in that order. The daily
   sinking fluxes of the faecal pellets were 197 to 639 mg C and 15 to 53
   mgN m(-2) d(-1) for organic carbon and nitrogen, respectively. This flux
   accounted for 7.4 to 13.4\% (C) and 9.4 to 20.3\% (N) of the primary
   production in the corresponding season of the Sargassum forest. The
   estimated residence time of the organic matter in the pellets together
   with the result of the dissolution-decomposition experiment indicated
   that about half of the organic carbon and nitrogen egested as faecal
   pellets was laterally exported to the pelagic zone by the exchange of
   water. Those possible lateral export fluxes accounted for 4.1 to 7.4\%
   (C) and 4.4 to 9.5\% (N) of Sargassum production.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore if sexual reproduction is present in
   scleractinian corals at the northern limit of their distribution (28.980
   degrees N, 113.470 degrees W) in a zone subject to upwelling and
   seasonal variations in sea surface temperature, and sampling was
   performed from August 2018 to October 2019. We placed 42 terracotta
   recruitment tiles in Bahia de los Angeles, Baja California. Coral cover
   was estimated, and the height, major diameter, and minor diameter of
   coral colonies were measured. Astrangia haimei and Porites panamensis
   recruits were identified on the recruitment tiles, constituting the
   first quantitative record for the northeastern tropical Pacific.
   Recruitment of P. panamensis was higher (Llave: 63.09 +/- 114 indm(-2)
   y(-1), Rasito: 3.21 +/- 7 indm(-2) y(-1)), while A. haimei recruitment
   at the same sites was 3.85 +/- 8 and 1.93 +/- 6 indm(-2) y(-1),
   respectively. Recruitment differences between locations were attributed
   to coral cover (the abundance of Porites panamensis is 15-fold greater
   in Llave than in Rasito) and colony size (P. panamensis Llave: 10.53 +/-
   5.93 cm, Rasito: 4 +/- 0.63 cm). Both SSTand Chl-a concentrations were
   also highly correlated with coral recruitment, with higher recruitment
   rates observed in the warmer seasons when high nutrient concentrations
   were also present. In contrast to other sites in the eastern tropical
   Pacific, the highest rate of recruitment was reported at this study
   (high-latitude coral community), which, according with the positive high
   latitude trend reported by other studies, is likely due to climate
   change.},

   ages overlapping in a single farm-with that used in the salmon industry
   (S2)-the whole is farm filled with fish that are the same age at once
   with a fallowing period between rearing cycles-in terms of waste
   production by coupling digestibility coefficients with growth, feeding,
   and eating behavior models into a mass balance model. We considered the
   total C, N, and P content in the different waste fractions (particulate
   and dissolved wastes). The model, which simulated real farming
   conditions, showed relevant quantitative and qualitative differences
   between both strategies, with stocked biomass and water temperature as
   the main drivers, the amount of feed wasted by chewing as the most
   relevant fraction differentiating both strategies, and the fallowing
   period as the main distinguishing management feature. We discuss the
   influence of both farming strategies on some key performance and
   environmental aspects, such as benthic recovery, the breakdown of the
   life cycle of pathogens, and adaptability to climate change. Our results
   suggest that changing the GHSB industry's production model is necessary

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Number = {44},
Pages = {72-89},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {The present-day coast of Louisiana is undergoing unprecedented change
   when compared With other coastal regions of the United States. Whereas
   most of its shoreline is retreating and its coastal bays expanding tit
   the expense of wetlands, the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya deltas are
   prograding and forming new delta plains. Coastal processes responsible
   for reworking the lower delta plain and modifying the coast are modest,
   including very low-wave energy and a microtidal regime. However,
   occasional hurricanes and more frequent frontal systems produce elevated
   water levels and large waves (heights >1 to 2 meters), which produce
   erosion, overwash, and barrier breaching. High subsidence rates coupled
   with eustatic sea-level rise and wave erosion are converting wetlands to
   open-water bays. Along barrier shorelines, this process is increasing
   tidal exchange, which is enlarging tidal inlets and the volume of sand
   captured in ebb-tidal deltas. Sequestration of sand in offshore ebb
   shoals depletes sand resources to the barrier chain. The segmentation,
   landward migration, and overall decrease in size of the barriers tire a
   product of relative sea-level rise and the lack of contribution of new
   sediment to the system, Restoration or the barrier,,; should be planned
   with an understanding that the Louisiana coast is evolving in a
   transgression.},

Abstract = {Thermal building simulations were carried out for the climate conditions
   of 20 cities in Mexico. We analyze the effects on thermal loads of
   variations in both solar reflectance and thermal insulation of a roofs
   exterior surface. The results are quantitative estimates of the
   reductions in annual (cooling + heating) loads reachable through
   adequate solar reflectance and thermal insulation of buildings in each
   city. Additionally, the adequate range of solar reflectance values is
   defined for each climate zone.},

Abstract = {An approach to power-factor control and islanding detection of a
   grid-connected photovoltaic system is proposed. With the designated
   control circuit, deviation at the output of the inverter can be
   observed. Coupled with the algorithm developed, this deviation serves as
   a useful aid to detect islanding more effectively. The proposed method
   has been tested through different scenarios, including the loss of grid
   and operation in parallel. Simulation studies and hardware circuits were
   both made to validate the effectiveness of the method. With the test
   results they help consolidate the feasibility and practicality of the
   approach for the applications considered.},

Abstract = {For several years, patches of plants presenting deficiencies in growth
   have been observed in fields cultivated with oilseed rape. Over 3 years,
   57 pairs of damaged and undamaged plants were sampled from cultivated
   fields on the Atlantic coast of France and around the Paris basin.
   Results show that two main species of plant-parasitic nematodes can be
   associated with the patches, Heterodera cruciferae and Meloidogyne
   artiellia, and that both species probably do not occur in the same
   fields and regions. This means that M. artiellia, which is considered as
   a Mediterranean species causing damage essentially on wheat, is also
   well adapted to colder climate conditions and can extensively damage
   oilseed rape. Monitoring the different development stages of M.
   artiellia in a field cultivated with oilseed rape provided more
   information about the life cycle and showed that only one generation can
   develop between the sowing in autumn and April.},

Title = {Improved short-term prediction of significant wave height by decomposing
   deterministic and stochastic components},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {177},
Pages = {743-758},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Significant wave height prediction for the following hours is a
   necessity for the planning and operation of wave energy devices. For a
   site-specific and short-term prediction, classical numerical wave
   forecasting methods may not be justified as exhaustive climatological
   data and huge computational power are needed. In this paper, a
   combination of a decomposition approach and long short-term memory
   network was presented to forecast the significant wave heights. An
   improved version of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition
   algorithm and recurrence quantification analysis were applied to
   separate the original time series into deterministic and stochastic
   components. Each decomposed series was forecasted by the long short-term
   memory network and the final predicted significant wave heights were
   obtained by integrating the deterministic and stochastic predictions.
   Wave data measured at three buoy stations along the eastern coast of the
   United States were utilized to verify the hybrid model. The performance
   of the proposed method in three different wave height ranges was
   evaluated. The results suggested that the hybrid model outperformed the
   stand-alone long short-term memory network adjusted on the unseparated
   signal; in particular, for longer lead times and larger wave heights.

Abstract = {High surface area activated carbons were obtained from chestnut shells,
   a lignocellulosic waste of the food industry generated by the peeling
   process in the preparation of candied products. KOH activation, preceded
   by a pyrolysis step, was performed in different conditions of activation
   temperature and inert flow gas. At 750 degrees C were prepared activated
   carbons at different KOH/precursor weight ratio. The adsorbent materials
   obtained were mainly microporous. The best results (S-BET 1792 m(2)
   g(-1) and VTOT 0.729 cm(3) g(-1)) were obtained in the activated carbon
   obtained at 750 degrees C with the largest KOH/precursor weight ratio
   (2: 1). The adsorbents were tested in a CO2, CH4 and H-2 adsorption
   process at high pressure. The activated carbons appear to be excellent
   candidates in terms of adsorption capacity, selectivity towards CO2 and
   for natural gas storage. The highest CO2 adsorption capacity achieved
   was equal to 587.86 mg g(-1) at 3 MPa and 25 degrees C. (C) 2017

Journal = {CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {186-197},
Abstract = {Discolored (chemically discolored) foraminiferal tests have long been
   known to occur in shallow-water, silici-carbonate sediments of the
   Caribbean, but their distributions and environmental significance have
   been little studied. To address this, nineteen sediment samples were
   collected from the shoreline around St. Kitts (<1 m), eleven from nearby
   coral reefs (6 - 27 m below sea level) and one from a shipwreck, the
   River Taw. Three species and one species-group were examined in detail:
   Amphistegina gibbosa, Archaias angulatus, Asterigerina carinata and
   Peneroplis spp.(= P. carinatus + P. proteus). Discolored specimens were
   either gray or brown. The percentage of this group of species discolored
   per sample was calculated, as was the percentage of each species
   discolored per sample. The percentage of discolored miliolids was
   consistently greater than that of rotaliids. The mean percentage of
   discolored specimens along the shoreline exceeded that on the reefs,
   suggesting that discolored specimens have potential as a proxy for
   palaeodepth. It was, however, greatest around the River Taw. High
   percentages mark areas with either low rates of sediment reworking or
   high levels of iron and manganese associated with the chemical
   alteration of tests. Observations on the River Taw show that discolored
   foraminifera may be used to assess the impact of artificial reefs on
   marine ecosystems.},

Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Authigenic carbonates recovered from two newly discovered active cold
   seeps on the northwestern slope of the South China Sea have been studied
   using petrography, mineralogy, stable carbon and oxygen isotopic, as
   well as trace element compositions, together with AMS C-14 ages of
   shells of seep-dwelling bivalves to unravel fluid sources, formation
   conditions, and seepage dynamics. The two seeps (ROV1 and ROV2),
   referred to as `Haim seeps' herein, are approximately 7 kilometers
   apart, and are typified by abundant carbonate rocks represented bycrusts
   and nodules. Aragonite and high-Mg calcite are the main carbonate
   minerals. Based on low delta C-13(carbonate) values ranging from -43.0
   parts per thousand to -27.5 parts per thousand (V-PDB) methane is
   apparently the predominant carbon source of seep carbonates. The
   corresponding 8180 values, varying from 2.5 parts per thousand to 5.8
   parts per thousand (V-PDB), mostly are higher than calculated values
   representing precipitation in equilibrium with seawater (2.5\%o to 3.8
   parts per thousand), which probably reflects past destabilization of
   locally abundant gas hydrates. In addition, we found that carbonates
   with bivalve shells are generally aragonite-dominated, and bear no
   barium enrichment but uranium enrichments, reflecting shallow formation
   depths close to the seafloor. In contrast, carbonate crusts without
   bivalve shells and nodules contain more calcite, and are characterized
   by major molybdenum enrichment and different degrees of barium
   enrichment, agreeing with precipitation at greater depth under strictly
   anoxic conditions. AMS 14C ages suggest that a major episode of
   carbonate precipitation occurred between 6.1 ka and 5.1 ka BP at the
   Haima seeps, followed by a possibly subordinate episode from
   approximately 3.9 ka to 2.9 ka BP. The common occurrence of dead
   bivalves at both sites indicates that chemosynthesis-based communities
   flourished to a greater extent in the past, probably reflecting a
   decline of seepage activity in recent times. Overall, these results
   confirm that authigenic carbonates from gas hydrate-bearing areas can
   provide insight into long-term seepage dynamics and the genesis and fate
   of marine gas hydrate reservoirs.},
