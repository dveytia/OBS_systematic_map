Title = {Understanding Tourism Suppliers' Resilience to Climate Change in a Rural
   Destination in Maine},
Journal = {TOURISM PLANNING \& DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {Supplier characteristics influence destination resilience to climate
   change, but there is limited research applying social resilience
   theories to this group. Using socio-ecological and psychology resilience
   theories, we examined how a group of rural, nature-based tourism
   suppliers enhanced their resilience to climate change. We conducted 17
   interviews in the Bay of Machias, Maine, USA to examine how
   characteristics of tourism suppliers influenced their resilience to
   climate change. Despite facing socio-economic challenges, suppliers were
   taking action to adapt to their most pressing climate change threat,
   flooding, by leveraging their knowledge, skill sets, and social ties.
   This study suggests that leveraging resources, collaboration, and
   developing connections to places through livelihoods may enhance the
   resilience of rural tourism suppliers. We suggest that the framework
   used in this study has broader applicability to understanding how
   suppliers can build destination resilience to climate change; however,
   the destination life cycle phase must be incorporated into resilience
   considerations.},

Title = {Urbanization effects on surface air temperature trends in Thailand
   during 1970-2019},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Continued urban expansion undergone in the last decades has converted
   many weather stations in Thailand into suburban and urban setting. Based
   on homogenio data during 1970-2019, therefore, this study examines
   urbanization effects on mean surface air temperature (Tmean) trends in
   Thailand. Analysis shows that urban-type stations register the strongest
   warming trends while rural-type stations exhibit the smallest trends.
   Across Thailand, annual urban-warming contribution exhibits a wide range
   (< 5\% to 77\%), probably manifesting the Urban Heat Island (UHI)
   differences from city to city resulting from the varied urban
   characteristics and climatic background. Country-wide average urban
   warming contribution shows a significant increasing trend of 0.15 oC per
   decade, accounting for 40.5\% of the overall warming. This evidence
   indicates that urban expansion has great influence on surface warming,
   and the urban-warming bias contributes large fraction of rising
   temperature trends in Thailand. The increasing trend of annual Tmean for
   Thailand as a whole after adjusting urban-warming bias is brought down
   to the same rate as the annual global mean temperature trend, reflecting
   a national baseline signal driven by large-scale anthropogenic-induced
   climate change. Our results provide a scientific reference for policy
   makers and urban planners to mitigate substantial fraction of the UHI
   warming.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {361-378},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {In light of current climate change projections in recent years, there
   has been an increasing interest in the assessment of indoor overheating
   in domestic environments in previously heating-dominated climates. This
   paper presents a monitoring study of overheating in 122 London dwellings
   during the summers of 2009 and 2010. Dry Bulb Temperature and Relative
   Humidity in the main living and sleeping area were monitored at 10 min
   intervals. The ASHRAE Standard 55 adaptive thermal comfort method was
   applied, which uses outdoor temperature to derive the optimum indoor
   comfort temperature. It was found that 29\% of all living rooms and 31\%
   of all bedrooms monitored during 2009 had more than 1\% of summertime
   occupied hours outside the comfort zone recommended by the standard to
   achieve 90\% acceptability. In 2010, 37\% of monitored living rooms and
   49\% of monitored bedrooms had more than 1\% of summertime occupied
   hours outside this comfort zone. The findings of this study indicate
   that London dwellings face a significant risk of overheating under the
   current climate. Occupant exposure to excess indoor temperatures is
   likely to be exacerbated in the future if climate change adaptation
   strategies are not incorporated in Building Regulations, building design
   and retrofit. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS \& RISK},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {This study presents the development of a geographic information system
   (GIS) land-use planning tool for coastal areas based on the calculated
   exposure to coastal erosion of buildings and infrastructure. Responding
   to the needs of land-use planners, who are involved in the project from
   the beginning, this tool facilitates identification of adaptation
   solutions based on coastal sensitivity to erosion. All buildings, roads,
   railways, aqueducts, sewer systems, hiking trails and bicycle routes
   were mapped at high resolution, and an exposure value was assigned to
   each for seven time horizons between 2015 and 2100. The calculations
   were based on three parameters: (1) the distance between the structure
   and the shoreline or coastline; (2) the most likely shoreline or
   coastline migration rate for each coastal geomorphology behaviour unit
   (CGBU); and (3) the maximum event retreat measured during a storm for
   each type of coast. This method was applied to Baie des Chaleurs in
   Quebec, Canada. The area comprises 11 municipalities with a total of 105
   km of coast. The approach not only produces current and future portraits
   of building and infrastructure exposed to erosion, but also provides an
   original land-use planning and intervention tool for coastal areas.},

Title = {Identifying design shortcomings and heat-island effects in schools
   located in warm climates: An outdoor environmental assessment procedure
   based on remote sensing tools},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The current effects of global warming and a growing obsolescence in the
   built environment are rendering out-door areas of existing schools
   thermally vulnerable and uncomfortable, thereby causing unsuitably hot
   temperatures during the academic year. This paper aims to diagnose and
   reveal the main weaknesses and design shortcomings in outdoor areas of
   schools. To this end, this research contributes with a normalised
   characterisation procedure that provides quantified parameters that not
   only focuses on design patterns and wooded and shaded spaces (Normalised
   Difference Vegetation Index), but also on ground materials (Solar
   Reflectance Index) in order to reduce the impact of solar radiation and
   adjust future renovation strategies for southern European schools. With
   the novelty of using remote sensing tools and in situ measurements, an
   outdoor environmental assessment is made of a representative sample of
   100 schools in Andalusia, a Mediterranean region in southern Spain. The
   results demonstrate that shade percentages are greatly limited, whereby
   90\% of schools contain between 0 and 10\% of wooded area, mostly with a
   vegetation index in the range of 0-0.3, along with 70\% of centres with
   more than 80\% of their ground area covered with hard paving, thereby
   involving a higher absorption of solar energy. Conclusions not only
   identify weaknesses and design shortcomings and highlight key
   implications based on the promotion of heat mitigation strategies
   through bioclimatic renovation actions, but they also provide ranges of
   recommended values for the established indices, towards achieving more
   shaded and comfortable areas in schools.},

Abstract = {Small islands are often taken as poster children for climate change

   dependency. Looking at small islands' issues beyond SIDS implies the
   recognition of topics such as asymmetrical governance structures,

Abstract = {Coastal zones are an essential part of maintaining sustainability in the
   world. Coastal regions have gained importance due to various factors,
   including high ecological production, dense population, industry
   compatibility, waste disposal, leisure, transportation, and development
   of military strategies. Coasts are often on the move and must adapt
   while nature constantly works to maintain balance. Southeast Asia has
   gained prominence due to its rich ecosystem, high productivity, and
   densely populated coastal region. In light of this, the coastlines of
   Southeast Asia are threatened by various factors, including global
   climate change and human activities. These factors exacerbate the
   shoreline erosion, frequent catastrophic events, rising sea levels, and
   saltwater intrusion. Coastal management has become one of the most
   important challenges of the past decade. The coastal vulnerability index
   (CVI) was developed to identify and manage vulnerable locations along
   the coast. Thus, this review attempts to summarize coastal vulnerability
   in Southeast Asian based on journals and reports. Topics covered
   include: (1) introduction to coastal vulnerability, (2) methods for
   determining coastal vulnerability, (3) factors influencing coastal
   vulnerability (4) associated coastal vulnerability, (5) assessment gaps,
   and (6) further courses of action. Consequently, assessment of coastal
   vulnerability will support Southeast Asian coastal communities in
   guiding mitigation strategies to manage coastal threats in future
   climate change and urban development.},

Abstract = {Social vulnerability analyses have typically relied upon narratives to
   capture the nuances of the concept. While narratives have enhanced our
   understanding of the multiple drivers of vulnerability, they have had
   limited influence on hazards and climate adaptation policy. This is
   partially a function of the different needs and goals of the policy and
   research communities. The former prioritises generalised quantitative
   information, while the latter is more concerned with capturing
   complexity. A theoretically driven and empirically tested quantitative
   vulnerability and capacities index (VCI) for use at the local scale is
   presented to help connect vulnerability research and policy. There are
   four versions of the index for use in rural and urban contexts at the
   household and community levels. There can be an infinite number of
   drivers of vulnerability, but the VCI draws upon 12 indicators to
   represent material, institutional and attitudinal aspects of
   differential vulnerability and capacities.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean basin (MB) connects the south with the north and the
   East (Europe, Africa \& Asia). It is a highly heterogeneous region where
   natural and anthropogenic activities interact in complex ways with
   climate variability. Climate change (CC) impacts are already defined on
   the Mediterranean. That is why the time has come to formulate a
   long-term plan for adaptation to CC of the MB. In this chapter the
   author aims (i) the assessment of the environmental vulnerability under
   CC provided in the BM during the last 30 years, (ii) the determination
   of environmental vulnerability indicators that the author call Major
   Common Indicators (MCI), and (iii) identification of adaptation
   strategies based on these indicators. For this analysis the author used
   the results of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI), developed by
   SOPAC. In this paper, the author extracted, compiled, compared and
   analyzed the data of the EVI of 8 selected Mediterranean countries; 4
   countries in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt) and 4
   Southern Europe (Spain, France, Italy and Greece).},

Title = {Semi-probabilistic coastal flood impact analysis: From deterministic
   hazards to multi-damage model impacts},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {143},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coastal flood impact assessments are important tools for risk management
   and are performed by combining the hazard component with the
   vulnerability of exposed assets, to quantify consequences (or impacts)
   in terms of relative or absolute (e.g. financial) damage. The process
   generates uncertainties that should be taken into account for the
   correct representation of the consequences of floods. This study
   presents a coastal flood impact application at the spatial level of the
   Stavanger municipality (Norway), based on a multi-damage model approach
   able to represent impacts, and their overall uncertainty. Hazard
   modelling was performed using the LISFLOOD-FP code, taking into account
   historical extreme water level events (1988-2017) and relative sea level
   rise scenarios. Direct impacts were calculated in the form of relative
   and financial damage for different building categories, using flood
   damage curves. The results showed that the expected impacts are fewer
   than 50 flooded receptors and less than (sic)1 million in damage in the
   current sea level scenario. The impacts could double by the end of the
   century, considering the most optimistic relative sea level scenario.
   The results were discussed considering the limitations of the approach
   for both hazard and impact modelling, that will be improved in future
   implementations. The outcome of this study may be useful for
   cost-benefit analyses of mitigation actions and local-scale plans for
   adaptation.},

Title = {A Framework to Manage Coastal Squeeze},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The coastal zone is in a critical state worldwide, due to the loss and
   fragmentation of its ecosystems. Much of this is caused by long-term
   anthropic local, regional, or global actions, which drive coastal
   squeeze processes. Most of the criteria to evaluate the effects of
   coastal squeeze are focused on merely identifying its effect on the
   coastal zone. Here, we propose a framework to manage (identify, analyze,
   quantify, and tackle) the effect of coastal squeeze. This DESCR
   framework examines the relations between Drivers, Exchanges, and States
   of the environment to subsequently evaluate the chronic, negative
   Consequences and determine possible Responses. To illustrate the
   application of the DESCR framework, the coastal zone of Puerto Morelos,
   in the Mexican Caribbean, was studied using this approach. We analyzed
   the systemic interactions among the coastal ecosystems in this area,
   such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, beach, coastal dunes, and mangroves,
   which have been altered over the last decades, resulting in a severe
   coastal squeeze. Recommended responses include urgent measures for
   ecosystem management to mitigate the coastal squeeze.},

Title = {Projections of South Asian Summer Monsoon under Global Warming from 1.5
   degrees to 5 degrees C},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {The South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) is one of the most crucial climate
   components in boreal summer. The future potential changes in the SASM
   have great importance for climate change adaption and policy setting in
   this populous region. To understand the SASM changes and their link with
   the global warming of 1.5 degrees-5 degrees C above the preindustrial
   level, we investigate the changes in the SASM circulation and
   precipitation based on a large-ensemble simulation conducted with
   Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2). With the global mean
   surface temperature (GMST) increase, the large-ensemble mean of SASM
   circulation is projected to weaken almost linearly while the
   precipitation and precipitable water are projected to enhance
   quasi-linearly. A double anticyclone along the tropical Indian Ocean is
   a major anomalous circulation pattern for each additional degree of
   warming and is responsible for the weakening of the lower-level
   westerlies. The decreased upper-level land-sea thermal contrast
   (TCupper) is the main thermal driver for the weakening of the SASM
   circulation while the lower-level thermal contrast contributes little.
   The nonlinearly decreased TCupper is mainly related to the temperature
   response to the increased CO2 forcing and convection-induced latent heat
   release in the tropics. The increase in the SASM precipitation is mainly
   due to the quasi-linearly increased positive contribution of the
   thermodynamic component, while the dynamic component has a negative
   impact. Both horizontal moisture advection and moisture convergence
   contribute to the precipitation increase, and moisture convergence plays
   a dominant role. These results provide new insight that the SASM changes
   can be roughly scaled by the GMST changes.},

Abstract = {Traditional assessment of heat-related health risks neglects the
   influence of the building physics as outdoor conditions are used as
   predictor variables. Data on heat-related mortality from Berlin, Germany
   and from the US are evaluated with a risk concept which differentiates
   between outdoor and indoor hazards. Such, the influence of non-linear
   building physics on heat-related risks can be considered and the impact
   of adaptation strategies can be examined.
   The number of heat-related deaths in the age-group 65+ for Berlin is
   expected to double with each 1 K increase in ambient temperature. It can
   be reduced by 50\% with a mean ambient air-temperature reduction of 0.8
   K. Countermeasures to urban heat islands are evaluated according to
   their reduction potential on hazards, both indoors and outdoors. The
   analysis shows that classic UHI countermeasures, which are effective in
   reducing air-temperatures outdoors, do not necessarily reduce the indoor
   hazard. Regarding indoor heat-related hazards, trees, facade and roof
   greening, cool roofs and cool pavements have a low impact only. Measures
   at the building level, namely cool roofs and facade greening perform
   best, however, passive cooling and air-conditioning are most effective.
   To reduce the number of excess deaths in a changing climate, combined
   measures are necessary. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise threatens to increase the impacts of future storms and
   hurricanes on coastal communities. However, many coastal hazard
   mitigation plans do not consider sea level rise when assessing storm
   surge risk. Here we apply a GIS-based approach to quantify potential
   changes in storm surge risk due to sea level rise on Long Island, New
   York. We demonstrate a method for combining hazard exposure and
   community vulnerability to spatially characterize risk for both present
   and future sea level conditions using commonly available national data
   sets. Our results show that sea level rise will likely increase risk in
   many coastal areas and will potentially create risk where it was not
   before. We find that even modest and probable sea level rise (.5 m by
   2080) vastly increases the numbers of people (47\% increase) and
   property loss (73\% increase) impacted by storm surge. In addition, the
   resulting maps of hazard exposure and community vulnerability provide a
   clear and useful example of the visual representation of the spatial
   distribution of the components of risk that can be helpful for
   developing targeted hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation
   strategies. Our results suggest that coastal agencies tasked with
   managing storm surge risk must consider the effects of sea level rise if
   they are to ensure safe and sustainable coastal communities in the
   future.},

Abstract = {Twenty years ago, the multidimensional, positive definite, advection
   transport algorithm was introduced by Smolarkiewicz. Over the two
   decades since, it has been applied countless times to numerous problems,
   however almost always on rectilinear grids. One of the few exceptions is
   the Operational Multiscale Environment model with Grid Adaptivity
   (OMEGA), an atmospheric simulation system originally designed to
   simulate atmospheric dispersion in the planetary boundary layer, but
   since then used for both mesoscale (from meso-alpha to meso-gamma)
   dispersion and weather forecasting. One of the unique aspects of OMEGA
   is the triangular unstructured grid geometry which leads in a natural
   way to the creation of a global grid with continuously variable
   resolution from roughly 100 km over the oceans to less than 10 km over
   regions of interest. Another unique aspect is the concept of dynamically
   adapting grid resolution-sometimes also called solution-adaptive grid
   resolution. A central element of the modelling system, however, is its
   advection solver-MPDATA. This paper presents the implementation of
   MPDATA on an unstructured grid and demonstrates its accuracy and
   efficiency using analytic and idealized test cases. Copyright (c) 2005

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the intra-city
   surface heat island (herein termed the surface urban heat island, SUHI)
   is critical for the design of urban heat mitigation strategies. Large
   disparities in the spatiotemporal variations of SUHIs are anticipated
   under different urbanization processes. However, most previous studies
   have focused solely on the inter-annual spatiotemporal SUHI variations
   of regular urbanization, while those for stable- and
   counter-urbanization remain largely unknown. Based on the remote
   identification of these three urbanization types over Guangzhou, China,
   we propose a novel strategy to investigate simultaneously the
   spatiotemporal variations and the associated controls of SUHIs. Our
   results indicate that: (1) Counter-, regular-, and stable-urbanization
   occurs mainly over the city center, city periphery, and the in-between
   areas, respectively. (2) The three urbanization types all demonstrate
   similar and significant growth in the daytime local SUHI intensity
   (SUHII). (3) There are significant disparities in the contributions of
   controls to the inter-annual daytime SUHII trends for these three
   urbanization processes. For the regular urbanization, the increase of
   the impervious surface percentage (ISP) dominates daytime SUHII growth,
   while the combination of ISP and residual factors (e.g., background
   climate and 3D urban geometry) leads for counter urbanization. For
   stable urbanization, the combination of residual controls and the
   increase in population density is the major factor. Urban divisional
   management may contribute to the mitigation of intra-city SUHI. Our
   findings potentially advance our understanding of changes in urban
   thermal environment under different urbanization processes.},

Title = {A systematic review of ecological attributes that confer resilience to
   climate change in environmental restoration},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Ecological restoration is widely practiced as a means of rehabilitating
   ecosystems and habitats that have been degraded or impaired through
   human use or other causes. Restoration practices now are confronted by
   climate change, which has the potential to influence long-term
   restoration outcomes. Concepts and attributes from the resilience
   literature can help improve restoration and monitoring efforts under
   changing climate conditions. We systematically examined the published
   literature on ecological resilience to identify biological, chemical,
   and physical attributes that confer resilience to climate change. We
   identified 45 attributes explicitly related to climate change and
   classified them as individual-(9), population-(6), community-(7),
   ecosystem-(7), or process-level attributes (16). Individual studies
   defined resilience as resistance to change or recovery from disturbance,
   and only a few studies explicitly included both concepts in their
   definition of resilience. We found that individual and population
   attributes generally are suited to species-or habitat-specific
   restoration actions and applicable at the population scale. Community
   attributes are better suited to habitat-specific restoration at the site
   scale, or system-wide restoration at the ecosystem scale. Ecosystem and
   process attributes vary considerably in their type and applicability. We
   summarize these relationships in a decision support table and provide
   three example applications to illustrate how these classifications can
   be used to prioritize climate change resilience attributes for specific
   restoration actions. We suggest that (1) including resilience as an
   explicit planning objective could increase the success of restoration
   projects, (2) considering the ecological context and focal scale of a
   restoration action is essential in choosing appropriate resilience
   attributes, and (3) certain ecological attributes, such as diversity and
   connectivity, are more commonly considered to confer resilience because
   they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems. We propose that
   identifying sources of ecological resilience is a critical step in
   restoring ecosystems in a changing climate.},

Title = {Implications of climate change for the fishes of the British Isles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {74},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1143-1205},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent climatic change has been recorded across the globe. Although
   environmental change is a characteristic feature of life on Earth and
   has played a major role in the evolution and global distribution of
   biodiversity, predicted future rates of climatic change, especially in
   temperature, are such that they will exceed any that has occurred over
   recent geological time. Climate change is considered as a key threat to
   biodiversity and to the structure and function of ecosystems that may
   already be subject to significant anthropogenic stress. The current
   understanding of climate change and its likely consequences for the
   fishes of Britain and Ireland and the surrounding seas are reviewed
   through a series of case studies detailing the likely response of
   several marine, diadromous and freshwater fishes to climate change.
   Changes in climate, and in particular, temperature have and will
   continue to affect fish at all levels of biological organization:
   cellular, individual, population, species, community and ecosystem,
   influencing physiological and ecological processes in a number of
   direct, indirect and complex ways. The response of fishes and of other
   aquatic taxa will vary according to their tolerances and life stage and
   are complex and difficult to predict. Fishes may respond directly to
   climate-change-related shifts in environmental processes or indirectly
   to other influences, such as community-level interactions with other
   taxa. However, the ability to adapt to the predicted changes in climate
   will vary between species and between habitats and there will be winners
   and losers. In marine habitats, recent changes in fish community
   structure will continue as fishes shift their distributions relative to
   their temperature preferences. This may lead to the loss of some
   economically important cold-adapted species such as Gadus morhua and
   Clupea harengus from some areas around Britain and Ireland, and the
   establishment of some new, warm-adapted species. Increased temperatures
   are likely to favour cool-adapted (e.g. Perca fluviatilis) and
   warm-adapted freshwater fishes (e.g. roach Rutilus rutilus and other
   cyprinids) whose distribution and reproductive success may currently be
   constrained by temperature rather than by cold-adapted species (e.g.
   salmonids). Species that occur in Britain and Ireland that are at the
   edge of their distribution will be most affected, both negatively and
   positively. Populations of conservation importance (e.g. Salvelinus
   alpinus and Coregonus spp.) may decline irreversibly. However, changes
   in food-web dynamics and physiological adaptation, for example because
   of climate change, may obscure or alter predicted responses. The
   residual inertia in climate systems is such that even a complete
   cessation in emissions would still leave fishes exposed to continued
   climate change for at least half a century. Hence, regardless of the
   success or failure of programmes aimed at curbing climate change, major
   changes in fish communities can be expected over the next 50 years with
   a concomitant need to adapt management strategies accordingly.},

Title = {Quantifying the expected value of uncertain management choices for
   over-abundant Greylag Geese},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {214},
Pages = {147-155},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In many parts of the world, conservation successes or global
   anthropogenic changes have led to increasing native species populations
   that then compete with human resource use. In the Orkney Islands,
   Scotland, a 60-fold increase in Greylag Goose Anser anser numbers over
   24 years has led to agricultural damages and culling attempts that have
   failed to prevent population increase. To address uncertainty about why
   populations have increased, we combined empirical modelling of possible
   drivers of Greylag Goose population change with expert-elicited benefits
   of alternative management actions to identify whether to learn versus
   act immediately to reduce damages by geese. We built linear
   mixed-effects models relating annual goose densities on farms to land
   use and environmental covariates and estimated AICc model weights to
   indicate relative support for six hypotheses of change. We elicited from
   experts the expected likelihood that one of six actions would achieve an
   objective of halting goose population growth, given each hypothesis for
   population change. Model weights and expected effects of actions were
   combined in Value of Information analysis (VoI) to quantify the utility
   of resolving uncertainty in each hypothesis through adaptive management
   and monitoring. The action with the highest expected value under
   existing uncertainty was to increase the extent of low quality habitats,
   whereas assuming equal hypothesis weights changed the best action to
   culling. VoI analysis showed that the value of learning to resolve
   uncertainty in any individual hypothesis for goose population change was
   low, due to high support for a single hypothesis of change. Our study
   demonstrates a two-step framework that learns about the most likely
   drivers of change for an over-abundant species, and uses this knowledge
   to weight the utility of alternative management actions. Our approach
   helps inform which strategies might best be implemented to resolve
   uncertainty when there are competing hypotheses for change and competing
   management choices.},

Abstract = {Life on Earth vitally depends on the availability of water. Human
   pressure on freshwater resources is increasing, as is human exposure to
   weather-related extremes (droughts, storms, floods) caused by climate
   change. Understanding these changes is pivotal for developing mitigation
   and adaptation strategies. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)
   defines a suite of essential climate variables (ECVs), many related to
   the water cycle, required to systematically monitor Earth's climate
   system. Since long-term observations of these ECVs are derived from
   different observation techniques, platforms, instruments, and retrieval
   algorithms, they often lack the accuracy, completeness, and resolution,
   to consistently characterize water cycle variability at multiple spatial
   and temporal scales. Here, we review the capability of ground-based and
   remotely sensed observations of water cycle ECVs to consistently observe
   the hydrological cycle. We evaluate the relevant land, atmosphere, and
   ocean water storages and the fluxes between them, including
   anthropogenic water use. Particularly, we assess how well they close on
   multiple temporal and spatial scales. On this basis, we discuss gaps in
   observation systems and formulate guidelines for future water cycle
   observation strategies. We conclude that, while long-term water cycle
   monitoring has greatly advanced in the past, many observational gaps
   still need to be overcome to close the water budget and enable a
   comprehensive and consistent assessment across scales. Trends in water
   cycle components can only be observed with great uncertainty, mainly due
   to insufficient length and homogeneity. An advanced closure of the water
   cycle requires improved model-data synthesis capabilities, particularly
   at regional to local scales.},

Title = {Tropical cyclone risk assessment using geospatial techniques for the
   eastern coastal region of Bangladesh},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Tropical cyclones frequently affect millions of people, damaging
   properties, livelihoods and environments in the coastal region of
   Bangladesh. The intensity and extent of tropical cyclones and their
   impacts are likely to increase in the future due to climate change. The
   eastern coastal region of Bangladesh is one of the most cyclone-affected
   coastal regions. A comprehensive spatial assessment is therefore
   essential to produce a risk map by identifying the areas under high
   cyclone risks to support mitigation strategies. This study aims to
   develop a comprehensive tropical cyclone risk map using geospatial
   techniques and to quantify the degree of risk in the eastern coastal
   region of Bangladesh. In total, 14 spatial criteria under three risk
   components, namely, vulnerability and exposure. hazard, and mitigation
   capacity, were assessed. A spatial layer was created for each criterion,
   and weighting was conducted following the Analytical Hierarchy Process.
   The individual risk component maps were generated from their indices,
   and subsequently, the overall risk map was produced by integrating the
   indices through a weighted overlay approach. Results demonstrate that
   the very-high risk zone covered 9\% of the study area, whereas the
   high-risk zone covered 27\%. Specifically, the south-western (Sandwip
   and Sonagazi), western (Patiya, Kutubdia, Maheshkhali, Chakaria. Cox's
   Bazar and Chittagong Sadar) and south-western (Teknal) regions of the
   study site are likely to be under a high risk of tropical cyclone
   impacts. Low and very-low hazard zones constitute 11\% and 28\% of the
   study area, respectively, and most of these areas are located inland.
   The results of this study can be used by the concerned authorities to
   develop and apply effective cyclone impact mitigation plans and
   strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Impacts of climate change on Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and
   the growing population pose a major threat to water and food security in
   India. Adapting to such changes needs reliable projections of ISMR by
   general circulation models. Here we find that, majority of new
   generation climate models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   phase5 (CMIP5) fail to simulate the post-1950 decreasing trend of ISMR.
   The weakening of monsoon is associated with the warming of Southern
   Indian Ocean and strengthening of cyclonic formation in the tropical
   western Pacific Ocean. We also find that these large-scale changes are
   not captured by CMIP5 models, with few exceptions, which is the reason
   of this failure. Proper representation of these highlighted geophysical
   processes in next generation models may improve the reliability of ISMR
   projections. Our results also alert the water resource planners to
   evaluate the CMIP5 models before using them for adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Green roof effects on daytime heat in a prefabricated residential
   neighbourhood in Berlin, Germany},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Berlin currently experiences increasing environmental challenges
   especially through the combined effect of urbanization and climate
   change. The intensification of summer temperature extremes has become
   increasingly evident in recent years, urging the city to promote
   mitigation and adaptation measures for local heat load reduction. Green
   roofs have been widely recognized as an effective urban greening
   strategy to reduce heat stress in cities. This study thus analyses the
   effect of rooftop greening on outdoor thermal conditions in an
   inner-city prefabricated residential area in Berlin. The studied
   neighbourhood is one of the inner-city hot-spot areas of environmental
   loads, highlighting the need for green solutions. We quantified thermal
   effects of intensive green roof implementation using the ENVI-met model
   which, for the first time, has been applied at the city's official
   planning scale. The study thereby aims at overcoming the mismatch
   between research scales and planning scales, facilitating the knowledge
   transfer between the science community and urban practitioners,
   particularly in land use planning. Results indicate that on a hot summer
   day, green roofs can significantly improve daytime thermal comfort at
   the roof level with an estimated decrease in physiological equivalent
   temperature (PET) by 9 K. Green roofs can thus provide spaces of
   qualitatively increased thermal comfort compared to street-level areas.
   Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of rooftop greening in
   terms of heat adaptation at the neighbourhood level. Therefore, this
   study suggests that these greening systems should be emphasized in
   future effect-oriented and sustainable urban planning assessments,
   especially of inner-city prefabricated housing estates.},

Abstract = {Recent research on climate vulnerability in cities in the Amazon Delta
   and Estuary (ADE) shows that about 1.2 million people are at risk of
   flooding due to the rapid unplanned occupation of lowlands and the
   absence of investment in infrastructure and services. In this study, we
   use secondary climate and census data, interviews and focus groups in
   four small cities in the Amazon Delta and Estuary (SCADEs), to discuss
   how residents and local governments perceive and respond to climate
   hazards and their implications. These SCADEs may be better equipped than
   other urban areas to deal with challenges brought by climate change, due
   partially to residents' high mobility between urban and rural areas and
   a tradition of adaptive actions in a dynamic social and environmental
   context. However, persistent flooding and sinkholes demonstrate the
   limited capacity of local governments to cope with the dynamics of
   accelerated occupation of floodplain areas in SCADEs.},

Title = {Sea-level rise, marine storms and the resilience of Mediterranean
   coastal wetlands: lessons learned from the Ebro Delta},
Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {73},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1246-1254},
Abstract = {Understanding the effects of sea-level rise (SLR) and marine storms on
   Mediterranean coastal wetlands is crucial to developing adequate climate
   change adaptation pathways. Because the majority of these systems are in
   deltaic areas, integrated river basin management (water and sediment
   discharge) is a must in the design of such pathways. Rising sea levels
   will tend to gradually flood coastal lagoons and marshes unless there is
   enough sediment supplied to compensate for the increasing deficit.
   Although the relationship between climate change and Mediterranean
   coastal storms is weak or non-existent, their impacts are expected to
   grow in the context of SLR and coastal squeezing. For example, the most
   affected Ebro Delta coastal stretches during the Gloria storm (January
   2020), one of the most intense ever recorded in the Mediterranean, were
   those where the beach was narrower and weaker. Hard engineering
   solutions, such as the construction of dykes, as a protection measure
   against marine storms are not sustainable under scenarios of climate
   change and energy scarcity. A management approach based on soft
   engineering coastal defences and nature-based solutions is the most
   cost-effective and sustainable in the long run. The adequacy of
   implementing this kind of solution along the Mediterranean coast is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the potential of
   strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to mainstream consideration of
   climate change adaptation (CCA) in Bangladesh, particularly for the
   coastal zone, to improve disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies in
   this region. Continuing climate risks require adaptation at all levels
   of society. The densely populated and resource-rich coastal zone of
   Bangladesh is at risk to the impacts of climate change.
   Design/methodology/approach This research is based on secondary sources
   (gray and published literature) of information on climate change impacts
   on the coastal zone of Bangladesh. The sources include research reports,
   online publications, governmental reports, scientific journals,
   international reports, books, journal articles and other academic
   resources on SEA, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and DRR. In
   addition to examining SEA in Bangladesh, this paper investigates SEA
   cases in different countries to obtain insights from the successful
   application of SEA for CCA. Findings The paper draws on several cases
   from different countries demonstrating that SEA has a significant
   potential to coordinate CCA objectives. The findings reveal that the
   appropriate use of SEA can enable DRR through CCA. Originality/value
   This study argues that SEA has a potential role in supporting CCA.},

Abstract = {Decisions to plan for the potential future impacts of climate change and
   sea-level rise are being made every day around the coast of Australia
   and New Zealand. Decisions about the location of new coastal development
   in potentially hazardous coastal areas and hazard mitigation for
   existing development are a routine part of the planning processes for
   both countries. These decisions are being made in the face of incomplete
   information on both natural climatic variability and its extremes, and
   with considerable uncertainties in the magnitude of future
   greenhouse-induced climate change and sealevel rise. Because planning
   decisions cannot be delayed until there is complete certainty in the
   prediction of future greenhouse effects, uncertainties must be taken
   into account when planning decisions are made. The various spheres of
   government in Australia and New Zealand have chosen different mechanisms
   to take into account coastal impacts, and the attendant uncertainties.
   These mechanisms depend to a large extent on each country's coastal
   management systems. This paper analyses the climate change and sea-level
   rise impact mitigation strategies adopted by the two countries. This
   analysis concludes that the governments of both countries use a
   policy-driven approach to planning for potential future coastal change,
   implemented through a hierarchy of regional and local plans, rules and
   guidelines. Despite these similarities, legislative differences are
   likely to result in subtle differences between the two countries in the
   type and magnitude of the reduction of the impacts of potential future
   coastal change.},

Title = {Rethinking the Galapagos Islands as a Complex Social-Ecological System:
   Implications for Conservation and Management},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2008},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Galapagos Islands are among the most renowned natural sites in the
   world. Unlike other oceanic archipelagos, the ecological and
   evolutionary processes characteristic of Galapagos have been minimally
   affected by human activities, and the archipelago still retains most of
   its original, unique biodiversity. However, several recent reports
   suggest that the development model has turned unsustainable and that the
   unique values of the archipelago might be seriously at risk. In response
   to international concern, UNESCO added Galapagos to the list of World
   Heritage in Danger in 2007. Our goal was to provide new insights into
   the origins of the present-day crisis and suggest possible management
   alternatives. To this end, we re-examined the Galapagos situation from a
   broad systems perspective, conceptualizing the archipelago as a complex
   social-ecological system. Past, present, and possible future trends were
   explored using the resilience theory as a perspective for understanding
   the dynamics of the system. Four major historical periods were
   characterized and analyzed using Holling's adaptive cycle metaphor. The
   current Galapagos situation was characterized as a prolonged series of
   crisis events followed by renewal attempts that have not yet been
   completed. Three plausible future scenarios were identified, with
   tourism acting as the primary driver of change. The current tourism
   model reduces the system's resilience through its effects on the
   economy, population growth, resource consumption, invasive species
   arrival, and lifestyle of the island residents. Opportunities to
   reorganize and maintain a desirable state do exist. However, strong
   political and management decisions are urgently needed to avoid an
   irreversible shift to a socially and environmentally undesirable regime.
   Key measures to achieve a new sustainability paradigm for Galapagos
   include modifying traditional practices to produce a more adaptive
   resilience-based co-management model, adopting a more comprehensive
   approach to territorial planning, strengthening participative approaches
   and institutional networks, and promoting transdisciplinary research at
   the frontiers of social and biophysical sciences.},

Title = {Social vulnerability analysis for sustainable disaster mitigation
   planning in coastal Bangladesh},
Journal = {DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {220-237},
Abstract = {Purpose - The opportunities and potentials of the coastal zone all over
   the world have not received much attention, and also the disaster
   mitigation approaches are seen as a curative measure rather than
   protective, both of which raise questions about sustainable coastal belt
   planning and development. What is needed is a multidisciplinary approach
   to tackle the complexity of social systems, and patterns of
   vulnerability in those systems. The aim of this paper is to attempt to
   understand those challenges in context of cyclone SIDR 2007 in
   Bangladesh.
   Design/methodology/approach - The combination of spatial and
   socio-economic data in this study is based on an empirical analysis.
   After clustering the geographical boundary, a systematic random sampling
   technique was applied to identify the respondents for a household
   survey. A total of 47 percent of the respondents were illiterate and
   thus required the help of data collectors. In-depth interviews were
   conducted with the victims of cyclone Sidr to ascertain their
   experiences during the event.
   Findings - The heterogeneous characteristics of the respondents show
   that the impact of disasters varies from individual to individual, group
   to group and community to community. It is evident that an affected
   community waiting for relief and reconstruction materials attracts
   ``dependency on relief works{''} which makes them more ``vulnerable{''}
   to other calamities. In the long run it increases the poverty ratio and
   pressurizes them to stay in a ``vulnerability trap{''} in any type of
   calamity. Furthermore, it reveals a socio-infrastructural vulnerability
   and also the overall ``social vulnerability{''} concepts by using a
   combination of socio-spatial data.
   Originality/value - This paper contains valuable information regarding
   the adaptation strategies to cyclone hazards resorted to by coastal
   peoples in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {The ecosystem services approach is now a key driver for environmental

   this, geodiversity provides or underpins many essential provisioning,

   in ecosystem functioning. Protecting geodiversity contributes to
   maintaining the resilience and adaptive capacity of biodiversity and
   supports critical ecosystem services. In addition, the analysis of
   palaeoenvironmental archives and geomorphological records provides a key
   long-term perspective on trends, rates of change and future trajectories
   in ecosystems and service delivery, an acknowledged gap within the
   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, as well as informing adaptive
   management of the effects of climate change, including sea-level rise.
   Better integration of geodiversity and biodiversity as part of Earth

Abstract = {The effects of climate change on April-October short- and long-duration
   precipitation extremes over the Canadian Prairie Provinces were
   evaluated using a multi-Regional Climate Model (RCM) ensemble available
   through the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program.
   Simulations considered include those performed with six RCMs driven by
   the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis II
   product for the 1981-2000 period and those driven by four
   Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for the current
   1971-2000 and future 2041-2070 periods (i.e. a total of 11
   current-to-future period simulation pairs). A regional frequency
   analysis approach was used to develop 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, and 50-year
   return values of precipitation extremes from NCEP and AOGCM-driven
   current and future period simulations that respectively were used to
   study the performance of RCMs and projected changes for selected return
   values at regional, grid-cell and local scales. Performance errors due
   to internal dynamics and physics of RCMs studied for the 1981-2000
   period reveal considerable variation in the performance of the RCMs.
   However, the performance errors were found to be much smaller for RCM
   ensemble averages than for individual RCMs. Projected changes in future
   climate to selected regional return values of short-duration (e.g. 15-
   and 30-min) precipitation extremes and for longer return periods (e.g.
   50-year) were found to be mostly larger than those to the longer
   duration (e.g. 24- and 48-h) extremes and short return periods (e.g.
   2-year). Overall, projected changes in precipitation extremes were
   larger for southeastern regions followed by southern and northern
   regions and smaller for southwestern and western regions of the study
   area. The changes to return values were also found to be statistically
   significant for the majority of the RCM-AOGCM simulation pairs. These
   projections might be useful as a key input for the future planning of
   urban drainage infrastructure and development of strategic climate
   change adaptation measures.},

Abstract = {The Krishna-Godavari coastal region in east coast of India has a
   525.15-km-long coastline with low-lying tidal mudflats, beaches,
   mangrove swamp, creek and tidal channels. Recently, the increasing
   frequency of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, i.e., Phylin and
   Hudhud in Andhra Pradesh coast, and the devastating impact of the 2004
   tsunami in India increased the significance in assessing the
   vulnerability of the coastal lands to inundation and flooding, notably
   in the context of climate change-induced sea level rise. This study aims
   to estimate a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) for the coastal
   subregion of Krishna-Godavari delta and to use the calculated index to
   evaluate the vulnerability of 14 coastal talukas of the Krishna-Godavari
   delta region. This CVI is calculated by using four geological and three
   physical parameters characterizing the vulnerability of the study
   coastal region, including regional slope, coastal elevation,
   geomorphology, significant wave height, mean tidal range and relative
   sea level using different conventional and remotely sensed data. Using a
   composite coastal vulnerability index based on the relative risk rating
   of those parameters, each of the 14 coastal talukas was classified
   according to their vulnerability. The CVI results depict that coasts are
   least and most vulnerable to inundation, flooding and erosion of coastal
   lands where geological parameters are more efficient to CVI. The paper
   alerts to decision makers and planners to mitigate the natural disaster
   and manage the coastal zone and is a primary step toward prioritizing
   coastal lands for climate change adaptation strategies in the view of
   increased storminess and projected sea level rise.},

Abstract = {A cocktail of land-based sources of pollution threatens coral reef
   ecosystems, and addressing these has become a key management and policy
   challenge in the State of Hawaii, other US territories, and globally. In
   West Maui, Hawai'i, nearly one quarter of all living corals were lost
   between 1995 and 2008. Onsite disposal systems (OSDS) for sewage leak
   contaminants into drinking water sources and nearshore waters. In
   recognition of this risk, the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) is
   prioritizing areas for cesspool upgrades. Independently, we applied a
   decision analysis process to identify priority areas to address sewage
   pollution from OSDS in West Maui, with the objective of reducing
   nearshore coral reef exposure to pollution. The decision science
   approach is relevant to a broader context of coastal areas both
   statewide and worldwide which are struggling with identifying pollution

Abstract = {Floods are more recurrent than any other disasters that affect the
   people of Bangladesh. Global warming and resultant climate change has
   made the situation worse, especially for Bangladesh as the vast coastal
   areas stand highly vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters due
   to steady rise of sea level. Moreover, rainwater coming from the
   upstream on the other side of Bangladesh-India boarder inundates the low
   lying lands in the downstream of Bangladesh during the time of monsoon.
   The current study is conducted in greater Sylhet region of Bangladesh
   which is known as flood prone areas since it gets affected through
   flooding almost every year. The sufferings of the people living in the
   four districts of greater Sylhet, namely Sunamganj, Moulvibazar,
   Hobiganj and Sylhet seem to be never ending. The study aims to
   investigate multidimensional fighting strategies of flood affected
   people to cope with the situation of flooding for the sake of survival.
   It is a qualitative interpretation of 40 suffering household heads who
   have been selected from 4 districts; 10 from each district by following
   simple random sampling procedure. Of 40 respondents, only 4 are found
   female household heads, and the rest are males. The findings of the
   study show that sufferings of the affected people are massive, but they
   still do not give up, never lose hope; rather they are committed to
   bounce back as they know very well that is how they will have to
   survive.},

Title = {Informing conservation planning using future sea-level rise and storm

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {51-62},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal communities across the Gulf of Mexico are increasingly
   vulnerable to coastal hazards, including sea level rise. The Gulf of
   Mexico contains 20 000 km(2) of land below 1.5 m in elevation and is one
   of the most vulnerable regions to sea level rise in the continental U.S.
   Wetlands are among the Gulf of Mexico's most economically and
   ecologically important habitats that comprise thirty-one percent (28 372
   mi(2)) of land within the U.S. Gulf coastal watershed. These increasing
   hazards threaten not only the human-built infrastructure and coastal
   communities, but also natural habitats and ecosystems. Through a
   participatory stakeholder process the project team and regional
   stakeholders identified ongoing and future conservation planning efforts
   that were best suited to be informed by sea-level rise and storm surge
   projections, socioeconomic indicators, and marsh migration scenarios.
   This study estimates the potential impacts of SLR and storm surge to
   human communities and natural habitats, with emphasis on coastal
   marshlands, in both the Galveston Bay region of Texas and the
   Choctawhatchee and Saint Andrew Bay region of Florida. Project results
   include A) marsh change and viability analysis, B) community risk
   analysis, C) community resilience analysis; and D) long-term marsh
   management analysis. Our study suggests that sea-level rise impacts
   should be incorporated into ongoing conservation planning and management
   activities in order to allow decision makers to more easily develop
   adaptation strategies that foster coastal resilience in the face of a
   changing climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Climate change is presently a major global challenge. As the world's
   largest developing country, China is particularly vulnerable to global
   warming, especially in the rapidly developing coastal regions in the
   southeast of the country. This paper provides an overview of the impacts
   of climate change on the nature of geological disasters in the coastal
   regions of southeastern China. In the context of climate change,
   processes with the potential for causing geological disasters in this
   region, including sea-level rise, land subsidence, storm surges, and
   slope failures, which already have a substantial occurrence history, are
   all aggravated. All these processes have their own characteristics and
   relevance to climate change. Sea-level rise together with land
   subsidence reduces the function of dikes and flood prevention
   infrastructure in the study areas and makes the region more vulnerable
   to typhoons, storm surges, floods, and astronomical tidal effects. Storm
   surges have caused great losses in the study areas and also have
   contributed to increases in rainstorms. As a result, numerous
   rainfall-induced slope failures, characterized by focused time
   concentration, high frequencies, strong ``burstiness,{''} and
   substantial damage, occur in the study areas. To prevent and mitigate
   such disasters that are accelerated by climate change, and to reduce
   losses, a series of measures is proposed that may help to achieve
   sustainable development in coastal southeastern China.},

Abstract = {Modern designs in shipbuilding industry, regardless of whether they are
   intended for cargo, passenger or particularly dedicated working ships
   and platforms, mostly use electric or hybrid propulsion. The new
   technology in marine propulsion and flexible operator ` s position
   during maneuvering requires redesign of traditional remote-control
   system. The article proposes digitally organized, soft programmable, CAN
   communication-based concept, solving electric and hybrid marine
   propulsion specific request in controlling propeller speed, direction
   and ship maneuverability from bridge, wings or any fly deck on the ship
   as well offers to operator a real time propulsion system control and
   monitoring. This technical concept proposes modular expandable solution
   adapted to the needs of the new propulsion drive train and applicable in
   most modern marine electrically propelled objects.},

Abstract = {In recent years, cooperative management systems have received attention
   as a means towards sustainable fisheries. Since its inception and for
   the past 20 years, the gooseneck barnacle fishery in the coast of
   Asturias has been co-managed by assigning Territorial User Rights to
   fishers' associations, allowing fishers to participate actively in the
   management and data gathering processes. Here, 20 years of landings,
   in-depth interviews and focus groups were used to characterize the
   emergence and social-ecological properties of the system. The system
   consists of 7 management areas each one some tens of kilometers long.
   The incorporation of fishers' knowledge has successfully led to
   within-area fragmentation of the management units down to single rocks
   as small as 3 m long, which are managed according to different
   protection levels. The system has empowered resource users and provided
   an opportunity for the use of both scientific information and fishers'
   knowledge to be integrated in management guidelines. Results suggest the
   adaptive capacity provided by the co-management framework has been
   essential to manage this heterogeneous fishery. The gooseneck barnacle
   fishery and its historical developments illustrate the potential for
   establishing co-management systems for small-scale fisheries in Europe.

Abstract = {This paper aims to understand how environmental stressors influence
   people?s livelihood options in the coastal belt of Bangladesh. We argue
   that environmental stressors such as cyclones, riverbank erosion,
   salinity intrusion, and floods have negative impacts on people?s lives
   by reducing their livelihood options. Twelve in-depth interviews
   (Livelihood Histories) and twelve Focus Group Discussions (FGD) based on
   two Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools (Village Timeline and
   Contextual Change) were carried out in three different sites in coastal
   Bangladesh were conducted under the study. Our study finds that when
   there are insufficient adaptation strategies to environmental stressors,
   many people turn to livelihoods banned by the government. These ?illegal
   livelihoods? include using fine mesh nets to collect shrimp fry in the
   rivers as well as logging in the Sundarbans. These people are often the
   poorestand vulnerable, and law enforcement only exacerbate their
   vulnerability. We end by concluding those that have turned to ?illegal
   livelihoods? as a result of detrimental environmental stressors should
   be viewed as a special category of vulnerable people by policymakers,
   and steps need to be taken to ensure resilience to different
   environmental stressors.},

Abstract = {Climate Change induced hazards, including cyclonic events, variations in
   temperature and rainfall, drought and salinity intrusion in water
   resources and soil are adversely affecting the agricultural production
   and food security in Bangladesh. Much more alarmingly, it is expected
   that Sea Level Rise will further deteriorate the agriculture sector in
   future. The fall of rice production in the coastal zones already
   indicates a disturbing situation under the already changing climatic
   elements. A number of studies have been under taken to explore the
   impacts, the adaptation measures being taken and that can be taken,
   vulnerability of the people living in these areas, and the loss and
   damages imposed upon the agricultural sector in the coastal zones. Both
   quantitative and qualitative tools were applied to measure agricultural
   productivity and vulnerability in the study locations. This paper is
   mainly based on the review of such recent studies on climate change and
   agriculture related issues in the coastal areas. It shows that cyclonic
   events (e.g. Cyclone Sidr 2007 and Cyclone Aila 2009) and the associated
   salinity intrusion have drastically affected the agricultural production
   (mainly rice and vegetables) in most of the coastal districts. According
   to a recent study, 86 \% households believe that the local rice
   production (aman) has decreased because of salinity intrusion in soil in
   the study villages.},

Title = {A Multifaceted Approach for Determining Sediment Provenance to Coastal
   Shipping Channels},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Maintenance dredging for shipping channels is required to maintain safe
   and efficient navigational channels and berths in ports around the
   world. Sediment that refills dredged channels can enter ports via
   alluvial transport of eroded materials from upstream and adjacent
   catchments, from marine transport due to tidal currents and wind driven
   currents and from longshore drift. Identifying the provenance of
   sediment infilling navigational channels allows port operators to
   mitigate and manage sediment transport, potentially reducing dredging
   requirements and costs. Further, understanding sediment sources can
   inform options for beneficial reuse or disposal of dredged sediments. A
   multi-faceted approach was used to assess whether sediment provenance in
   the Port of Gladstone could be characterized. A combination of particle
   size analysis, rare earth element composition, carbon stable isotope
   ratios, strontium isotopes, and beryllium-7 radioisotopes was employed.
   Samples were collected at accumulation locations within the navigational
   channel. Potential sediment sources were sampled from sites of longshore
   drift to the south of the Port of Gladstone, and intertidal sand and mud
   representative of transport from currents. Fluvial sediment samples were
   collected during dry and wet season conditions and from the three main
   local catchments. Potential source sediment samples yielded identifiable
   differences with respect to rare earth elements, while beryllium-7
   isotope analysis indicated recent deposition of sediments from mudflats
   or catchment within the channels. The approach used here provided
   insights into the source of recently deposited sediments to the dredged
   channels, enabling managers to make informed decisions on mitigation and
   management strategies.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {This article describes challenges met implementing an early intervention
   programme for Aboriginal parents and their children in the NT (Northern
   Territory) of Australia in the context of efforts to remediate
   Aboriginal disadvantage. The intervention is an adaptation of an 8- to
   10-week, manualised parenting programme designed for four-to
   six-year-old children with behavioural difficulties. It was implemented
   for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in urban Darwin and for
   Aboriginal children in three communities of the Tiwi Islands, near
   Darwin. Measured outcomes of the programme were positive overall with
   different outcomes by gender and Indigenous status. There were marked
   differences in retention of families from different socio-cultural
   backgrounds in the programme, with a significant loss of participants
   from referral through commencement to six-month follow-up. This drop-out
   was most marked for urban Aboriginal participants, despite highly
   flexible strategies of engagement and cultural adaptation of the
   approach pursued in each setting. The research provides lessons for the
   contextualisation of preventive interventions in diverse community
   settings and shows that systematic attention to cultural `fit' of the
   intervention logic and cultural competence in engagement of
   disadvantaged families with multiple problems are fundamental to
   sustainability. (C) 2011 The Author(s). Children \& Society (C) 2011

Title = {The Potential of Wave Energy Conversion to Mitigate Coastal Erosion from
   Hurricanes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wave energy conversion technologies have recently attracted more
   attention as part of global efforts to replace fossil fuels with
   renewable energy resources. While ocean waves can provide renewable
   energy, they can also be destructive to coastal areas that are often
   densely populated and vulnerable to coastal erosion. There have been a
   variety of efforts to mitigate the impacts of wave- and storm-induced
   erosion; however, they are either temporary solutions or approaches that
   are not able to adapt to a changing climate. This study explores a green
   and sustainable approach to mitigating coastal erosion from hurricanes
   through wave energy conversion. A barrier island, Dauphin Island, off
   the coast of Alabama, is used as a test case. The potential use of wave
   energy converter farms to mitigate erosion due to hurricane storm surges
   while simultaneously generating renewable energy is explored through
   simulations that are forced with storm data using the XBeach model. It
   is shown that wave farms can impact coastal morphodynamics and have the
   potential to reduce dune and beach erosion, predominantly in the western
   portion of the island. The capacity of wave farms to influence coastal
   morphodynamics varies with the storm intensity.},

   are effective in reaching management goals. The purpose of this research
   was to evaluate long-term CRM programs using community perceptions of
   coastal resource condition, management practices, and program outcomes.
   Coastal residents in Baybay City, Leyte were surveyed and asked to rank
   a series of questions related to resource condition and 20 previously
   described management performance indicators. Respondents reported a
   decline in coastal resource condition over the past decade, even though
   they perceive positive outcomes of management programs aimed at
   enhancing resource condition. The sustainability and efficiency of
   management outcomes were perceived positively, with mixed views on
   equity outcomes. Results suggest that lack of full inclusion, low
   management oversight, and threat to coastal resources are concerns of
   the coastal community. Socioeconomic data collected from respondents,
   yielded a pattern indicating that gender, self-reported level of
   environmental knowledge, and management cluster were significant
   contextual variables associated with perceptions of respondents.
   Overall, CRM programs are perceived to have a positive impact and there
   is a high level of interest for participating in future management
   activities. This study exemplifies how perceptions and associated
   contextual information of the community provides invaluable insights
   into the effectiveness of coastal resource management and be
   incorporated into the adaptive management cycle.},

Title = {Production-Living-Ecological Risk Assessment and Corresponding
   Strategies in China's Provinces under Climate Change Scenario},
Journal = {LAND},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the context of the increasing frequency of natural disasters caused
   by climate change in recent years, rational territorial spatial planning
   must pay attention to production-living-ecological (PLE) risks under
   climate change scenarios. In this study, a method synthesizing the
   Box-Cox transformation and area weighted averaging is established for
   characterizing the PLE risks in China's provinces, which are divided
   into three zones to cope with PLE risks. Further, targeted strategies
   from the perspective of the disaster-induced factors and
   disaster-affected objects are explored for the regions within the
   different zones. The results show that the regions with a high
   production risk are mainly distributed in Guangdong, Henan, and
   Shandong, with an index between 0.80 and 1.00; the regions with a high
   living risk are concentrated in Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, and Hainan,
   with an index exceeding 0.72; and the regions with a high ecological
   risk are concentrated in Guangxi, Ningxia, and Yunnan, with an index
   exceeding 0.50. The overall PLE risk is high along the southeastern
   coast, intermediate in central and western China, and low on the Tibetan
   Plateau. From the A to C zones, the number of risk types and intensity
   of risks requiring attention gradually decrease. For the category A
   zone, recommended measures include the construction of disaster risk
   monitoring and early warning systems for coastal cities and major
   grain-producing regions, the development of urban ecological protection
   zones, and the adjustment of economic and energy structures, etc.
   Production and living risks are central to the category B zone, while
   ecological and production risks are central to the category C zone. This
   study can provide theoretical support for China's scientific development
   of land planning and the realization of a beautiful China.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study explored the long-term trends and breakpoints of vegetation,
   rainfall, and temperature in Taiwan from overall and regional
   perspectives in terms of vertical differences from 1982 to 2012. With
   time-series Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and Taiwan Climate Change
   Estimate and Information Platform (TCCIP) gridded monthly climatic data,
   their vertical dynamics were investigated by employing the Breaks for
   Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, Pearson's correlation
   analysis, and the Durbin-Watson test. The vertical differences in NDVI
   values presented three breakpoints and a consistent trend from positive
   (1982 to 1989) to negative at varied rates, and then gradually increased
   after 2000. In addition, a positive rainfall trend was discovered.
   Average and maximum temperature had similar increasing trends, while
   minimum temperature showed variations, especially at higher altitudes.
   In terms of regional variations, the vegetation growth was stable in the
   north but worse in the central region. Higher elevations revealed larger
   variations in the NDVI and temperature datasets. NDVI, along with
   average and minimum temperature, showed their largest changes earlier in
   higher altitude areas. Specifically, the increasing minimum temperature
   direction was more prominent in the mid-to-high-altitude areas in the
   eastern and central regions. Seasonal variations were observed for each
   region. The difference between the dry and wet seasons is becoming
   larger, with the smallest difference in the northern region and the
   largest difference in the southern region. Taiwan's NDVI and climatic
   factors have a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05), but the
   maximum and minimum temperatures have significant positive effects at
   low altitudes below 500 m. The northern and central regions reveal
   similar responses, while the south and east display different feedbacks.
   The results illuminate climate change evidence from assessment of the
   long-term dynamics of vegetation and climatic factors, providing
   valuable references for establishing correspondent climate-adaptive
   strategies in Taiwan.},

Title = {Cool Pavements: State of the Art and New Technologies},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With growing urban populations, methods of reducing the urban heat
   island effect have become increasingly important. Cool pavements
   altering the heat storage of materials used in pavements can lead to
   lower surface temperatures and reduce the thermal radiation emitted to
   the atmosphere. Cool pavement technologies utilize various strategies to
   reduce the temperature of new and existing pavements, including
   increased albedo, evaporative cooling, and reduced heat conduction. This
   process of negative radiation forces helps offset the impacts of
   increasing atmospheric temperatures. This paper presents an extensive
   analysis of the state of the art of cool pavements. The properties and
   principles of cool pavements are reviewed, including reflectivity,
   thermal emittance, heat transfer, thermal capacity, and permeability.
   The different types, research directions, and applications of reflective
   pavements are outlined and discussed. Maintenance and restoration
   technologies of cool pavements are reviewed, including permeable
   pavements. Results show that cool pavements have significant temperature
   reduction potential in the urban environment. This research is important
   for policy actions of the European Union, noting that European and
   international business stakeholders have recently expressed their
   interest in new ways of reducing energy consumption through
   technologically advanced pavements.},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems can experience regime shifts, in which they shift from
   being organized around one set of mutually reinforcing structures and
   processes to another. Anthropogenic global change has broadly increased
   a wide variety of processes that can drive regime shifts. To assess the
   vulnerability of marine ecosystems to such shifts and their potential
   consequences, we reviewed the scientific literature for 13 types of
   marine regime shifts and used networks to conduct an analysis of
   co-occurrence of drivers and ecosystem service impacts. We found that
   regime shifts are caused by multiple drivers and have multiple
   consequences that co-occur in a non-random pattern. Drivers related to
   food production, climate change and coastal development are the most
   common co-occurring causes of regime shifts, while cultural services,
   biodiversity and primary production are the most common cluster of
   ecosystem services affected. These clusters prioritize sets of drivers
   for management and highlight the need for coordinated actions across
   multiple drivers and scales to reduce the risk of marine regime shifts.
   Managerial strategies are likely to fail if they only address
   well-understood or data-rich variables, and international cooperation
   and polycentric institutions will be critical to implement and
   coordinate action across the scales at which different drivers operate.
   By better understanding these underlying patterns, we hope to inform the
   development of managerial strategies to reduce the risk of high-impact
   marine regime shifts, especially for areas of the world where data are
   not available or monitoring programmes are not in place.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in economic
   losses caused by flood events on the coastal region of south-eastern
   Spain. The increase of extreme rainfall events forecast by the climate
   change models is currently not reflected in the statistics which
   suggests that the principal cause is due to the exposure experienced
   within the past 40 years. Consequently, it is interesting to evaluate
   the effect of urban growth in flood-prone areas and the role played by
   government institutions in mitigating the increase in exposure. For this
   study, the cadastral information and the hydrological modelling data for
   the return periods of 10, 50, 100 and 500 years were used. This allows
   high-resolution spatial-temporal results to be obtained that show one of
   the most significant growths in exposure in Spain and Europe, as well as
   the low efficiency that risk mitigation measures have had.},

Abstract = {The wildlife of the Galapagos Islands faces the threat of disease due to
   spillover from introduced domestic and peridomestic species. Many
   domestic species benefit the roughly 25,000 residents and 250,000
   visitors that travel to the islands every year. Although expanded human
   activities and the necessary agricultural and trade practices to support
   them are a potential concern for long-term sustainability of endemic
   species, the thriving economy behind this prime ecotourism destination
   is a possible asset and solution to protect it. Local agencies and
   strong, comprehensive management policies that are adaptable to rapidly
   changing conditions must be in place to guard against known and unknown
   disease threats.},

Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) for hydro-meteorological risks (HMRs)
   reduction and management are becoming increasingly popular, but
   challenges such as the lack of well-recognised standard methodologies to
   evaluate their performance and upscale their implementation remain. We
   systematically evaluate the current state-of-the art on the models and
   tools that are utilised for the optimum allocation, design and
   efficiency evaluation of NBS for five HMRs (flooding, droughts,
   heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion). We found
   that methods to assess the complex issue of NBS efficiency and
   cost-benefits analysis are still in the development stage and they have
   only been implemented through the methodologies developed for other
   purposes such as fluid dynamics models in micro and catchment scale
   contexts. Of the reviewed numerical models and tools MIKE-SHE, SWMM (for
   floods), ParFlow-TREES, ACRU, SIMGRO (for droughts), WRF, ENVI-met (for
   heatwaves), FUNWAVE-TVD, BROOK90 (for landslides), TELEMAC and ADCIRC
   (for storm surges) are more flexible to evaluate the performance and
   effectiveness of specific NBS such as wetlands, ponds, trees, parks,
   grass, green roof/ walls, tree roots, vegetations, coral reefs,
   mangroves, sea grasses, oyster reefs, sea salt marshes, sandy beaches
   and dunes. We conclude that the models and tools that are capable of
   assessing the multiple benefits, particularly the performance and
   cost-effectiveness of NBS for HMR reduction and management are not
   readily available. Thus, our synthesis of modelling methods can
   facilitate their selection that can maximise opportunities and refute
   the current political hesitation of NBS deployment compared with grey
   solutions for HMR management but also for the provision of a wide range
   of social and economic co-benefits. However, there is still a need for
   bespoke modelling tools that can holistically assess the various
   components of NBS from an HMR reduction and management perspective. Such
   tools can facilitate impact assessment modelling under different NBS
   scenarios to build a solid evidence base for upscaling and replicating
   the implementation of NBS.

Title = {The race for jellyfish: Winners and losers in Mexico's Gulf of
   California},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The trajectory of the cannonball jellyfish (Stomolophus sp. 2) fishery
   in the central portion of Mexico's Gulf of California is an all too
   familiar one, consisting of exploration, rapid development, and, as of
   now, subsequent collapse. As all of the product is exported to markets
   overseas, buyers have little incentive to conserve local stocks, with
   jellyfish now exhibiting a global-scale sequential exploitation
   experienced by many other marine resources. While historical data gaps
   are often used as excuses for overexploitation after the fact, the
   emergence of this modern fishery was accompanied by relatively broad
   research interest; however, recommendations based on sound science were
   not followed. The resultant paucity of policy goals, regulation,
   cooperation, compliance, and enforcement has resulted in the
   mismanagement of a potentially lucrative fishery for future generations.
   There are always myriad challenges when attempting to manage a nascent
   fishery with high uncertainty, particularly in a developing country, and
   this case further highlights the importance of taking a precautionary
   approach to emerging resource extraction. Multiple prior experiences
   with similar outcomes should behoove regulators and managers to exhibit
   extra caution, and yet, sustainability and forethought still appear to
   be secondary to short-term profits and employment support. Nonetheless,
   it is perhaps not too late for cannonball jellyfish fisheries in the
   Gulf of California, and there are opportunities to implement management
   strategies that promote collaboration, research, and sustainability.
   This fishery requires a new management regime that embraces adaptive
   co-management in order to provide benefits to locals, both now and in
   the future.},

Abstract = {The present paper provides a reflection on threats to integrated
   management of the Thau coastal lagoon due to climate change and the
   multi-scalar water scarcity adaptation strategy. This study proposes
   first to depict the Thau water governance assessed through a water use
   and social network analysis and its capacity to manage water quality.
   Next, this paper provides a downscaled study on the climate change
   impacts on the hydrological budget of the entire Thau catchment in
   2041-2070 compared with the 1971 2000 reference period, a methodology
   developed during the CLIMB EU research program. Following local climate
   change impacts, the importation of a new water resource to secure water
   uses is presented in regards to the capacity of local water governance
   to maintain coherence between integrated land planning and integrated
   water management planning based on water quality issues of the Thau
   coastal lagoon. The study underlines that although the water uses are
   currently secured thanks to the regional transfer of water, they are not
   coherent with local water management and create new vulnerabilities in
   the context of climate change. Moreover, the regional decision to end
   financial support for the more efficient, existing network for the water
   quality survey of regional coastal lagoons breaks up the local water
   governance. This paper demonstrates why keeping this network would have
   been absolutely necessary for encouraging a governance capable of
   proposing sustainable solutions to water quality challenges induced by
   climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exploring the decline of oyster beds in Atlantic Canada shorelines:
   potential effects of crab predation on American oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica)},
Journal = {HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Atlantic Canada's American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) beds, while
   economically and ecologically important, have been in decline over the
   past few decades. Predation by crabs, in particular by the European
   green crab (Carcinus maenas), has been proposed as one of the potential
   causes of such decline. Hence, this study examined oyster mortality
   levels in multiple beds across Prince Edward Island (PEI) and then
   experimentally assessed the contribution of green crab predation to
   oyster mortality. Results from surveys conducted in 10 estuaries across
   PEI in 2014 indicate that the probability of mortality for small oysters
   was significantly higher when green crabs were present then in areas
   without green crabs. This probability of mortality was significantly
   less when there was the presence of alternative prey like natural mussel
   beds (Mytilus edulis). The odds of oyster mortality were also higher
   when beds had rock crabs (Cancer irroratus) compared to beds with no
   rock crabs. Given the potential importance of green crab predation, its
   influence was assessed in 2015 using two field experiments with tethered
   oysters. Our results indicate that odds of small oyster mortality
   occurring were much higher in green crab inclusion cages than in the
   open environment and the exclusion cages. These results reaffirm that
   oysters up to similar to 40 mm SL are vulnerable to predation, and at
   least some of the mortality affecting these oysters can be causally
   attributed to green crab predation. Green crab predation rates upon
   small oysters are relevant given the economic benefits and ecosystem
   services provided by these bivalves. They highlight the need for the
   industry to consider mitigation measures and potentially adapt their
   oyster growing strategies.},

Title = {Stay or leave? Potential climate change adaptation strategies among
   Aboriginal people in coastal communities in northern Australia},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {591-609},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal northern Australia is largely owned and occupied by Aboriginal
   people who are strongly connected to their traditional country. We
   assess the views of Aboriginal people in Arnhem Land on the impacts of
   climate change and their possible precautionary responses to both sea
   level rise and a potential increase in the intensity of tropical
   cyclones in coastal communities. All respondents had heard about climate
   change, and 48 \% had already seen environmental changes, particularly
   sea level rise, which they attributed to climate change. Fifty-eight
   percent of respondents would consider relocating in the future for
   safety reasons, although most respondents perceived living close to the
   sea as highly important for their future well-being, emphasising their
   strong connection to their traditional sea country. Many of those
   willing to relocate would consider moving inland, either temporarily or
   permanently, provided that community facilities could also be moved.
   Other respondents who said they would be unlikely to relocate in the
   future because of climate change impacts, and would prefer to adapt in
   situ with government support (e.g. building more shelters for severe
   cyclones, building sea walls and better roads for quick evacuation if
   necessary). We recommend that the diversity of adaptation preferences
   among Aboriginal people should be accommodated in policy to minimise
   social impacts of climate change and to take advantage of potential
   opportunities that could arise from moving.},

Title = {Impact of harbour activities on local air quality: A review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {257},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Several harbour activities cause negative environmental impacts in the
   harbours' surrounding areas, namely the degradation of air quality. This
   paper intends to comprehensively review the status of the air quality
   measured in harbour areas. The published studies show a limited number
   of available air quality monitoring data in harbours areas, mostly
   located in Europe (71\%). Measured concentrations of the main air
   pollutants were compiled and intercompared, for different countries
   worldwide allowing a large spatial representativeness. The higher NO2
   and PM10 concentrations were found in Europe - ranging between 12 and
   107 mu g/m(3) and 2-50 mu g/m(3), respectively, while the higher
   concentrations of PM2.5 were found in Asia (25-70 mu g/m(3)). In
   addition, the lower levels of SO2 monitored in recent years suggest that
   current mitigation strategies adopted across Europe were very efficient
   in promoting the reduction of SO2 concentrations.
   Part of the reviewed studies also estimated the contributions from ship
   emissions to PM concentration through the application of source
   apportionment methods, with an average of 5-15\%. In some specific
   harbour areas in Asia, ships can contribute up to 7-26\% to the local
   fine particulate matter concentrations. This review confirms that
   emissions from the maritime transport sector should be considered as a
   significant source of particulate matter in harbour areas, since this
   pollutant concentrations are frequently exceeding the established
   standard legal limit values. Therefore, the results from this review
   boost the implementation of mitigation measures, aiming to reduce, in
   particular, particulate matter emissions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Coastal Stakeholders' Perceptions of Sea Level Rise Adaptation Planning
   in the Northern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {407-418},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Planning for sea level rise (SLR) is a complex process that involves
   scientific uncertainty and local and regional political tradeoffs. As
   part of a 6-year transdisciplinary research project in the northern Gulf
   of Mexico, we conducted focus groups with coastal stakeholders (natural
   resource managers, community planners, and environmental communicators)
   to gain a better understanding of their planning and adaptation
   activities for SLR. This paper reports on participants' perceptions
   about adaptation and their current adaptation activities and strategies.
   While stakeholders were concerned about SLR and thought adaptation had
   challenges, they still shared optimism and a commitment to planning. The
   findings identify different types of SLR adaptation initiatives in which
   participants were involved as well as types of perceived barriers to
   adaptation planning, and major recommended strategies to address them.
   The paper concludes with a discussion of findings, connections to
   related SLR adaptation literature, practical implications for coastal
   resiliency, and directions for future research.},

Title = {Making Space for Proactive Adaptation of Rapidly Changing Coasts: A
   Windows of Opportunity Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Coastlines are very often places where the impacts of global change are
   felt most keenly, and they are also often sites of high values and
   intense use for industry, human habitation, nature conservation and
   recreation. In many countries, coastlines are a key contested territory
   for planning for climate change, and also locations where development
   and conservation conflicts play out. As a ``test bed{''} for climate
   change adaptation, coastal regions provide valuable, but highly diverse
   experiences and lessons. This paper sets out to explore the lessons of
   coastal planning and development for the implementation of proactive
   adaptation, and the possibility to move from adaptation visions to
   actual adaptation governance and planning. Using qualitative analysis of
   interviews and workshops, we first examine what the barriers are to
   proactive adaptation at the coast, and how current policy and practice
   frames are leading to avoidable lock-ins and other maladaptive decisions
   that are narrowing our adaptation options. Using examples from UK, we
   then identify adaptation windows that can be opened, reframed or
   transformed to set the course for proactive adaptation which links high
   level top-down legislative requirements with local bottom-up actions. We
   explore how these windows can be harnessed so that space for proactive
   adaptation increases and maladaptive decisions are reduced.},

Title = {Developing locally managed marine areas: Lessons learnt from Kenya},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coastal communities in Kenya are increasingly adopting Locally Managed
   Marine Areas (LMMAs) and by 2015, 24 had been established. Coastal
   communities perceive the objectives of these LMMAs are to primarily
   conserve fisheries and marine resources and secure alternative sources
   of income. In this study we examined if there are generic approaches in
   how these LMMAs were established, that can be used for developing
   national guidelines as well as have application to other locations in
   the western Indian Ocean region. The study involved a literature review
   of all documents available on the LMMAs and key informant interviews.
   We found LMMAs in Kenya go through five phases to become fully
   established and operational: i) Conceptualisation, ii) Inception, iii)
   Implementation, iv) Monitoring and management; and v) Ongoing Adaptive
   Management. We defined each stage by the activities that are taking
   place which determine how far a LMMA has reached in its development. The
   final phase is when a LMMA exists sustainably in a continuous learning
   process. Out of 19 LMMAs assessed, four had reached the fifth Stage of
   `Ongoing Adaptive Management' though not all elements of this stage were
   fully operational.
   The Kenyan model differs from the widely known Pacific model of four
   phases due to an additional initial `Conceptualisation' phase. Our
   results illustrate the need for full acceptance of the LMMA concept by
   stakeholders before progressing to the `Inception phase.' When this step
   was missed many LMMAs stalled due to unaddressed training needs,
   incomplete involvement of stakeholders and lack of financial resources,
   management and operational structures. These five phases provide a
   useful guide for communities and other stakeholders to follow when
   developing LMMAs, or for those that are established and need guidance on
   their operations.
   Common factors that we found associated with the development of LMMAs
   were informed and committed community members, past training in
   community based marine resource management, a supportive legal
   framework, external funding and opportunities for sharing LMMA
   information. The occurrence of an exchange visit to an existing LMMA was
   invariably the trigger for a community to establish their own LMMA.
   Weaknesses were seen in poor enforcement on the water and inadequate
   ongoing education and training. Further there was very little
   understanding of the costs of establishing and running a LMMA, therefore
   long term financial sustainability was problematic. Thus, although the
   rapid increase in the number of LMMAs in Kenya is a conservation
   success, their effectiveness will be thwarted if enforcement and
   financial management are not addressed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {To examine whether U.S. public opinion may become as sharply polarized
   on adaptation responses as it has been on mitigation policies, we
   surveyed a sample of urban coastal residents in Maryland (n=378). We
   then tested the impact of a community deliberative event (n=40) with
   small-group sea level rise discussions as a depolarization strategy.
   Cultural worldviews which contribute to politically polarized beliefs
   about climate were predictive of perceptions of sea level rise risk.
   Living close to flooding hazards. also significantly predicted
   respondents' perceptions of household or neighborhood risks, but not of
   risks to the entire county. The event significantly increased topic
   knowledge among all participants and, among those with a worldview
   predisposing them to lower risk perceptions, significantly increased
   problem identification and concern about impacts. These results suggest
   small-group deliberation focused on local problem-solving may be an
   effective tool for reducing the polarizing effects of cultural
   worldviews on decision-making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Hydrological impacts of climate change are prompting water resource and
   flood hazard management to adapt to non-stationary conditions. Among the
   factors influencing these policy decisions is the question of timing:
   when are we likely to see climate change effects? Using a national
   climate-hydrology model cascade over the 21(st) century, times and
   extents of emergence of six hydrological metrics are evaluated across
   New Zealand rivers. While the stringency of the emergence criteria has a
   significant effect on timing and extent, emergence for all metrics
   generally occurs after mid-century, if at all, and in the country's
   South Island. Looking at the first emerging metrics, in contrast, allows
   us to sidestep the high uncertainties of the time of emergence,
   revealing mean winter flows to be the most extensive sentinel of climate
   change in New Zealand rivers among the metrics considered. This has
   implications for hydrological monitoring to inform timely climate change
   adaptation.},

Title = {The continuum of chronic to episodic natural hazards: Implications and
   strategies for community and landscape planning},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {189-197},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Natural hazards present challenges for community and rural planning. In
   this perspective essay hazards are categorized in the continuum from
   chronic to episodic to help guide the planning process. While episodic
   hazards garner most attention because of their immediate destructive
   nature, chronic hazards like sea-level rise and drought also have
   important implications for planning and can exacerbate episodic hazards
   like landfall typhoons, flooding, and wildfire. Both hazard types
   require long-term planning horizons, which have not been readily or
   optimally adopted. In the continuum between these two types, hazards
   differ with respect to maximum spatial extent of impacts, influences of
   anthropogenic effects, and risk of disaster. Issues warranting
   consideration that affect the vulnerability of communities and rural
   landscapes to natural hazards include demographic shifts and patterns,
   land use change, generational experience with hazards, adaptation
   measures, wealth, and community resilience. Of particular concern to
   planning in areas susceptible to disasters are cascading hazards, where
   one hazard (e.g., typhoon) triggers a series of other hazards (e.g.,
   landslides, debris flows, floods). We present a DAIR
   (Design-Analyze-Implement-Reassess) framework that could be used in
   early stages of planning to minimize the impacts of natural hazards.
   Examples of how multiple hazards have been and need to be incorporated
   into the planning process are presented for the Brisbane River catchment
   (Australia) and the Kagoshima Bay area (Japan)- regions with complex
   disaster histories that have been affected by past and recent
   anthropogenic pressures.},

Volume = {18},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The coastal Township of Kingscliff in northern NSW experienced severe
   erosion during 2010, resulting in the loss of 2 hectares of vegetated
   dune along a 200 metre length of foreshore. The catalyst for this
   erosion was a unique pattern of large waves from an easterly direction
   in early 2009 that resulted in the gradual lowering of the beach profile
   and led to severe erosion on spring tides in 2010. This erosion has
   coincided with the onset of a La Nina event and the beginning of a
   negative phase for the PDO. Analysis of past and current erosion events
   at Kingscliff shows a strong relationship between positive SOI, negative
   PDO, spring tides and severe erosion at Kingscliff. These indicators
   could act as simple indicators of the potential for extreme coastal
   erosion along the east coast of NSW allowing early implementation of
   mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Overwinter habitat selection by Antarctic krill under varying sea-ice
   conditions: implications for top predators and fishery management},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {568},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Climate change will affect Antarctic krill Euphausia superba,
   krill-dependent predators, and fisheries in the Southern Ocean as areas
   typically covered by sea ice become ice-free in some winters. Research
   cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic
   Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the
   first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association
   with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill
   fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all
   winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of
   magnitude higher (8 krill m(-2)) compared to summer (0.25 krill m(-2)),
   and this pattern was ob served in all winters regardless of ice cover.
   Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude
   higher (similar to 5 500 000 metric tons {[}t] in 2014) than a 15 yr
   summer average (520 000 t). Looking at krill-dependent predators, during
   winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in
   Brans-field Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals
   Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in
   coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and
   in an area that is becoming more frequently ice-free. While long-term
   projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and
   productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change
   include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions,
   alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in
   the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies
   to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent
   predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the
   impacts of long-term climate change.},

Title = {Effects of Decline in Fish Landings on the Livelihoods of Coastal
   Communities in Central Region of Ghana},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Fishing along Ghana's coast is the main livelihood for local
   communities, and it contributes significantly to their incomes. Most of
   them get employment, food security, and access to better health care
   through fishing activities. However, the fishing industry has been
   saddled with many challenges in recent times, which has led to low
   landings. This study aimed to assess the causes and effects of the
   decline in fish landings on the livelihood of coastal communities in the
   Central Region of Ghana. The systematic sampling technique was used to
   randomly select 200 households from four communities. A questionnaire
   was designed to elicit information from fisherfolk based on Likert scale
   estimation. In addition, time-series data of fish landings and imports
   for 51 years (1976-2017) was used in the analysis. The results from the
   study indicate that fish landings are declining, and this is affecting
   the income levels of fisherfolk. However, the impact of income decline
   on the female fisherfolk is lower as compared to their male
   counterparts. To mitigate against dwindling incomes, the fisherfolk have
   adopted livelihood diversification coping strategies. The key livelihood
   options identified in the communities are masonry, trading, and
   commercial driving. The fisherfolk mentioned overfishing, pollution, use
   of smaller mesh size nets, and unapproved methods of fishing as drivers
   of decline in fish landings. This study recommends that mandated
   institutions with oversight responsibilities in the fishing industry
   should be strengthened to enable them to conduct their functions
   effectively, so, they halt the decline in fish catch.},

Title = {Artisanal fishers in small island developing states and their perception
   of environmental change: the case study of Mauritius},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES},
Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) are highly dependent on coastal
   marine resources. Artisanal fishers in SIDS currently face multiple
   stressors related to global environmental change. Considering Mauritius
   (South Western Indian Ocean) as a case study, this paper characterizes
   artisanal fishers in SIDS and assesses their perception of global change
   using the Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) approach. A semi-structured
   survey method was used to interview 247 fishers from all around the
   country. Artisanal fishers used multiple fishing areas and gears, with
   half of the fishers using Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). Six main
   groups of fishers were identified according to their fishing strategies,
   which reflected different target species in their reported catches. The
   majority of fishers reported lower fish abundances and fewer species now
   compared to 10 to 15 years ago. All groups of fishers observed
   environmental change over the same period. Such ecological knowledge
   highlights the exposure of fishers to stressors induced by environmental
   change. The characterization of the groups of fishers and their fishing
   strategies will be useful to better evaluate adaptation strategies and
   support management measures to face global environmental change.},

   Mandatory Ship Reporting System (GOFREP) is a the complex
   socio-technical maritime transport safety management system that has
   been in efficient operation since 2004 and it is open to further
   improvement and development. However, environmental safety is not
   explicitly covered by the GOFREP so far. According to our working
   hypothesis, the Systems Theoretic Accident Models and Processes (STAMP)
   can be extended beyond the area of socio-technical system safety into
   realm of complex eco-socio-technical systems safety. This paper attempts
   to demonstrate the conceptual potential of STAMP based on adaptive
   management of the Maritime Spatial Planning processes and integrated
   safety management of eco-socio-technical maritime transport system. (C)

Abstract = {The Sundarbans, abutting the Bay of Bengal is home to about 7.2 million
   people; about 2.7 million in Bangladesh and the rest in India. Due to
   global warming the region is experiencing rise in sea surface
   temperature and sea level, increasing frequency of severe storms, and
   consequently, net land loss. What choices do communities and
   administrations have in the region? (i) Abandon and retreat, (ii)
   enhance resilience, or (iii) anticipate and facilitate transitions. This
   paper attempts to answer this question on the basis of a generic
   adaptation decision framework (GADF). The problem of climate
   vulnerability of the Indian Sundarbans is superimposed on the GADF to
   help administrations rationalize between choices. The threat of climate
   change-induced displacement in the ecoregion is real and the paper
   recommends a functional alliance between Bangladesh and India to
   bilaterally address environmental security issues, implying guarding
   against environmental degradation, and consequently, social disorder and
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Precise tracking and positioning of the towed vehicle is an important
   part of doing ocean bottom surveys. This is usually accomplished
   passively by slowly moving the ship from one position to another and
   assuming that, after the transients have died out, the towed vehicle
   will have moved the exact same distance and direction as the ship. The
   combination of delays and the slow rate at which the system returns to
   steady state makes this method slow and time consuming. To quantify
   this, we simulated a maneuver of a vehicle being moved to a location 400
   m away, holding position within 20 m of the new location for 10 minutes,
   and then returning to within 1 m of the original position. Using passive
   ship movement as described above, the maneuver took almost 160 minutes
   to accomplish. To improve performance, we examined two alternate
   strategies. One strategy involved the ship overshooting its estimated
   end point on the sea surface before settling back just as the vehicle
   was approaching its actual end point on the ocean floor. Without doing
   any optimization, we were able to use this ship-overshoot strategy to
   reduce the time of the maneuver to about 100 minutes. Finally, we
   simulated the action of a thruster on the vehicle that is used in
   conjunction with ship movement. This control strategy reduced the time
   of the maneuver to about 65 minutes, again with no optimization. These
   results indicate that active control through a combination of actuation
   at the top and bottom of a tow cable could greatly improve the
   performance of towed oceanographic survey systems.},

Abstract = {Context Coastal landscapes evolve in response to sea-level rise (SLR)
   through a variety of geologic processes and ecological feedbacks. When
   the SLR rate surpasses the rate at which these processes build elevation
   and drive lateral migration, inundation is likely. Objectives To examine
   the role of land cover diversity and composition in landscape response
   to SLR across the northeastern United States. Methods Using an existing
   probabilistic framework, we quantify the probability of inundation, a
   measure of vulnerability, under different SLR scenarios on the coastal
   landscape. Resistant areas-wherein a dynamic response is anticipated-are
   defined as unlikely (p < 0.33) to inundate. Results are assessed
   regionally for different land cover types and at 26 sites representing
   varying levels of land cover diversity. Results Modeling results suggest
   that by the 2050s, 44\% of low-lying, habitable land in the region is
   unlikely to inundate, further declining to 36\% by the 2080s. In
   addition to a decrease in SLR resistance with time, these results show
   an increasing uncertainty that the coastal landscape will continue to
   evolve in response to SLR as it has in the past. We also find that
   resistance to SLR is correlated with land cover composition, wherein
   sites containing land cover types adaptable to SLR impacts show greater
   potential to undergo biogeomorphic state shifts rather than inundating
   with time. Conclusions Our findings support other studies that have
   highlighted the importance of ecological composition and diversity in
   stabilizing the physical landscape and suggest that flexible planning
   strategies, such as adaptive management, are particularly well suited
   for SLR preparation in diverse coastal settings.},

Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},

Abstract = {Here, a methodology to obtain ensemble shoreline change projections at
   regional scale by combining multimodel projections of wave climate and
   water levels and the reduced-complexity shoreline evolution model in
   Alvarez-Cuesta et al. (2021) is presented. In order to account for
   climate change uncertainty, dynamically downscaled and bias corrected
   projected waves and storm surge series from five different combinations
   of global and regional climate models and three potential mean sea-level
   rise (SLR) trajectories for two representative concentration pathways,
   are used to force the erosion impact model IH-LANS . The methodology is
   applied to a 40 km highly anthropized coastal stretch in the
   Mediterranean coast of Spain. Thirty hourly time series of shoreline
   evolution between 2020 and 2100 are obtained, each of them linked to one
   future realization of waves and water levels. From the shoreline
   time-series analysis, long and short -term processes are unraveled,
   yielding permanent retreats and beach area losses, contribution of
   individual physical processes (longshore, short-term cross-shore, and
   SLR) to shoreline change and non-stationary extreme retreats. The
   methodology presented herein is intended to be a useful tool for
   evaluating potential climate change risks while enabling the evaluation
   and prioritization of adaptation measures.},

Abstract = {Climate change is among the most critical challenges facing local
   government decision-makers in the north. Yet while the risk is clear,
   with climate impacts occurring there more rapidly than many regions on
   Earth, integrated policy and planning for climate adaptation often
   remains a low priority for decision-makers. In an effort to extend the
   discussion and contribute to scholarship in this area, this paper
   explores climate change stressors and policy response in the coastal
   town Nome, Alaska. Through narratives of local government key actors and
   informed by strategic planning documents, this study sheds light on the
   decision dynamics around local climate change actions as well as
   preparedness for climate variability in general. In particular, this
   work highlights that thinning sea ice and thawing permafrost are both
   having an influence on life in Nome. Yet climate change adaptation
   remains a low priority for decision-makers, with the link to strategic
   policy often peripheral and not solutions orientated. As Nome is not
   unique in its need to adapt to climate change, findings from this work
   may provide communities experiencing similar climate stressors with
   awareness for the importance of incorporating adaptation thinking with
   long-term strategic policy and planning.},

Title = {Amplified Increases of Compound Hot Extremes Over Urban Land in China},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Consecutive hot periods without nighttime heat relief significantly
   increase mortality and morbidity rates. Using the Geophysical Fluid
   Dynamics Laboratory land model coupled with a newly developed and
   validated urban canopy model, changes in three types of summertime hot
   extremes, that is, independent hot days, independent hot nights, and
   compound hot events (CHEs), in the 21st century are quantified in China.
   Results indicate that all three types of hot extremes become more
   frequent, and CHEs arc projected to be the dominant type at the end of
   this century under the representative concentration pathway 8.5
   scenario. Furthermore, compared to the rural land, the urban land
   experiences even stronger increases in CHEs in terms of frequency,
   duration, and intensity. These faster increases of CHEs in urban areas
   highlight the urgency of developing and implementing mitigation and
   adaptation strategies to combat the adverse health effects of global
   warming and urban heat islands.
   Plain Language Summary As the urban population continues to rise, it is
   important to quantify the increase of hot extremes over urban areas,
   which have profound impacts on human health. According to climate
   simulations and meteorological observations, both urban and rural
   summertime hot extremes become more frequent, more intense, and longer
   lasting in China. As the climate warms, hot extremes transition from
   daytime-/nighttime-only events to compound events, and this transition
   is accelerated over urban land than rural land. As consecutive hot days
   without nighttime relief will significantly increase mortality and
   morbidity rates, increases in compound hot events over urban areas have
   extremely important implications for human health.},

Abstract = {Here, a methodology to obtain ensemble shoreline change projections at
   regional scale by combining multimodel projections of wave climate and
   water levels and the reduced-complexity shoreline evolution model in
   Alvarez-Cuesta et al. (2021) is presented. In order to account for
   climate change uncertainty, dynamically downscaled and bias corrected
   projected waves and storm surge series from five different combinations
   of global and regional climate models and three potential mean sea-level
   rise (SLR) trajectories for two representative concentration pathways,
   are used to force the erosion impact model IH-LANS . The methodology is
   applied to a 40 km highly anthropized coastal stretch in the
   Mediterranean coast of Spain. Thirty hourly time series of shoreline
   evolution between 2020 and 2100 are obtained, each of them linked to one
   future realization of waves and water levels. From the shoreline
   time-series analysis, long and short -term processes are unraveled,
   yielding permanent retreats and beach area losses, contribution of
   individual physical processes (longshore, short-term cross-shore, and
   SLR) to shoreline change and non-stationary extreme retreats. The
   methodology presented herein is intended to be a useful tool for
   evaluating potential climate change risks while enabling the evaluation
   and prioritization of adaptation measures.},

Title = {Assessment of coastal vulnerability to climate change hazards at the
   regional scale: the case study of the North Adriatic Sea},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2347-2368},
Abstract = {Sea level rise, changes in storms and wave climate as a consequence of
   global climate change are expected to increase the size and magnitude of
   flooded and eroding coastal areas, thus having profound impacts on
   coastal communities and ecosystems. River deltas, beaches, estuaries and
   lagoons are considered particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of
   climate change, which should be studied at the regional/local scale.
   This paper presents a regional vulnerability assessment (RVA)
   methodology developed to analyse site-specific spatial information on
   coastal vulnerability to the envisaged effects of global climate change,
   and assist coastal communities in operational coastal management and
   conservation. The main aim of the RVA is to identify key vulnerable
   receptors (i.e. natural and human ecosystems) in the considered region
   and localize vulnerable hot spot areas, which could be considered as
   homogeneous geographic sites for the definition of adaptation
   strategies. The application of the RVA methodology is based on a
   heterogeneous subset of bio-geophysical and socio-economic vulnerability
   indicators (e.g. coastal topography, geomorphology, presence and
   distribution of vegetation cover, location of artificial protection),
   which are a measure of the potential harm from a range of
   climate-related impacts (e.g. sea level rise inundation, storm surge
   flooding, coastal erosion). Based on a system of numerical weights and
   scores, the RVA provides relative vulnerability maps that allow to
   prioritize more vulnerable areas and targets of different
   climate-related impacts in the examined region and to support the
   identification of suitable areas for human settlements, infrastructures
   and economic activities, providing a basis for coastal zoning and land
   use planning. The implementation, performance and results of the
   methodology for the coastal area of the North Adriatic Sea (Italy) are
   fully described in the paper.},

Abstract = {Global climate change implies difficulties for coastal communities where
   activities are highly influenced by climate. This paper examines the
   case of seaweed harvesting in the community of Pisco-Peru. Aspects of
   environmental change that impact seaweed harvesting include global
   warming, ``El Nino{''} events, pollution of marine space, declines of
   marine species, and the rupture of ecological cycles.
   We look for relationships between local ecological knowledge (LEK)
   related to climate and other environmental change and strategies for
   coping with and adapting to current and anticipated change.
   This project is developed through a participative methodology, with the
   participation of university researchers and the community of seaweed
   extractors, and builds on an ongoing study of collaborative approaches
   to research and development of the algae industry in this region.
   Research questions include: the nature of the LEK held and shared; the
   extent to which LEK includes: the effects of climate changes on
   resources, harvesting and communities; and the contribution of LEK to
   industry resilience, harvester livelihoods and community well-being.
   The results of the research provide insight into LEK accumulation about
   algae species, management, and impacts of global environmental change.
   Documenting methods of collecting, analyzing and sharing harvester
   knowledge is an additional contribution.},

Title = {Ancient woodland indicators signal the climate change risk for
   dispersal-limited species},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {106-114},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The climate change risk to biodiversity operates alongside a range of
   anthropogenic pressures. These include habitat loss and fragmentation,
   which may prevent species from migrating between isolated habitat
   patches in order to track their suitable climate space. Predictive
   modelling has advanced in scope and complexity to integrate: (i)
   projected shifts in climate suitability, with (ii) spatial patterns of
   landscape habitat quality and rates of dispersal. This improved
   ecological realism is suited to data-rich model species, though its
   broader generalisation comes with accumulated uncertainties, e.g.
   incomplete knowledge of species response to variable habitat quality,
   parameterisation of dispersal kernels etc. This study adopts ancient
   woodland indicator species (lichen epiphytes) as a guild that couples
   relative simplicity with biological rigour. Subjectively-assigned
   indicator species were statistically tested against a binary habitat map
   of woodlands of known continuity (>250 yr), and bioclimatic models were
   used to demonstrate trends in their increased/decreased environmental
   suitability under conditions of `no dispersal'. Given the expectation of
   rapid climate change on ecological time-scales, no dispersal for ancient
   woodland indicators becomes a plausible assumption. The risk to ancient
   woodland indicators is spatially structured (greater in a relative
   continental compared to an oceanic climatic zone), though regional
   differences are weakened by significant variation (within regions) in
   woodland extent. As a corollary, ancient woodland indicators that are
   sensitive to projected climate change scenarios may be excellent targets
   for monitoring climate change impacts for biodiversity at a site-scale,
   including the outcome of strategic habitat management (climate change
   adaptation) designed to offset risk for dispersal-limited species. (C)

Abstract = {Based on the characteristics of freight train control, which are
   nonlinear, time-delay, with multi-constraint and multiobjective, this
   paper focuses on speed tracking problem. Firstly, in a gradual process,
   a multi-modal fuzzy PID (MM-FPID) control algorithm is presented on the
   basis of a brief analysis of PI and PID control, which is generally used
   to train control in active services. Secondly, in order to deal with the
   time-delay problem of freight train, the paper adopts an approach of
   traction force feed-forward, which greatly improves the dynamic
   performance of the controller. Thirdly, for the overspeed brake problem
   caused by speed overshoot, the strategy of adaptive traction force
   limitation is adopted, and we get satisfactory results without
   increasing the safety speed margin. Fourthly, inspired by the
   selflearning characteristic of neural networks (NNs), an integrated
   controller of MM-FPID and NNs is proposed. Finally, with the help of a
   computer simulation platform, the paper puts forward a set of
   simulations, comparing the MM-FPID and the integrated control method
   with classical PID and fuzzy control. The results show that both MM-FPID
   and the integrated controller has satisfactory control effect, and their
   multi-modal structure makes it easy to fit different applications well,
   while the integrated controller has more potential in self-learning.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification lowers the oceanic saturation states of carbonate
   minerals and decreases the calcification rates of some marine organisms
   that provide a range of ecosystem services such as wild fishery and
   aquaculture harvests, coastal protection, tourism, cultural identity,
   and ecosystem support. Damage to marine ecosystem services by ocean
   acidification is likely to disproportionately affect developing nations
   and coastal regions, which often rely more heavily on a variety of
   marine-related economic and cultural activities. Losses of calcifying
   organisms or changes in marine food webs could significantly alter
   global marine harvests, which provided 110 million metric tons of food
   for humans and were valued at US\$160 billion in 2006. Some of the
   countries most dependent on seafood for dietary protein include
   developing island nations with few agricultural alternatives.
   Aquaculture, especially of mollusks, may meet some of the future protein
   demand of economically developing, growing populations, but ocean
   acidification may complicate aquaculture of some species. By 2050, both
   population increases and changes in carbonate mineral saturation state
   will be greatest in low-latitude regions, multiplying the stresses on
   tropical marine ecosystems and societies. Identifying cost-effective
   adaptive strategies to mitigate the costs associated with ocean
   acidification requires development of transferable management strategies
   that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of regional human and
   marine communities.},

Title = {Exploring temporality in socio-ecological resilience through experiences
   of the 2015-16 El Nino across the Tropics},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In a context of both long-term climatic changes and short-term climatic
   shocks, temporal dynamics profoundly influence ecosystems and societies.
   In low income contexts in the Tropics, where both exposure and
   vulnerability to climatic fluctuations is high, the frequency, duration,
   and trends in these fluctuations are important determinants of
   socio-ecological resilience. In this paper, the dynamics of six diverse
   socio-ecological systems (SES) across the Tropics - ranging from
   agricultural and horticultural systems in Africa and Oceania to managed
   forests in South East Asia and coastal systems in South America - are
   examined in relation to the 2015-16 El Nino, and the longer context of
   climatic variability in which this short-term `event' occurred. In each
   case, details of the socio-ecological characteristics of the systems and
   the climate phenomena experienced during the El Nino event are described
   and reflections on the observed impacts of, and responses to it are
   presented. Drawing on these cases, we argue that SES resilience (or lack
   of) is, in part, a product of both long-term historical trends, as well
   as short-term shocks within this history. Political and economic
   lock-ins and dependencies, and the memory and social learning that
   originates from past experience, all contribute to contemporary system
   resilience. We propose that the experiences of climate shocks can
   provide a window of insight into future ecosystem responses and, when
   combined with historical perspectives and learning from multiple
   contexts and cases, can be an important foundation for efforts to build
   appropriate long-term resilience strategies to mediate impacts of
   changing and uncertain climates.},

Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NbS)-solutions to societal challenges that
   involve working with nature-have recently gained popularity as an
   integrated approach that can address climate change and biodiversity
   loss, while supporting sustainable development. Although well-designed
   NbS can deliver multiple benefits for people and nature, much of the
   recent limelight has been on tree planting for carbon sequestration.
   There are serious concerns that this is distracting from the need to
   rapidly phase out use of fossil fuels and protect existing intact
   ecosystems. There are also concerns that the expansion of forestry
   framed as a climate change mitigation solution is coming at the cost of
   carbon rich and biodiverse native ecosystems and local resource rights.
   Here, we discuss the promise and pitfalls of the NbS framing and its
   current political traction, and we present recommendations on how to get
   the message right. We urge policymakers, practitioners and researchers
   to consider the synergies and trade-offs associated with NbS and to
   follow four guiding principles to enable NbS to provide sustainable
   benefits to society: (1) NbS are not a substitute for the rapid phase
   out of fossil fuels; (2) NbS involve a wide range of ecosystems on land
   and in the sea, not just forests; (3) NbS are implemented with the full
   engagement and consent of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in a
   way that respects their cultural and ecological rights; and (4) NbS
   should be explicitly designed to provide measurable benefits for
   biodiversity. Only by following these guidelines will we design robust
   and resilient NbS that address the urgent challenges of climate change
   and biodiversity loss, sustaining nature and people together, now and
   into the future.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {276-290},
Abstract = {This article addresses the fundamental importance of observing the
   climate for development purposes. It first considers the establishment
   of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) in 1992 and its important
   linkage with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It
   also introduces the types of observations that are needed for climate
   purposes, with a focus on the so-called Essential Climate Variables. It
   then discusses the requirements for good quality observations for
   climate risk management, adaptation and sustainable development, noting
   specific examples of the uses of climate observations in agriculture,
   health, water resources management, disaster preparedness, tourism,
   urban development, coastal zone management and energy planning. The
   article concludes by suggesting measures that both developing and
   developed countries can take to improve climate observations in
   developing countries. For developing countries, these include improving
   national and regional coordination on climate observing issues, rescuing
   historical data, exchanging data regionally and internationally for
   mutual benefit, and routinely addressing climate variability and climate
   change in national development planning. Developed countries need to
   implement actions agreed by the UNFCCC and to follow up on commitments
   made in such fora as the G8 Summit Meetings, which include providing
   developing countries with infrastructure for observation systems and
   support for capacity building.},

   emphasis has placed on environmental and societal aspects, hence the
   questionable sustainability. This study, therefore, contributes a
   composite literature review, targeting two SI-related aspects: (i) key
   factors driving the intensification of SI in recent years across the
   Mekong Delta, and (ii) current understanding of the sustainability of
   PRRC. Results from the first review assignment highlight the four key
   SI-driving factors: riverbed incision, land subsidence, upstream dams,
   and sealevel rise. Also remarked are the critical absence of studies
   addressing multiple drivers and the need for a decoupling model to
   quantify the relative importance of each factor to strategize the
   adaptive measures. For PRRC, we reveal that while economic benefits have
   been widely reported, potential negative impacts of this model related
   to environmental and social aspects are lacking. Therefore, while the
   lucrative prawn trade might financially benefit the farmers', the
   economic benefit is marred by the underlying negative environmental
   impacts and social inequalities, limiting overall sustainability. This
   study also provides a case study to notify the spatial-temporal trends
   of PRRC in the last three decades and evaluate the associated
   geographical and social factors. Kien Giang province was selected as the
   study site since it is the largest PRRCacross the VMD. The lessons from
   Kien Giang can also be applied to other transformative agricultural
   models in both Mekong Delta and other deltas worldwide. (c) 2021

Abstract = {Taking the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) climate and
   socio-economic,scenarios (A1FI, A2, B1 and B2 `future worlds'), the
   potential impacts of sea-level rise through the twenty-first century are
   explored using complementary impact and economic analysis methods at the
   global scale. These methods have never been explored together
   previously. In all scenarios, the exposure and hence the impact
   potential due to increased flooding)by sea-level rise increases
   significantly compared to the base year (1990). While mitigation reduces
   impacts, due to the lagged response of sea-level rise to atmospheric
   temperature rise, impacts cannot be avoided during the twenty-first
   century by this response alone. Cost-benefit analyses suggest that
   widespread protection will be an economically rational response to land
   loss due to sea-level rise in the four SRES futures that are considered.
   The most vulnerable future worlds to sea-level rise appear to be the A2
   and B2 scenarios, which primarily reflects differences in the
   socio-economic situation (coastal population, Gross Domestic Product
   (GDP) and GDP/capita), rather than the magnitude of sea-level rise.
   Small islands and deltaic settings stand out as being more vulnerable as
   shown in many earlier analyses. Collectively, these results suggest that
   human societies will have more choice in how they respond to sea-level
   rise than is often assumed. However, this conclusion needs to be
   tempered by recognition that we still do not understand these choices
   and significant impacts remain possible. Future worlds which experience
   larger rises in sea-level than considered here (above 35 cm), more
   extreme events, a reactive rather than proactive approach to adaptation,
   and where GDP growth is slower or more unequal than in the SRES futures
   remain a concern. There is considerable scope for further research to
   better understand these diverse issues.},

Abstract = {Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have been impacted by and
   responded to COVID-19 in ways that give us clues about vulnerabilities
   under climate change, as well as pathways to resilience. Here, we
   reflect on some of these experiences drawing on case study examples from
   the Caribbean, Pacific, and Indian Ocean SIDS, exploring how SIDS have
   responded to COVID-19 and considering the potential for coping
   mechanisms enacted for the pandemic to support long-term resilience to
   climate change. Island responses to the pandemic highlight both new
   directions, like tourist schemes that capitalize on the rise of remote
   working in Barbados and Mauritius, and reliance on tried and tested
   coping mechanisms, like bartering in Fiji. Some of the actions
   undertaken to respond to the pressures of the pandemic, such as visa
   schemes promoting ``digital nomadism{''} and efforts to grow domestic
   food production, have climate resilience and equity dimensions that must
   be unpacked if their potential to contribute to more sustainable island
   futures is to be realized. Importantly, the diversity of contexts and
   experiences described here illustrates that there is no single
   ``best{''} pathway to climate-resilient post-pandemic futures for SIDS.
   While the emerging rhetoric of COVID-19 recovery often speaks of
   ``roadmaps,{''} we argue that the journey towards a climate-resilient
   COVID-19 recovery for SIDS is likely to involve detours, as solutions
   emerge through innovation and experiment, and knowledge-sharing across
   the wider SIDS community. This article is categorized under: Climate and

Abstract = {The phenomenon of global climate change is directly affecting the
   livestock production system world overall. Therefore, understanding the
   changing climatic scenario by the millions of resource poor livestock
   rearers across the east coast of India found to be imperative to get
   information for strategic planning to improve the livelihoods of rural
   people. But, systematic methodology to assess climatic change awareness
   among the livestock rearers is currently not available. Therefore, a
   psychometric scale entitled ``Climate Change Awareness Scale{''} was
   developed and applied among the randomly selected 480 livestock rearers
   of eastern coastal region of India. Results reflected majority of the
   population exhibit their strong level of awareness towards changing
   climatic scenario in general and particularly towards broad spectrum of
   climate change like causes, features, effects and impacts. It was also
   found that 37.188\% of livestock rearers of coastal region were having
   higher level of awareness followed by 31.973\% and 30.839\% were having
   lower and medium level of awareness. Comparisons of state of awareness
   with the factual climatic data validated farmers' claim and established
   the authenticity of the psychometric tool. Hence, this study will
   provide a significant tool for researchers and policy makers to assess
   state of climate change awareness among the end users and to develop
   appropriate adaptation strategies to minimize the risk of livestock
   sector to climate change.},

   Building Resilience to Tropical Cyclones},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is one of the most
   vulnerable regions in the world to the impacts of climate change. The
   region has prioritized adaptation to climate change and has implemented
   many adaptation actions over the past 20 years. However, the region is
   becoming increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of tropical cyclones
   (TC). This paper analyses the impacts of TC on the region between 1980
   to 2019. It aims to examine the economic loss and damage sustained by
   the region, identify the sectors most impacted, and ascertain the
   perspectives of key stakeholders on the factors that hinder building
   resilience. Statistical analysis techniques and semi-structured
   interviews were to unpack and understand the dataset. The paper finds
   that economic loss and damage has gradually increasing between 1980 to
   2009 with a drastic increase between 2010 to 2019. The paper highlights
   the agriculture, housing, transport, and utility sectors as the most
   impacted. The findings also call to attention the need for increased
   access to adaptation financing for SIDS, the disadvantages of the income
   status that hinders building resilience, and the need for increased
   Early Warning Systems. The paper recommends revising the per capita
   national income as an eligibility criterion for accessing concessional
   development finance assistance, a comprehensive EWS for the countries in
   the region, and consideration of debt relief for countries affected by
   TC.},

Abstract = {Advances in social and natural sciences provide hope for new approaches
   to restore the bounty and resilience of ocean ecosystems. From new
   interdisciplinary approaches and conceptual frameworks, to new tools
   such as catch shares, ecosystem-based management, marine spatial

   The confluence of local, regional, and global changes in the ocean
   driven by stressors, including nutrient pollution, habitat loss,
   overfishing, and climate change and ocean acidification is rapidly
   transforming many once bountiful and resilient ocean ecosystems into
   depleted or disrupted systems. Degraded ecosystems cannot provide key
   ecosystem services, such as production of seafood, protection of
   coastlines from severe storms and tsunamis, capture of carbon, and
   provision of places for recreation. The accelerating pace of change
   presents daunting challenges for communities, businesses, nations, and
   the global community to make a transition toward more sustainable
   practices and policies. In this paper, we highlight new
   interdisciplinary approaches, tools, and insights that offer hope for

Title = {READY OR NOT? Hurricane preparedness, response, and recovery of farms,
   forests, and rural communities in the US Caribbean},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Farmers, forest owners, and rural communities are among the groups most
   exposed to the effects and associated impacts of hurricanes and other
   extreme climate events in the Caribbean. Yet, lit-tle is known about
   their preparedness for or their capacity to respond to and recover from
   these disturbances. We conducted qualitative research involving focus
   group discussions and in-depth interviews with 152 farmers, forest
   owners, and agriculture and forest experts in Puerto Rico and the U.S
   Virgin Islands to understand the effects and associated impacts of
   hurricanes Irma and Maria at farm, forest, community, and sectoral
   levels and the internal and external factors that help to explain their
   capacities to anticipate, absorb, and adapt to hurricanes and other
   extreme climate events. Participants reported widespread crop and
   livestock losses; extensive damages to roads, facilities, and other
   private and public infrastructure; lengthy outages in electricity,
   telecommunications, and water supplies; and harmful impacts on human
   health and well-being that significantly affected their productive
   capacities and livelihoods. Most farmers and forest owners reported
   coping with the immediate effects and associated impacts of the
   hurricanes largely on their own, some also reported the emergence of
   informal or extemporized relief and re-covery support, mostly from
   family members, neighbors, and others in their local community.
   Of-ficial relief and recovery resources for the agriculture and forest
   sectors were described by many as having been too rigid or onerous to
   access or navigate successfully, ultimately limiting their
   ef-fectiveness in supporting farm and forest relief and recovery. Few
   participants or sectors reported having adequate hurricane preparations,
   mitigation, or adaptation practices in place prior to the storms. Low
   levels of risk reduction and adaptation mostly were associated with
   limited human, financial, and technological resources to design and
   implement related strategies and practices at individual and community
   levels. Many participants expressed a desire to incorporate more or
   specific hurricane and other disturbance plans and preparations into
   their production systems. Some participants also described plans to
   adapt, innovate, or transform their farm and forest sys-tems, but few
   had implemented these types of changes at the time of data collection.
   Findings point to the need for improved understanding, adoption, and
   support of effective hurricane miti-gation and adaptation measures in
   agriculture, forests, and rural communities; increased flexibil-ity and
   adaptiveness of official response and recovery programs and processes to
   accommodate local contexts, capacities, and conditions; and practical
   planning, preparations, and other risk re-duction measures for famers
   and forest owners at individual, community, organizational, and larger
   scales. Study results are important to the design and implementation of
   ongoing recovery efforts as well as broader conservation efforts within
   and across agriculture, forest, and rural communities in the U.S.

Abstract = {Tidal marsh loss to anthropogenic environmental impacts and climate
   change, particularly sea level rise, has and will continue to cause
   declines in tidal marsh bird populations. Distribution patterns of tidal
   marsh birds are generally known, yet we lack detailed knowledge of local
   abundance and regional population sizes, which limits our ability to
   develop effective conservation strategies that will mitigate the impacts
   of marsh loss. We designed and implemented a probabilistic sampling
   framework to establish a regional marsh bird monitoring program, and
   collected baseline information for breeding tidal marsh birds in the
   northeastern USA (Maine to Virginia). We sampled 1,780 locations in
   2011-2012 to provide regional population estimates for 5 tidal
   marsh-specialist birds. We estimated that there were 151,000 Clapper
   Rails (Rallus crepitans; 95\% CI = 90,000-212,000), 117,000 Willets
   (Tringa semipalmata; 95\% CI = 88,000-146,000), 5,000 Nelson's Sparrows
   (Ammodramus nelsoni; 95\% CI = 1,000-9,000), 53,000 Saltmarsh Sparrows
   (A. caudacutus; 95\% CI = 37,000-69,000), and 230,000 Seaside Sparrows
   (A. maritimus; 95\% CI = 174,000-286,000) in northeastern tidal marshes.
   Our baseline assessment can be used to identify local habitat patches
   important to regional populations for each species and to prioritize
   conservation actions in targeted areas to maximize tidal marsh bird
   persistence. The flexibility and probabilistic design of our sampling
   framework also allow for integration with other monitoring programs
   (e.g., the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Salt Marsh Integrity Program
   and National Park Service Vital Signs Monitoring Program) so that
   inferences for these species can be made at multiple spatial scales.},

Title = {Applications of network analysis for adaptive management of artificial
   drainage systems in landscapes vulnerable to sea level rise},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {357},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {207-217},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The vulnerability of coastal landscapes to sea level rise is compounded
   by the existence of extensive artificial drainage networks initially
   built to lower water tables for agriculture, forestry, and human
   settlements. These drainage networks are found in landscapes with little
   topographic relief where channel flow is characterized by bi-directional
   movement across multiple time-scales and related to precipitation, wind,
   and tidal patterns. The current configuration of many artificial
   drainage networks exacerbates impacts associated with sea Level rise
   such as salt-intrusion and increased flooding. This suggests that in the
   short-term, drainage networks might be managed to mitigate sea level
   rise related impacts. The challenge, however, is that hydrologic
   processes in regions where channel flow direction is weakly related to
   slope and topography require extensive parameterization for numerical
   models which is Limited where network size is on the order of a hundred
   or more kilometers in total length. Here we present an application of
   graph theoretic algorithms to efficiently investigate network properties
   relevant to the management of a large artificial drainage system in
   coastal North Carolina, USA. We created a digital network model
   representing the observation network topology and four types of drainage
   features (canal, collector and field ditches, and streams). We applied
   between-ness-centrality concepts (using Dijkstra's shortest path
   algorithm) to determine major hydrologic flowpaths based off of
   hydraulic resistance. Following this, we identified sub-networks that
   could be managed independently using a community structure and
   modularity approach. Lastly, a betweenness-centrality algorithm was
   applied to identify major shoreline entry points to the network that
   disproportionately control water movement in and out of the network. We
   demonstrate that graph theory can be applied to solving management and
   monitoring problems associated with sea level rise for poorly understood
   drainage networks in advance of numerical methods. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Title = {Stakeholder-defined scientific needs for coastal resilience decisions in
   the Northeast US},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, coastal communities and ecosystems in the
   Northeast United States have begun to face acute and chronic impacts of
   climate change. Extreme events such as Superstorm Sandy caused
   stakeholders in this region to examine what information is needed to
   implement adaptation and mitigation plans to prepare for the next major
   storm. The objective of this study was to determine research needs
   identified by stakeholders in the Northeast needed for decision-support
   and policy creation so that scientists can target future research
   efforts to fill gaps. Modeled after document analysis methods in Dilling
   et al. (2014), this study examines documents sourced from local and
   regional organizations in both the public and private sectors to
   determine gaps in information necessary for climate resilience planning.
   Stakeholders throughout the Northeast expressed a need for
   solution-based research, in particular natural and nature-based
   solutions such as wetlands. Additionally, there was a need to better
   understand the economic impacts of climate change on key industries in
   the region as well as cost-benefit analyses of different adaptation
   options. It was also determined that government organizations, such as
   Sea Grant, play a crucial role in supporting stakeholder needs
   assessments both in terms of funding and providing necessary expertise.
   This study provides a baseline of stakeholder-expressed research needs
   in the Northeast to start the conversation between communities and
   researchers interested in conducting useable science.},

Title = {Can Forest-Related Adaptive Capacity Reduce Landslide Risk Attributable
   to Climate Change?-Case of Republic of Korea},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent cases of climate disasters such as the European floods in 2021
   and Korea's longest rainy season in 2020 strongly imply the importance
   of adaptation to climate change. In this study, we performed a numerical
   prediction on how much climate change adaptation factors related to
   forest policy can reduce climate disasters such as landslides. We
   focused on the landslide in Korea and applied a machine learning model
   reflecting adaptive indicators in the representative concentration
   pathway 8.5 climate scenario. The changes in the landslide probability
   were estimated using the Random Forest model, which estimated the
   landslide probability in the baseline period (2011) with excellent
   performance, and the spatial adaptation indicators used in this study
   contributed approximately 20\%. The future landslide risk predicting
   indicated a significant increase in the Very High and High risk areas,
   especially in 2092. The application of the forest-related adaptation
   indices based on the policy scenario showed that in 2050, the effect was
   not pronounced, but in 2092, when the risk of landslides was much
   higher, the effect increased significantly. In particular, the effect
   was remarkable in the Seoul metropolitan and southern coastal regions.
   Even with the same adaptive capacity, it exerted a larger effect on the
   enhanced disasters. Our results suggest that the enhancement of adaptive
   capacity can reduce landslide risk up to 70\% in a Very High risk
   region. In conclusion, it implies an importance to respond to the
   intensifying climate disasters, and abundant follow-up studies are
   expected to appear in the future.},

Abstract = {Taiwan, located in the Western Pacific, is a country that is one of the
   most vulnerable to disasters that are associated with the changing
   climate; it is located within the Ring of Fire, which is the most
   geologically active region in the world. The environmental and
   geological conditions in Taiwan are sensitive and vulnerable to such
   disasters. Owing to increasing urbanization in Taiwan, floods and
   climate-related disasters have taken an increasing toll on human lives.
   As global warming accelerates the rising of sea levels and increasing of
   the frequency of extreme weather events, disasters will continue to
   affect socioeconomic development and human conditions. Under such
   circumstances, researchers and policymakers alike must recognize the
   importance of providing useful knowledge concerning vulnerability,
   disaster recovery and resilience. Strategies for reducing vulnerability
   and climate-related disaster risks and for increasing resilience involve
   preparedness, mitigation and adaptation. In the last two decades,
   extreme climate events have caused severe flash floods, debris flows,
   landslides, and other disasters and have had negative effects of many
   sectors, including agriculture, infrastructure and health. Since climate
   change is expected to have a continued impact on socio-economic
   development, this work develops a vulnerability assessment framework
   that integrates both biophysical and social vulnerability and supports
   synthesized vulnerability analyses to identify vulnerable areas in
   Taiwan. Owing to its geographical, geological and climatic features,
   Taiwan is susceptible to earthquakes, typhoons, droughts and various
   induced disasters. Therefore, Taiwan has the urgent task of establishing
   a framework for assessing vulnerability as a planning and policy tool
   that can be used to identify not only the regions that require special
   attention but also hotspots in which efforts should be made to reduce
   vulnerability and the risk of climate-related disaster. To analyze the
   biophysical vulnerability of Taiwan, hazards on eight maps from Taiwan's
   National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) are
   analyzed. Statistical data from the NCDR on social vulnerability are
   also adopted. Finally, a GIS overlaying method was used to perform the
   synthesized vulnerability analysis of biophysical and social
   vulnerability for municipalities and counties in Taiwan.},

Title = {Residents' understanding of the role of green infrastructure for climate

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {138},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {132-143},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Hangzhou is a rapidly growing Chinese coastal metropolis that is facing
   climate change impacts, including intense heat waves, flooding and
   increased severity of storms (e.g. typhoons and thunderstorms). This
   paper examines whether green infrastructure (GI), specifically increased
   tree planting, could help Hangzhou City adapt to some of these impacts.
   The paper reports the results of a survey of Hangzhou green-space users
   and their disposition toward tree planting in public and communal
   green-spaces as a climate change adaptive response. Results show that
   surveyed green-space users tended to favor tree planting as an adaptive
   strategy if they were older, believed that individual actions could
   reduce climate change impacts, and believed that future climate change
   impacts would be economically disruptive. Few respondents reported tree
   costs (disservices). While the perceived benefits of urban trees were
   unrelated to support for urban greening, results suggest that under some
   conditions, residents may be willing to support increased tree cover
   within urban public and communal open spaces. Findings suggest land use
   planners and environmental managers in China would do well to cultivate
   support for green infrastructure interventions among older green-space
   users and residents who perceive personal costs associated with climate
   change. Additional research across a range of Chinese cities, and
   internationally, could further assist in evaluating the efficacy of
   green infrastructure for climate change adaptation from a green-space
   user perspective. Particular attention will need to be given to the
   potential costs of large-scale tree planting (e.g. health impacts) and
   to the utility of GI for macro-scale climate change response. (C) 2015

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {12},

Month = {DEC 13},
Abstract = {As a consequence of climate change and land subsidence, coastal zones
   are directly impacted by sea-level rise. In some particular areas, the
   effects on the ecosystem and urbanisation are particularly enhanced. We
   focus on the Emilia-Romagna (E-R) coastal plain in Northern Italy,
   bounded by the Po river mouth to the north and by the Apennines to the
   south. The plain is similar to 130 km long and is characterised by wide
   areas below mean sea level, in part made up of reclaimed wetlands. In
   this context, several morphodynamic factors make the shore and back
   shore unstable. During next decades, the combined effects of land
   subsidence and of the sea-level rise as a result of climate change are
   expected to enhance the shoreline instability, leading to further
   retreat. The consequent loss of beaches would impact the economy of the
   region, which is tightly connected with tourism infrastructures.
   Furthermore, the loss of wetlands and dunes would threaten the
   ecosystem, which is crucial for the preservation of life and the
   environment. These specific conditions show the importance of a precise
   definition of the possible local impacts of the ongoing and future
   climate variations. The aim of this work is the characterisation of
   vulnerability in different sectors of the coastal plain and the
   recognition of the areas in which human intervention is urgently
   required. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth
   Assessment Report (AR5) sea-level scenarios are merged with new
   high-resolution terrain models, current data for local subsidence and
   predictions of the flooding model ``in\_CoastFlood{''} in order to
   develop different scenarios for the impact of sea-level rise projected
   to year 2100. First, the potential land loss due to the combined effect
   of subsidence and sea-level rise is extrapolated. Second, the increase
   in floodable areas as a result of storm surges is quantitatively
   determined. The results are expected to support the regional mitigation
   and adaptation strategies designed in response to climate change.},

Title = {A conceptual framework for cross-border impacts of climate change},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability studies tend to
   confine their attention to impacts and responses within the same
   geographical region. However, this approach ignores cross-border climate
   change impacts that occur remotely from the location of their initial
   impact and that may severely disrupt societies and livelihoods. We
   propose a conceptual framework and accompanying nomenclature for
   describing and analysing such cross-border impacts. The conceptual
   framework distinguishes an initial impact that is caused by a climate
   trigger within a specific region. Downstream consequences of that impact
   propagate through an impact transmission system while adaptation
   responses to deal with the impact propagate through a response
   transmission system. A key to understanding cross-border impacts and
   responses is a recognition of different types of climate triggers,
   categories of cross-border impacts, the scales and dynamics of impact
   transmission, the targets and dynamics of responses and the
   socio-economic and environmental context that also encompasses factors
   and processes unrelated to climate change. These insights can then
   provide a basis for identifying relevant causal relationships. We apply
   the framework to the floods that affected industrial production in
   Thailand in 2011, and to projected Arctic sea ice decline, and
   demonstrate that the framework can usefully capture the complex system
   dynamics of cross-border climate impacts. It also provides a useful
   mechanism to identify and understand adaptation strategies and their
   potential consequences in the wider context of resilience planning. The
   cross border dimensions of climate impacts could become increasingly
   important as climate changes intensify. We conclude that our framework
   will allow for these to be properly accounted for, help to identify new
   areas of empirical and model-based research and thereby support climate
   risk management.},

Title = {Shifting responsibility and denying justice: New Zealand's contentious
   approach to Pacific climate mobilities},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {It is increasingly evident that climate change is intersecting in
   complex ways with the more traditional drivers of migration, such as
   poverty and conflict. Yet there remains a startling lack of
   international agreement on how to address the issue. This article
   examines the problem climate change-related migration poses in terms of
   international responsibility and provides a review of two approaches to
   addressing this challenge. First, the idea that migration in the context
   of climate change requires the development of a new international
   protection agreement and, second, the argument that migration should be
   managed and mitigated through in situ adaptation and development
   programmes These approaches differ in terms of how they understand the
   relationship between migration and climate change and thus differ also
   in terms of how they situate responsibility and address issues of
   climate justice. This paper explores these differences and outlines the
   benefits and challenges of both. Following this, we turn to the case of
   New Zealand's immigration tribunal appeals involving claims for
   climate-refugee status and look at how in situ adaptation, development
   narratives and arbitrary risk thresholds have been used to legitimise
   the denial of these claims. Throughout the article, we ask to what
   extent these approaches acknowledge climate justice, and we conclude by
   looking at ways that climate (mobility) justice might be better
   incorporated into solutions that prioritise the needs of migrants in the
   context of rapid climate change.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {149-160},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Loading of nitrogen (N) from diffuse sources to Danish marine waters was
   reduced by 41\% in the period 1990-2012 by a suite of general measures.
   However, further reductions in N loading are required if the ambitious
   quality goals of the EU Water Framework Directive are to be achieved.
   Measures will be more effective if they are implemented in N loss hot
   spots or risk areas. Additionally, the highly variable N reduction in
   groundwater and surface waters needs to be taken into account as this
   strongly influences the resulting effect of mitigation measures. The
   objectives of this study were to develop and apply an N risk tool to the
   entire agricultural land area in Denmark. The purpose of the tool is to
   identify high risk areas, i.e. areas which contribute disproportionately
   much to diffuse N losses to the marine recipient, and to suggest
   cost-effective measures to reduce losses from risk areas. In the N risk
   mapping part of the tool, we combined a modelled root zone N leaching
   with a catchment-specific N reduction factor which in combination
   determines the N load to the marine recipient. N leaching was calculated
   using detailed information of agricultural management from national
   databases as well as datasets of percolation and soil parameters as
   input parameters to an empirical N leaching model. The developed N risk
   tool showed that the Danish agricultural area is distributed almost
   evenly between N retention classes (N retention being divided into
   classes of <40\%; 40-60\%; 60-80\% and >80\% N retention). Hot spots for
   marine N loading are, however, mainly located in catchments with N
   retention less than 80\%. Hot spots for N leaching from the root zone
   are mainly located in the western part of Jylland, while hot spots for
   marine N loading are found in all regions and especially in small
   catchments close to the coast. In a case study for the catchment of the
   Danish Odense Fjord estuary, we demonstrated how the tool facilitates
   cost-effective implementation of measures and how measures can be
   combined to reach a given reduction target for an estuary. (C) 2014

Title = {Impact of Climate Change on Flood Hazard at Airports on Pacific Islands:
   A Case Study of Faleolo International Airport, Samoa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {351-362},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change is believed to have increased the intensity and frequency
   of heavy rainfall, and also to have caused sea level rises over this
   century and beyond. There is widespread concern that small-island
   nations are particularly vulnerable to increasing risk of inland flood
   due to such climate change. Understanding the impact of climate change
   on flood hazard is of great importance for these countries for the
   development of better protection and adaptation strategies. This study
   conducted a case study focusing on the impact of climate change on flood
   hazard at Faleolo International Airport (FIA), Samoa. FIA is a typical
   small islands airport, located on the lowland along the coast fronted by
   a fringing reef. Annual maximum daily rainfalls for different return
   periods were first estimated for the present and future climate around
   FIA. The estimated rainfalls were input as the forcing of a
   two-dimensional flood inundation model to investigate the flooding
   behavior and effectiveness of probable drainage systems. Results showed
   that a part of the runway can be inundated under heavy rainfall.
   Construction of drainage pipes significantly contributes to reducing the
   flood hazard level. Sensitivity analysis showed that the astronomical
   tide level has relatively little influence on the performance of the
   drainage system, while the combination of sea level rise and the sea
   level anomaly induced by stormy waves on the fringing reef could have
   non-negligible impacts on the drainage system. Location of the drainage
   pipe is also important to effectively mitigate flooding. The time
   concentration of torrential rainfall may also significantly impact the
   overall performance of the drainage system.},

Title = {Shaping sustainable harvest boundaries for marine populations despite
   estimation bias},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Biased estimates of population status are a pervasive conservation
   problem. This problem has plagued assessments of commercial exploitation
   of marine species and can threaten the sustainability of both
   populations and fisheries. We develop a computer-intensive approach to
   minimize adverse effects of persistent estimation bias in assessments by
   optimizing operational harvest measures (harvest control rules) with
   closed-loop simulation of resource-management feedback systems:
   management strategy evaluation. Using saithe (Pollachius virens), a
   bottom water, apex predator in the North Sea, as a real-world case
   study, we illustrate the approach by first diagnosing robustness of the
   existing harvest control rule and then optimizing it through propagation
   of biases (overestimated stock abundance and underestimated fishing
   pressure) along with select process and observation uncertainties.
   Analyses showed that severe biases lead to overly optimistic catch
   limits and then progressively magnify the amplitude of catch
   fluctuation, thereby posing unacceptably high overharvest risks.
   Consistent performance of management strategies to conserve the resource
   can be achieved by developing more robust control rules. These rules
   explicitly account for estimation bias through a computational grid
   search for a set of control parameters (threshold abundance that
   triggers management action, B-trigger, and target exploitation rate,
   F-target) that maximize yield while keeping stock abundance above a
   precautionary level. When the biases become too severe, optimized
   control parameters-for saithe, raising B-trigger and lowering
   F-target-would safeguard against a overharvest risk (<3.5\% probability
   of stock depletion) and provide short-term stability in catch limit
   (<20\% year-to-year variation), thereby minimizing disruption to fishing
   communities. The precautionary approach to fine-tuning adaptive risk
   management through management strategy evaluation offers a powerful tool
   to better shape sustainable harvest boundaries for exploited resource
   populations when estimation bias persists. By explicitly accounting for
   emergent sources of uncertainty, our proposed approach ensures effective
   conservation and sustainable exploitation of living marine resources
   even under profound uncertainty.},

Title = {Ecosystem-based management for kelp forest ecosystems},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Kelp forests line a quarter of the world's coastlines and provide
   diverse ecosystem services. While kelps are a harvested resource
   themselves, they are also foundation species that form the basis of
   productive ecosystems. Globally, kelps are threatened by a variety of
   anthropogenic impacts, including overharvesting, overgrazing, invasive
   species, poor water quality, and the direct and indirect effects of
   climate change. To address these threats and preserve the services
   provided by these foundation species, we show that Ecosystem-Based
   Management (EBM) approaches are well-suited for kelp forest management.
   To define and illustrate key EBMinspired approaches for kelp forest
   management and conservation, we combined key concepts from the EBM
   literature, the literature on the biology and ecology of kelp forests,
   and primary information we gathered on case studies of ongoing kelp
   forest management at regional levels in British Columbia (Canada),
   California (United States), and northern Chile. Using these three
   sources of information, we identify six key principles for kelp forest
   EBM: 1) monitoring at biologically relevant temporal and spatial scales,
   2) assessing and addressing cumulative impacts, 3) managing across
   spatial and institutional scales, 4) co-management with users, 5)
   employing rapid adaptive management and/or the precautionary principle,
   and 6) managing food web connections. We explore and illustrate these
   principles using examples from multiple regions to provide concrete
   guidance on EBMinspired strategies that are likely to improve kelp
   forest management outcomes.},

   review for hot-summer Mediterranean climate},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {252},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {The production and consumption of avocado has increased significantly
   over the past years, experiencing a steady expansion into new markets
   around the world. This review paper focuses on avocado cultivation in
   its new markets with hot-summer Mediterranean climate. A significant
   literature gap exists on the viability of this crop in such data
   environments which experience limited availability of water in the
   summer exacerbated by climate change and potential salinity issues in
   irrigation water, typical in coastal regions. Strategies for handling
   salinity usually aim at preventing the build-up of salts in the root
   zone, while studies on the response of avocado trees to saline water
   have shown that it is highly influenced by rootstock selection. In this
   review paper priority is given to the appropriate irrigation water
   characteristics both in terms of quantity and quality for different tree
   sizes, soil characteristics and irrigation methods, including the use of
   reclaimed wastewater. Also, the effects of irrigation (frequency/amount)
   on fruit productivity are studied. This review also highlights the role
   of fertigation as well as the importance of a soil moisture and salinity
   monitoring. It is strongly suggested to use soil moisture sensor
   networks (precision agriculture) in avocado cultivations, to optimize
   irrigation management and promote water sustainability. Given the
   increasing dynamic in the expansion of this crop, especially in European
   countries with this climate type such as southern Italy, Spain, Greece,
   Turkey and Cyprus, among others, this review paper is expected to
   provide guidance on avocado cultivation in these regions with focus on
   its viability under water scarcity and salinity conditions.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Modern lifestyle demands high-end commodities, for instance, cosmetics,
   detergents, shampoos, household cleaning, sanitary items, medicines, and
   so forth. In recent years, these products' consumption has increased
   considerably, being antibiotics and some other pharmaceutical and
   personal care products (PPCPs). Several antibiotics and PPCPs represent
   a wide range of emerging contaminants with a straight ingress into
   aquatic systems, given their high persistence in seawater, effluent
   treatment plants, and even drinking water. Under these considerations,
   the necessity of developing new and affordable technologies for the
   treatment and sustainable mitigation of pollutants is highly requisite
   for a safer and cleaner environment. One possible mitigation solution is
   an effective deployment of nanotechnological cues as promising matrices
   that can contribute by attending issues and improving the current
   strategies to detect, prevent, and mitigate hazardous pollutants in
   water. Focused on nanoparticles' distinctive physical and chemical
   properties, such as high surface area, small size, and shape, metallic
   nanoparticles (MNPs) have been investigated for water remediation. MNPs
   gained increasing interest among research groups due to their superior
   efficiency, stability, and high catalyst activity compared with
   conventional systems. This review summarizes the occurrence of
   antibiotics and PPCPs and the application of MNPs as pollutant
   mitigators in the aquatic environment. The work also focuses on
   transportation fate, toxicity, and current regulations for environmental
   safety.

Title = {Quantifying the Uncertainty Sources of Future Climate Projections and
   Narrowing Uncertainties With Bias Correction Techniques},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Decomposing the uncertainty of global climate models is highly
   instructive in understanding climate change. However, it remains unclear
   whether sources of uncertainty have changed as the models have evolved
   and the extents to which uncertainty in temperature and precipitation
   are narrowed after bias correction (BC). We quantified uncertainty in
   temperature and precipitation projections over global land from three
   sources-model uncertainty, scenario uncertainty, and internal
   variability-and compared results from the models participating in the
   5th and 6th phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5
   and CMIP6). In addition, we investigated the potential of four BC
   methods for narrowing uncertainty in temperature and precipitation over
   the globe and individual continents. Raw projections of temperature and
   precipitation have greater uncertainty and lower fractional uncertainty
   relative to their anomalies. The largest temperature uncertainties
   appear in high-latitude and high-altitude regions, and the largest
   precipitation uncertainties are in low-latitude regions and mountainous
   and coastal areas. For uncertainties in CMIP6 temperatures, the
   contribution from model uncertainty decreases with time (from 99\% to
   39\%), while the contribution from scenario uncertainty increases with
   time (from 0.01\% to 61\%). For precipitation projections, the
   contribution from model uncertainty predominates (98\%), while the
   contributions from scenario uncertainty (1.8\%) and internal variability
   (0.2\%) are extremely low. Four BC methods have exhibited excellent
   ability to reduce uncertainty, and among them, BC and spatial
   disaggregation has the best performance. These findings can help us
   better understand the characteristics of the models, while also
   providing decision makers with more accurate information to address
   climate mitigation and adaptation measures.},

Title = {Nurturing ecosystem-based adaptations in South Africa's Garden Route: a

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1849-1863},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Increasing human demands for ecosystem services due to climate change,
   population growth, poverty, lack of employment, tourism, and concomitant
   coastal property development threatens adaptive capacity in South
   Africa's coastlines. Adaptation strategies frequently propose
   ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) as a model for transformative change.
   However, several studies point to difficulties implementing EBA across
   the world. The aim of this paper is to assess to what extent
   social-ecological systems approaches and common pool resource (CPR)
   governance theories could inform EBA. Data obtained from interviews and
   surveys with policy makers and residents in South Africa's Garden Route
   District were interpreted using the robustness framework (RF) and the
   design principles (DPs), two common tools for analyzing CPR governance.
   We found that the Garden Route coast is threatened by negative
   interactions between hard public and private infrastructures and
   ecological infrastructures (the cornerstone of EBA) which are driven by
   weak local government bodies and asymmetrical power relations. By coding
   the data for elements/interactions within the RF and then identifying
   and mapping the DPs onto the RF, we also revealed ways to leverage
   transformative EBA in the Garden Route. Our analyses suggest that the
   interactions between human-made and ecological infrastructures, as well
   as power relation, should be at the core of any development debate.
   Trade-offs should aim for maximum congruence between sustainability and
   equity in ecosystem services provisioning. This paper provides some
   considerations for researchers and decision makers to leverage
   transformative EBA that could potentially apply to areas experiencing
   similar challenges.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Tropical coral reefs are highly diverse and globally threatened.
   Management to ensure their persistence requires sound biological
   knowledge in regions where coral reef biodiversity and/or the threats to
   it are greatest. This paper uses a novel text analysis approach and
   Google Maps (TM) to examine the spatial coverage of scientific papers on
   coral reefs listed in Web of Science (R). Results show that research is
   highly clumped spatially, positively related to per capita gross
   domestic product, negatively related to coral species richness, and
   unrelated to threats to coral reefs globally; indicating a serious
   mismatch between conservation needs and the knowledge required for
   effective management. Greater research effort alone cannot guarantee
   better conservation outcomes, but given some regions of the world (e.g.,
   Central Indo-Pacific) remain severely understudied, priority allocation
   of resources to fill such knowledge gaps should support greater adaptive
   management capacity through the development of an improved knowledge
   base for reef managers.},

Abstract = {Climate changes projected for 2100 and beyond could result in a
   worldwide race for adaptation resources on a scale never seen before.
   This paper describes a model for estimating the cost and materials of
   elevating coastal seaport infrastructure in the United States to prevent
   damage from sea level rise associated with climate change. This study
   pilots the use of a generic port model (GenPort) as a basis from which
   to estimate regional materials and monetary demands, resulting in
   projections that would be infeasible to calculate on an individual
   port-by-port basis. We estimate the combined cost of adding two meters
   of additional fill material to elevate the working surface and then
   reconstructing the generic port. We use the resulting unit area cost to
   develop an estimate to elevate and retrofit 100 major United States
   commercial coastal ports. A total of \$ 57 billion to \$ 78 billion
   (2012 US dollars) and 704 million cubic meters of fill would be required
   to elevate the 100 ports by two meters and to reconstruct associated
   infrastructure. This estimation method and the results serve as a
   thought exercise to provoke considerations of the cumulative monetary
   and material demands of widespread adaptations of seaport
   infrastructure. The model can be adapted for use in multiple
   infrastructure sectors and coastal managers can use the outlined
   considerations as a basis for individual port adaptation strategy
   assessments.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses increasing risks to global aquaculture in general
   and clam farming in particular. In Vietnam, clam farming has often
   encountered massive clam mortalities and the main reasons for that are
   weather-related extreme events. This study, therefore, aims to assess
   risks and then propose mitigation solutions for clam farms in Northern
   Vietnam in the context of climate change. Five categories of risks for
   clam farms were identified and categorized, including (i) physical risks
   of nature, (ii) operational and technical risks, (iii) financial and
   market-related risks, (iv) social and political risks (v) liability and
   consumer-related risks. Each risk type was assessed for probability and
   consequence on a 5-point scale. A risk matrix was used to define the
   level of risk as negligible, low, moderate, high or extreme. Results
   showed that clam farms in Northern Vietnam were at high or extreme risk
   from tropical cyclones and floods, severe temperature and salinity,
   environmental pollutants, infectious diseases and predators. The other
   risks ranged from negligible to moderate, except for the low quality of
   seeds, high stocking densities and unstable markets defined as high risk
   at some farms. Remarkable physical risks of nature detected in the
   present study indicate that greater awareness of risk management for
   clam farming is required if this activity is to be sustainable under
   climate change.},

Title = {The effectiveness of urban green infrastructure in reducing surface
   urban heat island},
Journal = {AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the era of the devastating impacts of climate change, many cities
   around the world make strenuous efforts to find suitable and sustainable
   adaptation strategies to address the climatic dangers. In the past
   decades, Baghdad city witnessed an increase in the intensity of surface
   urban heat island (SUHI) as a result of the change in land cover and
   population density. By reviewing the related literature, it was found
   that many studies discussed SUHI intensity and causes, yet there is
   limited knowledge concerning the adaptation to such a phenomenon. In
   general, urban green infrastructure (UGI) represents a vital sustainable
   strategy that can achieve climate change `adaptation and mitigation'
   simultaneously. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to assess the
   effectiveness of UGI in reducing SUHI in Baghdad city. Risafa
   municipality was selected as a case study, as it suffers from a high
   level of SUHI risk. Using a computer climatic simulation program;
   ENVI-met, the temperature of different surfaces in the study area was
   assessed, and two typical models were selected. Surface temperature (Ts)
   of different points in these two models was measured according to the
   base case scenario and to three proposed scenarios of UGI. The results
   show that UGI has an apparent role in declining Ts in both models. It
   was also found that the cooling effects of injecting UGI scenarios in
   similar surfaces of the two models are convergent. This confirms the UGI
   great effectiveness in reducing SUHI in Baghdad City. It is also found
   that the effectiveness of UGI in cooling the existing surfaces depends
   on the original condition of the surfaces and the intensity and types of
   the injected UGI assets. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV

Title = {Impact of Barrier Breaching on Wetland Ecosystems under the Influence of

Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {771-785},

Abstract = {Coastal wetland ecosystems and biodiversity are susceptible to changes
   in salinity brought about by the local effects of climate change,
   meteorological extremes, coastal evolution and human intervention. This
   study investigates changes in the salinity of surface water and the
   associated impacts on back-barrier wetlands as a result of breaching of
   a barrier beach and under the compound action of different surge
   heights, accelerated sea-level rise (SLR), river discharge and rainfall.
   We show that barrier breaching can have significant effects in terms of
   vegetation die-back even without the occurrence of large storm surges or
   in the absence of SLR, and that rainfall alone is unlikely to be
   sufficient to mitigate increased salinity due to direct tidal flushing.
   Results demonstrate that an increase in sea level corresponding to the
   RCP8.5 scenario for year 2100 causes a greater impact in terms of
   reedbed loss than storm surges up to 2 m with no SLR. In mitigation of
   the consequent changes in wetland ecology, regulation of relatively
   small and continuous river discharge can be regarded as a strategy for
   the management of coastal back-barrier wetland habitats and for the
   maintenance of brackish ecosystems. As such, this study provides a tool
   for scoping the potential impacts of storms, climate change and
   alternative management strategies on existing wetland habitats and
   species.},

Abstract = {The atmospheric level of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the dominant variable
   in the anthropogenic influence of future global climate change. Thus, it
   is critical to understand the long-term factors affecting its level,
   especially the longer-range technological considerations. Most recent
   analyses of the problem focus on the next 20 to 100 years. While great
   uncertainties exist in longer-term projections of CO2, it is of concern
   that the longer-range buildup (over many centuries) may be of
   substantial magnitude and might be so despite major efforts to reduce
   use of fossil reserves for energy, save world forests, and/or collect
   and dispose of CO2. This paper summarizes some of the recent literature
   relating to the longer-term CO2 problem and discusses some of the
   technological considerations for known prevention and mitigation
   approaches in the context of this longer-term problem. These approaches
   include: renewables (solar photovoltaics, wind, and biomass),
   conservation, flue-gas and fuel CO2 sequestration via disposal on land
   or in the ocean, carbon recycling (chemical/biological utilization), and
   atmospheric CO2 fixation/utilization via terrestrial and marine
   approaches. These are discussed along with other strategies to identify
   those that 1) could be major factors in preventing long-term CO2
   buildup, 2) would be environmentally sound but likely to have more
   limited long-range CO2 impact, 3) would be environmentally uncertain or
   uncertain for other reasons, and 4) would be environmentally
   questionable or unlikely solutions for other reasons.},

   Is REDD plus a solution?},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {58-66},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Globally, coastal aquaculture particularly shrimp farming has been under
   huge criticism because of its environmental impacts including
   devastating effects on mangrove forests. However, mangroves are
   ecologically and economically important forests, and the most
   carbon-rich forests in the tropics that provide a wide range of
   ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Carbon emissions are
   likely to have been the dominant cause of climate change and blue carbon
   emissions are being critically augmented through mangrove deforestation.
   Because of mangrove deforestation, different climatic variables
   including coastal flooding, cyclone, drought, rainfall, salinity,
   sea-level rise, and sea surface temperature have dramatic effects on
   coastal aquaculture. Mangrove forests have been instrumental in
   augmenting resilience to climate change. The ``Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD){''} program can help to
   restore mangroves which in turn increases options for adaptation{''} to
   climate change. However, technical and financial assistance with
   institutional support are needed to implement REDD+. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {Coastal communities are threatened by the impact of severe storms that
   may cause significant loss or damage of property and life. The main
   processes causing such impacts at sandy coastlines and nearby coastal
   communities are storm erosion, overwash and inundation. Coastal response
   under present conditions and under predicted climate change has been
   frequently assessed on the basis of numerical models, which in turn can
   be also used to evaluate the effectiveness of Disaster Risk Reduction
   (DRR) measures to mitigate the response of the coast to the imposed
   conditions. However, detailed morphodynamic models are computationally
   expensive and not commonly used by coastal managers. The present work
   proposes the construction of a probabilistic Bayesian Network (BN) as a
   surrogate for the numerical simulations. This BN is trained with a large
   number of morphodynamic simulations, under a variety of storm conditions
   and DRR measures, in order to serve as a front-end platform for
   visualising, analysing and evaluating combined results of the numerical
   modelling. The BN introduced in an early warning system will be able to
   serve both, as a predictive and as a working tool to determine impacts
   and evaluate risk reduction after measures implementation.
   Here, an example of the implementation and results of such a BN system
   is presented. The BN system was built for a coastal sector of the Ria
   Formosa barrier island system (South Portugal) to inform the degree of
   impact derived from overwash and erosion over the study area. The BN
   boundary conditions include variable wave height, water level, and wave
   period. The impact on receptors, including houses and infrastructure,
   was assessed. In addition, this tool can inform about the effectiveness
   of a particular DRR measure. The evaluated DRR measures were two primary
   measures (partial house removal and beach replenishment) and a
   non-primary measure (improve channels of communication), all measures
   proposed by local stakeholders. Results show that for a storm with wave
   characteristics of the 1 in 50 year return period and spring tide
   conditions, the house removal DRR reduces the overwash impact by 15\%
   and erosion impact by 58\%. The implementation of beach replenishment
   could reduce the erosion impact of the same event by 96\% while it would
   have a smaller effect on the overwash impact (16\%). The implementation
   of non-primary measures would have a much smaller effect on risk
   reduction. The combined effect of the above DRR measures (mainly house
   removal and beach nourishment) reduces storm impacts at the study area
   to a value near zero. The BN surrogates the model simulated onshore
   hazards and translates them into impacts for the current conditions,
   which give a high degree of confidence in the potential application of
   the BN as a management tool.},

Title = {Adaptive measures adopted for risk reduction of coastal erosion in the
   People's Republic of China},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {134-145},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hard engineered structures such as seawalls, groynes and breakwaters are
   often built to reduce coastal erosion and maintain a minimum beach width
   for recreation along coast regions. China has a seawall coastline of
   some 13 830 km that is the most popular erosion countermeasure along the
   Chinese coast; groynes and breakwaters always appear along muddy coasts
   or are used as aided structures. The latter are a common way to trap
   sediment in a particular coastal cell to maintain the nourished beach
   width; reclamation has already produced 12 000 km(2) of new land for the
   Chinese coastal area since the 1940's, including artificial islands in
   recent years. Soft engineering and combined structures are more and more
   popular in China; including those in Taiwan there are 34 documented
   nourishment sites. Other significant countermeasures to protect the
   coastline include planting Spartina alterniflora, mangrove
   afforestation, coral reef transplants, and introducing marine natural
   reserves. Since its introduction in the 1980's, over 34 km(2) of coastal
   wetland has been covered by Spartina alterniflora in China. Mangrove
   afforestation and coral reef transplants have also been carried out in
   the south China coastal area as environmentally friendly measures for
   coastal management, together with the declaration of marine natural
   reserves. More than 8 300 km(2) of coastal land has been protected in
   this way. Before the 1960's hard engineering works were mainly built on
   the Chinese coast, from then on soft engineering solutions became more
   common. The advantages and disadvantages of the countermeasures taken in
   China to combat coastal erosion are also dependent upon the country's
   economic circumstances. China needs to establish an effective coastal
   erosion management system, guiding managers and stakeholders to balance
   environmental and economic needs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Impacts of CO2-induced seawater acidification on coastal Mediterranean

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The effects of seawater acidification caused by increasing
   concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), combined with other
   climatic stressors, were studied on 3 coastal Mediterranean bivalve
   species: the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the clams Chamelea
   gallina and Ruditapes decussatus. CO2 perturbation experiments produced
   contrasting responses on growth and calcification of juvenile shells,
   according to species and location. In the Northern Adriatic (Italy),
   long-term exposure to reduced pH severely damaged the shells of M.
   galloprovincialis and C. gallina and reduced growth for the latter
   species. Seawater in the Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal) was consistently
   saturated in carbonates, which buffered the impacts on calcification and
   growth. After 80 days, no shell damage was observed in Portugal, but
   mussels in the acidified treatments were less calcified. Reduced
   clearance, ingestion and respiration rates and increased ammonia
   excretion were observed for R. decussatus under reduced pH. Clearance
   rates of juvenile mussels were significantly reduced by acidification in
   Italy, but not in Portugal. Both locations showed a consistent trend for
   increased ammonia excretion with decreasing pH, suggesting increased
   protein catabolism. Respiratory rates were generally not affected.
   Short-term factorial experiments done in Italy revealed that
   acidification caused alterations in immunological parameters of adult
   bivalves, particularly at temperature and salinity values far from the
   optimal for the species in the Mediterranean. Overall, our results
   showed large variations in the sensitivities of bivalves to climatic
   changes, among different species and between local populations of the
   same species. Expectations of impacts, mitigation and adaptation
   strategies have to consider such local variability.},

Title = {The growth of finfish in global open-ocean aquaculture under climate
   change},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {284},

Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Aquaculture production is projected to expand from land-based operations
   to the open ocean as demand for seafood grows and competition increases
   for inputs to land-based aquaculture, such as freshwater and suitable
   land. In contrast to land-based production, open-ocean aquaculture is
   constrained by oceanographic factors, such as current speeds and
   seawater temperature, which are dynamic in time and space, and cannot
   easily be controlled. As such, the potential for offshore aquaculture to
   increase seafood production is tied to the physical state of the oceans.
   We employ a novel spatial model to estimate the potential of open-ocean
   finfish aquaculture globally, given physical, biological and
   technological constraints. Finfish growth potential for three common
   aquaculture species representing different thermal guilds-Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and cobia
   (Rachycentron canadum)-is compared across species and regions and with
   climate change, based on outputs of a high-resolution global climate
   model. Globally, there are ample areas that are physically suitable for
   fish growth and potential expansion of the nascent aquaculture industry.
   The effects of climate change are heterogeneous across species and
   regions, but areas with existing aquaculture industries are likely to
   see increases in growth rates. In areas where climate change results in
   reduced growth rates, adaptation measures, such as selective breeding,
   can probably offset potential production losses.},

Abstract = {Aquatic ecosystem services are important for human wellbeing, but they
   are much less studied than terrestrial ecosystem services. The
   objectives of this study are to broaden, itemize and exemplify the
   human-nature interactions in modeling the future provision of aquatic
   ecosystem services. We include shared socioeconomic and representative
   concentration pathways, used extensively in climate research, as drivers
   of change for the future development of the Baltic Sea. Then we use
   biogeochemical and ecosystem models to demonstrate the future
   development of exemplary supporting, provisioning and cultural ecosystem
   services for two distinct combinations of regionally downscaled global
   climate and socioeconomic futures. According to the model simulations,
   the two global futures ({''}Sustainable well-being{''} vs.
   ``Fossil-fuelled development{''}) studied lead to clearly deviating
   trajectories in the provision of marine ecosystem services. Under the
   ``Sustainable well-being{''}-scenario primary production decreases by
   20\%, catches of demersal fish increases and the recreation
   opportunities increase significantly by the end of the ongoing century.
   Under the ``fossil-fuelled development{''}-scenario primary production
   doubles, fisheries focus on less valued pelagic fish and the recreation
   possibilities will decrease. Long-term projections of aquatic ecosystem
   services prepared for alternative global socioeconomic futures can be
   used by policy makers and managers to adaptively and iteratively adjust
   mitigation and adaptation effort with plausible future changes in the
   drivers of water pollution.},

Title = {Understanding Microbial Community Dynamics in Up-Flow Bioreactors to
   Improve Mitigation Strategies for Oil Souring},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {Oil souring occurs when H2S is generated in oil reservoirs. This not
   only leads to operational risks and health hazards but also increases
   the cost of refining crude oil. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms are
   considered to be the main source of the H2S that leads to oil souring.
   Substrate competition between nitrate-reducing and sulfate-reducing
   microorganisms makes biosouring mitigation via the addition of nitrate
   salts a viable strategy. This study explores the shift in microbial
   community across different phases of biosouring and mitigation.
   Anaerobic sand-filled columns wetted with seawater and/or oil were used
   to initiate the processes of sulfidogenesis, followed by mitigation with
   nitrate, rebound sulfidogenesis, and rebound control phases (via nitrate
   and low salinity treatment). Shifts in microbial community structure and
   function were observed across different phases of seawater and oil
   setups. Marine bacterial taxa (Marinobacter, Marinobacterium,
   Thalassolituus, Alteromonas, and Cycloclasticus) were found to be the
   initial responders to the application of nitrate during mitigation of
   sulfidogenesis in both seawater- and oil- wetted columns. Autotrophic
   groups (Sulfurimonas and Desulfatibacillum) were found to be higher in
   seawater-wetted columns compared to oil-wetted columns, suggesting the
   potential for autotrophic volatile fatty acid (VFA) production in
   oil-field aquifers when seawater is introduced. Results indicate that
   fermentative (such as Bacteroidetes) and oil-degrading bacteria (such as
   Desulfobacula toluolica) play an important role in generating electron
   donors in the system, which may sustain biosouring and nitrate
   reduction. Persistence of certain microorganisms (Desulfobacula) across
   different phases was observed, which may be due to a shift in metabolic
   lifestyle of the microorganisms across phases, or zonation based on
   nutrient availability in the columns. Overall results suggest mitigation
   strategies for biosouring can be improved by monitoring VFA
   concentrations and microbial community dynamics in the oil reservoirs
   during secondary recovery of oil.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise causes saltwater intrusion and flooding of agricultural
   land and ultimately threatens the livelihoods of farm households in the
   delta region of Myanmar. Empirical research on the effects of climate
   change on the delta's agriculture and an assessment of the vulnerability
   are becoming necessary. This study explores the vulnerability of farm
   households to sea level rise using two methods: the Livelihood
   Vulnerability Index (LVI), which is comprised of 37 indicators, and the
   Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SeVI), which contains 35 indicators.
   Interviews with 178 farmers were conducted in Bogale, Pyapon and Dedaye
   Townships in Pyapon District. In addition, 7 focus group discussions
   were performed, with at least 2 discussions in each Township. Both
   methods identify Bogale to be the most vulnerable Township, followed by
   Dedaye and Pyapon Townships. Following the LVI approach, Bogale Township
   has the highest sensitivity to climate effects and the highest exposure
   to natural hazards, but also a higher adaptive capacity than the other
   townships. In contrast using the SeVI approach, Bogale was found to have
   the highest sensitivity and exposure to natural hazards but the lowest
   adaptive capacity score. The study found that the climate change
   adaptation measures taken by the farmers are important to limit
   vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and thus promotion
   of the adaptive capacity of farmers is important for the delta region of
   Myanmar.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems around the world are reorganizing due to climate change(1),
   motivating management responses to facilitate species persistence and
   maintain ecological functions. Spatial management actions are generally
   undertaken to relieve local stressors on populations and have recently
   been suggested as an approach to facilitate species range shifts,
   provide refugia and enhance resilience to climate change(2,3). Efforts
   to identify which habitats to protect, however, typically assume that
   organisms do not evolve in response to shifting environmental
   conditions(4,5) despite growing evidence that rapid evolutionary
   responses occur under new selective regimes in the wild(6,7). It is not
   clear whether conservation strategies would be different if evolutionary
   dynamics were considered during conservation planning. Here, we show
   that evolutionary responses fundamentally change recommendations for
   conservation actions. With spatially explicit simulations of a simple
   three-species coral reef ecosystem, we show that the preferred
   management strategies changed from those focusing on thermal refugia
   when evolutionary capacity was absent to those prioritizing trait and
   habitat diversity or high cover when adaptive evolution was possible.
   Prioritizing habitat diversity protects heat resistant populations and
   protects cooler refuges and the stepping stones between them. The
   protection of habitat heterogeneity and connectivity also produced
   substantially larger benefits outside reserves than refugia-based
   strategies, providing conservation planners an opportunity to facilitate
   adaptation to ongoing and unpredictable change.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Restoration of coral reefs is generally studied under the most favorable
   of environmental conditions, a stipulation that does not always reflect
   situations in the field. A 2-year study (2005-2007), employing the
   ``reef gardening{''} restoration concept (that includes nursery and
   transplantation phases), was conducted in Bolinao, Philippines, in an
   area suffering from intense human stressors. This site also experienced
   severe weather conditions, including a forceful southwesterly monsoon
   season and three stochastic environmental events: (1) a category 4
   typhoon hit the Bolinao's lagoon (May 2006) impacted farmed corals; (2)
   heavy rains (August 2006) caused seepages of freshwater, followed by
   reduced salinity that impacted transplanted colonies; and (3) a
   bleaching event (June 2007) caused by warming of seawater, severely
   impacted both nursery and transplanted corals. This study analyzes the
   effects of these natural catastrophes on restoration efforts, and
   presents the successes and failures of recently used restoration
   instruments. Our results show that (1) in the nursery phase,
   consideration should be paid to depth-flexible constructions and tenable
   species/genotypes prioritization and (2) for transplantation acts,
   site/species deliberation, timing, and specific site selections should
   be taken into account. Only the establishment of large-scale nurseries
   and large transplantation measures and the adapting of restoration
   management to the frequently changing environment may forestall
   extensive reef degradation due to the combination of continuous
   anthropogenic and worsening global changes.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Reducing the impacts and risk of weather hazards requires better
   knowledge of the regions that are most affected in terms of economic
   damage, fatality and injury. While understanding of weather hazards has
   greatly improved, regional vulnerability to weather hazards of various
   types has not been well assessed in the United States. Through a
   compilation of event-based records of eight types of weather hazards for
   1996-2016 at the national, regional and state levels, our analysis shows
   large differences in the change trends in economic damage, fatality and
   injury caused by drought, coastal flood, hail and wildfire,
   demonstrating the inconsistent responses of economic and human systems
   to weather hazards of various types at the state level. Despite a
   general increase in annual occurrences, spatial analysis shows that
   vulnerability to tornado and hail has decreased significantly in most of
   the country. Our results have great implications for adaptation and
   mitigation strategies, through identifying the vulnerable regions and
   types of hazards that require more urgent efforts for reducing economic
   and human losses. It is, however, important to keep in mind that the
   results may depend on the records, indicators and time periods used for
   the analysis.},

Abstract = {Global climate change will become an additional source of stress on
   coastal fishing communities. Therefore, adaptation to climate change is
   becoming a key feature for the development of sustainable livelihoods in
   these socioecological systems and has become a priority for governments.
   Analysing and highlighting the factors that influence the adaptive
   capacity of communities in these contexts have become an urgent matter
   for governments to overcome foreseeable threats. In this study, a
   qualitative bottom-up approach was used to explore the conditions
   affecting the drivers of adaptive capacity of three small-scale
   artisanal fishing communities dealing with the oil industry and
   threatened by climate change in Tabasco, Mexico. Information about the
   adaptive capacity of these communities was obtained through
   semi-structured interviews and was analysed using a set of proxy
   indicators: (1) flexibility and diversity, (2) capacity to organize, (3)
   learning and knowledge, and (4) access to assets. The analysis confirmed
   that adaptive capacity is highly context--specific but also revealed
   that multiple ways of adaptation are conditioned by historical social
   agreements and geographic location, as well as defined by adverse
   conditions that force individuals to diversify their income sources. Our
   findings emphasize the need to analyse adaptive capacity on a local
   scale to better inform policymakers and improve adaptation policies'
   design. Reducing the negative impacts of climate change in fishing
   communities in Tabasco is possible, but social, economic, and cultural
   changes must first occur on different levels ranging from the government
   to the communities themselves.},

Abstract = {Climate change and ocean acidification are altering marine ecosystems
   and, from a human perspective, creating both winners and losers. Human
   responses to these changes are complex, but may result in reduced
   government investments in regulation, resource management, monitoring
   and enforcement. Moreover, a lack of peoples' experience of climate
   change may drive some towards attributing the symptoms of climate change
   to more familiar causes such as management failure. Taken together, we
   anticipate that management could become weaker and less effective as
   climate change continues. Using diverse case studies, including the
   decline of coral reefs, coastal defences from flooding, shifting fish
   stocks and the emergence of new shipping opportunities in the Arctic, we
   argue that human interests are better served by increased investments in
   resource management. But greater government investment in management
   does not simply mean more of ``business-as-usual{''}. Management needs
   to become more flexible, better at anticipating and responding to
   surprise, and able to facilitate change where it is desirable. A range
   of technological, economic, communication and governance solutions
   exists to help transform management. While not all have been tested,
   judicious application of the most appropriate solutions should help
   humanity adapt to novel circumstances and seek opportunity where
   possible.},

Abstract = {Identifying the type and strength of interactions between local
   anthropogenic and other stressors can help to set achievable management
   targets for degraded marine ecosystems and support their resilience by
   identifying local actions. We undertook a meta-analysis, using data from
   118 studies to test the hypothesis that ongoing global declines in the
   dominant habitat along temperate rocky coastlines, forests of
   canopy-forming algae and/or their replacement by mat-forming algae are
   driven by the nonadditive interactions between local anthropogenic
   stressors that can be addressed through management actions (fishing,
   heavy metal pollution, nutrient enrichment and high sediment loads) and
   other stressors (presence of competitors or grazers, removal of canopy
   algae, limiting or excessive light, low or high salinity, increasing
   temperature, high wave exposure and high UV or CO2), not as easily
   amenable to management actions. In general, the cumulative effects of
   local anthropogenic and other stressors had negative effects on the
   growth and survival of canopy-forming algae. Conversely, the growth or
   survival of mat-forming algae was either unaffected or significantly
   enhanced by the same pairs of stressors. Contrary to our predictions,
   the majority of interactions between stressors were additive. There were
   however synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment and heavy
   metals, the presence of competitors, low light and increasing
   temperature, leading to amplified negative effects on canopy-forming
   algae. There were also synergistic interactions between nutrient
   enrichment and increasing CO2 and temperature leading to amplified
   positive effects on mat-forming algae. Our review of the current
   literature shows that management of nutrient levels, rather than
   fishing, heavy metal pollution or high sediment loads, would provide the
   greatest opportunity for preventing the shift from canopy to mat-forming
   algae, particularly in enclosed bays or estuaries because of the higher
   prevalence of synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment with
   other local and global stressors, and as such it should be prioritized.},

   long-term resilience of water supply in California},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Study Region: We created a 270-m coupled model of land-use and
   groundwater conditions, LUCAS-W{[}ater], for California's Central Coast.
   This groundwater-dependent region is undergoing a dramatic
   reorganization of groundwater management under California's 2014
   Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA).Study Focus: Understanding
   land-use and land-cover change supports long-term sustainable water
   management. Anthropogenic water demand has depleted groundwater aquifers
   worldwide, while future water shortages will likely affect land-use
   change, creating system feedbacks. Our novel participatory approach
   fused changes in land-use and associated water use from county-scale
   data to local water agencies' estimates of total sustainable supply,
   scaling up local hydro-geologic knowledge from heterogeneous aquifers
   and diverse management approaches to a regional level. We assessed five
   stakeholder-driven scenarios with the same historic rates of urban and
   agricultural land-use change, but different water and land-use
   management, analyzing how management strategies altered both the spatial
   pattern of development and subsequent water sustainability from 2001 to
   2061.New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Transformative strategies
   using demand-side interventions that coupled water availability to
   land-use more effectively achieved long-term sustainability than
   adaptive strategies using supply-side interventions to increase water
   supplies. Limiting water withdrawals within SGMA regulated basins
   resulted in leakage of development into unregulated basins, increasing
   groundwater pumping there. Protecting ecosystems, farmlands, and
   recharge areas from development reduced leakage into undeveloped basins
   without negatively affecting water sustainability.},

Title = {Leveraging public adaptation finance through urban land reclamation:
   cases from Germany, the Netherlands and the Maldives},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},

Abstract = {Flood risk in urban areas around the world is increasing due to
   socio-economic development and climate change. Urban climate adaptation
   measures are beneficial over the longer term, particularly in coastal
   areas, yet the upfront costs of such measures are significant. Moreover,
   public actors responsible for adaptation to flood risk face constrained
   budgets. A promising strategy for overcoming these constraints and
   enabling greater adaptation investment is land reclamation that includes
   adaptation, i.e. flood risk reduction. Land reclamation in high-value
   urban areas can generate substantial revenues through the sale or lease
   of new land, or taxes on increased economic activities, thus offsetting
   public adaptation investments. This paper explores the potential of land
   reclamation for leveraging public adaptation investments and associated
   distributional issues, by analysing 3 urban land reclamation and
   adaptation projects in Germany, the Netherlands and the Maldives. We
   find that all projects have leveraging potential, and leveraging in
   projects primarily aimed at land creation is particularly high. Further,
   due to low adaptation costs needed to protect revenue streams in such
   projects, these investments appear to be `low-regret'. Regarding
   distributional aspects, high project costs and limited public budgets
   for adaptation constrain public actors' ability to ensure equitable
   outcomes through planning instruments, for example, social housing.
   Further, in implementation, competition for project benefits can lead to
   further inequalities. We conclude that urban land reclamation presents a
   significant opportunity to leverage public adaptation investments under
   certain conditions. We further outline future research needs including
   to extend land-based financing theory from related urban infrastructure
   sectors to inform the design of equitable governance arrangements and to
   better understand the role of such urban land reclamation projects in
   regional or national development pathways.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Coastal transportation systems are extremely vulnerable due to the
   coupled impacts of storm surge, waves, and inundation. Existing
   literature has developed coastal fragility models for bridges. However,
   to date, flood fragility models for coastal roadways are lacking. For
   this purpose, the current study proposes a data-driven fragility model
   based on logistic regression for coastal roadways, with failure
   probability conditioned on distance to shoreline and inundation
   duration, using hindcast data for Hurricane Ike. In addition, the effect
   of bridge and roadway damage on transportation network performance is
   investigated through a case study on Galveston Island, Texas. The
   results indicate the spatial distribution of storm impacts on the
   transportation network, with select roads highly vulnerable if they are
   located within a couple of hundred meters of the shoreline. In addition,
   considering roadway damage in addition to bridge damage alone, which is
   the current state of the art, can have a significant impact on
   decreasing the performance of the transportation network. Such analyses
   shed light on potential policy or risk mitigation practices that are
   expected to be increasingly important in the future as sea level rise
   further reduces roadway distance to the shoreline or as storm intensity
   and frequency changes.},

Title = {Risk measures and the distribution of damage curves for 600 European
   coastal cities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A good understanding of climate change damages is vital to design
   effective adaptation policies and measures. Using a dataset of
   probabilistic sea-level rise and other of flood damages and protection
   cost curves for the 600 largest European coastal cities we generate
   stochastic damage curves and their distributions with and without
   adaptation. We apply the Generalized Extreme Value distribution to
   characterize the distributions and calculate two risk measures: the
   Value at Risk and the Expected Shortfall, which contribute to
   understanding the magnitude and probability of high-end sea-level rise
   represented by the upper tail of the distribution. This allows the costs
   of sea-level rise to be estimated (that is, in addition to other costs
   related to coastal extreme events) and supports decision-makers in
   integrating the high uncertainty related to future projections. This
   knowledge is necessary for an adequate risk management that does not
   underestimate risk. Furthermore, it allows city planners to tailor their
   risk tolerance. A great number of cities in Europe are currently
   undertaking adaptation plans or have already done so. Making these
   findings available should therefore be of great priority value to inform
   these processes.},

Title = {DTEx: A dynamic urban thermal exposure index based on human mobility
   patterns},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {155},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Extreme heat in light of climate change is increasingly
   threatening the health and comfort of urban residents. Understanding
   spatio-temporal patterns of heat exposure is a critical factor in
   directing mitigation measures. Current heat vulnerability indices
   provide insight into heat sensitivities within given communities but do
   not account for the dynamic nature of the human movement as people
   travel for different activities. Here, we present a new Dynamic urban
   Thermal Exposure index (DTEx) that captures the varying heat exposure
   within urban environments. Methods: We developed the DTEx to understand
   human heat exposure patterns in a mid-sized city. This index
   incorporates the human movement pattern and the heat hazard pattern
   obtained via novel and advanced techniques. We generated the human
   movement pattern from large-scale, anonymized smartphone location data.
   The heat hazard patterns were extrapolated via machine learning models
   from air temperature data measured through vehicle-mounted sensors. The
   exposure index was then developed by combining the two parameters using
   their standard-deviation-classified indices. Results: Our exposure index
   varied between 2 and 12, indicating low to high thermal exposures.
   Several hightemperature spots associated with a large volume of foot
   traffic are successfully identified through this DTEx. We observed the
   hottest spots at shopping plazas but not specifically in the urban
   center. During the selected football gameday, the exposure index surged
   across most places near the football stadium but was reduced
   considerably further away. Discussion: The proposed DTEx is novel
   because it provides dynamic heat monitoring capability to facilitate
   heat mitigation strategies at vulnerable locations in urban
   environments. Combining the mobility data and extensive sensor data
   generates rich details on the most heat-exposed areas due to human
   congregation. Such information will be critical for risk communication
   and urban planning for policymakers. DTEx could also help smart route
   planning in sustainable cities to avoid heat hazards risks.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the multi-decadal variations of the Multivariate ENSO
   Index (MEI) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index were studied
   to determine their influence on tropical cyclones (TCs) using the
   empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and Hilbert spectral analysis.
   The ENSO and PDO are closely associated with various oceanic and
   atmospheric factors that govern TC activities in the western North
   Pacific (WNP). From the analysis results, multi-decadal oscillations
   with characteristic periods of 13 and 32.5 years from MEI, and about
   16.7 and 32.8 years from PDO, were obtained. These values showed good
   agreement with the values obtained in other studies. The results of
   category 4-5 TCs and category 5 TCs also showed possible multi-decadal
   oscillations of about 15- and 37-year timescales, indicating that low
   frequency multi-decadal oscillations of intense TC occurrence in the WNP
   is influenced by the multi-decadal oscillations of ENSO and PDO. When
   seeking adaptation and mitigation measures for future climate scenarios,
   the multi-decadal variations of climate and their impacts on extreme
   events such as TCs should be taken into account together with the
   background of the global warming trend. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Perceived Vulnerability and Climate Change Impacts on Small-Scale
   Fisheries in Davao Gulf, Philippines},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {The small-scale fisheries play a critical role in food security and
   income of coastal fishing communities. However, climate variability and
   its impacts are affecting fishers, their communities, and fishing
   grounds. This study aimed to determine the perceived impacts of climate
   change and vulnerability of small-scale fisheries in selected fishing
   communities around the Davao Gulf. A semi-structured questionnaire was
   used to gather data on the perceptions of fishers (N = 220) on the
   impacts of climate change on their livelihood and communities. Seven
   focus groups corroborated the collected data and conclusions reached (N
   = 15). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the sources
   of vulnerability and number of impacts of climate change. Regression was
   used to determine factors influencing the catch per unit effort (CPUE).
   The PCA results showed that for the vulnerability, the sources, coral
   bleaching, inadequate food, lack of credit access, changes in weather
   pattern and hotter temperature contributed highly. For the climate
   change impacts, the factors, less seasonality, unclear reproductive
   patterns, diseases in the catch, invasive species, decrease in catch and
   venturing farther to fish offshore were substantially influential.
   Further analysis showed that disease and invasive species, decrease in
   fish catch, fishing farther offshore, and monthly income affected the
   CPUE of the fisheries. Recommendations for climate change vulnerability
   reduction based on the conclusions reached in this study include more
   financial credit access, apprehension of illegal fishers, increased
   capacity building and technical skills for coastal communities,
   supplemental livelihoods, and information dissemination on climate
   change adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Salt marsh monitoring along the mid-Atlantic coast by Google Earth
   Engine enabled time series},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Salt marshes provide a bulwark against sea-level rise (SLR), an
   interface between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, important nursery
   grounds for many species, a buffer against extreme storm impacts, and
   vast blue carbon repositories. However, salt marshes are at risk of loss
   from a variety of stressors such as SLR, nutrient enrichment, sediment
   deficits, herbivory, and anthropogenic disturbances. Determining the
   dynamics of salt marsh change with remote sensing requires high temporal
   resolution due to the spectral variability caused by disturbance, tides,
   and seasonality. Time series analysis of salt marshes can broaden our
   understanding of these changing environments. This study analyzed
   aboveground green biomass (AGB) in seven mid-Atlantic Hydrological Unit
   Code 8 (HUC-8) watersheds. The study revealed that the Eastern Lower
   Delmarva watershed had the highest average loss and the largest net
   reduction in salt marsh AGB from 1999-2018. The study developed a method
   that used Google Earth Engine (GEE) enabled time series of the Landsat
   archive for regional analysis of salt marsh change and identified
   at-risk watersheds and salt marshes providing insight into the
   resilience and management of these ecosystems. The time series were
   filtered by cloud cover and the Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII). The
   combination of GEE enabled Landsat time series, and TMII filtering
   demonstrated a promising method for historic assessment and continued
   monitoring of salt marsh dynamics.},

Abstract = {In a natural resource management setting, monitoring is a crucial
   component of an informed process for making decisions, and monitoring
   design should be driven by the decision context and associated
   uncertainties. Monitoring itself can play >= 3 roles. First, it is
   important for state-dependent decision-making, as when managers need to
   know the system state before deciding on the appropriate course of
   action during the ensuing management cycle. Second, monitoring is
   critical for evaluating the effectiveness of management actions relative
   to objectives. Third, in an adaptive management setting, monitoring
   provides the feedback loop for learning about the system; learning is
   sought not for its own sake but primarily to better achieve management
   objectives. In this case, monitoring should be designed to reduce the
   critical uncertainties in models of the managed system. The United
   States Geological Survey and United States Fish and Wildlife Service are
   conducting a large-scale management experiment on 23 National Wildlife
   Refuges across the Northeast and Midwest Regions. The primary management
   objective is to provide habitat for migratory waterbirds, particularly
   during migration, using water-level manipulations in managed wetlands.
   Key uncertainties are related to the potential trade-offs created by
   management for a specific waterbird guild (e.g., migratory shorebirds)
   and the response of waterbirds, plant communities, and invertebrates to
   specific experimental hydroperiods. We reviewed the monitoring program
   associated with this study, and the ways that specific observations fill
   >= 1 of the roles identified above. We used observations from our
   monitoring to improve state-dependent decisions to control undesired
   plants, to evaluate management performance relative to shallow-water
   habitat objectives, and to evaluate potential trade-offs between
   waterfowl and shorebird habitat management. With limited staff and
   budgets, management agencies need efficient monitoring programs that are
   used for decision-making, not comprehensive studies that elucidate all
   manner of ecological relationships. (JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

Title = {A study on livelihood resilience in the small-scale fisheries of Ghana
   using a structural equation modelling approach},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {215},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Livelihood resilience is one of the social-ecological concepts with
   importance for development, policy and research as crises from
   human-environment interactions are becoming intense and widespread.
   Nevertheless, measuring livelihood resilience is a difficult task
   requiring handy and practical methods, which are missing in the
   literature. This study proposed and validated a measure to the
   three-dimensional livelihood resilience framework of buffer capacity,
   capacity for self-organization and learning in the context of Ghana's
   declining small-scale fisheries. It proposed measurement indicators to
   the three dimensions of the framework and tested its structural and
   predictive validity using simultaneous equations. The data used for the
   analysis were collected from a random sample of 1180 artisanal
   fisherfolk in three fishing communities using a semi-structured
   questionnaire. The framework is useful for livelihoods and resilience
   thinking and its three dimensions are uniquely interrelated and
   significantly explain the livelihood resilience of fisherfolks. Aside
   from the slight differences in the paths to livelihood
   resilience-building across communities observed, there were significant
   gender and community differences in the application of the framework.
   These findings suggest the usefulness of the framework for monitoring
   and evaluation of interventions aimed at building livelihood resilience
   of fisherfolks. However, the highlighted differences in its application
   across gender and community contexts need to be considered. The study
   contributes to sustainable fisheries and coastal management by providing
   insights on the pathways for enhancing livelihood resilience-reducing
   social vulnerability and promoting the adaptive capacities of fisherfolk
   to shocks. For instance, interventions towards building livelihood
   resilience could increase fisherfolk's access and ownership to capitals
   through trusted savings and lending schemes/associations and impact
   capitals (buffer capacity); institutionalization and strengthening
   traditional authority (self-organization); and framing advocacy messages
   against illegal fishing practices highlighting previous experiences of
   good fish catch under less pervasiveness of such illicit practices
   (learning).},

Title = {Coastal residential waterways, science and policy-making: The Australian
   experience},

Volume = {155},

Abstract = {Thousands of kilometres of coastal residential waterways have been
   constructed across the globe, mostly in estuaries. These have caused
   significant environmental impact demonstrating a need for proper
   management and planning informed by science. Additional potential
   impacts of climate change, specifically sea-level rise, make coastal
   residential waterway developments by their nature particularly
   vulnerable, with restricted options for adaptation. This paper analyses
   Australian policies on coastal residential waterways over the last 50
   years and the extent to which science, including estuarine and climate
   change science, has been incorporated into policy decisions or policy
   formulation. This analysis is in the context of theories on the uptake
   of science in policy-making and against a background of Australian
   government and inter-governmental reports indicating the vulnerable
   nature of low-lying coastal development. This paper reveals that coastal
   residential waterways referred to as canal estates occur in all
   Australian mainland states but given the lack of any national coastal
   policy, the onus is on each individual state to formulate its own
   policies. These policies are on a continuum from explicit, detailed
   science-based policy guidelines in some states, through implicit
   scientific impacts informing political decisions in other states, to
   generic environmental assessment procedures without specific reference
   to canal estate development. This paper concludes that the extent to
   which science has been incorporated into policy-making for canal estates
   is variable across the Australian states and appears to be heavily
   influenced by politics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the contribution of urban land use change to
   near-surface air temperature during the summer extreme heat events of
   the early twenty-first century in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan
   area. This study uses the Weather Research Forecasting model with a
   single urban canopy model and the newest actual urban cover datasets.
   The results show that urban land use characteristics that have evolved
   over the past similar to 20 years in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
   metropolitan area have had a significant impact on the extreme
   temperatures occurring during extreme heat events. Simulations show that
   new urban development has caused an intensification and expansion of the
   areas experiencing extreme heat waves with an average increase in
   temperature of approximately 0.60 A degrees C. This change is most
   obvious at night with an increase up to 0.95 A degrees C, for which the
   total contribution of anthropogenic heat is 34 \%. We also simulate the
   effects of geo-engineering strategies increasing the albedo of urban
   roofs, an effective way of reducing urban heat island, which can reduce
   the urban mean temperature by approximately 0.51 A degrees C and counter
   approximately 80 \% of the heat wave results from urban sprawl during
   the last 20 years.},

Title = {Infusing Inuit and local knowledge into the Low Impact Shipping
   Corridors: An adaptation to increased shipping activity and climate
   change in Arctic Canada},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {105},

Abstract = {Ship traffic has nearly tripled in the Canadian Arctic over the past
   decade and additional growth is expected as climate change continues to
   increase navigability in the region. In response, the Canadian
   Government is developing Low Impact Shipping Corridors as an adaptation
   strategy that supports safety and sustainability under rapidly changing
   environmental conditions. The corridors are voluntary maritime routes
   where services and infrastructure investments are prioritized. While a
   large amount of data from different sources were used to establish the
   location of the corridors, important local and Indigenous knowledge from
   Arctic communities has yet to be considered in much detail. The Arctic
   Corridors and Northern Voices (ACNV) project was established in response
   to this fundamental gap in knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to
   outline perspectives and recommendations for the corridors from 13
   Canadian Arctic communities across Inuit Nunangat (Inuit homeland) that
   were involved in the ACNV project through a series of participatory
   community mapping workshops. A summary of the recommendations for the
   corridors that emerged from communities is presented including spatial
   representations for: 1) preferred corridors, 2) areas to avoid, 3)
   restrictions by season, 4) modification of vessel operation and 5) areas
   where charting is needed. The findings of the study further reiterate
   the vital need for meaningful inclusion of northern voices in the
   development of Arctic shipping policy and governance.},

Abstract = {Beaches are economically and socially important to coastal regions. The
   intensive use of beaches requires active management to mitigate impacts
   to natural habitats and users. Understanding the patterns of beach use
   can assist in developing management actions designed to promote
   sustainable use. We assessed whether remotely piloted aerial systems
   (commonly known as drones) are an appropriate tool for quantifying beach
   use, and if beach activities are influenced by environmental conditions.
   Novel drone-based methods were used to quantify beach use. Drone flights
   recorded 2km of beach, capturing video footage of the beach from the
   dune to water interface and the breaker zone. Flights were undertaken
   during three school holiday periods at four popular beaches in New South
   Wales, Australia. These videos were later analysed in the laboratory to
   categorise beach users. Of the total users sampled, 45.0\% were
   sunbathing, 22.8\% swimming, 21.2\% walking, 10.6\% surfing, and less
   than 0.5\% were fishing. Participation in walking, surfing and fishing
   was similar throughout the sampling periods. However, sunbathing and
   swimming significantly increased during the austral spring and summer
   sampling periods. Usage patterns varied significantly among beaches, and
   during the different sampling periods, suggesting that adaptive
   management strategies targeted to specific areas are the most
   appropriate way to protect beach habitats and users. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that drones are an effective assessment tool to improve
   coastal management decisions.},

Title = {Measuring Peripherality as a Proxy for Autonomous Community Coping
   Capacity: A Case Study from Bua Province, Fiji Islands, for Improving
   Climate Change Adaptation},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Over the past thirty years, externally-driven interventions for
   climate-change adaptation in rural Pacific Island contexts have largely
   failed to be effective or sustained. One reason is that traditional
   (culturally-grounded) autonomous community coping capacity has been
   overlooked, many external agencies viewing all such communities as both
   homogenous and helpless. A community's autonomous coping capacity can be
   proxied by peripherality, a measure of the degree to which a particular
   community in archipelagic (island) countries engages with core agendas.
   In order to gauge the depth, breadth and efficacy of autonomous coping
   capacity, three indices of community peripherality were developed from
   research within thirteen communities in (peripheral-biased) Bua Province
   in Fiji. Index 1 concerns geography (travel time/cost to town), Index 2
   concerns population and employment (community size, age distribution,
   employment), and Index 3 concerns tradition and global awareness (mobile
   phones per capita, traditional/western healthcare preferences, inherent
   coping capacity, diet, water and energy security). Mapping of Indices
   1-3 allows the nature of community peripherality in Bua to be captured
   using a readily-reproducible tool for rapid assessment in similar
   contexts. It is demonstrated that an understanding of peripherality (as
   a proxy for autonomous community coping capacity) can inform the design
   of future interventions for climate-change adaptation.},

Abstract = {The broader ecosystem impacts of fishing continue to present a challenge
   to scientists and resource managers around the world. Bycatch is of
   greatest concern for marine mammals, for which fishery bycatch and
   entanglement is the number one cause of direct mortality. Climate change
   will only add to the challenge, as marine species and fishing practices
   adapt to a changing environment, creating a dynamic pattern of overlap
   between fishing and species (both target and bycatch). Economists
   suggest policy instruments for reducing bycatch that move away from
   top-down, command-and-control measures (e.g. effort reduction, time/area
   closures, gear restrictions, bycatch quotas) towards an approach that
   creates incentives to reduce bycatch (e.g. transferable bycatch
   allowances, taxes, and other measures). The advantages of this flexible,
   incentive-oriented approach are even greater in a changing and
   increasingly variable environment, as regulatory measures would have to
   be adapted constantly to keep up with climate change. Unlike the
   regulatory process, individual operators in the fishery sector can make
   adjustments to their harvesting practices as soon as the incentives for
   such changes are apparent and inputs or operations can be modified. This
   paper explores policy measures that create economic incentives not only
   to reduce marine mammal bycatch, but also to increase compliance and
   induce technological advances by fishery operators. Economists also
   suggest exploration of direct economic incentives as have been used in
   other conservation programs, such as payments for ecosystem services, in
   an approach that addresses marine mammal bycatch as part of a larger
   conservation strategy. Expanding the portfolio of mandatory and
   potentially, voluntary, measures to include novel approaches will
   provide a broader array of opportunities for successful stewardship of
   the marine environment.},

Title = {Five decades of growth in a genetic field trial of Douglas-fir reveal
   trade-offs between productivity and drought tolerance},
Journal = {TREE GENETICS \& GENOMES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {To select suitable planting stock for reforestation under uncertain
   future climates, information about tolerances of genotypes to different
   climate conditions is necessary. One useful approach is to combine
   dendrochronological research with common garden experiments to quantify
   genotype by environment interactions observed over time. Here, we assess
   the response of Douglas-fir provenances planted in a common environment
   to climate variation over five decades using tree-ring analysis and
   historic height data. A rare drought event that affected growth in the
   year of 1985 provided the opportunity to study how mature Douglas-fir
   provenances differ in resilience and resistance to drought conditions
   and whether there are trade-offs with long-term productivity. We found
   that overall growth performance of provenances originating from drier
   and colder environments within the coastal range was below average and
   correlated with interannual variation in temperature. Productive
   provenances originated primarily from moist and warm areas and their
   annual increments co-varied strongly with summer precipitation and
   summer drought indices. Further, provenances with below average growth
   were able to recover more quickly from the drought event of 1985, but
   did not show stronger drought resistance than coastal sources. Our
   results provide evidence for trade-offs between productivity and drought
   resilience and show that sources originating from moist locations are
   more dependent on favorable growing conditions in the summer. We
   conclude that selecting drought-resilient planting stock as an
   adaptation strategy for climate change is possible, but it would entail
   reductions in productivity.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather events seem to have become more frequent with climate
   change. These anomalies throughout the world may generally be
   categorized as drought, heavy rain storms, landslides, heavy snow
   storms, sea level rise, ice melts from the polar regions, tornadoes and

   areas should definitely include such plans and strategies. The purpose
   of the current work is to point to the best practices already being
   carried out in some areas, and to draw attention to some of the
   knowledge embodied in the indigenous populations in particular regions,
   which have come by this knowledge via generations of survival through
   adverse climate/ environmental changes. The integration of this
   indigenous knowledge where applicable, with modern engineering tools and

Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly affecting rural areas worldwide. The
   Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) is at particular risk due to heat stress,
   changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and more frequent and
   extreme climatic events. It is imperative that local-level adaptation
   plans are developed in a manner that builds resilience to these growing
   threats. Strategies for developing adaptation plans tend to comprise
   predominantly science-led or predominantly community-led processes. This
   study examines an approach that balances inputs from both processes in
   characterizing community vulnerability as a component of the adaptation
   planning workflow. Evaluation sites are located within four distinct
   sub-regions of the LMB: the Vietnam Mekong Delta, the Annamite Mountains
   of Lao PDR, the Cambodia central lowlands, and the mid-elevation forests
   of northern Thailand. Our results indicate that by merging science-based
   data with community-level perspective, knowledge gaps from both sides
   are filled and a more comprehensive understanding of vulnerability is
   factored into adaptation planning.},

Abstract = {The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment
   Report 4 found an average increase in global surface temperature of 0.74
   degrees C between 1906 and 2005. There is general agreement in the
   literature that the frequency of extreme precipitation events in
   Southeast Asia will increase with global warming. In particular, the
   potential impact of associated storm hazards will render the densely
   populated countries in Southeast Asia vulnerable to such changes in
   precipitation events. One main adaptation strategy given such impending
   changes is preparedness. Using existing literature and historical
   meteorological data, this paper establishes that Southeast Asia is
   indeed experiencing storms of higher intensities and more frequently.
   Two case of extreme storm event in Southeast Asia, the extreme high
   rainfall event in December 2006 in Southern Johor and Typhoon Vamei, are
   presented to consider the implications of the increased storm activities
   due to global warming. These two examples also discuss the need for
   preparedness in adapting to the impact of global warming.},

Abstract = {Estimating future sea level rise (SLR) and sea surface temperature (SST)
   is essential to implement mitigation and adaptation options within a
   sustainable development framework. This study estimates regional SLR and
   SST changes around the Korean peninsula. Two Shared Socioeconomic
   Pathways (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) scenarios and nine Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) model simulations are used to
   estimate the changes in SLR and SST. At the end of the 21st century,
   global SLR is expected to be 0.28 m (0.17-0.38 m) and 0.65 m (0.52-0.78
   m) for SSP 1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. Regional change around the
   Korean peninsula (0.25 m (0.15-0.35 m; SSP1-2.6) and 0.63 m (0.50-0.76
   m; SSP5-8.5)) is similar with global SLR. The discrepancy between global
   and regional changes is distinct in SST warming rather than SLR. For
   SSP5-8.5, SST around the Korean peninsula projects is to rise from 0.49
   degrees C to 0.59 degrees C per decade, which is larger than the global
   SST trend (0.39 degrees C per decade). Considering this, the difference
   of regional SST change is related to the local ocean current change,
   such as the Kuroshio Current. Additionally, ocean thermal expansion and
   glacier melting are major contributors to SLR, and the contribution
   rates of glacier melting increase in higher emission scenarios.},

Abstract = {Global wetland degradation and loss are occurring at a rapid rate, and
   in the United States over 50 \% of wetlands in the lower 48 states have
   been altered since European settlement. In some cases, wetlands that
   were historically transformed for agriculture are now managed as wetland
   habitat. We conducted occupancy surveys for black rails (Laterallus
   jamaicensis) in managed and unmanaged areas of coastal South Carolina.
   We modeled landscape and local variables potentially influencing black
   rail occupancy and we assessed whether these habitat associations
   indicated vulnerability following expected alterations from sea level
   rise. Black rails occupied 17 of 344 surveyed sites. Landscape factors
   had the strongest influence on black rail occupancy. Occupancy was
   associated with impounded marshes, decreasing distance to forest, and
   greater proportion of marsh landscape within a 200 m buffer. We mapped
   parameters from our top model to predict the amount of current and
   future suitable habitat under various sea level rise scenarios at Bear
   Island Wildlife Management Area, a black rail hotspot. Suitable habitat
   decreases in tidal marshes but increases in impounded areas. The current
   use of impoundments by black rails could represent a new management
   strategy for mitigating the loss of black rail habitat.},

Title = {Climate-driven variations in productivity reveal adaptive strategies in
   Iberian cork oak agroforestry systems},
Journal = {FOREST ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Background: Cork oak agroforestry systems (AFS) have been managed for
   centuries by humans to produce cork and other goods and services and
   have recently been recognised as an important reservoir for biodiversity
   improvement and conservation. However, despite having recently been
   included as a natural habitat of community-wide interest within the EU
   Habitats Directive, these systems are in a critical situation of
   decline. Among other factors, they are strongly threatened by climate
   change, the effects of which are also expected to be particularly severe
   in the Mediterranean region. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
   influence of climate variability by examining primary production
   indicators and also to analyse whether the geographical location may
   have a role in the incidence of the adverse effects of climate. Methods:
   Cork oak AFS were identified in the Forest Map of Spain and the Land use
   map of Portugal and categorized on the basis of canopy cover. Seasonal
   climate data from 2001 to 2020 were used to model relationships with
   climate predictors and proximity to the coast. Hotspot analysis was
   conducted to identify significant spatial clusters of high-and
   low-efficiency areas. Results: The responses to the influence of
   climatic conditions differed among the various cork oak AFS categories,
   particularly in the forest category, which was less dependent on climate
   variations. Relative humidity and water availability were the main
   drivers of net primary production (NPP). Carbon use efficiency (CUE) was
   limited by relative humidity and spring temperature in open ecosystems.
   Proximity to the coast proved beneficial, especially in years with
   adverse weather conditions, but was not a limiting factor for survival
   of the ecosystem. Finally, the results of the hotspot analysis supported
   the other findings, highlighting high-efficiency areas close to the
   coast and cold spots grouped in specific areas or dispersed inland.
   Conclusions: Canopy plays a key role in the influence of climatic
   conditions, particularly in forest categories in which a high density
   seems to generate microclimate conditions. Water availability, both via
   the soil and air moisture, is the main driver of primary production,
   reflecting different adaptive strategies. The oceanic atmosphere may act
   as a buffer in years of extreme drought.},

Title = {The role of estuarine macrofaunal patterns for the management of marine
   protected areas in a changing world},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {63},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The integration of biodiversity knowledge with management needs in
   coastal protected ecosystems is a current challenge that requires a
   social-ecological perspective, especially in view of the current
   scenario regarding climate changes. At the southeastern Brazil,
   estuaries inside protected areas highlight as a great source of
   ecosystem services connected to the biodiversity, such as the food
   provisioning for local communities (i.e. fishery supply). However,
   climate change models considering the last four decades alert to an
   annual rainfall increase in the region, threatening the estuarine
   biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services. Here, we evaluated
   how estuarine macrofaunal distribution could be used as ecological
   indicators to support the stakeholders management needs in subtropical
   Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The intertidal macrofauna distribution
   was assessed along physical gradients in estuaries within MPAs of the
   southeastern Brazil, testing the effects of salinity and sediment
   properties on taxa richness. Then, implications of these ecological
   findings were discussed with the local users and managers of the MPAs,
   aiming to stipulate indicators and management proposals considering the
   rainfall increase predicted for the region. We found that macrofauna
   community varied between estuarine zones along the physical gradients.
   High values of mud and organic content in the sediment were correlated
   with reduced taxa richness in the upper estuarine zone, indicating high
   vulnerability of biodiversity to a possible estuarine mud input
   connected to the expected rainfall increase. Stakeholders noted that
   this knowledge could assist with spatial planning for an adaptive
   management of the biodiversity use rules on the MPAs, with focus on the
   ecosystem services conservation (ecosystem-based management).
   Stakeholders suggested using biodiversity hotspots to guide estuarine
   areas classification (no-take zones and sustainable use zones),
   maintaining the resources use rules adaptable according to the
   biodiversity changes. In this regard, our data revealed important
   bioindicators, such as the macrofaunal richness, which can be monitored
   as ``early signals{''} to assess eventual ecosystem alterations related
   to the climate changes. These signals can include loss in taxa richness,
   extirpation of species exclusively found on the lower estuarine zone
   (sensitives to mud input) and changes in the distribution or abundance
   of dominant taxa. We suggest that understanding the relationships
   between macrofaunal indicators and ecosystems services, associated with
   continuous monitoring, are the key steps to implementing an adaptive
   ecosystem-based management of these protected estuaries in the current
   changing scenario, contributing to decision making at local scale that
   respond to global challenges, as the UN Ocean Decade.},

Abstract = {Spatially large and multiple use coastal regions face unprecedented
   pressures. Decision makers need to build policy that links social,
   economic and ecological dimensions in ways that build the adaptive
   capacity of these systems while not compromising individual values. This
   paper reports on an inter-disciplinary project that used a Capitals
   approach to build socio-economic indicators robust enough to use in
   integrated community assessments of adaptive capacity. Using the Spencer
   Gulf, South Australia as a case study, we demonstrate the utility of
   these indicators to derive quantitative assessments of socio-economic
   adaptive capacity. We argue that such assessments used at regular
   periods, in conjunction with scientific indicators, have the potential
   to be powerful management tools and provide ongoing ability to measure
   community adaptive capacity over time.},

Title = {Recent variability of sub-seasonal monsoon precipitation and its

Abstract = {The present study assessed the spatiotemporal variation of summer
   monsoon precipitation and its potential drivers in Myanmar, utilizing
   monthly precipitation data from forty-six (46) synoptic meteorological
   stations spanning 1981-2020. The nonparametric statistical Mann-Kendall
   (MK), Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test, Empirical Orthogonal Function
   (EOF), and Probability Distribution Function (PDF) were used to
   determine the spatiotemporal monsoon precipitation trends and
   variability over the study period. The results show that higher
   precipitation occurs during June, July and August (peak monsoon period),
   while low precipitation was detected in May (onset month), September and
   October (withdrawal monsoon period), respectively. Moreover, abrupt
   change in precipitation is observed after 1990 with a significant (95\%
   confidence level) increasing trend from 2000 to 2020. Decadal
   precipitation experienced the highest fluctuation during 2011-2020, a
   positive shift and increased frequency in recent decades. The spatial
   trends for monthly and seasonal precipitation vary from station to
   station and region to region due to a fluctuated shift of climatic
   dynamics. During dry conditions, less cloud liquid water suppressed
   relative humidity and high air temperature were exhibited, thus implying
   less precipitation in the region. However, the wet years revealed strong
   moisture/water vapour into the inland regions from the ocean, increased
   relative humidity, and suppressed air temperature. In addition, no
   significant relationship was found between El-Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and monsoon onset timing with
   precipitation variability over Myanmar. This study provides essential
   information on manageable climate adaptation, mitigation and weather
   forecasting strategies in Myanmar.},

Abstract = {Climate change presents a variety of doomsday scenarios for human
   society, including more extreme and frequent storms, droughts, heatwaves
   and fires, the heating and acidification of oceans, rising sea levels,
   biodiversity decline, food shortages, as well as exacerbating
   geopolitical tensions and conflicts. While many corporations and
   communities are already anticipating and planning for various climate
   impacts, we argue that much management research is in denial of the
   profound consequences of a worsening climate crisis. This is evident in
   the relative neglect of climate change in our research and teaching and
   we argue reflects how management theories legitimize the continuation of
   business as usual. We suggest that if the management academy is to
   maintain relevance in a context of worsening climate change, then we
   need to rethink the focus of our research and engage with new and
   emerging literatures and concepts that will better enable societies to
   undertake the complex processes of climate mitigation, adaptation, and
   the limitation of human suffering.},

Title = {Towards climate adaptation and coastal governance in Ireland: Integrated

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6, SI},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal environments are susceptible to a range of impacts arising from
   medium and long-term climate change. However, as Ireland's population
   and industrial centres are concentrated in coastal locations, Ireland's
   coastal communities will be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of
   climate change. Therefore, making the best use of existing knowledge to
   inform the establishment of governance structures capable of
   facilitating the measures and actions which may soon be required is a
   national imperative. Coastal communities worldwide have turned to
   integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) as a process to deliver
   sustainable development. This paper explores how experience gained from
   ICZM implementation can be harnessed to inform the development and
   implementation of climate adaptation policies, with a particular focus
   on the coastal zone. Using the principles and conceptual basis of Earth
   System Governance - an emerging approach to analyse complexity of
   governance under global environmental change - the paper maps the
   architecture of ICZM and climate governance in Ireland. The research
   identifies the main barriers to, and opportunities for, integrated
   application of the two policy domains. Barriers include the
   fragmentation of governance structures and responsibilities of key
   stakeholders, a lack of coordinated support for ICZM implementation at
   the national level, and a relatively weak awareness of the specifics of
   adaptation at the local level. Opportunities include the availability of
   expertise gathered from phases of ICZM implementation in Ireland, which
   encompasses mechanisms for science-policy integration, and invaluable
   experience of stakeholder participation and interaction. Current
   political and scientific support at national and EU levels give an
   additional impetus to climate research and actions which may bring
   additional opportunities and resources to coastal governance in Ireland.

Abstract = {Food security on Malo Island in Vanuatu is examined. All trade between
   Malo and the outside world passes through a beach on the neighboring
   island. Data collected there, and on Malo itself, during a long period
   of fieldwork in 1997-with a short follow-up in 2007-are used to describe
   the island's food system qualitatively and in terms of energy
   availability. The data indicate that 20 \% of calories come from food
   imports, which could be easily substituted with surplus subsistence
   production in most years. The food system is then analyzed in terms of
   food security, with consideration given to past and present food systems
   in the context of economic and climatic variability. The contemporary
   food system is found to be not only resilient, but far more so than that
   which existed prior to the commencement of sustained contact with
   Europeans from around the turn of the twentieth century. While there is
   some localized pressure on land caused by the dual drivers of population
   growth and extensive cash cropping, Malo people have been finding
   innovative solutions that have adapted ``traditional{''} practices and
   institutions. These findings demonstrate that not all Pacific Islands
   fit the portrayal of the Pacific as an undifferentiated region
   characterized by vulnerability and food insecurity. They also
   demonstrate the importance of social resilience, in this case the
   adaptive capacity of traditional practices and institutions, to the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems. The article concludes with
   reflections on the policy and ethical challenges posed by the ``Pacific
   food insecurity narrative.{''}.},

Title = {Impact of climate change on groundwater hydrology: a comprehensive
   review and current status of the Indian hydrogeology},
Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Groundwater is the second largest store of freshwater in the world. The
   sustainability of the ecosystem is largely dependent on groundwater
   availability, and groundwater has already been under tremendous pressure
   to fulfill human needs owing to anthropogenic activities around various
   parts of the world. The footprints of human activities can be witnessed
   in terms of looming climate change, water pollution, and changes in
   available water resources. This paper provides a comprehensive view of
   the linkage between groundwater, climate system, and anthropogenic
   activities, with a focus on the Indian region. The significant prior
   works addressing the groundwater-induced response on the climatic system
   and the impacts of climate on groundwater through natural and
   human-instigated processes are reviewed. The condition of groundwater
   quality in India with respect to various physicochemical, heavy metal
   and biological contamination is discussed. The utility of remote sensing
   and GIS in groundwater-related studies is discussed, focusing on Gravity
   Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) applications over the Indian
   region. GRACE-based estimates of terrestrial water storage have been
   instrumental in numerous groundwater studies in recent times. Based on
   the literature review, the sustainable practices adopted for optimum
   utilization of groundwater for different purposes and the possible
   groundwater-based adaptation strategies for climate change are also
   enunciated.},

Abstract = {Adapting to climate change and sea level rise is challenging on small
   islands. False adaptation can lead to adverse impacts on natural and
   societal dynamics. Therefore, an interdisciplinary perspective on the
   interaction of natural dynamics, societal demands, and political
   decisions is crucial. In this sense, this study scrutinizes coastal
   processes and socio-political dimensions of erosion on the reef island
   Fuvahmulah, the Maldives. The national government and Fuvahmulah's
   population have an opposed perception and attribution of the drivers and
   processes behind Fuvahmulah's most pressing coastal issue - coastal
   erosion. To review these perceptions, natural dynamics are recreated
   with process-based methods and discussed regarding present and projected
   marine pressures. Population surveys and interviews with actors in
   coastal development complement the physical insights into erosion on
   Fuvahmulah and describe the socio-political dimension of climate change
   adaptation on small islands. This interdisciplinary approach
   demonstrates how small-islands' adaptive capacities are typically
   impaired and disclose the potential of local knowledge to overcome
   maldevelopment.
   Climate change adaptation and sea level rise pose challenges for both
   natural and societal dynamics. Here the authors analyse coastal
   processes and socio-political dimensions of erosion, leading to
   maldevelopment on Fuvahmulah in the Maldives.},

Title = {Learning from Floods-How a Community Develops Future Resilience},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Settlements close to rivers, the sea, and hills are among those most
   vulnerable to floods. The hilly terrain region experiences higher
   rainfall than the lowlands due to the orographic effect. As a result,
   excessive rains feeding major rivers cause a rapid rise in water level
   resulting in frequent breaks of the riverbanks. The flood hence covers
   the inhabited lowlands with water and silt, causing loss of lives and
   properties. The affected communities need practical coping alternatives
   to deal with the intensity and the increasing exposure to floods. The
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG6) identify the sustainable management
   of water and sanitation as one of their key objectives. This study
   identifies resilience in practice focusing on how communities create
   resilience and develop sustainable river catchment management. A
   qualitative method was used, involving observations, interviews, and
   community surveys with one of the most flood-prone populations, the New
   Zealand Northland community. A desktop study containing government
   publications and flood records compliments the thematic analysis result
   and strengthens the discussions. Social connections, participation in
   self-protection training, and maintaining the catchment were among the
   main findings of the study. This study recommends for community-led
   response plans integrated with infrastructure improvements and
   collaboration with councils to reduce the risk of future floods.},

Abstract = {Most salt marshes in the USA have been degraded by human activities, and
   coastal managers are faced with complex choices among possible actions
   to restore or enhance ecosystem integrity. We applied structured
   decision making (SDM) to guide selection of monitoring variables and
   management priorities for salt marshes within the National Wildlife
   Refuge System in the northeastern USA. In general, SDM is a systematic
   process for decomposing a decision into its essential elements. We first
   engaged stakeholders in clarifying regional salt marsh decision
   problems, defining objectives and attributes to evaluate whether
   objectives are achieved, and developing a pool of alternative management
   actions for achieving objectives. Through this process, we identified
   salt marsh attributes that were applicable to monitoring National
   Wildlife Refuges on a regional scale and that targeted management needs.
   We then analyzed management decisions within three salt marsh units at
   Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, coastal Delaware, as a case example
   of prioritizing management alternatives. Values for salt marsh
   attributes were estimated from 2 years of baseline monitoring data and
   expert opinion. We used linear value modeling to aggregate multiple
   attributes into a single performance score for each alternative,
   constrained optimization to identify alternatives that maximized total
   management benefits subject to refuge-wide cost constraints, and used
   graphical analysis to identify the optimal set of alternatives for the
   refuge. SDM offers an efficient, transparent approach for integrating
   monitoring into management practice and improving the quality of
   management decisions.},

Title = {Mangrove Trace Metal Biogeochemistry Response to Global Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {This review discusses observed impacts from different climate
   change-driven pressures on mangrove's role in modulating trace metal
   transfer at the land-ocean interface. It contributes to the literature
   in a global context and shows mangroves as mitigators or providing
   positive feedback to metal mobilization. Most chalcophile metals(2+)
   accumulate in mangrove soils associated with sulfides while high
   sedimentation rates avoid their oxidation. Exudation of oxygen by roots
   fixates Fe, which co-precipitates metals as oxyhydroxides in the
   rhizosphere. These two biogeochemical processes reduce trace metal
   availability to plants and their mobility within estuaries. However,
   climate change-driven pressures alter this geochemical equilibrium.
   Increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature, and the intensity and
   frequency of extreme climatic events, have proved to affect mangrove
   functioning and cover, but no direct observation on the impact on metal
   biogeochemistry is presently available, whereas sea level rise and
   saline intrusion impacts on the fate of metals have already been
   observed. Sea level rise increases erosion, that dissociates deposited
   sulfides releasing metals to the water column. Released metals adsorb
   onto suspended particles and can re-deposit in the estuary or are
   exported to continental shelf sediments. Saline intrusion may oxidize
   deeper sediment layers releasing metals to porewaters. Part of the
   mobilized metals may remain in solution complexed with DOM and have
   their bioavailability increased, as shown by high bioaccumulation
   factors and biomagnification and high metal concentrations in the
   estuarine biota, which results in higher human exposure through
   fisheries consumption. Since erosion occurs preferentially at the sea
   border and higher sedimentation at the higher reaches of the estuary,
   triggering mangroves migration landward, spatial gradients are formed,
   and shall be taken into consideration when planning mitigation or
   adaptation strategies. These observations suggest disruption of
   traditional humans dwelling in mangrove dominated coastlines by
   increasing contamination of coastal fisheries, often the principal
   protein source for those groups and an important source of income.
   Further research into the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of
   climate change driven alterations to metal biogeochemical processes in
   mangroves as contaminant levels are expected to increase.},

Title = {Sea level rise under climate change: Implications for beach tourism in
   the Caribbean},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Sandy beaches play a significant role in the Caribbean tourism industry,
   which markets an attractive sea-sand-sun product, but are potentially
   threatened by climate-change-induced sea level rise. In this study, we
   quantify the impact of climate change on sandy beaches and beach tourism
   losses in the region. To this end, we assemble exhaustive data on sandy
   shorelines, beach erosion and hotel rooms for 30 Caribbean islands.
   Under a low CO2 emissions pathway (RCP4.5), we predict an average 53\%
   loss in sandy beaches, resulting in a 30\% hotel room loss and thus a
   38\% tourism revenue decrease by 2100. In contrast, under a higher
   emissions path (RCP8.5), sea level rise will cause 59\% and 39\%
   reductions in beach and hotel rooms, respectively. Sea level rise will
   also cause a 47\% reduction in direct tourism revenue which is only one
   aspect of beach erosion costs. Notably, however, there is considerable
   impact heterogeneity across islands. We also estimate that beach
   nourishment may be an affordable adaptation strategy, constituting
   0.87\% and 1.1\% of annual tourism revenue. Our results underscore the
   need for the development coastal management practices to protect the
   future of Caribbean economies and their tourism sectors.},

   Green and Grey Infrastructure for Flood Protection in a Cultural Setting},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The present paper describes a methodological framework that combines
   ecosystem services (flood protection, education, art/culture, recreation
   and tourism) with economic analysis for selection of multifunctional
   measures for flood resilience. The framework includes active stakeholder
   participation and it consists of the four main components: (1)
   identification and valuation of ecosystem services pertinent to the
   project site under various mitigation scenarios, including baseline
   (pre-mitigation conditions); (2) evaluation of most effective flood
   mitigation measures through hydrodynamic simulations, and evaluation of
   economic viability using cost-benefit analysis; (3) selection of
   measures through consideration of ecosystem services, and solicitation
   of stakeholders' inputs; (4) development of the conceptual landscape
   design. Application of the framework was demonstrated in a case study of
   Ayutthaya Island, Thailand. Results of our research suggest that taking
   a holistic perspective of ecosystem services and economic assessments,
   marshalled through active stakeholder participation, has the potential
   to achieve more ecologically sustainable and socially acceptable
   solutions for flood protection in areas with cultural heritage. However,
   there is still a considerable challenge in taking this framework to a
   full-scale practical implementation, and this mainly relates to the
   selection of indicators that can enable proper application of ecosystem
   services.},

Abstract = {The global demand for food and bioenergy changes associated with land
   use and land cover change (LULCC) has raised concerns about the
   environment, global warming, and climate change. There is enough
   evidence that we are passing through human-induced changes which may
   lead to sixth mass extinction. Information of spatial representation of
   land use and land cover and its dynamics of landscape pattern and
   habitat organisation are vital for developing land use policy, adapting,
   and mitigating climate change impacts and nature-based solutions,
   including proposing areas for conservation. Spatial data is also a
   leading way of providing geographically linked or located data with the
   help of remote sensing (including drones), geographical information
   systems, Global Positioning Systems, and real-time in situ measurements.
   This article attempts to critically review the current research on the
   congruence of LULCC with climate and its processes. The article
   discusses current research on LULCC, its environmental consequences, and
   its impact on regulatory systems of the terrestrial biosphere, ecosystem
   services, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. Finally, it emphasises the
   need to evolve land use policy based on scientific analysis of LULCC to
   achieve sustainability goals and overall socioeconomic development with
   a special focus on climate change. The commitments of international
   agreements and protocols also require land use policy which accounts for
   concerns of climate change.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses novel challenges for cities, threatening long-term
   sustainability objectives and necessitating investments in resilience.
   Climate change exacerbates the challenge of identifying the range of
   impacts of natural hazards in terms of scale and frequency. This study
   focuses on climate change adaptation responses with regard to flood
   management in the Metro Vancouver regional area, which is the last large
   non-amalgamated region in Canada. It is comprised of 24 local
   authorities and a regional government with delegated and distributed
   authority for flood management and other responsibilities. The area is
   subject to river flooding, intense rain storms and an increasing rate of
   sea level rise. The study identifies mechanisms by which the
   municipalities make sense of the existing hazards as well as how they
   design and invest into responses for future risks under conditions of
   uncertainty. Given the geographic, demographic and socio-economic
   differences across municipalities in the region, the study found a
   diverse set of responses in planning regimes in regard to the long-term
   risks as well as the short-term political pressures that municipalities
   face. This resulted in a significant variability of planning policies
   and practices across the region, which could potentially reduce overall
   regional ability to adapt to change. The paper concludes with a
   discussion of measures that can be taken to strengthen the regional
   coordination process.},

Title = {Evidence of climate-driven regime shifts in the Aegean Sea's demersal

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change (CC) can alter the configuration of marine ecosystems;
   however, ecosystem response and resilience to change are usually
   case-specific. The effect of CC on the demersal resources of the Aegean
   Sea (east Mediterranean Sea) was investigated during the past six
   decades applying a combination of multivariate analysis, non-additive
   modeling and the Integrated Resilience Assessment (IRA) framework. We
   focused on the study of: (i) the biological ``system{''} complex, using
   proxies of biomass (landings per unit of capacity) for 12 demersal taxa,
   and (ii) the environmental ``stressor{''} complex, described by 12
   abiotic variables. Pronounced changes have occurred in both the
   environmental and biological system over the studied period. The
   majority of the environmental stressors exhibited strikingly increasing
   trends (temperature, salinity, primary production indices) with values
   started exceeding the global historical means during late 1980s-early
   1990s. It is suggested that the biological system exhibited a
   discontinuous response to CC, with two apparently climate-induced regime
   shifts occurring in the past 25 years. There is evidence for two-fold
   bifurcations and four tipping points in the system, forming a folded
   stability landscape with three basins of attraction. The shape of the
   stability landscape for the Aegean Sea's biological system suggests that
   while the initial state (1966-1991) was rather resilient to CC,
   absorbing two environmental step-changes, this was not the case for the
   two subsequent ones (intermediate: 1992-2002; recent: 2003-2016). Given
   the current trajectory of environmental change, it is highly unlikely
   that the biological system will ever return to its pre-1990s state, as
   it is entering areas of unprecedented climatic conditions and there is
   some evidence that the system may be even shifting toward a new state.
   Our approach and findings may be relevant to other marine areas of the
   Mediterranean and beyond, undergoing climate-driven regime shifts, and
   can assist to their adaptive management.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {287-293},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In response to global climate change, managed retreat has emerged as a
   controversial adaptation strategy. The purposeful movement of people and
   communities away from hazardous places raises numerous social and
   environmental justice concerns that will become even more pressing as
   retreat occurs more frequently and at larger scales. This special issue
   contributes to an emerging body of literature on managed retreat by
   providing a range of perspectives and approaches to considering justice
   in managed retreat. The assembled papers represent diverse voices
   (including perspectives from individuals whose communities are currently
   relocating or considering relocation), disciplines (including oral
   histories, legal analyses, and cultural heritage considerations), and
   lenses through which to consider the justice implications of managed
   retreat. They describe completed, in-progress, and foiled relocations.
   They suggest opportunities for improvement through improved evaluations
   and broader collaborations. While each presents a unique lens, key
   themes emerge around the need for transparent and equitable policies,
   self-determination of communities, holistic metrics for assessing
   individual and community well-being, the importance of culture both as
   something to be protected and an asset to be leveraged, and the need to
   address historical and systemic injustices that contribute to
   vulnerability and exposure to risk.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change is imposing substantial consequences across physical and
   social infrastructures. The extent of social disruption and risk to
   human health are, however, potentially much broader than these general
   consequences, taken individually, would suggest. To address this gap, we
   assess the distribution of contaminated sites in the United States (US)
   and then estimate the impact that flood hazards in urban areas will have
   on these contaminated sites. Using these measures, we draw inferences
   about the risk of contamination from climate impacted extreme weather
   events, climate adaptation at the local level, social risk and how it is
   distributed, and a broader understanding of the potential global
   consequences of climate change. In this paper we address three critical
   points: 1) the role classification of contaminated sites on our
   understanding of risk due to climate change; 2) the relationship between
   contaminated sites and flood risk; and 3) the potential for climate
   adaption strategies to mediate this risk. We estimate that of the
   roughly one-third of the US population living in urban areas, up to
   3,338,518 people, are living in high-risk flood zones near contaminated
   sites. Our results suggest severe potential implications for estimates
   of the negative consequences from climate change and contamination and
   provide critical insights into the relationship between climate change
   and the built environment for urban planners and environmental policy
   makers and managers alike.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {581-593},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The idea that integration and synthesis are critical for designing
   climate change adaptation and mitigation is well entrenched
   conceptually. Here, we review the concepts of adaptation, synthesis and
   integration and apply them to the case study of coastal wetlands in
   South East Queensland, Australia. The distribution and condition of
   coastal wetlands will change as climate changes. This will create
   conservation challenges and economic costs, but these can be minimised
   by drawing from a broad sectoral perspective in undertaking adaptation
   planning and by ensuring integration into policy. Our review indicates
   that adaptations to sea level rise that are focussed on wetland and
   biodiversity conservation are likely to have impacts for urbanisation
   patterns. Planning regulations that provide spatial buffering around
   wetlands may give rise to more compact urban forms that may lead to
   reductions in the cost of defence against sea level rise, reduce energy
   usage per person and provide more green space. However, more compact
   urban forms could exacerbate heat island effects and place greater
   burden on the economically disadvantaged as, for example, single-family
   homes become more expensive. Planning for climate change needs to
   balance these equity and cross-sectoral issues in order to reduce the
   likelihood of unforeseen negative consequences.},

Title = {The role of knowledge and power in climate change adaptation governance:
   a systematic literature review},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The long-term character of climate change and the high costs of
   adaptation measures, in combination with their uncertain effects, turn
   climate adaptation governance into a torturous process. We
   systematically review the literature on climate adaptation governance to
   analyze the scholarly understanding of these complexities. Building on
   governance literature about long-term and complex policy problems, we
   develop a conceptual matrix based on the dimensions knowledge and power
   to systematically study the peer-reviewed literature on climate
   adaptation governance. We find that about a quarter of the reviewed
   journal articles do not address the knowledge or power dimension of the
   governance of climate change adaptation, about half of the articles
   discuss either the knowledge or the power dimension, and another quarter
   discuss both knowledge and power. The articles that do address both
   knowledge and power (1) conceptualize the governance of climate
   adaptation mainly as a complex system of regulatory frameworks and
   technical knowledge, (2) assume that regulatory systems can be easily
   adapted to new knowledge, (3) pay little attention to fluid or
   unorganized forms of power, e. g., negotiation, and knowledge, e. g.,
   learning, and (4) largely neglect the interplay between the two. We
   argue that more research on this interplay is needed, and we discuss how
   puzzling and powering are a promising pair of concepts to study this.},

Pages = {125-138},
Abstract = {We live in a rapidly advancing digital information age where the ability
   to discover, access and utilize high-quality information in a reliable
   and timely manner is often assumed to be the norm. However, this is not
   always the experience of researchers, practitioners and decision makers
   responding to the challenges of a rapidly changing climate, despite the
   billions now being made available for investment in climate change
   adaptation initiatives throughout the world and particularly in
   developing countries. In recognition of the importance of information in
   adaptation planning, Article 7.7 of the Paris Agreement sets out clear
   guidance for parties to develop, share, manage and deliver climate
   change knowledge, information and data as a means to strengthening
   cooperation and action on adaptation. This article provides some key
   lessons and insights on climate change information and knowledge
   management (IKM) in small island developing States (SIDS) from the
   perspective of Pacific SIDS. A situation analysis of current climate
   change IKM practices in Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu was conducted and key
   barriers to effective climate change IKM identified. The outcome of this
   article is a range of pragmatic policy considerations for overcoming
   common barriers to climate change IKM in the Pacific, which may be of
   value to SIDS more widely.Key policy insights The partnership approach
   of co-investigating climate change IKM barriers in collaboration with
   Pacific SIDS generated considerable trust, a shared purpose and
   therefore rich IKM lessons and insights.Turning climate change IKM
   aspirations into practice is significantly more complicated than
   expected, and requires a long-term commitment from both national
   governments and development partners.Pacific SIDS need to establish
   national guiding climate change IKM Frameworks that leverage rather than
   duplicate growing national investments in whole-of-government
   IKM.Reframing climate change IKM in the Pacific towards demand and user
   needs will be critical to ensuring widespread ownership and
   participation in IKM solutions that lead to greater adaptation and
   resilience outcomes.It is also critical that IKM activities in SIDS
   support the development of national capacity to scope, develop, deploy
   and maintain decision support systems.Federated IKM systems are ideal
   for encouraging greater IKM collaboration.},

Title = {Mental models of sea-level change: A mixed methods analysis on the
   Severn Estuary, UK},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {71-82},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Global average sea levels are expected to rise by up to a metre by the
   end of the century. This long-term rise will combine with shorter-term
   changes in sea level (e.g. high tides, storm surges) to increase risks
   of flooding and erosion in vulnerable coastal areas. As communities
   become increasingly exposed to these risks, understanding their beliefs
   and responses becomes more important. While studies have explored public
   responses to climate change, less research has focused on perceptions of
   the specific risks associated with sea-level change. This paper presents
   the results of a mental models study that addressed this knowledge gap
   by exploring expert and public perceptions of sea-level change on the
   Severn Estuary, a threatened coastal environment in the southwest of the
   United Kingdom. A model was developed from the literature and expert
   interviews (N = 11), and compared with public perceptions elicited via
   interviews (N = 20) and a quantitative survey (N = 359). Whilst we find
   a high degree of consistency between expert and public understandings,
   there are important differences that have implications for how sea level
   risks are interpreted and for what are perceived as appropriate
   mitigation and adaptation practices. We also find a number of potential
   barriers to engaging with the issue: individuals express low concern
   about sea-level change in relation to other matters; they feel detached
   from the issue, seeing it as something that will happen in future to
   other people; and many perceive that neither the causes of nor responses
   to sea-level change are their responsibility. We point to areas upon
   which future risk communications should therefore concentrate. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Coastal retreat is a non-recoverable phenomenon that-together with a
   relevant proneness to landslides-has economic, social and environmental
   impacts. Quantitative data on geological and geomorphologic features of
   such areas can help to predict and quantify the phenomena and to propose
   mitigation measures to reduce their impact. Coastal areas are often
   inaccessible for sampling and in situ surveys, in particular where
   steeply sloping cliffs are present. Uses and capability of infrared
   thermography (IRT) were reviewed, highlighting its suitability in
   geological and landslides hazard applications. Thanks to the high
   resolution of the cameras on the market, unmanned aerial vehicle-based
   IRT allows to acquire large amounts of data from inaccessible steep
   cliffs. Coupled structure-from-motion photogrammetry and coregistration
   of data can improve accuracy of IRT data. According to the strengths
   recognized in the reviewed literature, a three-step methodological
   approach to produce IRTs was proposed.},

Title = {Alkanes increase the stability of early life membrane models under
   extreme pressure and temperature conditions},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {Terrestrial life appeared on our planet within a time window of
   {[}4.4-3.5] billion years ago. During that time, it is suggested that
   the first proto-cellular forms developed in the surrounding of deep-sea
   hydrothermal vents, oceanic crust fractures that are still present
   nowadays. However, these environments are characterized by extreme
   temperature and pressure conditions that question the early membrane
   compartment's capability to endure a stable structural state. Recent
   studies proposed an adaptive strategy employed by present-day
   extremophiles: the use of apolar molecules as structural membrane
   components in order to tune the bilayer dynamic response when needed.
   Here we extend this hypothesis on early life protomembrane models, using
   linear and branched alkanes as apolar stabilizing molecules of prebiotic
   relevance. The structural ordering and chain dynamics of these systems
   have been investigated as a function of temperature and pressure. We
   found that both types of alkanes studied, even the simplest linear ones,
   impact highly the multilamellar vesicle ordering and chain dynamics. Our
   data show that alkane-enriched membranes have a lower multilamellar
   vesicle swelling induced by the temperature increase and are
   significantly less affected by pressure variation as compared to
   alkane-free samples, suggesting a possible survival strategy for the
   first living forms. Fatty acid membranes are implicated in several
   hypotheses about the origins of life, but whether their stability
   towards extremes of temperature, pressure, and ionic strength is
   sufficient to enable primitive biochemistry remains unclear. Here
   branched and linear alkanes are shown to stabilise a common model
   primordial membrane towards high temperatures and pressures},

Volume = {101},
Number = {2},
Pages = {595-630},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events due to climate change and growing economic and
   development activities along coastlines have resulted in increased risks
   from natural and human-induced disasters-affecting the safety and
   livelihoods of coastal communities. Assessing community resilience to
   disasters is, therefore, an essential step toward mitigating their
   current and future risks. This study provides a systematic review of
   coastal community resilience frameworks for disaster risk management,
   covering their content, structure, and assessment. Sixty-four critical
   resilience criteria under four dimensions are identified by analyzing
   the convergence and divergence of the consideration of assessment
   indicators in the reviewed frameworks. Existing frameworks focus mostly
   on `governance and institutions,' `infrastructure,' and `society and the
   economy.' Despite significant risks, the impacts on the environment and
   potential risks of climate change are not prioritized. Only 22\% of the
   frameworks consider future risks, rendering the remainder inadequate for
   assessing projected risks from climate change. None of the frameworks
   consulted the full spectrum of stakeholders (public, government, and
   experts) during the development process, which compromised their
   applicability, acceptability, and effectiveness. 56\% of the frameworks
   considered a single hazard type. Community resilience is inherently
   multi-dimensional. Therefore, the interrelationships between multiple
   hazards should be adequately addressed in future frameworks.},

Title = {Human-driven atoll island expansion in the Maldives},
Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study assesses the evolution of 104 inhabited and 82 resort islands
   across the Maldives between 2004-2006 and 2014-2016 and investigates the
   contribution of human drivers. Using multi-date satellite imagery, we
   show that 59.1 \% of these islands expanded as a result of human
   intervention, including mainly land reclamation (often associated with
   harbor development) and the construction of engineering structures. Land
   reclamation drove island expansion on 93.5 \% of inhabited islands,
   whereas land reclamation and/or the effects of engineered structures
   (especially groins and breakwaters) were involved in 79.2 \% of the
   resort islands. Almost 52 \% of the islands that increased in size
   experienced growth rates >= 10 \%, with 13 inhabited and 6 resort
   islands exhibiting growth rates >= 50 \%. As a result of widespread
   human intervention, these islands behave very differently from both the
   documented Pacific islands and the Maldivian islands of Gaafu-Alifu
   Dhaalu Atoll (most of which are `natural'), 15.5 \% and 19.5 \% of which
   underwent expansion over the past decades, respectively. Changes on the
   islands were driven by political-institutional (one-size-fits-all risk
   reduction policy based on hard engineering in inhabited islands),
   demographic (population growth) and socioeconomic (developing and
   securing outer inhabited islands and post-tsunami tourism growth)
   factors. The Maldivian island model of `reclamationfortification' has
   detrimental impacts on the environment while also questioning the future
   capacity of the Maldives to face a hard path under increasing risks.
   Results from the Maldives more broadly offer lessons for other island
   countries and territories by highlighting the importance of
   distinguishing between inhabited and exploited and natural islands, and
   accounting for path dependencies, when designing adaptation solutions.

Title = {The climate sensitive zone along an altitudinal gradient in central
   Himalayan rivers: a useful concept to monitor climate change impacts in
   mountain regions},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {132},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Highland freshwater ecosystems respond rapidly to changing climatic
   conditions making the biota of mountain streams and rivers particularly
   vulnerable to climate change. Lack of data and concepts to monitor and
   manage the potential effects of climate change on freshwater biota is
   particularly evident in developing countries. Many of the highest and
   longest mountain systems are found in these regions and provide
   fundamental water-based services to these countries. The climate
   sensitive zone (CSZ) concept is based upon changes in community
   composition along altitudinal gradients that serve as a proxy for
   climatic gradients. The CSZ characterizes a community of climatically
   sensitive biota that is likely to react quickly to climate change. We
   present a framework on how the CSZ can be adapted to and implemented in
   streams, and demonstrate its applicability for central Himalayan streams
   of Nepal. We sampled and analyzed benthic invertebrate communities of 58
   central Himalayan streams along altitudinal gradients from 1500 to 4500
   m asl. A generalized linear model identified altitude as the only
   significant, albeit indirect, variable explaining benthic invertebrate
   composition. We applied species turnover scores and threshold indicator
   taxon analysis (TITAN) to identify the CSZ in central Himalayan streams
   along the extensive altitudinal gradients. An altitudinal band between
   2900 and 3500 m was identified as CSZ and was characterized by 33
   indicator taxa. Identifying CSZs in streams can help prioritize
   resources for monitoring climate change impacts in running waters and
   help pinpoint stream reaches suitable for testing the efficacy of
   climate change-directed mitigation practices.},

Title = {Competition and tree age modulated last century pine growth responses to
   high frequency of dry years in a water limited forest ecosystem},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {192},
Pages = {18-26},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Likely tree growth responses to climate change remain a controversial
   issue, in part because these responses may differ across biomes and
   forest communities. In the Mediterranean basin one of the most
   vulnerable regions according to climatic change scenarios there are
   experimental and modelling evidences of both positive and negative tree
   growth responses to warming temperatures: i.e. warmer temperatures can
   be positive for tree growth whenever a higher evapotranspirational
   demand does not imply a significant stress due to water scarcity. In
   this study we examine the relationship between last century drought
   events and growth patterns in inland-dune managed pinelands in the
   Iberian Peninsula. We used decadal growth measurements recorded in
   harvested trees belonging to a chronosequence of managed forest stands
   along the XX century. As relevant climatic predictors we considered mean
   temperature, mean precipitation and three indices based on the
   Standardized Precipitation and Evapo-transpiration Index (SPEI) (i.e.
   mean water balance, frequency of dry years and the most severe drought
   event in the decade). Results support that the final outcome of climate
   change on forest productivity would critically depend more on unusual
   frequency of dry years than on mean temperature, precipitation or water
   balance. However this pattern can greatly vary with population-level
   structural factors such as population age distribution and competition,
   i.e. negative impacts of increasing drought frequency are
   disproportionally higher in younger trees under high competition. These
   results suggest two adaptive measures to concomitant climatic changes;
   (i) lengthening the rotation period to enhance forest resistance to
   drought due to lower vulnerability of older trees and, (ii) promoting
   stand heterogeneity (i.e. size and age unevenness) with a gradient in
   shade conditions to decrease competition and increase recruitment
   opportunities during benign periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Oceanic islands and climate: using a multi-criteria model of drivers of
   change to select key conservation areas in Galapagos},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The unique marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the Galapagos Islands
   are highly vulnerable to human-based drivers of change, including the
   introduction of invasive species, unsustainable tourism, illegal
   fishing, overexploitation of ecosystem services, and climate change.
   These drivers can interact with climate-based drivers such as El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at multiple temporal and spatial
   scales, exacerbating their negative impacts on already fragile
   ecosystems and the socioeconomic system of the Archipelago. In this
   review, we performed a literature review based on published literature
   from 1945 to 2020 and local and global climate databases to analyze
   drivers of change in the Galapagos. We developed and applied a spatial
   impact assessment model to identify high-ecological value areas with
   high sensitivity and exposure scores to environmental change drivers. We
   identified 13 priority HEVA that encompass ca. 23\% (14,715 km(2)) of
   the Galapagos Archipelago, distributed in nearly 3\% of the Galapagos
   Marine Reserve and 20\% Galapagos National Park. Current and future
   impacts are likely to concentrate on the inhabited islands' highlands,
   whereas marine impacts concentrate along most of the Galapagos Islands'
   shorelines. These results are important for guiding the design and
   implementation of adaptation measures aimed at increasing ecosystem
   resilience and human adaptive capacity in the face of global
   environmental change. Overall, these results will be valuable in their
   application for preserving Galapagos biota, securing the provision of
   vital ecosystem services for resident human populations, and sustaining
   the nature-based tourism industry.},

Title = {Evaluation and application of a low-cost measurement network to study
   intra-urban temperature differences during summer 2018 in Bern,
   Switzerland},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The understanding of intra-urban air temperature variations is crucial
   to assess strategies for cities' adaptation to impacts of present and
   future anthropogenic climate change. Depending on extensive measurement
   networks, high-resolution air temperature measurements in urban
   environments are challenging due to high instrumentation and maintenance
   costs. Here, we present a low-cost measurement device (LCD) consisting
   of a temperature logger and a custom-made, naturally ventilated
   radiation shield. Besides intercomparisons with automated weather
   stations (AWS) at three reference sites during record-dry summer 2018,
   we tested the potential of the devices using a network of 79 LCDs to
   assess the intra-urban variability of urban heat island (UHI) patterns
   in the city of Bern, Switzerland. We found positive mean measurement
   biases between LCDs and AWS of 0.61 to 0.93 K (RMSE: 0.78 to 1.17 K)
   during daytime, of which up to 82.8\% of the variance could be explained
   statistically by solar irradiance (radiative heating) and wind speed
   (insufficient ventilation). During night, average measurement biases
   were markedly lower and eventually negative with -0.12 to 0.23 K (RMSE:
   0.19 to 0.34 K). Our results highlight the importance of sensor
   intercomparisons being conducted at multiple locations with differing
   urban land-cover, structure, and metabolism given that biases varied
   considerably between the reference sites. Data retrieved by the
   city-wide measurement network showed that the LCD approach is well
   suited for the analysis of spatiotemporal UHI patterns during night and
   adds considerable value compared to the few existing AWS in detecting
   fine-scale air temperature variability. In conclusion, the current LCD
   measurement approach represents a valuable option for cost-effective
   analyses of urban air temperature variability across multiple scales,
   which may be of particular value for the development, appliance, and
   monitoring of adaptation strategies to climate change in cities with
   restricted financial resources.},

Abstract = {Changes in fish distribution and migration patterns have occurred in
   mid- and high-latitude oceans worldwide in response to global change.
   Since the 1980s, the sea surface temperature (SST) of the Sea of Japan
   has increased significantly. The mechanisms behind these changes in
   migratory fish assemblages are difficult to determine from general
   capture fishery databases. This study collected a long-term dataset of
   set-net catches reported from Toyama Bay in western Japan to analyse
   catch compositions. The results indicated that in the coastal zone at
   the front of the Tsushima warm current and Liman cold current, increased
   SSTs have caused fluctuations both in the presence of cold-water and
   warm-water fish and in the timing of fishing seasons. Additionally, the
   results based on multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analyses showed
   that the study period can be divided into 5 clusters: (1) 1963-1964, (2)
   1966-1972, (3) 1973-1998, (4) 1999-2006, and (5) 2007-2013; the
   similarity value was 89\%. The boundaries between these clusters were
   similar to the timing of changes in SST, Pacific decadal oscillation,
   and North Pacific gyre oscillation. A species composition change
   analysis of these clusters showed that clustering was associated with
   changes in the intensities of the Tsushima warm current and Liman cold
   current. A northward expansion of low-latitude fish species, especially
   small- and medium-sized fish, was observed in Toyama Bay, similar to the
   expansion of high-latitude fish species into polar regions. Based on the
   principles of risk management and these research results, the adaptation
   strategies recommended in this study were differentiated into two
   categories: proactive adaptation and planned adaptation. (1)
   Establishment of pre-disaster adaptation capability: Proactive
   adaptation emphasizes countering the uncertainty in marine fishery
   production and improving the resilience of local communities. (2)
   Establishment of resilience during and after climate disasters: Planned
   adaptation can be used to manage uncertainty in the seafood supply by
   implementing adjustments in production and marketing and also to
   mitigate the impact of climate variation on the marine fishery industry
   and local coastal communities.},

Abstract = {The urban heat island effect for the coastal Mediterranean city of
   Kalamata is studied, for June to September during two consecutive years,
   2019-2020. Temperature data were gathered by fixed temperature stations,
   placed in representative locations, covering all the major areas (urban,
   suburban, and rural). Results showed that the urban area is warmer than
   suburban and rural ones. The maximum heat island intensity was also
   estimated, usually achieved during nighttime and early in the morning.
   As there are no such data for Kalamata, this work helps to identify
   issues of energy consumption and human comfort. Especially for small
   Mediterranean cities, the work could be useful for a researcher to
   clarify the UHI Intensity. Detailed data are presented in the work, both
   for the clarification of UHI and its intensity and for the
   characteristics of each area, which could be useful for the development
   of UHI mitigation strategies, in small coastal cities.},

Abstract = {Northern North America presents a vast and varied northern geography, a
   sparse yet relatively concentrated human population, super-abundant
   freshwater habitats and untold kilometres of coastline. Freshwater and
   anadromous fishes, largely dominated by salmonids, represent a major
   natural resource to the region's residents and visitors. With the
   exception of the huge offshore-based commercial fishery for Alaskan
   Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and a much smaller lake whitefish
   Coregonus clupeaformis fishery in Great Slave Lake, however, the value
   of fisheries is primarily for local consumption rather than for export.
   In Alaska, much fisheries management focuses on Pacific salmon
   escapement goals; throughout the region, sport and subsistence fisheries
   are locally important. Five challenges to sustainable fisheries
   resources in this region are identified, including overharvesting
   migratory stocks that pass through several local community fisheries,
   the potential damage from events such as climate change, the potential
   to overharvest certain sport fisheries, limited information on which to
   base management decisions and the potential for adverse impacts from
   resource development.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Oceans absorb a huge part of the atmospheric heat, leading to the rise
   in water temperature. Reefs are among the most affected ecosystems,
   where the complex behavioral repertoire of fishes is usually an
   indicator of environmental impacts. Here, we examined whether
   temperature (28 and 34 degrees C) and habitat complexity (high and low)
   interact to affect the agonistic behavior (mirror test) of the dusky
   damselfish (Stegastes fuscus), a key species in Brazilian reefs because
   of its gardening capacity and territorial behavior. Higher temperatures
   altered basal behavior in both high and low-complexity conditions. Fish
   kept at 28 degrees C under the high-complexity condition were more
   aggressive than those at a higher temperature (34 degrees C) and in a
   low-complexity condition, which also exhibited lower dispersion. Our
   data show that changes in behavior of coral reef fish is associated to
   fluctuations in environmental conditions. Thus, it is important to
   implement management or conservation strategies that could mitigate
   global change effects.},

Title = {Putting vulnerability to climate change on the map: a review of

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-202},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is growing demand among stakeholders across public and private
   institutions for spatially-explicit information regarding vulnerability
   to climate change at the local scale. However, the challenges associated
   with mapping the geography of climate change vulnerability are
   non-trivial, both conceptually and technically, suggesting the need for
   more critical evaluation of this practice. Here, we review climate
   change vulnerability mapping in the context of four key questions that
   are fundamental to assessment design. First, what are the goals of the
   assessment? A review of published assessments yields a range of
   objective statements that emphasize problem orientation or
   decision-making about adaptation actions. Second, how is the assessment
   of vulnerability framed? Assessments vary with respect to what values
   are assessed (vulnerability of what) and the underlying determinants of
   vulnerability that are considered (vulnerability to what). The selected
   frame ultimately influences perceptions of the primary driving forces of
   vulnerability as well as preferences regarding management alternatives.
   Third, what are the technical methods by which an assessment is
   conducted? The integration of vulnerability determinants into a common
   map remains an emergent and subjective practice associated with a number
   of methodological challenges. Fourth, who participates in the assessment
   and how will it be used to facilitate change? Assessments are often
   conducted under the auspices of benefiting stakeholders, yet many lack
   direct engagement with stakeholders. Each of these questions is reviewed
   in turn by drawing on an illustrative set of 45 vulnerability mapping
   studies appearing in the literature. A number of pathways for placing
   vulnerability mapping on a more robust footing are also identified.},

Title = {Cluster Analysis of Monthly Precipitation over the Western Maritime
   Continent under Climate Change},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Changes in climate because of global warming during the 20th and 21st
   centuries have a direct impact on the hydrological cycle as driven by
   precipitation. However, studying precipitation over the Western Maritime
   Continent (WMC) is a great challenge, as the WMC has a complex
   topography and weather system. Understanding changes in precipitation
   patterns and their groupings is an important aspect of planning
   mitigation measures to minimize flood and drought risk as well as of
   understanding the redistribution of precipitation arising from climate
   change. This paper employs Ward's hierarchical clustering on regional
   climate model (RCM)-simulated monthly precipitation gridded data over 42
   approximately evenly distributed grid stations from the years 2030 to
   2060. The aim was to investigate spatial and temporal groupings over the
   four major landmasses in the WMC and to compare these with historical
   precipitation groupings. The results showed that the four large-scale
   islands of Java, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo would
   experience a significant spatial redistribution of precipitation over
   the years 2030 to 2060, as compared to historical patterns from 1980 to
   2005. The spatial groups were also compared for two future forcing
   scenarios, representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, and
   different groupings over the Borneo region were observed.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities and small-scale fisheries are highly vulnerable to
   climate change. In this study, we aimed to examine fishers' decisions to
   adapt to climate change and their expectations for their children to
   pursue the same profession. Data were obtained from fisher households
   covering 8 districts and 22 sub-districts in the coastal area of
   Chumphon Province, Thailand, using participatory observation, focus
   group discussion, and in-person field surveys. A binary logistic
   regression model was used to determine factors influencing the fishers'
   decisions and their expectations for their children to inherit their
   occupation. Results showed that the fishers are aware of the increasing
   trends in air temperature, sea water temperature, inland precipitation,
   offshore precipitation, and storms. Increased fishing experience and
   fishing income increased the likelihood of the fishers applying
   adaptations to climate change. Looking to the future, fishers with high
   fishing incomes expect their children to pursue the occupation, whereas
   increased fishing experience, non-fishing incomes, and perceptions of
   storms likely discourage them from expecting their children to be
   fishers. Of the fishers interviewed, 58.06\% decided to apply
   adaptations in response to climate change by incorporating climate-smart
   agriculture, particularly by cultivating rubber, oil palm, and orchards
   as a second income source. The adoption of climate-smart fisheries
   should be considered in relation to the body of local knowledge, as well
   as the needs and priorities of the fisher community. To cope with the
   impacts of current and future climate change on coastal communities, the
   national focal point of adaptation should be climate change, and related
   governmental agencies should pay more attention to these key factors for
   adaptation.},

Title = {THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOECONOMY OF THE BALTIC REGION IN THE CONTEXT OF
   REGIONAL AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE},
Journal = {BALTIC REGION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {20-35},
Abstract = {Climate change is projected to have a profound effect on natural
   ecosystems, biodiversity, and societies both in the Baltic region and
   globally, particularly so through agriculture and food systems. The
   Baltic region has a vast potential for the development of bioeconomy due
   to the existing opportunities for biomass production and advances in
   microbiology leading to process- and product innovations in biomass
   production and utilization. The development of sustainable bioeconomy in
   the Baltic region, however, requires a flexible and timely adaptation to
   climate change. Based on an overview of the relevant state-of-the-art
   literature, the article explores the implications of the development of
   bioeconomy for the adaptation to and the mitigation of climate change in
   the Baltic region. The paper elaborates on actions that may facilitate
   the sustainability of bioeconomy in the region. It concludes that
   scientific collaboration across borders in the Baltic region can
   accelerate innovations to successfully adapt bioeconomy to climate
   change. Sustainable development of bioeconomy can provide considerable
   opportunities for mitigating climate change.},

Title = {Estimating resilience across landscapes},
Journal = {CONSERVATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although ecological managers typically focus on managing local or
   regional landscapes, they often have little ability to control or
   predict many of the large-scale, long-term processes that drive changes
   within these landscapes. This lack of control has led some ecologists to
   argue that ecological management should aim to produce ecosystems that
   are resilient to change and surprise. Unfortunately, ecological
   resilience is difficult to measure or estimate in the landscapes people
   manage. In this paper, I extend system dynamics approaches to resilience
   and estimate resilience using complex landscape simulation models. I use
   this approach to evaluate cross-scale edge, a novel empirical method for
   estimating resilience based on landscape pattern. Cross-scale edge
   provides relatively robust estimates of resilience, suggesting that,
   with some further developments it could be used as a management tool to
   provide rough and rapid estimates of areas of resilience and
   vulnerability within a landscape.},

Title = {Multi-indicator sensitivity analysis of climate change effects on
   landscapes in the Kiskunsag National Park, Hungary},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {8-20},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A multi-indicator approach assessing sensitivity to drought within
   different landscape types was explored within the Kiskunsag National
   Park (Hungary) and its surrounding landscapes. The National Park
   preserves alkaline lakes, sand dunes, wetlands, dry steppes and forests,
   surrounded by a matrix of intensively used agricultural land and
   forests. The investigated indicators rely to soil moisture regime,
   changes in groundwater resources, biomass production of vegetation and
   wind erosion hazard. The study also estimated future drought hazard as
   an indicator of climate change (CC) by REMO and ALADIN regional climate
   model simulations applying two future time periods (2021-2050 and
   2071-2100). Overlaying analysis of future CC scenarios and the
   multi-indicator assessment indicates increasing drought hazards over the
   whole area investigated, with landscapes in the northern part of the
   territory relatively more exposed. On the basis of the calculated
   indicators, the most sensitive areas were identified as being located in
   the areas of highest altitude and within the sandy area/alluvial plain
   transitional zone, which are mostly wetland and sand-dune regions.
   Results indicate that conservation management should especially focus on
   the northern part of the Kiskunsag as an area most at risk of increasing
   drought. The outcomes of this research demonstrate the utility of a
   dynamic, multi-indicator landscape sensitivity approach to developing
   strategies to adapt on the multilayered and complex effects of CC on
   nature conservation practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Indigenous knowledge, climate change and transformations of Gwadar
   fishing community},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper explores the indigenous climate knowledge (ICK) of the
   Gwadar fishing community in Pakistan. The main purpose of this paper is
   to explore the accuracy of ICK and how climatic change brings changes to
   it and the social lives of local fishers.
   Design/methodology/approachQualitative research methods, including
   participant observation, in-depth interviews and oral histories, were
   used to collect the data. FindingsFinding from this long fieldwork shows
   that this fishing community has a harmonious relationship with nature
   and local ecology. Their knowledge of local ecology enables them to have
   equal access to natural resources, sustainable resource management,
   disaster risk reduction and strong social organization on the coast of
   Gwadar. Recently their deep relationship with local ecology and
   sociocultural organization has been disturbed due to huge climate
   changes caused by human manipulation of the environment. Their ability
   to foresee climatic events has been reduced. They are finding it
   impossible to estimate fish availability due to massive climate changes.
   Local communities are losing their traditional livelihoods and
   socioeconomic autonomy as a result of growing climate change. Climatic
   change adds to the existing poverty situation and increases political
   instability in the region. Practical implicationsThe study suggests
   using the fishermen's valuable indigenous knowledge of local ecology,
   climate and its ties to local traditions, culture and resource
   management for a scientific understanding of climate change and marine
   resource management in Gwadar, Pakistan. Originality/valueThis is an
   ethnographic study based on a long term field work. Fishing community is
   passing through catastrophic climatic changes in the region. This
   community has been ignored by both government and researchers to record
   their problems and bring them to academia and media. Therefore, this
   study will help them raise their voices.},

Title = {Antifouling Performance of a Membrane Modified by Phase-Transited Bovine
   Serum Albumin},
Journal = {ACS ES\&T WATER},
Abstract = {Membrane-based technology has been extensively applied in seawater
   desalination and wastewater reclamation, but its sustainable
   applications are limited by the inevitable membrane fouling. Modifying
   membranes is a widely used approach to mitigate biofouling in membrane
   preparation processes. However, high costs and complexity of the
   modification limit the practical applications of this approach. In this
   work, a biocompatible and robust coating strategy was adopted to
   mitigate fouling caused by biomacromolecules and microbes in an
   environmentally friendly way. The phase-transited bovine serum albumin
   (PTB) coating was triggered by soaking membranes in the mixture of the
   protein and a reductant. The coating preserved the porous structures of
   membranes and also maintained the water flux of the microfiltration
   membrane in dead-end filtration tests. Moreover, the PTB-coated
   membranes exhibited high antifouling properties toward both
   biomacromolecules and microbes. In particular, the most significant
   improvement against membrane fouling was observed for sodium alginate,
   followed by bovine serum albumin and humic acid. Additionally, the
   membrane fouling caused by Sphingomonas wittichii and Aeromonas
   hydrophila was also efficiently mitigated. These improved antifouling
   performances were found to be attributed to the negatively charged
   membrane surface after PTB coating. This work provides a feasible and
   environmentally friendly approach to modify membranes to mitigate
   biofouling without compromising its original porous structure and water
   flux.},

Title = {Assessing vulnerability and adaptation strategy of the cyclone affected
   coastal area of Bangladesh},
Journal = {GEOENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Bangladesh is a land of natural calamities. Due to locational
   disadvantages, especially being situated at the tip of the funnel-shaped
   Bay of Bengal on the south and at the foot of Himalayas on the north,
   every year it experiences a number of different types of natural
   calamities, such as flood, cyclone, river bank erosion, drought etc. As
   a result of climate change events, an increasing trend in frequency has
   been observed in recent time. Spatial distribution of natural calamities
   portraits northern part as prone to flood, western part to drought,
   eastern part (basically hilly region) to flash flood and southern part
   to cyclone. The Southern part, especially the coastal belt of the
   country is the worst affected area to cyclones and their ultimate
   effects. Among these cyclones, Aila was a severe one that tore through
   the area in 2009 affecting the livelihood of the inhabitants. This study
   is an effort to discuss the inhabitants' vulnerability and their
   adaptation strategies to economic changes caused by Aila, such as
   occupation, income, expenditure capacity, savings, housing structures,
   general and agricultural land use etc. For the study required data has
   been collected from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data
   have been collected through questionnaire survey and group discussion
   while secondary data, especially satellite images have been collected
   from Google Earth. Then different softwares like SPSS have been used for
   analysis and graphic presentation of the collected primary data, and
   ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS have been used for mapping analysis and
   presentation. The research findings indicate that because of the cyclone
   Aila, economy of the area has taken downturn. Most of the people were
   engaged in agriculture allied activities, but after Aila, agricultural
   land had been converted into aquaculture. Consequently, people have
   switched to occupations with lesser earnings, such as daily labour,
   rickshaw puller, brick field worker etc. As a result, people had to
   reduce all sorts of daily consumptions to cope up with the changing
   situation. The Governmental Organisations and the Non-Governmental
   Organisations extended little help to rebuild houses, embankment, road,
   reforestation etc. but not towards any income generates activities. So,
   the livelihood of the people is still vulnerable in terms of economy,
   and attention of the responsible authorities needs to be drawn to create
   income generating activities to recover the vulnerable situation in the
   study area.},

Abstract = {Few comparative international studies describe the climate change
   policies people are willing to support and the reasons for their support
   of different policies. Using survey data from 664 economics and business
   undergraduates in Austria, Bangladesh, Finland, Germany, Norway, and the
   United States, we explore how perceived risk characteristics and mental
   models of climate change influence support for policy alternatives.
   General green policies such as funding research on renewable
   technologies and planting trees were the overwhelmingly most popular
   policy alternatives. Around half the students support carbon reduction
   policies such as requiring higher car fuel efficiency and increasing
   taxes on fossil fuels. Least popular were engineering alternatives such
   as fertilizing the oceans and replacing fossil fuels with nuclear power.
   Variations among nations are generally small. Support for different
   policy alternatives corresponds with different causal thinking. Those
   who hold a pollution model of the causes of climate change, tend to
   blame environmental harms (e.g., air pollution from toxic chemicals),
   see general green policy alternatives as effective, and support general
   green policies. Support of carbon reduction strategies is associated
   with seeing carbon emissions as the cause and reducing carbon emissions
   as effective solutions. Support of engineering solutions increases with
   identifying volcanoes among causes and regarding engineering solutions
   as effective. Although these international students agree that climate
   change is a threatening problem, their causal thinking correlates with
   support for different mitigative policy actions, with the most popular
   ones not necessarily the most effective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Differential Branchial Response of Low Salinity Challenge Induced
   Prolactin in Active and Passive Coping Style Olive Flounder},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Stress coping styles are very common in fish, and investigations into
   this area can greatly improve fish welfare and promote the sustainable
   development of aquaculture. Although most studies have focused on the
   behavioral and physiological differences of these fishes, the endocrine
   response of different coping styles fish when undergoing salinity
   challenge is still unclear. We examined the physiological response in
   olive flounder with active coping (AC) style and passive coping (PC)
   style after transferred from seawater (SW) to freshwater for 0, 2, 5, 8,
   and 14 days. The results showed that: 1) the plasma prolactin level of
   FW-acclimated AC flounder was substantially higher than that of
   FW-acclimated PC flounder at 5, 8, and 14 days, and the branchial gene
   expression of prolactin receptor (PRLR) in AC flounder was slightly
   higher than PC flounder after transfer. While there was no remarkable
   difference observed in cortisol (COR) levels between AC and PC flounder.
   After transfer, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in AC flounder
   was significantly higher compared with PC flounder at 8 days. 2)
   Branchial NKA-IR ionocytes numbers were reduced in PC flounder after
   transfer, while ionocytes number remain stable in AC flounder. 3) The
   branchial stem cell transcription factor foxi1 gene expression of AC
   flounder was significantly higher than PC flounder at 2, 5, and 14 days
   after transfer, while branchial stem cell transcription factor p63 gene
   expression of FW-acclimated AC flounder was only substantially higher
   than that of PC flounder at 5 days. 4) As an apoptosis upstream
   initiator, the branchial gene expression of caspase-9 in PC flounder was
   considerably higher than in AC flounder after transfer at 8 days. This
   study revealed that olive flounder with active and passive coping styles
   have different endocrine coping strategies after facing the low-salinity
   challenge. AC flounder adopt an active endocrine strategy by increasing
   ionocyte differentiation and prolactin secretion significantly. In
   contrast, PC flounder employ a passive strategy of reducing ionocytes
   differentiation and retaining prolactin content at a low level to reduce
   branchial ionocytes number.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the main achievements of DISARM (Drought and fIre
   ObServatory and eArly waRning system) project, which developed an early
   warning system for wildfires in the Eastern Mediterranean. The four
   pillars of this system include (i) forecasting wildfire danger, (ii)
   detecting wildfires with remote sensing techniques, (iii) forecasting
   wildfire spread with a coupled weather-fire modeling system, and (iv)
   assessing the wildfire risk in the frame of climate change. Special
   emphasis is given to the innovative and replicable parts of the system.
   It is shown that for the effective use of fire weather forecasting in
   different geographical areas and in order to account for the local
   climate conditions, a proper adjustment of the wildfire danger
   classification is necessary. Additionally, the consideration of
   vegetation dryness may provide better estimates of wildfire danger. Our
   study also highlights some deficiencies of both EUMETSAT (Exploitation
   of Meteorological Satellites) and LSA-SAF (Satellite Application
   Facility on Land Surface Analysis) algorithms in their skill to detect
   wildfires over islands and near the coastline. To tackle this issue, a
   relevant modification is proposed. Furthermore, it is shown that IRIS,
   the coupled atmosphere-fire modeling system developed in the frame of
   DISARM, has proven to be a valuable supporting tool in fire suppression
   actions. Finally, assessment of the wildfire danger in the future
   climate provides the necessary context for the development of regional
   adaptation strategies to climate change.},

   scientists to share observations, these have typically been limited to
   biodiversity surveys or bird counts; projects that require more
   versatile data collection capability and use paper datasheets or costly
   custom-made online data collection systems. Anecdata is designed to help
   projects managers develop data collection solutions by offering a far
   broader scope of data collection options; data collected may include
   measurements from water, snow, or air samples, beach debris tallies,
   species presence or absence reports, photographs, or written field
   notes. The site currently supports several projects related to sea level
   rise. We are building new tools to help project managers and
   participants in these communities to address climate change issues and

Abstract = {The influence of sea-level rise (SLR) on seawater intrusion (SWI) has
   been the subject of several publications, which consider collectively a
   range of functional relationships within various hydrogeological and SLR
   settings. Most of the recent generalized analyses of SWI under SLR
   neglect land-surface inundation (LSI) by seawater. A simple analytical
   method is applied to quantitatively assess the influence and importance
   of LSI on SLR-SWI problems under idealized conditions. The results
   demonstrate that LSI induces significantly more extensive SWI, with
   inland penetration up to an order of magnitude larger in the worst case,
   compared to the effects of pressure changes at the shoreline in
   unconfined coastal aquifers with realistic parameters. The study also
   outlines some of the remaining research challenges in related areas,
   concluding that LSI impacts are among other important research questions
   regarding the SLR-SWI problems that have not been addressed, including
   the effects of aquifer heterogeneities, real-world three dimensionality,
   and mitigation measures.},

   populations with negligible environmental impacts. However, repeated
   field applications of Bti over many years raise the question of possible
   long-term effects on non-target invertebrates with putative subsequent
   alterations of food webs. Environmental effects of Bti have mainly been
   studied in continental freshwater wetlands. Much less is known for
   brackish water coastal wetlands. We investigated whether repeated
   treatments with Bti, applied as VectoBac((R)) WG over seven consecutive
   years, may affect non-target invertebrate communities in wetlands of the
   French Atlantic coast. Particular attention was devoted to invertebrates
   potentially used as food sources by shorebirds and wading birds.
   Invertebrates were sampled in the water and sediment of control and
   VectoBac((R))-treated saltmarsh pools between 2006 and 2012. Taxa
   abundance data were used to calculate community descriptors and to
   analyse the potential structural changes due to VectoBac((R)) using the
   principal response curve method and similarity analysis. Physicochemical
   parameters were measured in the same pools so that homogeneity of the
   environmental conditions between the control and treated areas could be
   tested. We demonstrated that long-term use of VectoBac((R)) WG in French
   Atlantic coastal wetlands had no influence on the temporal evolution of
   the taxonomic structure and taxa abundance of non-target aquatic
   invertebrate communities, which is highly driven by abiotic factors. In
   addition, over the long term, the amount of invertebrates that could be
   used as food resources by birds is maintained in VectoBac((R))-treated
   areas.Synthesis and applications. Reduced application rate and targeted
   spraying of VectoBac((R)) WG in mosquito breeding sites minimize
   potential environmental impacts of Bacillus thuringiensis var.
   israelensis (Bti). Even so, surveillance of its possible primary side
   effects is needed, which requires comparable control and treated areas.
   Indeed, systematic temporal trends and subtle differences in the range
   of variation of abiotic factors result in discrepancies between control
   and treated area in terms of invertebrate abundance, which could be
   wrongly attributed to VectoBac((R)). Management decisions and mitigation
   measures may therefore benefit from (i) extending surveillance to a time
   frame that allows for coverage of the immense temporal variation in taxa
   abundance and diversity and (ii) the inclusion of environmental
   variables in the monitoring of non-target animal communities potentially
   exposed to Bti.

Abstract = {Since 2007, gross domestic product (GDP) growth in China's inland
   provinces has exceeded that of the affluent coastal provinces.
   Concurrently, they have also been given more lenient energy intensity
   reduction targets to provide latitude for continued growth. The regional
   unevenness of economic development and energy policy has implications
   for the ability of the country to achieve its energy savings target an
   objective that has become the key part of China's climate change
   mitigation strategy. This study shows that there is an explicit trend in
   which changes in regional economic structure is moving towards
   increasing national energy intensity. This is due, in large part, to
   carbon leakage between provinces. Changes in regional economic structure
   increased national energy intensity by 0.13\% during the 11th five-year
   plans (FYP) period, and is on track to cause a further increase of
   1.35\% during the 12th FYP period. In formulating national energy
   policy, the existing ``Target Responsibility System{''} (TRS) of policy
   implementation may need to be improved. Regional economic disparities
   must be taken directly into account in policymaking, as inland provinces
   should be assigned higher, not lower, energy intensity reduction
   targets. This will increase the likelihood that national targets, and
   hence China's broader climate change mitigation goals, will be met. (c)

Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a crucially-needed adaptation to climate change, the United Nations
   plans to expand Early Warning Systems (EWS) for extreme weather to cover
   everyone on Earth. Given the growing interest in this climate change
   adaptation solution, we assess how well weather early warnings perform
   for extreme events in different parts of the world. First, we carry out
   a forecast verification for weather forecasts from the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for 95th percentile extreme heat
   and extreme precipitation globally at 0.5 degrees resolution, with three
   days of lead time. We present the results alongside similar verification
   results from ECMWF forecasts and a CHIRPS-GEFS forecast, to identify
   regions of the world with consistent forecast skill. We then overlay the
   skill of these short-term weather forecasts on top of climate change
   projections for the increasing frequency of the extreme events
   themselves. Based on these results, we offer policy implications for EWS
   investments in different regions. We find that in much of the tropics,
   weather forecasts have relatively poor skill in forecasting extreme
   temperature and precipitation events, calling for further investments in
   predictability. In the extra-tropics, most extreme heat and extreme
   precipitation events can be correctly forecasted, with better results
   for multi-day events and shorter lead-times. While there is room to
   improve predictability, end-to-end investments in EWS in these regions
   can focus on the use of existing skillful forecasts. Finally, most of
   the world's land area is projected to see an increase in the magnitude
   of extreme heat and precipitation events with climate change, and EWS
   investments in these regions should prepare for unprecedented extremes
   and changing vulnerabilities. These results provide a foundation for
   localized research on EWS in different parts of the world as well as
   evidence for policy and donors on how best to invest in EWS in different
   regions.},

Abstract = {This review paper aimed to summarize the climate change impacts on water
   sources and their relation with human and ecosystem health and evaluate
   better management strategies. In aquatic environments, climate change
   causes alteration of biodiversity and species distribution, changes in
   the duration of biological functions, decreasing productivities,
   alteration in food web structures, as well as triggering the invasion of
   various species, and variation in the presence, abundance, and
   concentrations of various co-stressors. Since the beginning of the 20th
   century, the surface water temperature in the oceans has risen by about
   1 degrees C. Consequently, human well-being is directly and indirectly
   affected by these alterations. The World Health Organization (WHO)
   estimates 3.5 million people die from water-related diseases each year.
   It is projected that the number of water-related diseases will increase
   due to the effects of climate change. To cope with these problems,
   alternative water management strategies should be developed to have
   resilient water systems in terms of both ecological and technological
   perspectives. Thus, water management requires the cooperation of many
   sectors including citizens, institutions, public and private sectors,
   etc. within a multi-stakeholder approach.},

Abstract = {Animal community responses to extreme climate events can be predicted
   from the functional traits represented within communities. However, it
   is unclear whether geographic variation in the response of functional
   community structure to climate change is primarily driven by
   physiological matching to local conditions (local adaptation hypothesis)
   or by differences between species pools in functional redundancy
   (insurance hypothesis). We conducted a coordinated experiment to
   understand how aquatic invertebrate traits mediate the responses of
   multitrophic communities to changes in the quantity and evenness of
   rainfall in 180 natural freshwater microcosms (tank bromeliads)
   distributed across six sites from 18 degrees N in the Caribbean to 29
   degrees S in South America. At each site, we manipulated the mean and
   dispersion of the daily amount of rainfall that entered tank bromeliads
   over a 2-month period. Manipulations covered a response surface
   representing 50\% to 200\% of the dispersion of daily rainfall crossed
   with 10\% to 300\% of the mean amounts of rainfall. The response of
   functional community structure to precipitation regimes differed across
   sites. These geographic differences were not consistent with the local
   adaptation hypothesis, as responses did not correlate with the current
   amplitude in precipitation. Geographic differences in community
   responses were consistent with the insurance hypothesis: sites with the
   lowest functional redundancy in their species pools had the strongest
   response to a gradient in hydrological variability induced by uneven
   precipitation. In such sites, an increase in the hydrologic variability
   induced a shift from communities with both pelagic and benthic traits
   using both green and brown energy channels to strictly benthic, brown
   energy communities. Our results predict uneven impacts of precipitation
   change on community structure and energy channels within communities
   across Neotropical regions. This geographic variation is due more to
   differences in the size and redundancy of species pools than to local
   adaptation. Strategies for climate change adaptation should thus seek to
   identify and preserve functionally unique species and their habitats.

Abstract = {Coastal areas are on the front lines of the impacts of climate change.
   The immediate impacts of temperature, precipitation and sea-level change
   affect rich but already threatened ecological systems and the most
   populated, highly developed, and economically vibrant regions of human
   activity on the planet. The specific vulnerabilities, impacts and
   adaptation options and activities vary greatly across the coastal areas
   of the US. The charge given to the coastal chapter team of the third US
   National Climate Assessment (NCA3, released in May 2014) was to discern
   the key vulnerabilities and most important cross-cutting concerns across
   the extensive coastline of the US. This paper is a reflection on what
   the coastal chapter team accomplished and how it was done (including
   author selection, staff support, technical inputs, the chapter
   development process, within-and cross-chapter integration, the review
   process, the delivery and high-impact release, the timeline of key
   assessment steps, and evaluation of the chapter development process). It
   concludes with eight lessons that might inform the activities of future
   collaborative author teams writing transdisciplinary, integrated
   assessment reports.},

   INSIGHTS AND ASSESSMENT AFTER 5 YEARS},

Abstract = {After the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and tsunami, the
   Central Disaster Management Council of Japan newly introduced the
   concept of two different levels of tsunamis for disaster prevention and
   mitigation strategies. Under this concept, in general, the height of the
   coastal dike is designed to prevent the inundation against the level-one
   tsunami. Against the higher level tsunami, on the other hand, the dike
   may allow overflow but should be designed to avoid fatal collapse and
   thus to reduce the damage level of the area behind the dike. The
   quantitative evaluation of such damage-reduction effects of dikes is,
   therefore, one of the key tasks because it affects land-use planning and
   other disaster-prevention or mitigation measures in the inundated area.
   This chapter first discusses to what extent coastal dikes can reduce the
   extent of various coastal hazards against a tsunami flowing over the
   dikes. Based on a numerical study, the overall performance of coastal
   dikes is investigated by comparing the following three parameters: (i)
   volume of the overflow, (ii) inundation area and (iii) ``damaged
   area{''}, i.e., the area where the expected number of collapsed houses
   exceeds that of surviving houses. It was found through the analysis that
   coastal dikes show better performance in the reduction of the damaged
   area rather than in the other parameters and that these effects are
   practically diminished as the relative height of the dike decreases to
   below half of the tsunami height in front of the dike. The stability of
   the dike against an overflowing tsunami is also an important factor to
   ensure the damage-reduction effect of the dike; thus, a slope-type dike
   becomes one of the preferred designs for the dike. Such slopes of the
   dike, however, may reduce the dissipation effect of an overflowing
   tsunami and may thus sacrifice the damage-reduction effect in the
   inundated area. The influence of such a trade-off relationship is
   examined through laboratory experiments. The experimental results showed
   that the sloping-type dike clearly increases the overflow of a tsunami
   and has a significant impact on the damage in the inundated area.
   Finally, this manuscript outlines some other problems for the
   quantitative estimations of inundation characteristics, hazards and
   risks under various uncertain factors and discusses possible
   multi-disciplinary approaches to overcome these difficulties.},

Title = {Connections of climate change and variability to large and extreme
   forest fires in southeast Australia},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The 2019/20 Black Summer bushfire disaster in southeast Australia was
   unprecedented: the extensive area of forest burnt, the radiative power
   of the fires, and the extraordinary number of fires that developed into
   extreme pyroconvective events were all unmatched in the historical
   record. Australia's hottest and driest year on record, 2019, was
   characterised by exceptionally dry fuel loads that primed the landscape
   to burn when exposed to dangerous fire weather and ignition. The
   combination of climate variability and long-term climate trends
   generated the climate extremes experienced in 2019, and the compounding
   effects of two or more modes of climate variability in their
   fire-promoting phases (as occurred in 2019) has historically increased
   the chances of large forest fires occurring in southeast Australia.
   Palaeoclimate evidence also demonstrates that fire-promoting phases of
   tropical Pacific and Indian ocean variability are now unusually frequent
   compared with natural variability in pre-industrial times. Indicators of
   forest fire danger in southeast Australia have already emerged outside
   of the range of historical experience, suggesting that projections made
   more than a decade ago that increases in climate-driven fire risk would
   be detectable by 2020, have indeed eventuated. The multiple climate
   change contributors to fire risk in southeast Australia, as well as the
   observed non-linear escalation of fire extent and intensity, raise the
   likelihood that fire events may continue to rapidly intensify in the
   future. Improving local and national adaptation measures while also
   pursuing ambitious global climate change mitigation efforts would
   provide the best strategy for limiting further increases in fire risk in
   southeast Australia. Multiple climate contributors to fire risk in
   southeast Australia have led to an increase in fire extent and intensity
   over the past decades that will likely continue into the future,
   suggests a synthesis of climate variability, long-term trends and
   palaeoclimatic evidence.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of stringent climate stabilization scenarios for
   coastal areas in terms of reduction of impacts/adaptation needs and
   wider policy implications has received little attention. Here we use the
   Warming Acidification and Sea Level Projector Earth systems model to
   calculate large ensembles of global sea-level rise (SLR) and ocean pH
   projections to 2300 for 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C stabilization
   scenarios, and a reference unmitigated RCP8.5 scenario. The potential
   consequences of these projections are then considered for global coastal
   flooding, small islands, deltas, coastal cities and coastal ecology.
   Under both stabilization scenarios, global mean ocean pH (and
   temperature) stabilize within a century. This implies significant
   ecosystem impacts are mm avoided, but detailed quantification is
   lacking, reflecting scientific uncertainty. By contrast, SLR is only
   slowed and continues to 2300 (and beyond). Hence, while coastal impacts
   due to SLR are reduced significantly by climate stabilization,
   especially after 21(X), potential impacts continue to grow for
   centuries. SLR in 2300 under both stabilization scenarios exceeds
   unmitigated SLR in 2100. Therefore, adaptation remains essential in
   densely populated and economically important coastal areas under climate
   stabilization. Given the multiple adaptation steps that this will
   require, an adaptation pathways approach has merits for coastal areas.

   understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of
   1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels'.},

Abstract = {When it comes to understanding the creepage and clearance requirements
   for power electronic conversion and distribution equipment in the naval
   shipboard environment, appropriate guidance has always been limited.
   Design practices suitable to the shipboard environment have not kept
   pace with the comparable trends in terrestrial applications. The
   necessity of direct interfacing of power electronics, without
   intervening transformers, to Medium Voltage ac (MVac) and (MVdc)
   shipboard distribution systems introduces unique challenges to behavior
   of insulation systems due to mixed-mode electric field stresses that are
   currently being researched. In the interim, what is needed is a
   methodology that adapts present-day industry practices regarding
   insulation coordination to shipboard MVac and MVdc distribution system
   equipment. This paper discusses a conservative design practice that
   adapts the insulation coordination design to the PEC and power
   distribution equipment that will comprise an Integrated Power and Energy
   System (IPES) for shipboard electrification.},

Title = {Shading and Watering as a Tool to Mitigate the Impacts of Climate Change
   in Sea Turtle Nests},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Increasing sand temperatures resulting from climate change may
   negatively impact sea turtle nests by altering sex ratios and decreasing
   reproductive output. We analyzed the effect of nest shading and watering
   on sand temperatures as climate mitigation strategies in a beach
   hatchery at Playa Grande, Costa Rica. We set up plots and placed
   thermocouples at depths of 45cm and 75cm. Half of the plots were shaded
   and half were exposed to the sun. Within these exposure treatments, we
   applied three watering treatments over one month, replicating local
   climatic conditions experienced in this area. We also examined
   gravimetric water content of sand by collecting sand samples the day
   before watering began, the day after watering was complete, and one
   month after completion. Shading had the largest impact on sand
   temperature, followed by watering and depth. All watering treatments
   lowered sand temperature, but the effect varied with depth. Temperatures
   in plots that received water returned to control levels within 10 days
   after watering stopped. Water content increased at both depths in the
   two highest water treatments, and 30 days after the end of water
   application remained higher than plots with low water. While the impacts
   of watering on sand temperature dissipate rapidly after the end of
   application, the impacts on water content are much more lasting.
   Although less effective at lowering sand temperatures than shading,
   watering may benefit sea turtle clutches by offsetting negative impacts
   of low levels of rain in particularly dry areas. Prior to implementing
   such strategies, the natural conditions at the location of interest
   (e.g. clutch depth, environmental conditions, and beach characteristics)
   and natural hatchling sex ratios should be taken into consideration.
   These results provide insight into the effectiveness of nest shading and
   watering as climate mitigation techniques and illustrate important
   points of consideration in the crafting of such strategies.},

Title = {Sliding Toward the Collapse of Mediterranean Coastal Marine Rocky

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the biggest emerging threats to marine
   biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. In this chapter, we focus on the
   recurrent and large scale mass mortality events (MMEs) induced by marine
   heatwaves (MHWs), and their immediate and long-term impacts on
   structural octocorals from highly diverse coralligenous communities. By
   combining an accurate characterization of present and expected thermal
   stress conditions in coastal seawater from the surface down to 40 m
   depth with the state of the art on demography, population genetics, and
   responses to thermal stress, we analyze the ongoing eco-evolutionary
   impacts and explore future trajectories of these emblematic
   Mediterranean communities.
   Analysis of satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) trends over
   the three decades revealed a marked increase in MHW events in the
   Mediterranean Sea. The immediate impacts of MMEs on structural octocoral
   populations were dramatic decreases of their biomass (similar to 60\%).
   After 10-15 years since the occurrence of a NHW, there were no signs of
   population recovery, and in fact, a continued decrease was observed due
   to subsequent marine heatwaves.
   The modeling of Mediterranean SST suggests longer and more severe marine
   heatwaves as the century progresses. In this thermal context, the
   eco-evolutionary dynamics of the structural octocorals will likely
   result in an abrupt collapse of impacted populations. Indeed, from the
   eco-evolutionary interaction, the demographic decline is expected to
   increase the strength of genetic drift due to the low recolonization
   capacity of the species. This may lead to an extinction vortex, in spite
   of the occurrence of potentially thermoresistant individuals suggesting
   some potential for adaptation to future conditions. The ongoing collapse
   of Mediterranean habitat-forming octocorals may drive to a functional
   void with severe consequences for coralligenous communities and services
   they provide.
   The implementation of ambitious mitigation and adaptation policies
   compliant with the Paris agreement is urgently needed. In this context,
   we highlight the critical role of marine protected areas and the need
   for increasing their surface and improving their management.},

Abstract = {The Magdalena River in Colombia is one of the world's largest (discharge
   = 7100 m(3) s(-1)) tropical rivers, hosting > 170 aquatic vertebrate
   species. However, concise synthesis of the current ecological and
   environmental status is lacking. By documenting the anthropogenic
   stressors impacting the river on time scales ranging from centuries to
   decades, we found that the river system is subject to the compounding
   impacts of climate change, river impoundment, invasive alien species
   (IAS), catchment deforestation, and water pollution. We show that the
   Magdalena is a woefully understudied ecosystem relative to its critical
   importance to Colombia's economy, culture, and biodiversity compared
   with other similarly sized tropical rivers. We emphasize the need for
   research on (1) IAS population and ecological dynamics, (2) river
   damming and its links with IAS and climate change, and (3) land-use
   changes as well as identifying sources of water pollution and strategies
   for mitigation.},

Abstract = {Climate change and sea level rise impacts will affect coastal
   communities with multiple threats, including increased frequency of
   compound events, such as storm surge combined with heavy precipitation.
   Accurately modeling how the stakeholders, such as governments and
   residents, may respond to sea level rise scenarios (i.e., scenario
   planning) can assist in the creation of policies tailored to local
   impacts and resilience strategies. In this paper, our contributions are
   twofold. Firstly, considering a single-agent model for government, we
   numerically show that the government's policy on infrastructure
   improvement should be based on the observed sea levels rather than the
   observed cost from nature. The latter refers to the straightforward
   policy that any responsive (but not proactive) government would follow.
   Through a reinforcement learning algorithm based on a Markov decision
   process model we show that the precautionary measures, (i.e.,
   infrastructure improvements triggered by the sea levels) are more
   effective in decreasing the expected cost than the aftermath measures
   triggered by the cost from nature. Secondly, to generate different
   scenarios we consider several sea level rise projections by NOAA, and
   model different government and resident prototypes using cooperation
   indices in terms of being responsive to the sea level rise problem. We
   present a reinforcement learning algorithm to generate simulations for a
   set of scenarios defined by the NOAA projections and cooperation
   indices.},

Abstract = {Documented and forecasted trends in rising sea levels and changes in
   storminess patterns have the potential to increase the frequency,
   magnitude, and spatial extent of coastal change hazards. To develop
   realistic adaptation strategies, coastal planners need information about
   coastal change hazards that recognizes the dynamic temporal and spatial
   scales of beach morphology, the climate controls on coastal change
   hazards, and the uncertainties surrounding the drivers and impacts of
   climate change. We present a probabilistic approach for quantifying and
   mapping coastal change hazards that incorporates the uncertainty
   associated with both climate change and morphological variability. To
   demonstrate the approach, coastal change hazard zones of arbitrary
   confidence levels are developed for the Tillamook County (State of
   Oregon, USA) coastline using a suite of simple models and a range of
   possible climate futures related to wave climate, sea-level rise
   projections, and the frequency of major El Nio events. Extreme total
   water levels are more influenced by wave height variability, whereas the
   magnitude of erosion is more influenced by sea-level rise scenarios.
   Morphological variability has a stronger influence on the width of
   coastal hazard zones than the uncertainty associated with the range of
   climate change scenarios.},

Title = {Monitoring for Resilience within the Coastal Wetland Fish Assemblages of
   Fathom Five National Marine Park, Lake Huron, Canada},

Abstract = {A resilient coastal wetland is naturally dynamic and responds to
   disturbances by maintaining the regimes defining structures and
   functions. Methods to monitor resilience have been difficult to develop,
   yet are essential to either prevent or actively navigate a regime shift.
   As others have reported, ecosystem behavior becomes more variable when
   resilience decreases and feedbacks begin to weaken. To advance the
   practice of conservation within protected areas, a resilience-based
   approach to monitoring was explored within Fathom Five National Marine
   Park, Canada. By means of a multivariate distance-based control chart,
   the variability of fish assemblages in eight coastal wetlands over an
   eight-year period (2005-2012) was monitored. The control chart
   identified occasions when variance in three of the park's wetlands
   deviated more than expected (i.e., acted ``out of control{''}). To
   explain the exceedances, an ordination of fish assemblages was completed
   using principal components analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA).
   Colonization by the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and the
   prolonged period of low lake levels and stranding were discussed as
   possible explanations for the exceedances. In conclusion, the control
   chart and ordination methods provided valuable insight and understanding
   of wetland dynamics and were recommended as part of a long-term
   resilience-based approach to monitoring.},

Title = {Inuit Food Insecurity as a Consequence of Fragmented Marine Resource
   Management Policies? Emerging Lessons from Nunatsiavut},
Journal = {ARCTIC},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {5, 1},
Pages = {40-55},
Abstract = {Historically, Inuit communities of the Arctic have relied significantly
   on the living marine resources of their coastal waters for nutrition,
   underpinning community cohesion and enhancing individual and collective
   well-being. Inadequate understanding of the conditions of coastal marine
   stocks and their dynamics, along with failed past fisheries management
   practices, now threatens secure access to these resources for food and
   nutrition. We examine the degree of integration of modern Canadian
   federal food and marine resource management policies, which heretofore
   have been unable to lessen food insecurity in the Arctic, suggesting
   that causes rather than symptoms need to be treated. Using evidence from
   Nunatsiavut, northern Labrador, we assess the limits to marine resource
   governance affecting access to traditionally important food sources. We
   explore the potential for both increased subsistence harvests and
   enhanced access to commercial fisheries in mitigating Inuit food
   insecurity, arguing for the relevance of expanded marine resource
   assessments, more focused fisheries management, and integration with
   policies designed to mitigate food insecurity. Crucially, the absence of
   methods for tracking changes in locally harvested marine resources
   threatens not only individual and household nutrition but also the
   social, economic, and cultural integrity of Inuit communities. We
   further describe the needs for monitoring and propose the use of
   indicators that capture the contributions of locally harvested marine
   resources to increased food security along with a framework that allows
   for utilizing local knowledge and observations. Relying on emerging
   lessons from research in Nunatsiavut, we build a foundation for a better
   understanding of both the political and institutional legacies that
   contribute to Labrador Inuit food insecurity and discuss how the deeper
   integration of food and marine resource management policies could help
   mitigate it.},

Title = {More exposed but also more vulnerable? Climate change, high intensity
   precipitation events and flooding in Mediterranean Spain},
Journal = {DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {229-248},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of high intensity
   precipitation events in increasing the vulnerability to floods in
   Mediterranean Spain. Precipitation intensity in this area appears to
   have augmented in the last two decades in association with warming
   trends of the Mediterranean Sea. At the same time, intense urbanization
   processes, occupying and transforming flood prone land, have produced an
   important increase in exposure. The main objective is to assess whether
   higher intensity precipitation and changing patterns in exposure
   aggravate vulnerability to floods.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this paper, vulnerability is understood as the result of the
   interrelationships between exposure, sensitivity, impacts and adaptive
   capacity. Consequently, methods used involved the compilation and
   analysis of published and unpublished precipitation data, population and
   land use data, data on insurance claims, and media sources related to
   those variables.
   Findings
   Changes toward episodes of more intense precipitation in the expanding
   urban areas of Mediterranean Spain increase exposure but not necessarily
   vulnerability, at least in terms of human deaths. However, adaptative
   capacity needs to be formulated. Actions that attempt to absorb and
   eventually reuse flood flows (as the flood park in Alicante) appear to
   be more effective than traditional hydraulic solutions (as in Majorca).
   Originality/value
   The paper provides a systematic and coherent approach to vulnerability
   analysis taking into account the changing dynamics of its components.
   Especially, it signals the limits of current adaptive approaches to
   flooding and advocates for changes toward a more circular and less
   linear approach to urban drainage.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean is commonly recognized as a climate change hotspot
   where the rate of warming is greater than global and disturbances in
   precipitation patterns are predicted. Despite this, knowledge gaps are
   still identified in the South with respect to the lack of regional
   projections and studies of key elements such as trends, concentration,
   disparity, deviation, and their association with regional geographical
   factors. Here, these gaps were addressed in the Maghreb using
   appropriate statistical methods (Mann-Kendall test, consecutive
   disparity, daily concentration, Spearman correlation, and categorization
   of precipitation) based on long-term daily datasets from 45 scattered
   meteorological stations. It was found that precipitation is channeled
   under the orographic effect of the Atlas and Rif Mountain belts and the
   latitudinal gradient (continentality), which spatially determine the
   abundance of precipitation and the duration of dry periods along a
   dominant North-South axis. The two factors combine with maritime effects
   (Mediterranean and Atlantic) to favor the north of the mountain belts
   with high daily concentrations, low interannual disparity but negative
   trend, and frequent disturbances. An intra-annual time shift was found
   in the number of days of significant precipitation (>= 10 mm) of 2 to 7
   fortnights with respect to the core of the rainy season
   (December-January) with a decrease in precipitation intensity in winter
   and an increase in spring and summer. The result is a forecasted
   precipitation deficit marked by more widespread and intense droughts,
   and more intense but delayed and spatiotemporally dispersed
   precipitation according to a disturbed and non-sequential character in
   places of abundance (North, East, and West of the Mountain belts).
   Overall, the projected precipitation pattern is likely to entrain
   prolonged and staggered intra-annual droughts (even in wet years) with
   deep ecological and socio-economic impacts, and repetitive hydroclimatic
   hazards, making it necessary to improve collaborative resilience
   measures to cope with hydro-agricultural needs.},

   effluents. Changes in the intensity, frequency and tracks of storms
   salinate coastal aquifers. Aquifers are also under the threat from
   rising sea level. Groundwater in urban limits and industrial zones are
   far beyond safety limits. Large-scale destruction of wetlands for
   industries and residential complexes has affected the quality of surface
   and groundwater resources in most parts of India. Measures to maintain
   food security and the new developments schemes such as river linking

Abstract = {Climate change leads to the deposition of substantial amounts of
   sediment along the coasts of Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) amid rapidly
   growing global demand for these resources. Yet, little is known about
   what the predominantly Inuit population of Kalaallit Nunaat thinks about
   adaptation opportunities arising from the melt of the Greenland Ice
   Sheet. Here we conduct a nationally representative survey (N = 939) of
   Kalaallit (Greenlanders') views on glacially derived sand extraction,
   finding that large majorities support extracting and exporting sand but
   oppose foreign involvement. This pattern of support persists at both the
   national and subnational levels. Public preferences largely align with
   Kalaallit Nunaat's current mineral policy mandating environmental and
   economic impact assessments of new resource opportunities. In addition,
   those aware of human-caused climate change have significantly higher
   odds of both supporting sand extraction and prioritizing environmental
   impact assessment. Our results reveal broad support for domestically
   involved, environmentally assessed and economically appraised
   opportunistic adaptation to Greenland's melting ice sheet and
   accumulating sand resources.
   Sand has become an increasingly scarce critical resource. As a result of
   changing climate, Greenland now receives large deposits of glacially
   derived sand along its coasts. Local communities broadly support
   domestic, environmentally mindful economic sand extraction.},

Abstract = {Radiata pine plantation resources in Australia and New Zealand are a
   highly productive source of solid-wood and pulp products for domestic
   consumption and export. This has largely been achieved through long-term
   investments in tree breeding programs that select the best-performing
   genotypes for varied regional environments. However, climate change
   could threaten the realisation of genetic improvement in plantations due
   to suboptimal matching of improved planting stock to new climate
   conditions. Here, we investigate how information from genetic field
   tests could be utilised under anticipated climate change. We use
   principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance measures to find
   the closest match between climate of plantation regions in the future
   and current climate of field test sites. By 2050, future climates of
   some important plantation regions are expected to match climates
   currently present in different regions. For example, future climates of
   Green Triangle, a key plantation region in Australia, will better match
   current climate of Western Australia. The Central North Island of New
   Zealand will shift to warmer and wetter climate with no current
   analogue, and Western Australia, to warmer and drier no-analogue
   climate. The latter is also likely to fall outside the climate niche
   where radiata pine can be grown in the future. Nevertheless, for the
   majority of radiata pine plantation regions in Australia and New Zealand
   our analysis provides a framework of how anticipated climate change can
   be addressed in tree improvement programs using existing field tests.},

Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {How organisms may adapt to rising global temperatures is uncertain, but
   concepts can emerge from studying adaptive physiological trait
   variations across existing spatial climate gradients. Many ectotherms,
   particularly fish, have evolved increasing genetic growth capacities
   with latitude (i.e. countergradient variation (CnGV) in growth), which
   are thought to be an adaptation primarily to strong gradients in
   seasonality. In contrast, evolutionary responses to gradients in mean
   temperature are often assumed to involve an alternative mode, `thermal
   adaptation'. We measured thermal growth reaction norms in Pacific
   silverside populations (Atherinops affinis) occurring across a weak
   latitudinal temperature gradient with invariant seasonality along the
   North American Pacific coast. Instead of thermal adaptation, we found
   novel evidence for CnGV in growth, suggesting that CnGV is a ubiquitous
   mode of reaction-norm evolution in ectotherms even in response to weak
   spatial and, by inference, temporal climate gradients. A novel,
   large-scale comparison between ecologically equivalent Pacific versus
   Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) revealed how closely growth CnGV
   patterns reflect their respective climate gradients. While steep growth
   reaction norms and increasing growth plasticity with latitude in M.
   menidia mimicked the strong, highly seasonal Atlantic coastal gradient,
   shallow reaction norms and much smaller, latitude-independent growth
   plasticity in A. affinis resembled the weak Pacific latitudinal
   temperature gradient.},

Abstract = {The representation of ocean heat uptake in Simple Climate Models used
   for policy advice on climate change mitigation strategies is often based
   on variants of the one-dimensional Vertical Advection/Diffusion equation
   (VAD) for some averaged form of potential temperature. In such models,
   the effective advection and turbulent diffusion are usually tuned to
   emulate the behaviour of a given target climate model. However, because
   the statistical nature of such a ``behavioural{''} calibration usually
   obscures the exact dependence of the effective diffusion and advection
   on the actual physical processes responsible for ocean heat uptake, it
   is difficult to understand its limitations and how to go about improving
   VADs. This paper proposes a physical calibration of the VAD that aims to
   provide explicit traceability of effective diffusion and advection to
   the processes responsible for ocean heat uptake. This construction
   relies on the coarse-graining of the full three-dimensional advection
   diffusion for potential temperature using potential temperature
   coordinates. The main advantage of this formulation is that the temporal
   evolution of the reference temperature profile is entirely due to the
   competition between effective diffusivity that is always positive
   definite, and the water mass transformation taking place at the surface,
   as in classical water mass analyses literature. These quantities are
   evaluated in numerical simulations of present day climate and global
   warming experiments. In this framework, the heat uptake in the global
   warming experiment is attributed to the increase of surface heat flux at
   low latitudes, its decrease at high latitudes and to the redistribution
   of heat toward cold temperatures made by diffusive flux.},

   Seas},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {634-653},
Abstract = {The land-sea interface is a complex social-ecological system
   characterized by natural ecological processes and human-induced changes.
   Holistic management of the shoreline is a critical element of an
   ecosystem-based approach to the land-sea interface in coastal zone
   management (CZM) programs. Anthropogenic alteration of shoreline
   environments has resulted in significant loss of sandy beach ecosystems
   and eroded the resilience of these systems to disturbance. We tested the
   efficacy of CZM programs in managing the land-sea interface under
   current and future challenges by comparing alternative approaches to
   shoreline management in two U. S. states (Hawai'i and North Carolina).
   Our results show that explicit prohibition of shoreline armoring has
   been more effective in conserving dynamic coastal environments and
   communities by passing the risk associated with coastal development from
   the public trust to private landowners. Over the long-term, robust
   anti-armoring legislation will de-incentivize risky coastal development
   projects while preserving coastal environments and the ecological
   services they provide to society. Policy prescriptions for effective
   shoreline management and increased coastal resilience under persistent
   coastal erosion and future sea-level rise are proposed.},

Title = {Nature-Based Solutions for Co-mitigation of Air Pollution and Urban Heat
   in Indian Cities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {The urban population is subjected to multiple exposures of air pollution
   and heat stress and bear severe impacts on their health and well-being
   in terms of premature deaths and morbidity. India tops the list of
   countries with the highest air pollution exposure and hosts some of the
   most polluted cities in the world. Similarly, Indian cities are highly
   vulnerable to extreme heat with the frequency of heatwaves expected to
   increase several-fold in urban areas in India. It is reported that
   mitigating air pollution could reduce the rural-urban difference of the
   incoming radiation thus resulting in mitigation of the urban heat island
   effect. Since the interaction between urban heat and air pollution is
   dynamic and complex, both these factors should be considered by the
   urban authorities in designing mitigation strategies. Given the
   multi-functional nature and cost-effectiveness of Nature-Based Solutions
   (NbS), they appear to be the most appropriate remedy for environmental
   issues of urban areas, particularly in developing countries. In addition
   to improving public health (through the reduction in air pollution and
   urban heat), NbS also provides a wide range of co-benefits such as
   reducing energy cost and health costs as well as conservation of
   biodiversity. This review is an attempt to understand the potentials of
   NbS in co-mitigating air pollution and urban heat in Indian cities. A
   framework for the planning and design of NbS in Indian cities is also
   proposed based on the review that could help city planners and
   decision-makers in addressing these two issues in an integrated manner.},

Title = {Spatial dimensions of dichotomous adaptive responses to natural hazards
   in coastal districts of West Bengal, India},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Developing countries continue to reel under the impact of hydro
   meteorological disasters which have been aggravated by climate change.
   Communities exposed to such vagaries of nature continuously strive to
   adapt to such events. These adaptive practices can be traced spatially
   through transformations in Land Use Land Cover (LULC). This study
   hypothesizes that these spatial transformations are a function of the
   spatial manifestation due to changes in livelihood practices resulting
   from exposure to natural hazards. Moreover, the spatial dimensions of
   changes observed are dichotomous in nature and express themselves
   differently based on local stimuli. LULC transformations between the
   period 2002-2014, along with socio-economic data and semi-structured
   interviews were used to identify the drivers of LULC changes in coastal
   districts of West Bengal, India. In this study, evidence of
   transformations triggered by natural hazards are differently expressed
   for zone in proximity to coastal areas and zone in proximity to a
   primate metropolitan area. Results from the analyses show three
   predominant changes - increasing trends from agriculture to aquaculture
   practices in coastal tidal influence Blocks (270.39\%), trends of rapid
   urbanization, and increases of the built-up (rural) area in Blocks
   adjoining the metropolitan area (58.18\%). Statistical analyses revealed
   that the changes in the area under aquaculture can be attributed to
   change in area under agriculture practice and accessibility to a station
   of suburban railway network. Similarly, for Blocks in the rural areas,
   it was observed that the change in the built-up area can be explained by
   existing built-up area/fallow land and its distance from the district
   headquarter.},

Title = {Skill Assessment of Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction of Sea Level
   Anomaly in the North Pacific Based on the SINTEX-F Climate Model},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Extreme sea level rise seriously impacts habitation and is indicative of
   changes in primary production in the North Pacific. Because of its
   rising trend associated with global warming, skillful
   seasonal-to-interannual predictions have become increasingly valuable to
   guide the introduction of suitable adaptation measures that help us
   reduce the risks of socioeconomic losses. Here, we have used a dynamical
   coupled ocean-atmosphere model called ``SINTER-F{''} to revisit the
   potential predictability of sea level anomalies at a lead of up to about
   2 years. Skillful prediction is found mainly in the tropical Pacific as
   shown in previous work. Here, we found a new skillful prediction region
   in the North Pacific (30 degrees-40 degrees N, 180 degrees-150 degrees
   W) at about 2 years' lead time. We also analyzed the covariability among
   ensemble members and found the long-lasting ENSO/ENSO-Modoki in the
   tropical Pacific seems to contribute to the predictability source. The
   result may be useful to develop systematic and synergistic attempts to
   predict marine ecosystem responses to regional and global climate
   variations.},

Title = {Sustainable Groundwater Exploitation Aiming at the Reduction of Water
   Vulnerability in the Brazilian Semi-Arid Region},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Semi-arid regions have historically suffered from low water
   availability. In addition, the increasing frequency and intensity of
   extreme weather events credited to global climate change has made it
   increasingly clear that among the challenges faced by society water
   resource management is extremely necessary. In this context,
   desalination based on renewable energy resources integrated with
   production systems that make use of the waste resulting from this
   process becomes a socio-environmentally indicated alternative to expand
   existing supply strategies and sustainable water use in isolated
   locations, and/or areas distant from large urban centers, thus
   addressing local potential and reducing environmental impacts. This
   study assesses the use of Photovoltaic Solar Power Plants (PSPPs), as
   well as of residues generated in a Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis System
   (BWRO), in productive units linked to fish and family farming. This is
   as an alternative way to reduce water vulnerability in the Brazilian
   semi-arid area (BS), adhering to climate change adaptation measures in
   the light of Brazilian public policies through the Freshwater Program
   (Programa agua DocePAD), which aims to promote access to good quality
   water to approximately 500 thousand people in the Brazilian semi-arid
   region.},

Title = {Resilience to Climate Change in Industrial Shrimping in Bangladesh:
   Assessing the Comparative Role of the Stakeholders},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Over the last few decades, the global shrimp aquaculture industry has
   grown considerably and experienced important transformations in coastal
   regions in the Global South. However, despite being a major contributor
   to GDP and export earnings of the country, the shrimp industry in
   Bangladesh is not yet fully developed. This important sector is often
   plagued by numerous environmental challenges including frequent climate
   disasters. To address local climate perturbations, the shrimping
   industry undertakes a wide range of individual, communal, and
   institutional level resilience activities. Drawing on primary data
   collected through ethnography and qualitative interviews in three
   shrimping communities, this paper examines the nature, effects, and
   efficacy of resilience strategies adopted by various stakeholders in the
   shrimp industry in coastal Bangladesh. This research demonstrates that
   there is a clearly visible resilience gradient in the shrimp aquaculture
   industry in Bangladesh: individual shrimp farmers and households play a
   pivotal role in resilience enhancement, while other stakeholders
   including community, state, and civil society organizations have
   moderate-to-little involvement in aiding resilience in the sector. The
   study offers a series of recommendations for resilience to climate
   change.},

Abstract = {The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is a common phenomenon in many cities
   across the world that has significant socioeconomic and environmental
   ramifications. Recognizing the significance of taking measures to
   mitigate the UHI effect, a vast body of research has been published,
   over the past few decades, on this topic. Existing research covers
   various climatic contexts and has significantly improved our
   understanding of the dynamics of the UHI. However, there is a lack of
   research on the potential linkages between the physical form of urban
   streets and the UHI effect. The results of such research can be used to
   develop planning and design strategies for achieving climate-resilient
   urban development. As a step toward filling this gap, in this study, we
   use a mixed-methods approach, involving graph theory and spatial
   statistics to examine the relationship between the UHI effect and
   selected urban form measures such as street network connectivity, street
   network centrality, and land-use in Izmir, Turkey. Results show that the
   UHI effect is more intense in areas with higher levels of street network
   centrality. On the contrary, higher connectivity of the urban street
   network is associated with lower levels of the UHI effect.},

Abstract = {This article presents the development to reliably seal copper canisters
   containing the Swedish nuclear waste, using friction stir welding. To
   avoid defects and welding tool fractures, it is important to control the
   welding temperature within a span of 790-910 degrees C. A cascade
   controller is used to efficiently suppress fast power input disturbances
   reducing their impact on the temperature. The controller is tuned using
   a recently presented method for robust PID control. Results show that
   the controller keeps the temperature within +/- 10 degrees C during the
   40 min long joint line sequences. Apart from the cascaded control
   structure, good process knowledge and control strategies adapted to
   different weld sequences have contributed to the successful results. (C)

Pages = {251-263},
Abstract = {The potential effects of climate change on large coastal cities have
   been addressed in scientific literature over the past 10-15 years.
   Climate change and sea level rise may exacerbate flood risks as well as
   river peak discharges. As a consequence, the vulnerability of
   infrastructure, people, nature and other economic sectors is increasing.
   Future climatic developments need to be taken into account in current
   urban and port development plans. It is important to reserve the space
   that will be required in the future for water storage, and to prepare
   projects that will be necessary to enhance protection against flooding
   and guarantee accessibility. In addition, design and construction
   concepts have to be adjusted both at the level of urban planning and at
   the individual building level. Taking these steps now will generate
   innovations that can also be marketed elsewhere in a later phase. This
   chapter discusses the water sensitive design initiatives that Rotterdam
   is taking, using climate change as a catalyst for urban design that is
   `climate proof' but also using water to improve the overall urban
   environment.
   The city of Rotterdam has decided to make the region `climate proof', in
   other words, to create a system that is sufficiently robust and that can
   adapt in good time to changes as they occur.
   Innovative applications in the area of water management will make the
   city more attractive. Examples include the construction of water plazas
   and floating structures.},

   the Pacific: Community narratives from Port Vila, Vanuatu},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services play a key role in maintaining community resilience
   and wellbeing; a function increasingly profiled following the
   publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. However, there is
   limited understanding of the value of, and threats to, `urban' ecosystem
   services, especially in relation to Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS). This study uses a bottom-up approach to investigate the
   provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural benefits of local
   ecosystems to urban communities in Port Vila, Vanuatu. The project was
   based on participatory action research carried out for the Pacific
   Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) as part of the Pacific
   Ecosystem-based Adaptation to Climate Change Project. Based on a survey
   of 821 households, and 10 community workshops, this paper provides a
   narrative of the terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal ecosystem services
   salient to the livelihoods of vulnerable urban communities. This
   narrative is set in the context of rapid urbanisation and climate
   change, which are increasingly undermining community resilience. These
   findings stress the urgent need to better understand, and account for,
   complex socio-ecological relationships when developing adaptation
   policies and urban development plans, not only in Vanuatu but across
   Oceania's cities and towns.},

Abstract = {This paper outlines the benefits of using the framework for an ecosystem
   approach to fisheries management (EAFM) for dealing with the inevitable
   yet unclear impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on coastal
   fisheries. With a focus on the Asia-Pacific region, it summarizes the
   projected biological and socio-economic effects of increased emissions
   of carbon dioxide (CO2) for coastal fisheries and illustrates how all
   the important dimensions of climate change and ocean acidification can
   be integrated into the steps involved in the EAFM planning process. The
   activities required to harness the full potential of an EAFM as an
   adaptation to climate change and ocean acidification are also described,
   including: provision of the necessary expertise to inform all
   stakeholders about the risks to fish habitats, fish stocks and catches
   due to climate change; promotion of trans-disciplinary collaboration;
   facilitating the participation of all key stakeholders; monitoring the
   wider fisheries system for climate impacts; and enhancing resources and
   capacity to implement an EAFM. By channeling some of the resources
   available to the Asia-Pacific region to adapt to climate change into an
   EAFM, developing countries will not only build resilience to the
   ecological and fisheries effects of climate change, they will also help
   address the habitat degradation and overfishing presently reducing the
   productivity of coastal fisheries. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Risk estimation for future glacier lake outburst floods based on local
   land-use changes},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1611-1624},
Abstract = {Effects of climate change are particularly strong in high-mountain
   regions. Most visibly, glaciers are shrinking at a rapid pace, and as a
   consequence, glacier lakes are forming or growing. At the same time the
   stability of mountain slopes is reduced by glacier retreat, permafrost
   thaw and other factors, resulting in an increasing landslide hazard
   which can potentially impact lakes and therewith trigger far-reaching
   and devastating outburst floods. To manage risks from existing or future
   lakes, strategies need to be developed to plan in time for adequate risk
   reduction measures at a local level. However, methods to assess risks
   from future lake outbursts are not available and need to be developed to
   evaluate both future hazard and future damage potential.
   Here a method is presented to estimate future risks related to glacier
   lake outbursts for a local site in southern Switzerland (Naters,
   Valais). To generate two hazard scenarios, glacier shrinkage and lake
   formation modelling was applied, combined with simple flood modelling
   and field work. Furthermore, a land-use model was developed to quantify
   and allocate land-use changes based on local-to-regional storylines and
   three scenarios of land-use driving forces. Results are conceptualized
   in a matrix of three land-use and two hazard scenarios for the year
   2045, and show the distribution of risk in the community of Naters,
   including high and very high risk areas. The study underlines the
   importance of combined risk management strategies focusing on land-use
   planning, on vulnerability reduction, as well as on structural measures
   (where necessary) to effectively reduce future risks related to lake
   outburst floods.},

Abstract = {Decisions on how to manage future flood risks are frequently informed by
   both sophisticated and computationally expensive models. This complexity
   often limits the representation of uncertainties and the consideration

   that enables us to analyze a richer set of strategies, a wider range of
   objectives, and greater levels of uncertainty than are typically
   considered by more sophisticated and computationally expensive models.
   We find that allowing for more combinations of risk mitigation
   strategies can help expand the solution set, help explain synergies and
   trade-offs, and point to strategies that can improve outcomes.},

   Acropora},
Journal = {CONSERVATION LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Identifying organisms that play an important role in maintaining
   ecosystem function is a key aspect of resilience-based management. For
   Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), we found that the recovery ability
   of shallow exposed fore-reefs is more than 14 times higher when tabular
   Acropora are present. The disproportionate role that tabular Acropora
   play appears to be driven by a combination of traits including high
   recruitment, high growth rate and, importantly, large maximum colony
   sizes. Despite this key role, tabular Acropora are highly sensitive to
   most pressures. We compile evidence suggesting that if tabular corals
   were to decline or disappear on the GBR, the potential for reef recovery
   on exposed fore-reefs would be considerably slowed. We then consider the
   merits of placing special emphasis on the protection of tabular Acropora
   within the management of the GBR. Importantly, we recognise that an
   analysis of costs and benefits of such recognition is vital before any
   change is implemented. Actions might include targeted crown-of-thorns
   starfish control, anchoring restrictions and protection for tabular
   corals on reefs identified as essential for their larval dispersal. In
   addition, targeted communications about the critical importance of these
   highly recognisable corals may boost community support and participation
   in their protection.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {235-245},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean Basin is expected to be more strongly affected by
   ongoing climate change than most other regions of the earth. The
   South-eastern France can be considered as case study for assessing
   global change impacts on forests. Based on non-parametric statistical
   tests, the climatic parameters (temperature, relative humidity,
   rainfall, global radiation) and forest-response indicators (crown
   defoliation, discoloration and visible foliar ozone injury) of two pine
   species (Pinus halepensis and Pinus cembra) were analyzed. In the last
   20 years, the trend analyses reveal a clear hotter and drier climate
   along the coastline and slightly rainier inland. In the current climate
   change context, a reduction in ground-level ozone (O-3) was found at
   remote sites and the visible foliar O-3 injury decreased while
   deterioration of the crown conditions was observed likely due to a drier
   and warmer climate. Clearly, if such climatic and ecological changes are
   now being detected when the climate, in South-eastern France, has warmed
   in the last 20 years (+0.46-1.08 degrees C), it can be expected that
   many more impacts on tree species will occur in response to predicted
   temperature changes by 2100 (+1.95-4.59 degrees C). Climate change is
   projected to reduce the benefits of O-3 precursor emissions controls
   leading to a higher O-3 uptake. However, the drier and warmer climate
   should induce a soil drought leading to a lower O-3 uptake. These two
   effects, acting together in an opposite way, could mitigate the harmful
   impacts of O-3 on forests. The development of coordinated emission
   abatement strategies is useful to reduce both climate change and O-3
   pollution. Climate change will create additional challenges for forest
   management with substantial socio-economic and biological diversity
   impacts. However, the development of future sustainable and adaptive
   forest management strategies has the potential to reduce the
   vulnerability of forest species to climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study explores the possibility of using adaptive filters to predict
   sea-water quality indicators such as water temperature, pH and dissolved
   oxygen based on measurements produced by an under-water measurement
   set-up. Two alternative adaptive approaches are tested, namely a
   projection algorithm and a least squares algorithm. These algorithms
   were chosen for comparison because they are widely used prediction
   algorithms. The results indicate that if the measurements remain
   reasonably stationary, it is possible to make one-day ahead predictions,
   which perform better than the prediction that the value of a certain
   quality variable tomorrow is going to be equal to the value today. (C)

Abstract = {Salt marshes reduce wave energy and offer natural protection from storms
   and floods. In the last centuries these coastal areas have been
   intensely impacted by human activities worldwide. In northern Spain,
   more than 50\% of the original salt marshes have been reclaimed with
   agricultural purposes since the 17th century. However, many of these
   coastal wetlands have been recovered since the agricultural decline
   during the 1950s. Benthic foraminifera and sand content can be used as
   proxies to identify past episodes of salt-marsh reclamation and to
   analyze the environmental regeneration process of previously occupied
   lands. Foraminifera are absent in agricultural soils and increase in
   abundance during the regeneration of the area, until total recovery is
   reached. Similarly, sand content increases as tidal inundation takes
   place during the environmental regeneration period. The physical
   disturbance originated by reclamation presents a challenge for the
   Pb-210 dating method. Nevertheless, historical aerial photography
   provides a good record for age estimation. This can be supported by
   chronostratigraphic horizons of major pollution events and nuclear
   weapon testing (i.e. heavy metals and Cs-137). In the current context of
   sea-level rise, sediment supply constrains the environmental
   regeneration of salt marshes. In northern Spain, abundant regional
   sediment input is available, allowing high sedimentation rates to happen
   during the regeneration process and facilitating adaptation to ongoing
   sea-level rise. Therefore, restoration of currently reclaimed tidal
   wetlands in global temperate coastal areas, with abundant sediment
   supply, can be considered as a soft adaptation measure against climate
   change consequences in the coastal zone.},

Abstract = {Climate change and its association with sea level rise `SLR' have become
   a true fact that increasingly challenge coastal zones all over the
   world. This study attempts to fill the lack of studies and assessments
   of the African coasts through developing a SLR vulnerability assessment.
   The study has customized coastal vulnerability index `CVI' to include
   seventeen parameters grouping in the vulnerability's pillars: exposure,
   sensitivity, and resilience. The selected variables represent the main
   coastal characteristics physically and socioeconomically. The study
   applies CVI method for the African coastal zone using GIS and remote
   sensing. However, the study has followed the case study approach on the
   continental level of Africa, and the results have classified coastal
   areas into different degrees of vulnerabilities. Application of CEI
   equation showed that about 40\% of African coast are ranging from
   moderate to very high exposure, as for the CSI equation showed that 75\%
   of African coast are ranging from moderate to very high sensitivity, as
   for the CRI equation showed that 55\% of African coast are ranging from
   moderate to very high resilience, and as for the CVI equation showed
   that 35\% of the 26,000 km length of Africa's coasts are vulnerable to
   SLR. It has been approved that deltas are the most vulnerable areas
   along the African coasts. Also, values of CVI pillars for each of these
   deltas showed great variation, which accordingly could give an indicator
   for adaptation and mitigation strategies of Africa's coasts at regional
   and national levels, which could be one strategy or more: protection,
   accommodation, and retreat strategies.},

Abstract = {This study examines an innovative Coastal Reservoir (CR) technique as a
   feasible solution for flood adaptation and mitigation in the Brisbane
   River Estuary (BRE), Australia, which is vulnerable to coastal flooding.
   The study analysed the operation of a CR by using the MIKE 21
   hydrodynamic modelling package. The 2D hydrodynamic model was calibrated
   and validated for the 2013 and 2011 flood events respectively, with a
   Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E-ns) between 0.87 to 0.97 at all gauges.
   River right branch widening and dredging produced a 0.16 m reduction in
   water level at the Brisbane city gauge. The results show that by
   suitable gate operation of CR, the 2011 flood normal observed level of
   4.46 m, with reference to the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at Brisbane
   city, could have been reduced to 3.88 m AHD, while under the improved
   management operation of the Wivenhoe Dam, the flood level could be
   lowered to 4 m AHD at Brisbane city, which could have been reduced with
   CR to 2.87 m AHD with an overall water level reduction below the maximum
   flood level. The results demonstrated that the innovative use of a CR
   could considerably decrease the overall flood peak and lessen flood
   severity in the coastal city of Brisbane.},

Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) and storm surge have significant impacts on tourism
   properties and activities in the low-lying coastal region. Coastal
   tourism in Zhejiang Province, China, is physically and socioeconomically
   susceptible to the flood risk posed by accelerated SLR and intensified
   storm surge. In this paper, within a scenario design of SLR and storm
   surge, a GIS-based dataset of major coastal tourist attractions in
   coastal Zhejiang is created to assess their potential flood risk by
   using a simple inundation model and a risk matrix. It is estimated that
   only two resorts would be directly flooded by a SLR of 1-2 m, but
   extensive inundation of coastal tourism communities may occur during
   low-frequency surges, especially after adding predicted 1-m SLR. The
   risk assessment further shows that a majority of the exposed sites is
   subject to moderate and low risk at current state but would be at higher
   (moderate and high)-risk categories in the future. In the long term, a
   combination of adaption measures is presented for policy-makers and
   other stakeholders for sustainable flood risk management in coastal
   tourism destinations.},

Title = {Maladaptive diffusion? The spread of hard protection to adapt to coastal
   erosion and flooding along island coasts in the Pacific and Indian Ocean},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion occurs along many of the world's shorelines, but is of
   particular concern to small islands. In response, island shorelines are
   often armoured through engineered structures such as seawalls, rip-raps,
   dikes or similar. Such hard protection is rarely successful in island
   contexts; rather than stop erosion, hard protection often simply
   redistributes and sometimes exacerbates shoreline erosion, and fails to
   protect property, land and food production. Such hard-protection
   structures frequently collapse shortly after construction. Why then does
   hard protection remain widespread? We argue that diffusion, specifically
   learning and emulation, helps explain the spread of hard protection.
   Island communities learn from the apparent effectiveness of hard
   protection in some contexts, and consider it an appropriate and accepted
   response to coastal erosion, regardless of its actual consequences
   (emulation). Case studies from the Pacific (Fiji, Federated States of
   Micronesia) and Indian Ocean (Maldives, Mauritius) show that both
   mechanisms are at work in small island states (SIDS) and may be mutually
   reinforcing. The case studies underline the role of the specific context
   in the understanding of not only why a specific adaptation measure is
   introduced, but also how it may change and evolve over time-and
   accordingly, when and how communities can move to more effective and
   sustainable alternatives to hard protection.},

Abstract = {There is an urgent need for an effective and harmonized framework to
   develop climate resilient solutions to ensure the necessary level of
   security in energy production and supply. Energetic sector will have to
   adapt not only to changes in mean climate but also it has to cope with
   an increased climate variability whose effects could hamper the security
   in energy production and supply with remarkable social and economic
   impacts. This study aimed to analyze the incremental changes of
   temperature and precipitations, and the changes of some extreme events
   such as droughts, storms and floods, wet-snow and coldwaves, as well as
   fire danger over Italy at medium and long terms.
   The investigation has been done on the basis of highresolution climate
   models provided by three EU-funded Projects: ENSEMBLES (horizontal
   resolution of 25 km), Med-CORDEX and Euro-CORDEX (horizontal resolution
   of 0.11 degrees, about 12 km) under different green-house gas forcings.
   The climate change scenarios have been characterized by comparing the
   current climate (1971-2000) with medium (FUT1=2021-2050) and long term
   (FUT2=2051-2080) future scenarios.
   The more significant results highlight a warmer and drier climate (1 -
   1.5 degrees C), above all in summer with a temperature increase of about
   2 degrees C and a precipitation reduction of 20\% by 2050. Extreme
   events have been investigated by using some threshold values to select
   particular weather conditions, and by computing some indicators (a
   sub-set of the ETCCDI indexes), specifically defined to describe extreme
   weather and climate events. The results highlight an exacerbation of the
   hazards, projected to become more serious in the second part of the
   century respect to the first one: the heat waves occurrences will likely
   increase of about 20 - 30\% in the next decades, and 40 - 50\% after the
   middle of the century; droughts are expected to become more frequent
   over time, increasing of about 5\% and 10 - 20\% in FUT1 and FUT2
   respectively; storms and floods are projected to increase locally from
   10\% to 30\%, specially over coast areas during spring and autumn
   seasons. Instead wet-snow events are expected to damp ranging from less
   than -5\% to -10\% over the century. Analogously cold waves are likely
   to reduce of about 10 - 20\% and 30 - 40\% in FUT1 and FUT2 scenarios.
   Lastly, it is expected a lengthening of fire season and an increase of
   fire danger of at least 20\% by 2050 in most of Italy in summer .},

Abstract = {Like most ectothermic species, American lobster growing in warmer
   environments mature at smaller sizes. A formal quantification of this
   pattern at multiple spatiotemporal scales has not been developed,
   impeding the development of tools to predict the impacts of climate
   change on American lobster life history and fishery. In this study, data
   from sea sampling programs from southern New England to the Bay of Fundy
   are used to estimate female lobster size at maturity, and to quantify
   the effects of water temperature on maturity at three spatial scales: i)
   regional (similar to 1000 km), ii) stock (100 s km), and iii)

   Results: show that female lobsters living in warmer waters mature at
   smaller sizes and that other factors, likely fishing, also contributed
   to the observed decrease in length at 50\% maturity. This study suggests
   that adaptive management plans need to consider temperature-induced
   trends in size at maturity to ensure sustainability of the valuable
   American lobster fisheries. Additionally, this study provides a maturity
   function for use in models that aim to project effects of climate change
   on American lobster populations and fisheries dynamics. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {The characterization of Pacific Islands as especially vulnerable to
   climate change often undervalues the cultural resilience of their
   inhabitants. On many Micronesian islands, coastal stone-built structures
   are the most visible type of tangible cultural resilience and have
   endured for perhaps 1000 years or more. A distinction is recognized
   between older structures, likely built in response to sea-level rise
   during the Medieval Warm Period (AD 750-1250), and more recent
   structures that likely took advantage of the lowered sea level during
   the Little Ice Age (AD 1350-1800). Detailed studies of Micronesian
   responses to recent coastal change were undertaken in the islands of Yap
   (Proper). The positioning and maintenance of coastal men's houses
   (faluw) reflect either pragmatic responses to unmanageable coastal
   change or a cultural determination to resist this. The long history of
   traditional responses to climate variability and coastal change for
   terrestrial food production on Yap is also discussed. Future adaptation
   pathways on Yap and other higher islands in Micronesia need to combine
   scientific knowledge of climate change with traditional responses to
   historical change, including the stonework tradition and the cultural
   determination to resist undesired coastal change.},

   sites of northern Chhattisgarh, India},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change is a major issue across the globe. Therefore, carbon (C)
   assimilation and storage is the key management strategy for mitigating
   climate change. The present investigation was carried out in two
   riparian sites i.e., Maini and Machhli river of northern Chhattisgarh,
   India, through stratified random sampling. Results reveal that
   vegetation beside Maini river was represented by 22 species of tree, 17
   species of saplings, 12 species of seedlings, 5 shrub species and 15
   herb species and total density value was 1410-460,000 individuals/ha.
   The vegetation in Machhli river was represented by 14 species of tree,
   15 species of sapling, 14 species of seedling, 10 shrub and herb species
   each and the total density value was 830-440,000 individuals/ha. The
   diversity indices were higher for tree and herb layer in Maini river
   while in Machhli river the diversity indices value were higher for
   sapling, seedling and shrub layer. Terminalia arjuna, Shorea robusta and
   Mangifera indica contributed maximum total biomass (58.23\%) at Maini
   river. In Machhli river, 73\% of total biomass was contributed by
   Terminalia arjuna, Leucana leucocephala and Ficus heterophylla. Higher
   biomass accumulation, C stock and CO2 mitigation were found in 30-50 cm
   girth class in both sites. The total C stock and CO2 mitigation ranged
   between 60.54-77.58 t/ha and 222.10-284.84 t/ha for both the sites,
   respectively. Results reveal significant contribution of riparian
   vegetation towards biomass accumulation, C storage and CO2 mitigation.
   Such study under tropical condition would help to formulate policy
   towards restoring degraded riparian vegetation and combating climate
   change.},

Abstract = {The causes of overfishing are reviewed along with deficiencies in

   marine ecosystems; the second are targets that account for the
   bioeconomics of fisheries; and the third, adaptive management practices,
   especially marine protected areas, that promote resilience against
   ecosystem disturbances. Collectively, the three pillars offer a
   practical and proven combination to ` turn the tide' and help overcome
   the overexploitation prevalent in many of the world's marine capture

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper presents the key contributions of marine cultural heritage to
   the survival of coastal ecosystems and the communities that rely on them
   in East Africa. Marine cultural heritage (MCH) describes the evidence of
   past human interactions with coastal and marine space, encompassing
   tangible material culture remains and associated intangible cultural
   expressions within coastal communities. By incorporating the protection
   of MCH into local and regional environmental frameworks, we gain an
   essential indicator to monitor change dynamics in natural habitats, the
   cumulative impacts of climate change, and the development of social
   adaptation strategies. An essential aspect of this development is the
   move away from global sustainability strategies towards
   community-centric management and stewardship. Such processes utilise a
   combination of traditional knowledge systems and scientific approaches
   designed to harness targeted economic, ecological, and social
   sustainable development. To argue for the incorporation of MCH into
   local and regional environmental frameworks in the area, this paper
   presents four case studies from the Rising from the Depths Network, a
   challenge-led research network focusing on harnessing the potential of
   MCH to bring sustainable development strategies to East Africa.},

Title = {Implementing Regional Sea Use Planning system in China: Evolution,
   drivers and experiences},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Regional Sea Use Planning (RSUP) system, initiated in 2006 and
   terminated in 2018 in China, required a concentrated layout and unified
   planning for multiple reclamation projects in the same coastal area to
   improve reclamation management. In this study, we investigated the
   driving factors and challenges by analysing policy evolution, temporal
   and spatial changes of the approved reclamation area under RSUP system,
   and utilisation efficiency of reclamation land. Our results show that
   the progress of RSUP in China was strongly influenced by macro policies
   and the economy, local industrial structure, and bottom-level governance
   system. First, RSUP items increased steadily from 2006 to 2008, peaked
   from 2009 to 2012, and decreased sharply thereafter, indicating that the
   policy adjustment and the trend of economic fluctuation has played a
   crucial role in pro-moting or controlling reclamation. Second, the
   reclamation scale curve of each coastal region was highly consistent
   with the proportion curve of the marine secondary industry. This implies
   that the coastal industrial structure largely relied on traditional
   land-based secondary industry has led to a surge in RSUP items.
   Moreover, the reclamation completion rate of 79.7\% and construction
   rate of 24.8\% exposed the excessive conversion of the sea to land, and
   the main reason is that the bottom-up governance process of the RSUP
   system did not coincide with its top-down decision-making process.
   Hence, adaptive management is an important approach for coastal
   reclamation policymaking, marine industrial structure should be
   redesigned to become less dependent on sec-ondary industry, and the
   bottom-level governance system must be improved to connect effectively
   to the top-level design. The experiences gained from China's RSUP system
   are highly important and relevant even to other countries, as the policy
   implications from this study would inform reclamation and other sea use
   man-agement policies.},

Title = {Strong influence of north Pacific Ocean variability on Indian summer
   heatwaves},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {New study finds that Summer Indian heatwaves are controlled by the large
   scale atmospheric circulation associated with the Pacific Meridional
   Mode.
   Increased occurrence of heatwaves across different parts of the world is
   one of the characteristic signatures of anthropogenic warming. With a
   1.3 billion population, India is one of the hot spots that experience
   deadly heatwaves during May-June - yet the large-scale physical
   mechanism and teleconnection patterns driving such events remain poorly
   understood. Here using observations and controlled climate model
   experiments, we demonstrate a significant footprint of the far-reaching
   Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM) on the heatwave intensity (and duration)
   across North Central India (NCI) - the high risk region prone to
   heatwaves. A strong positive phase of PMM leads to a significant
   increase in heatwave intensity and duration over NCI (0.8-2 degrees C
   and 3-6 days; p < 0.05) and vice-versa. The current generation (CMIP6)
   climate models that adequately capture the PMM and their responses to
   NCI heatwaves, project significantly higher intensities of future
   heatwaves (0.5-1 degrees C; p < 0.05) compared to all model ensembles.
   These differences in the intensities of heatwaves could significantly
   increase the mortality (by approximate to 150\%) and therefore can have
   substantial implications on designing the mitigation and adaptation
   strategies.},

Title = {Urban neighborhood characteristics influence on a building indoor
   environment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {403-413},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) is exacerbated during heat waves, which have
   been reported to be more frequent in recent years. Unwanted consequences
   of the UHI not only include an increase in mean/peak energy demand, but
   an escalation in the heat-related mortality and disease. Although UHI
   mitigation strategies are being implemented by cities, they serve as mid
   to long-term solutions. The implementation of short-term mitigation
   strategies is paramount for cities to reduce the immediate risks of the
   heatrelated hazards. Various prognostic tools have been developed to
   empower urban planners and decision makers in minimizing the related
   risks. These tools are mainly based on stationary parameters, such as
   the average surface temperature of a city, and are independent of
   land-use/land-cover (LULC). Furthermore, the outdoor temperatures are
   utilized to develop such models. However, heat-related risks occur
   mostly in indoor spaces, and correlations between indoor and outdoor
   spaces are rarely considered.
   In this study, a predictive model for the indoor air temperature of
   buildings is developed using the artificial neural network (ANN)
   concept. A four-month measurement campaign was conducted to obtain
   indoor temperatures of more than 50 buildings located on the island of
   Montreal. The area is then separated into 11 regions, each containing at
   least one of the measured buildings. The ANN model is then trained to be
   sensitive to the neighborhood's characteristics and LULC of each region.
   The surrounding radial area that influences the building's indoor
   temperature is first defined within an effective radius, by analyzing
   areas with radii ranging from 20 m to 500 m in 20 m increments. Hence,
   the effective radius is found for each region to be within a radial
   area, where the environment beyond its limit does not significantly
   impact the building indoor air temperature. This technique trains a
   single model for the city, encompassing the unique characteristics of
   the sub-regions that contain buildings under study. An effective radius
   was established to lie within 320-380 m. Analyzing surrounding radial
   areas within this range enabled the network to effectively forecast
   future indoor conditions resulting from UHI effects, producing hourly
   indoor temperature predictions with an MSE of 0.68. Furthermore, the
   ability of the developed tool in the city planning is investigated with
   an additional case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Meta-analysis reveals complex marine biological responses to the

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1016-1030},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification and warming are considered two of the greatest
   threats to marine biodiversity, yet the combined effect of these
   stressors on marine organisms remains largely unclear. Using a
   meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine
   organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation
   and combination. As expected biological responses varied across
   taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but
   importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger
   biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of
   orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological
   responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and
   survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and
   acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting
   stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from
   single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the
   development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that
   the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely
   to intensify in the future. There is now an urgent need to move toward
   more robust, holistic, and ecologically realistic climate change
   experiments that incorporate interactions. Without them accurate
   predictions about the likely deleterious impacts to marine biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning over the next century will not be possible.},

Title = {Parameterization Framework and Quantification Approach for Integrated
   Risk and Resilience Assessments},
Journal = {INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-146},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A growing challenge for risk, vulnerability, and resilience assessment
   is the ability to understand, characterize, and model the complexities
   of our joint socioecological systems, often delineated with differing
   natural (e.g., watershed) and imposed (e.g., political) boundaries at
   the landscape scale. To effectively manage such systems in the
   increasingly dynamic, adaptive context of environmental change, we need
   to understand not just food web interactions of contaminants or the
   flooding impacts of sea level rise and storm surges, but rather the
   interplay between social and ecological components within the inherent
   and induced feedforward and feedback system mechanisms. Risk assessment,
   in its traditional implementation, is a simplification of a complex
   problem to understand the basic cause-and-effect relationships within a
   system. This approach allows risk assessors to distill a complex issue
   into a manageable model that quantifies, or semiquantifies, the effects
   of an adverse stressor. Alternatively, an integrated risk and resilience
   assessment moves toward a solution-based assessment with the
   incorporation of adaptive management practices as 1 of 4 parts of system
   resilience (i.e., prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt), and directly
   considers the complexities of the systems being modeled. We present the
   Multilevel Risk and Resilience Assessment Parameterization framework for
   the systematic parameterization and deconstruction of management
   objectives and goals into assessment metrics and quantifiable risk
   measurement metrics and complementary resilience measurement metrics. As
   a proof-of-concept, the presented framework is paired with the Bayesian
   Network-Relative Risk Model for a human-focused subset of a larger risk
   and resilience assessment of climate change impacts within the
   Charleston Harbor Watershed of South Carolina. This new parameterization
   framework goes beyond traditional simplification and embraces the
   complexity of the system as a whole, which is necessary for a more
   representative analysis of an open, dynamic complex system.Integr

Title = {External stakeholders' attitudes towards and engagement with local
   knowledge in disaster risk reduction: are we only paying lip service?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the research and policy environment, local knowledge (LK) is
   increasingly seen as an important component of building the resilience
   of communities and delivering sustainable disaster risk reduction (DRR)
   approaches tailored to local contexts. Many studies focus on documenting
   LK in different contexts; however, far less emphasis has been given to
   understanding how external stakeholders (i.e. government, NGOs,
   consultants) engage with and perceive the value of LK for DRR. Through
   an intepretivist epistemology and a case study research design, this
   paper sets out to fill in this gap by engaging with external
   stakeholders involved with community-based flood risk management in
   Malawi. It bases its findings on a thematic analysis of qualitative data
   collected through focus group discussions (n = 7) and key informant
   interviews (n = 69) conducted in 2016 and 2017. The findings show that
   although there is an appreciation of the importance of LK in rhetoric,
   its inclusion in DRR practice remains limited. The strong dichotomy
   between local and scientific knowledge persists and it has led to the
   further marginalisation of LK. The international policy and research
   push for LK in DRR is therefore not translated to realities on the
   ground. To the best of our knowledge, this presents one of the first
   studies of external stakeholders' attitudes of LK and how these
   influence its overall position in DRR. The paper calls for further
   development of knowledge co-production processes that will be based on
   giving equal weight, recognition and importance to LK.},

Title = {Simulating urban heat island effects with climate change on a Manchester

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {This article presents a methodology for determining the internal
   temperatures of a post-1919 mid-terrace house for the present-day and a
   future (2050) climate. The Meteorological Office, Hadley Centre regional
   climate model has been run with urban parameterisation and an improved
   land-surface scheme with urban heat island forcing and a weather
   generator to quantify the effect of the urban heat island. Manchester
   city dry-bulb air temperatures are shown to be of the order of 4K higher
   than those for the present-day under a UKCP09 medium emissions scenario.
   Extreme summer temperature data (99\% percentile) are used to produce a
   cooling design day for use in a building simulation program.(1) Loft and
   wall insulation decreases internal air temperatures by up to 17\% and
   low e glazing with louvres by up to 8\%. Internal temperatures for a
   2050 climate will exceed existing Chartered Institution of Building
   Services Engineers thresholds.
   Practical application: Climate change is an important subject for both
   the building industry and local authorities. Climate change scenarios
   produced by the Hadley Centre General Circulation Models (GCM) have been
   downscaled to the local level for use in a building simulation model.(1)
   This article demonstrates a technique that enables data from a GCM to be
   used within a building simulation program(1) for an urban environment.
   It also examines the implications of the combined effect of the urban
   heat island and climate change on the adaptation options available to
   designers and planners for existing and future buildings.},

Title = {The capacity to adapt?: communities in a changing climate, environment,
   and economy on the northern Andaman coast of Thailand},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The health and productivity of marine ecosystems, habitats, and
   fisheries are deteriorating on the Andaman coast of Thailand. Because of
   their high dependence on natural resources and proximity to the ocean,
   coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to climate-induced
   changes in the marine environment. These communities must also adapt to
   the impacts of management interventions and conservation initiatives,
   including marine protected areas, which have livelihood implications.
   Further, communities on the Andaman coast are also experiencing a range
   of new economic opportunities associated in particular with tourism and
   agriculture. These complex and ongoing changes require integrated
   assessment of, and deliberate planning to increase, the adaptive
   capacity of communities so that they may respond to: (1) environmental
   degradation and fisheries declines through effective management
   interventions or conservation initiatives, (2) new economic
   opportunities to reduce dependence on fisheries, and (3) the increasing
   impacts of climate change. Our results are from a mixed methods study,
   which used surveys and interviews to examine multiple dimensions of the
   adaptive capacity of seven island communities near marine protected
   areas on the Andaman coast of Thailand. Results show that communities
   had low adaptive capacity with respect to environmental degradation and
   fisheries declines, and to management and conservation interventions, as
   well as uneven levels of adaptive capacity to economic opportunities.
   Though communities and households were experiencing the impacts of
   climate change, especially storm events, changing seasons and weather
   patterns, and erosion, they were reacting to these changes with limited
   knowledge of climate change per se. We recommend interventions, in the
   form of policies, programs, and actions, at multiple scales for
   increasing the adaptive capacity of Thailand's coastal communities to
   change. The analytical and methodological approach used for examining
   adaptive capacity could be easily modified and applied to other contexts
   and locales.},

Title = {Building resilience to natural hazards through coastal governance: a
   case study of Hurricane Harvey recovery in Gulf of Mexico communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {176},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper provides an evidence-based contribution to understanding
   coastal governance in response to hurricane hazards. It uses the
   five-part conceptual framework for coastal governance, which includes 1)
   complexity, 2) vulnerability, 3) adaptive management, 4) stakeholder
   participation, and 5) the integration of technical knowledge in
   decision-making. A case study of the Harvey-impacted Texas communities
   in the Gulf of Mexico is presented within this framework. This
   particular case is important because of current high level discussions
   that suggest subnational, state-centric policy response to hazards may
   be the new model for disaster response moving forward. This study
   presents insights on the current trends toward devolved, subnational
   policy response to disasters, as well as a revised framework for coastal
   governance, where resilience is linked to all concepts in the governance
   framework as an outcome. Several major findings are discussed. First,
   higher scales of government take much longer than is necessary to
   respond to hazards because of their complex administrative policies and
   procedures. This is worsened in places that have not experienced hazards
   in recent decades. Innovative adaptation by subnational policy-makers
   may be one pathway to quicken policy response, as are the commendable
   but fragmented efforts of charities and voluntary groups. However,
   devolved policy responses may face their own challenges in
   implementation, increasing adaptive capacity but decreasing resilience.
   This study found that participatory, multi-stakeholder processes enhance
   resilience through disaster simulation exercises and participatory
   planning processes. These participatory processes enhance learning and
   the capacity to implement recovery-focused public policy within the
   constraints of the disaster.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {Artificial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere has been
   proposed as a measure for mitigating climate change and restoring the
   climate system to a target state after exceedance ({''}overshoot{''}).
   This research investigates to what extent overshoot and subsequent
   recovery of a given cumulative CO(2)emissions level by CDR leaves a
   legacy in the marine environment using an Earth system model. We use
   RCP2.6 and its extension to year 2300 as the reference scenario and
   design a set of cumulative emissions and temperature overshoot scenarios
   based on other RCPs. Our results suggest that the overshoot and
   subsequent return to a reference cumulative emissions level would leave
   substantial impacts on the marine environment. Although the changes in
   sea surface temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen are largely
   reversible, global mean values and spatial patterns of these variables
   differ significantly from those in the reference scenario when the
   reference cumulative emissions are attained.},

Title = {Analytical structural vulnerability and classification of Italian
   residential building stock to tsunami hazard},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF GEOPHYSICS AND OCEANOGRAPHY},
Abstract = {The increasing exposure of Mediterranean coastal regions to tsunami
   risk, also due to climate changes, leads to the need of tools to support
   disaster risk management and loss assessment. This study presents a
   tsunami structural vulnerability model for Italian residential buildings
   based on numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Starting from
   national building census repositories, typical building typological
   classes and main attributes are defined. Monte Carlo simulation is
   performed to simulate building stocks statistically representative of
   existing Italian residential buildings, and analytical models are
   adopted for the structural damage assessment of such buildings under
   tsunami inundation. The structural damage is classified according to a
   unified damage scale adapted for different structural typologies, and a
   damage index is computed to describe the structural vulnerability to
   tsunami hazard. Based on the analytical vulnerability curves, tsunami
   vulnerability classes for Italian residential buildings are finally
   proposed to be used for an informed definition and prioritisation of
   risk mitigation strategies. Results from this study can be also
   applicable to other Mediterranean regions with a similar construction
   practice.},

Abstract = {Bervie Braes is a 750 m long, and up to 55 m high, coastal slope above a
   residential area and harbour in Stonehaven, Scotland, with a history of
   instability mostly associated with the road traversing the slope. This
   paper outlines the most probable causes of the instability on the slope
   and details the hazards that had to be taken into account during the
   design and construction of stabilisation measures. The hazards
   associated with hydrology in terms of future potential change in
   rainfall patterns and intensity, but also in terms of providing adequate
   drainage capacity and flows, were juxtaposed against the geotechnical
   hazards of shallow landslips and erosion near the surface, as well as
   deep-seated landslides on the slope. Owing to the complex nature of the
   hazards and the need for longer life expectancy of the design, the soil
   nailing option was combined with eco-engineering strategies to provide
   resilience for a changing climate. A risk-based approach considering the
   number of lives at danger during a catastrophic failure was adopted when
   deciding on the priority of the areas of the slope to be stabilised. The
   sustainability of the design solution and the construction methods were
   constantly monitored and re-appraised throughout the project.},

Title = {Ecosystem-based adaptation in cities: An analysis of European urban
   climate adaptation plans},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {38-47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) measures have been increasingly
   promoted in the literature, as well as in policies and practices, for
   their environmental and socio-economic co-benefits. The recent
   scientific literature has shown a growing interest to assess climate
   adaptation plans at the urban level, in recognition of the important
   role played by urban areas in addressing climate change challenges.
   However, little information is available on the combination of these two
   issues, i.e., the actual inclusion of EbA measures in climate adaptation
   plans at the urban level. This paper addresses this gap by developing a
   framework to analyze the treatment of EbA in urban level climate
   planning, and apply it to a sample of climate adaptation plans in
   Europe. The framework consists of a classification of EbA measures, and
   a scoring system to evaluate how well they are reflected in different
   components of the plans. The results suggest that there is in general
   good awareness in plans of EbA measures, and of their potential role in
   addressing climate change challenges. However, their treatment in
   climate adaptation plans at the urban level often lacks sufficient
   baseline information, as well as convincing implementation actions. The
   paper concludes by offering recommendations to improve future practice,
   in terms of enhancing the baseline information to improve the proposal
   and design of EbA measures, improving the treatment of co-benefits
   associated to EbA measures, and strengthening coordination with other
   planning tools. Possible future development of this works include the
   integration of the proposed EbA classification, and the analysis of a
   larger sample of territorial plans. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Volume = {283},

Abstract = {Sharp increases in atmospheric CO2 are resulting in ocean warming,
   acidification and deoxygenation that threaten marine organisms on
   continental margins and their ecological functions and resulting
   ecosystem services. The relative influence of these stressors on
   biodiversity remains unclear, as well as the threshold levels for change
   and when secondary stressors become important. One strategy to interpret
   adaptation potential and predict future faunal change is to examine
   ecological shifts along natural gradients in the modern ocean. Here, we
   assess the explanatory power of temperature, oxygen and the carbonate
   system for macrofaunal diversity and evenness along continental
   upwelling margins using variance partitioning techniques. Oxygen levels
   have the strongest explanatory capacity for variation in species
   diversity. Sharp drops in diversity are seen as O-2 levels decline
   through the 0.5-0.15 ml l(-1) (approx. 22-6 mu M; approx. 21-5 matm)
   range, and as temperature increases through the 7-10 degrees C range.
   pCO(2) is the best explanatory variable in the Arabian Sea, but explains
   little of the variance in diversity in the eastern Pacific Ocean. By
   contrast, very little variation in evenness is explained by these three
   global change variables. The identification of sharp thresholds in
   ecological response are used here to predict areas of the seafloor where
   diversity is most at risk to future marine global change, noting that
   the existence of clear regional differences cautions against applying
   global thresholds.},

Title = {Sustainability of the Water-Energy-Food Nexus in Caribbean Small Island
   Developing States},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The sustainability of small island developing states (SIDS) of the
   Caribbean is fragile because of island size and topography, limited
   resources, population growth, natural disasters, and climate change.
   Current and projected sustainability in 2050 were assessed within the
   framework of the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus for 10 of 16 SIDS with
   the best databases. Values for each WEF sector below either Falkenmark
   indicators or regional averages were considered unsustainable (failing)
   for that sector. Overall, SIDS were considered unsustainable if they
   failed at least two of three sectors. Projected water sustainability for
   2050 was based on population growth and climate change effects on
   precipitation and per capita water availability. All SIDS failed the
   food sector, and four failed the energy sector. Water was considered the
   ultimate control for long-term sustainability. Five SIDS currently fail
   the water sector, but all but the largest two SIDS are likely to fail
   this sector by 2050. The role of poor governance and associated lack of
   long-term planning for population growth, disasters, and climate change,
   adaptative management strategies, infrastructure investment with an
   emphasis on nature-based solutions, decentralized energy grids
   emphasizing renewable energy, and local food production are clearly
   impediments for reaching sustainability goals for Caribbean SIDS.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Over its 17 years, the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF) has
   allocated US \$7.5 billion intended to develop and implement
   scientifically and socially credible solutions to key global
   environmental problems such as climate change, biological diversity loss
   and degradation of transboundary aquatic systems. We studied 906 GEF
   projects to analyse the challenges that it is facing in delivering
   solutions that are likely to be sustainable in the long-term. The
   research included desk reviews of relevant documents and follow-up
   interviews with a wide range of stakeholders. Some of the challenges the
   GEF faces are deeply rooted in temporal and spatial mismatches of scale
   between human economies and their environmental consequences and the
   strongly sectoral way current society is managed. We conclude that the
   GEF obtained impressive results for tackling problems of limited
   complexity and easily quantified benefits but progress is slower on more
   complex and less tangible problems impeding sustainable development.
   Potentially, the GEF could enable adaptive management through a
   `learning by doing' process, transforming it into an innovative
   mechanism for delivering global benefits. Continued emphasis on `easy
   wins' would not allow it to achieve this goal. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Estimates of seabird incidental catch by pelagic longline fisheries in
   the South Atlantic Ocean},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-152},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The mortality of seabirds in fisheries has had a serious negative impact
   on many seabird populations, yet the extent of fishery-derived seabird
   mortality in pelagic longline fisheries, remains poorly understood. In
   this study, we analyze fishing effort and catch data of the Taiwanese
   distant-water longline tuna fleet the largest fleet in the Atlantic
   Ocean. These data collected by fishery observers over a 5-year span
   include 61 trips involving 6181 observed sets of over 20 million hooks,
   where 198 seabirds were caught (23 of which were released alive). Most
   birds were caught in the South Atlantic, with estimated seabird bycatch
   rates ranging from 0.026 birds per thousand hooks in the southwest
   Atlantic to 0.063 birds per thousand hooks in the southeast Atlantic.
   Black-browed, Atlantic yellow-nosed, and wandering albatrosses, as well
   as spectacled and southern giant petrels, were the most frequently
   caught species. Seabird bycatch hotspots were identified at 20 degrees
   40 degrees S/10 degrees W15 degrees E and 35 degrees 45 degrees S/45
   degrees 55 degrees W. In the South Atlantic Ocean, generalized additive
   models indicated that fishing location and the number of birds sighted
   significantly influenced seabird bycatch rates. Extrapolating these
   spatially and temporally explicit seabird bycatch rates to the fishing
   effort data of other distant-water longline fleets and extrapolating the
   bycatch rates reported in the literature to the reported fishing effort
   of coastal nation fleets, we estimate the total seabird incidental
   mortality from pelagic longline fishing in the southern Atlantic Ocean
   to be between 3446 and 6083 birds per year from 2004 to 2008. These
   findings support proposals calling for the required use of best-practice
   mitigation measures by all pelagic longline vessels operating in seabird
   bycatch hotspots in the South Atlantic Ocean. International cooperation
   on research and data sharing is critical to ensure the sustainability of
   seabird populations and fisheries.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather is creating a growing challenge for disaster managers
   and transportation planners. The Tennessee Department of Transportation
   (TDOT) recently completed a study sponsored in part by the U.S. Federal
   Highway Administration (FHWA) to conduct an assessment of critical
   transportation assets in the state that are most vulnerable to plausible
   extreme weather events out to 2040. This vulnerability assessment
   required building an asset inventory, determining which of those assets
   should be considered critical, identifying various types of extreme
   weather events to which the critical assets may be exposed, and
   quantifying the potential asset damage and system disruption for the
   selected extreme weather event types and critical asset combinations.
   Combining this information then provided an overall vulnerability rating
   for the critical transportation assets in the state.
   The Tennessee study is unique in that it represents an inland region
   whose climate and topography expose the state to a variety of extreme
   weather events, and which are not dominated by concerns associated with
   sea level rise and storm surge. Moreover, all significant passenger and
   freight transport modes and support facilities were considered across a
   large region. As a result, the vulnerability assessment serves as an
   important screening tool to help stakeholders better understand where to
   focus their resources as they consider potential adaptation measures,
   and as a catalyst for facilitating a more proactive approach to building
   transportation resilience to extreme weather events. The methodology and
   tools developed in the study are also transferable to other regions
   attempting to better understand the vulnerabilities of their
   transportation infrastructure to climate change and extreme weather.
   This paper describes the study approach and findings, including a
   discussion of steps being taken to incorporate the study results into
   agency operations and planning. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {We review the current and future threats to duck populations that breed,

   species are sensitive indicators of their changing environment, and
   their societal value confirms the need to translate signals from changes
   in their distribution, status and abundance into a better understanding
   of changes occurring in their wetland environments. We used expert
   opinion to highlight 25 major areas of anthropogenic change (and touch
   briefly on potential mitigation measures through nature restoration and
   reserve management projects) that we consider key issues likely to
   influence Nordic duck populations now and in the near future to
   stimulate debate, discussion and further research. We believe such
   reviews are essential in contributing to development of successful
   management policy as well as stimulating specific research to support
   the maintenance of duck species in favourable future conservation status

Title = {Assessing atoll shoreline condition to guide community management},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {321-330},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Resilience assessment allows targeted management, and many low Pacific
   island atolls have no baseline condition data or monitoring, and are
   threatened by sea-level rise. Ecological resilience is a useful
   management concept where an ecosystem risks losing its ability to
   recover, potentially driving itself to an undesirable state, which for
   atoll shorelines is beach erosion without recovery, and mangrove
   dieback. This study used spatial change analysis to assess resilience
   condition indicators for lagoon shore habitats of an atoll protected
   area, methods developed in the region to facilitate improved community
   based assessment and management decision making. The lagoon shore was
   the focus, being potentially more vulnerable to human impacts owing to
   higher population densities, and potentially more vulnerable to relative
   sea level rise owing low gradients and elevations. Results showed
   mangrove vegetation to be in healthy condition, and spatial analysis of
   coastal change found that the mangrove area expanded 1998-2013,
   increasing by 17\%, at a rate of 604 m(2) per year. Results from the
   southern beach coast showed littoral vegetation to be in poor condition,
   with profile evidence of recent erosion, confirmed by spatial analysis
   results of loss of a previous progradation trend. Spatial analysis
   results therefore confirmed the veracity of community methods for
   assessing mangrove and beach condition, allowing confidence in their use
   in assessment of resilience state and rehabilitation needs. Sediment
   supply is helpful to coastal resilience, and analysis of beach sand
   found it to be 99.9\% carbonate, derived from foraminifera and
   fragmented shell and coral, and continued supply is essential to
   maintain resilience. Beach sediment from such biogenic sources is
   derived from offshore reefs, making resilience assessment and monitoring
   of those habitats a further priority. Suitable timeframes are needed for
   managers to assess resilience, necessitating a need for longer term
   monitoring projects in the region. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {Climate and carbon cycle changes under the overshoot scenario},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {164-172},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The ``overshoot scenario{''} is an emissions scenario in which CO2
   concentration in the atmosphere temporarily exceeds some pre-defined,
   ``dangerous{''} threshold (before being reduced to non-dangerous
   levels). Support for this idea comes from its potential to achieve a
   balance between the burdens of current and future generations in dealing
   with global warming. Before it can be considered a viable policy, the
   overshoot scenario needs to be examined in terms of its impacts on the
   global climate and the environment. In, particular, it must be
   determined if climate change cause by the overshoot scenario is
   reversible or not, since crossing that ``dangerous{''} CO2 threshold
   could result in climate change from which we might not be able to
   recover. In this study, we quantify the change in several climatic and
   environmental variables under the overshoot scenario using a global
   climate model of intermediate complexity. Compared to earlier studies on
   the overshoot scenario, we have an explicit carbon cycle model that
   allows us to represent carbon-climate feedbacks and force the climate
   model more realistically with CO2 emissions rates rather than with
   prescribed atmospheric pCO(2). Our standard CO2 emissions rate is
   calculated on the basis of historical atmospheric pCO(2) data and the
   WRE S650 non-overshoot stabilization profile. It starts from the
   preindustrial year 1760, peaks in the year 2056, and ends in the year
   2300. A variety of overshoot scenarios were constructed by increasing
   the amplitude of the control emissions peak but decreasing the peak
   duration so that the cumulative emissions remain essentially constant.
   Sensitivity simulations of various overshoot scenarios in our model show
   that many aspects of the global climate are largely reversible by year
   2300. The significance of the reversibility, which takes roughly 200
   years in our experiments, depends on the time horizon with which it is
   viewed or the number of future generations for whom equity is sought. At
   times when the overshoot scenario has emissions rates higher then the
   control scenario, the transient changes in atmospheric and oceanic
   temperatures and surface ocean pH can be significant, even for moderate
   overshoot scenarios that remain within IPCC SRES emissions scenarios.
   The large transient changes and the centennial timescale of climate
   reversibility suggest that the overshoot might not. be the best
   mitigation approach, even if it technically follows the optimal economic
   path. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Macroinvertebrate and diatom community responses to thermal alterations
   below water supply reservoirs},
Journal = {RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {595-612},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {River impoundments have transformed river ecosystems globally due to the
   modification of various abiotic and biotic factors. This study provides
   rare evidence quantifying how water supply reservoirs alter water
   temperature regimes and its effects on macroinvertebrate and diatom
   communities over a 4-year period. We obtained near-continuous water
   temperature measurements upstream and downstream of three reservoirs and
   analysed thermal variables in association with macroinvertebrate and
   diatom community indices (including taxonomic richness, proportion of
   Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa {[}\%EPT] and diatom
   ecological guilds). Reservoirs typically decreased downstream thermal
   variability, with reduced summer temperatures and increased winter
   temperatures, and a delayed timing of annual temperature extremes.
   Marked differences in thermal regime modifications between reservoirs
   were observed, including evidence of inter-annual variation associated
   with inter-basin water transfers downstream of one reservoir.
   Biomonitoring indices showed associations with thermal indices that
   differed between site types (regulated versus non-regulated) and seasons
   (spring vs. autumn). Various macroinvertebrate and diatom indices
   capturing community diversity elements and sensitivities to different
   environmental pressures were associated with higher maximum summer
   temperatures and lower minimum winter temperatures, suggesting
   ecological effects of reduced thermal variation downstream of
   reservoirs. Different ecological responses to thermal indices were
   observed between seasons, likely due to organism life-cycle effects and
   intra-annual thermal variations. Contrasting macroinvertebrate and
   diatom communities were observed between regulated and non-regulated
   sites, which may be driven by differences in the thermal regime and
   other abiotic factors at regulated sites, including nutrient, sediment
   and flow regimes. Long-term continuous water temperature monitoring of
   both multiple regulated and non-regulated river systems is necessary to
   better understand the environmental and ecological effects of river
   impoundments. Given the extent to which river impoundment has modified
   stream temperatures globally, the inclusion of thermal regime data in
   environmental flow studies alongside hydrological information may guide
   the implementation of mitigation measures on impounded waterbodies.},

Title = {Fishes and fisheries of Asian inland lacustrine waters},
Booktitle = {FRESHWATER FISHERIES ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {384-403},
Abstract = {In tropical Asia, there is a general paucity of natural lakes that are
   mainly located in the island states of the Philippines and Indonesia.
   Reservoir construction is extensive in the region primarily for
   irrigation, flood control and hydroelectricity generation, and fish
   production is essentially a secondary use of these reservoirs. Although
   the degree of endemism can in no way be equated to those in the great
   lakes of rift valley region of East Africa, familial diversity of fishes
   in Asia, but not species diversity, is considerably higher than in
   African lakes. Asia has a significant contribution to the world inland
   capture fisheries production of 11.5 x 10(6) t that is c. 69\%. In most
   countries in Asia, the bulk of inland fisheries for food fish production
   occur in lacustrine waters, albeit productive riverine fisheries occur
   in the Lower Mekong Basin. Nevertheless, fisheries in multipurpose
   reservoirs are not fully appreciated compared to their other economic
   uses. Fisheries enhancement in lacustrine waterbodies in Asia through
   culture-based fisheries (CBF) is considered environmentally friendly due
   to low external inputs such as provision of supplementary feeds. There
   is a great potential for food fish production through CBF development in
   many parts of Asia. Hitherto, deterioration of water quality due to
   anthropogenic activities is less frequent in Asia than in other regions
   as local authorities are active in maintaining water quality in
   reservoirs used for multiple purposes. As reservoir water levels range
   from highly stable systems to highly fluctuating systems, a combination
   of flood pulses and mean depth can be used as a fish yield predictor in
   lakes and reservoirs. Approaches directed towards addressing both human
   and ecological well-being, in the lake and reservoir fisheries
   development strategies, are useful to combine the important aspects that
   are of ecological and societal interest. There is a paucity of studies
   on climate change impacts on inland fisheries, although some isolated
   studies are reported on specific aspects. Hence, there is a need to step
   up research on climate change impacts on inland fisheries for enabling
   adoption of mitigation and adaptive measures.},

Title = {Climate change impacts on international seaports: knowledge,

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {110},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {5-29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Seaports are located in vulnerable areas to climate change impacts: on
   coasts susceptible to sea-level rise and storms or at mouths of rivers
   susceptible to flooding. They serve a vital function within the local,
   regional, and global economy. Their locations in the heart of sensitive
   estuarine environments make it an imperative to minimize the impacts of
   natural hazards. Climate impacts, like a projected SLR of .6 m to 2 m
   and doubling of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes by 2100, will result in more
   extreme events at many seaports. To assess the current state of
   knowledge on this issue, we surveyed port authorities from around the
   world about how administrators felt climate change might impact their
   operations, what sea-level change would create operational problems, and
   how they planned to adapt to new environmental conditions. The planned
   rapid expansion of ports reported by the survey respondents indicates
   that adaptation measures should be considered as ports construct new
   infrastructure that may still be in use at the end of the century.
   Respondents agreed that the ports community needs to address this issue
   and most felt relatively uninformed about potential climate impacts.
   Although most ports felt that SLR would not be an issue at their port
   this century, sea-level rise was nevertheless an issue of great concern.
   Our results suggest opportunities for the scientific community to engage
   with port practitioners to prepare proactively for climate change
   impacts on this sector.},

Title = {Range expansion of the invasive lionfish in the Northwest Atlantic with
   climate change},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {546},
Pages = {225-237},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Growing populations of invasive lionfishes Pterois volitans and P. miles
   have had detrimental impacts on native marine fish communities and
   transformed many of the reef ecosystems of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.
   Over the last 3 decades, suitable environmental conditions and lack of
   natural biological controls have allowed lionfish populations to expand
   into areas ranging from the tropical waters of the Caribbean to the
   northern portions of the shelf break along the Southeast United States
   Continental Shelf (SEUSCS) during all months of the year. Under current
   climate conditions, continued expansion to waters further north or
   inshore from the shelf break is unlikely, given the physiological
   thermal tolerance of lionfish and the cooler temperatures of these
   waters. However, the geographic range of suitable environments may
   expand in the future with climate change. Here, we develop a conceptual
   model of the physical climate niche of lionfish and use projections of
   future ocean temperatures and salinities to explore potential lionfish
   habitat through the year 2100 under conditions of anthropogenic climate
   change. Without successful culling efforts or implementation of
   climate-change mitigation strategies, the spatial extent of suitable
   year-round lionfish habitat is expected to increase 45\% on the SEUSCS
   during the 21st century, covering 90\% of the region. Establishment of
   resident populations north of Cape Hatteras is unlikely. Nevertheless,
   in the coming decades, the potential impact of continued lionfish
   invasion on the valuable marine ecosystems of the SEUSCS is cause for
   concern.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {185},
Pages = {127-140},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cool and green roofs are widely adopted measures for curtailing
   summertime urban heat islands. Existing numerical studies to assess
   their effectiveness and cooling benefits usually assume an unrealistic
   100\% coverage across the entire metropolis. This study investigates the
   scale dependence of the absolute cooling benefits and efficiency
   (cooling per adapted roof area) of cool and green roofs in a typical
   summer when they are installed over 25\% of building rooftops at local,
   city, or regional scales. Six major U.S. cities with active climate
   action plans in different geoclimatic zones are compared through
   high-resolution simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting
   model. The results reveal that reductions in 2-m air temperature over
   the urban core increase non-linearly with the intervention area, and the
   benefits of both roof types scale similarly. This scale-dependence of
   urban core cooling is not universal, but is rather controlled by the
   shape of metropolitan areas and wind pattern. The siting of mitigation
   measures hence plays an important role especially under windy
   conditions, and some urban cores are not able to achieve a noticeable
   and consistent cooling by retrofitting their own rooftops.
   Regional-scale deployments of mitigation strategies, on the other hand,
   yield a more substantial temperature reduction but with a lower
   efficiency. The scale-dependence of regional cooling efficiency showed
   remarkable similarity across studied cities, yielding a potentially
   generalizable power law. The successful resiliency plans for cities
   should account for the scale dependence and geoclimatic determinants of
   the achievable cooling, and identify the target neighborhoods of most
   interest.},

Title = {Development of microclimate modeling for enhancing neighborhood thermal
   performance through urban greenery cover},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {252},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Green spaces and vegetation cover offer various environmental benefits,
   including building energy-saving. Enriching the urban vegetation is
   fundamental in urban heat island (UHI) mitigation policies pro-moted
   over the last years in many large North American cities. For example,
   the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) has been promoting significant increases
   in urban greenery by intensifying the urban trees and green roofs. In
   this paper, an updated version of the open-source code of the Urban
   Weather Generator was developed and validated to assess the effect of
   the increased horizontal and vertical green infrastructure on the
   microclimatic thermal performance of three urban typologies within the
   GTA. The updates of the model efficiently estimate the cooling and
   warming effects of the urban greenery cover on the microclimate thermal
   environment. The proposed enhancements included intensifying the tree
   canopy and incorporating the vegetated facades and green roofs. The
   validation ensured the model's abil-ity to predict the cooling and
   warming effects of the green infrastructure. The results confirmed that
   tree canopy and green facades were the most effective mitigation
   strategies for reducing the canyon air tem-perature and building energy
   consumption, respectively. A parametric analysis utilizing a
   multi-objective algorithm was also designed to evaluate the
   effectiveness and affordability of the applied strategies. The results
   showed that the ambient peak air temperature, the outdoor heat stress
   index, and building energy savings were reduced by up to 4.6 = C, 5.4,
   and 42.4\%, respectively. Considering reducing the green infras-tructure
   cost by 50\%, the parametric study resulted in a reduction of up to 3 =
   C, 2.9, and 35.6\% in the ambi-ent peak air temperature, the outdoor
   heat stress index, and building energy savings, respectively. (c) 2021

Title = {Household perceptions of coastal hazards and climate change in the
   Central Philippines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {137-148},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {As a tropical archipelagic nation, the Philippines is particularly
   susceptible to coastal hazards, which are likely to be exacerbated by
   climate change. To improve coastal hazard management and adaptation
   planning, it is imperative that climate information be provided at
   relevant scales and that decision-makers understand the causes and
   nature of risk in their constituencies. Focusing on a municipality in
   the Central Philippines, this study examines local meteorological
   information and explores household perceptions of climate change and
   coastal hazard risk. First, meteorological data and local perceptions of
   changing climate conditions are assessed. Perceived changes in climate
   include an increase in rainfall and rainfall variability, an increase in
   intensity and frequency of storm events and sea level rise. Second,
   factors affecting climate change perceptions and perceived risk from
   coastal hazards are determined through statistical analysis. Factors
   tested include social status, economic standing, resource dependency and
   spatial location. Results indicate that perceived risk to coastal
   hazards is most affected by households' spatial location and resource
   dependency, rather than socio-economic conditions. However, important
   differences exist based on the type of hazard and nature of risk being
   measured. Resource dependency variables are more significant in
   determining perceived risk from coastal erosion and sea level rise than
   flood events. Spatial location is most significant in determining
   households' perceived risk to their household assets, but not perceived
   risk to their livelihood. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Perceptions of sub-seabed carbon dioxide storage in Scotland and
   implications for policy: A qualitative study},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {9-15},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) offers notable potential,
   as part of larger carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) processes, to
   be a significant climate change mitigation technology. This paper
   challenges the argument often put forward that, due to the greater
   distances from centres of population, it will be `easier' to garner
   public and stakeholder support for offshore CO2 storage than onshore.
   Based on the results of research interviews carried out with
   stakeholders and informed publics in Scotland, challenges for public and
   stakeholder acceptance of sub-seabed CO2 storage that may require
   further policy attention are identified. Whilst existing policy for
   sub-seabed CO2 storage is cognisant of the need for societal engagement,
   it may be the case that these regulations may need further reinforcement
   to ensure future developments are able to address social acceptability
   issues as fully as possible. The value of taking into account social as
   well as physical characteristics at the site selection phase, the need
   for mechanisms to take seriously stakeholder conceptions of uncertainty,
   and the importance of extending social engagement beyond risk
   communication are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {The future of low-lying reef islands has been the subject of
   international concern, scientific debate, and media interest in the last
   decade. As a result of sea-level rise, atoll islands are expected to
   become increasingly unstable and to be susceptible to potential
   depopulation by the end of the 21st century. Some have suggested that
   sea-level rise has already resulted in widespread erosion and inundation
   of atoll islands. Here, we analyze the physical changes in over 200
   islands on 12 atolls in the central and western Pacific in the past few
   decades when sea level in the region increased at rates three to four
   times the global average. Results show little evidence of heightened
   erosion or reduction in island size. Instead island shores have adjusted
   their position and morphology in response to human impacts such as
   seawall construction and to variations in climate-ocean processes. These
   changes are reviewed and the role of sea-level rise is evaluated. The
   implications of this analysis are addressed in two parts. First, we
   consider the proposition that future sea-level rise will destabilize
   atoll islands to such an extent that their inhabitants will be forced to
   migrate offshore. And second, we identify a series of new challenges
   relating to risk reduction and adaptation policy for atoll island
   governments, international agencies, and island communities. These
   require a substantial shift away from the present adaptation paradigm of
   external migration and focus on the persistence of atoll islands and
   in-country solutions. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},

Abstract = {Global climate change has intensified extreme climate events, such as
   torrential rain, heavy snow, heatwaves, and droughts. Among all extreme
   disaster events, extreme heat might lead to long and intensified
   heatwaves and seriously impact human living environments and ecological
   habitats. This study applies remote sensing to identify the spatial
   variation in extreme heat and principal component analysis (PCA) to
   explore the spatial distribution of the heat vulnerability index in the
   Taipei metropolitan area. Finally, a bivariate local indicator of
   spatial association (bivariate LISA) is used to explore the relationship
   between extreme heat and the heat vulnerability index. The results show
   that most vulnerable villages are clustered in downtown Taipei. In
   addition, the bivariate LISA results show an aggregation of 346
   high-high clusters, indicating extreme heat and relatively high
   vulnerability clustered in particular areas. The findings of this study
   could provide the basis for proposing adequate resilience strategies for
   areas suffering from extreme heat based on the heat vulnerability

Abstract = {Climate change is posing additional pressures on coastal ecosystems due
   to variations in water biogeochemical and physico-chemical parameters
   (e.g., pH, salinity) leading to aquatic ecosystem degradation.
   With the main aim of analyzing the potential impacts of climate change
   on marine water quality, a Regional Risk Assessment methodology was
   developed and applied to coastal marine waters of the North Adriatic. It
   integrates the outputs of regional biogeochemical and physico-chemical
   models considering future climate change scenarios (i.e., years 2070 and
   2100) with site-specific environmental and socio-economic indicators.
   Results showed that salinity and temperature will be the main drivers of
   changes, together with macronutrients, especially in the area of the Po'
   river delta.
   The final outputs are exposure, susceptibility and risk maps supporting
   the communication of the potential consequences of climate change on
   water quality to decision makers and stakeholders and provide a basis
   for the definition of adaptation and management strategies. (C) 2015

Abstract = {The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-mediated
   environmental changes to marine resources were long recognized; however,
   species-specific responses were also reported to vary, possibly more so,
   under the emerging event-to-event diversity of the ENSO conditions.
   Hence, the objective of this study is to characterize the potential
   impacts of the ENSO-regulated environmental variability to squid habitat
   in the central North Pacific under the different ENSO flavors, using
   habitat models developed from at least a decade of fishery-dependent
   dataset and environmental parameters. Our findings revealed that the
   potential squid habitats were largely influenced by ENSO-forced
   environmental changes during the squid's spawning and nursery periods,
   resulting in substantial reduction/enhancement of available habitats in
   the succeeding summers of Central Pacific El Nio/La Nia, where the
   latter led to an expansion of favorable spawning and nursery grounds.
   However, the autumn-winter periods of weaker and short-lived Eastern
   Pacific El Nio showed elevated potential habitats due to minimal sea
   surface temperature drop and close proximity of spawning and nursery
   grounds to optimal feeding environments. The quick, albeit variable,
   squids' responses to ENSO flavors accentuate their promising potential
   as ecological beacons under climate changes, aiding the development of
   adaptive management strategies for commercially exploited fisheries.},

Abstract = {The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is one of the world?s most vulnerable
   deltas to climate change and sea level rise. Adequate understandings of
   future hydrological changes are crucial for effective water management
   and risk-proofing, however, this knowledge body is currently very
   limited. This study quantifies the responses of the VMD?s river flow
   regime to multiple stimuli, namely future upstream inflow variation,
   local climate change, and sea level rise. The one-dimensional
   hydrodynamic model MIKE 11 was used to simulate discharges and water
   levels across the delta. We developed four scenarios to represent
   changes in the upstream discharges, precipitation changes and sea level
   rise, covering the 2036?2065 period. We downscaled climate data and
   applied three bias-correction methods for five General Circulation
   Models (GCM), and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The
   climate change projections show similar trends of increasing wet season
   precipitation and decreasing dry season precipitation. However,
   cross-scenario variations are sometimes large, depending on the
   individual GCMs, the RCPs and specific locations. The hydraulic
   simulation results indicate that, under discharge changes between ?20\%
   and +10\%, combined with in-delta precipitation variations during the
   dry season, river discharges at the four representative stations could
   reduce substantially from ?2.5\% to ?100.2\%. During the wet season, the
   calculated river discharges show increase between 7.3\% and 46.7\% under
   four considered scenarios. Substantial changes in the VMD?s river flow
   regime could have potentially serious implications for water management,
   especially saltwater intrusion, and therefore calling for timely
   adaptation measures.},

Title = {Islands and the rise of correlational epistemology in the Anthropocene:
   Rethinking the trope of the `canary in the coalmine'},
Journal = {ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Once on the periphery of international debate, today small islands are
   seen by many as key to unlocking new ways of thinking about climate
   change and developing new practices of adaptation in the epoch of the
   Anthropocene. These approaches differ starkly from modernist, linear,
   causal frameworks that construct islands as vulnerable objects that
   require `saving' or `protecting'. Instead, islands become instruments of
   productive knowledge, laboratories for investigation and learning,
   fundamental to an alternative, correlational, epistemology. In analysing
   these approaches, we take the prolific trope of islands as the `canaries
   in the coalmine' in order to draw out the ontological implications of
   instrumentalising islands as `correlational machines' in the
   Anthropocene. We raise fundamental problems with this literal
   instrumentalisation of islands and islanders, drawing out how these
   logics reduce island life to merely sensing and attuning to the
   co-relational entanglements of the Anthropocene, rather than offering
   higher normative aspirations for political change.},

Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems is under grave threat from human
   activities, due to the combined effects of multiple stressors such as
   pollution and habitat degradation, flow regulation, overfishing, and
   alien species. Consequently, a higher proportion of freshwater species
   are threatened to extinction than their terrestrial or marine
   counterparts. While this indicates the degree to which current practices
   are unsustainable, the actual situation is even worse as a failure to
   take account of shifting baselines has led to underestimation of
   historic declines. Anthropocene trajectories of rising human population
   growth and water consumption will be exacerbated by climate change
   impacts and consequential environmental alterations which, in
   combination with existing stressors, will lead to further extinctions.
   Such losses seem likely to impair ecosystem functioning and hence
   provision of goods and services that underpin human livelihoods.
   Unfortunately, evidence of a close relationship between biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning (B-EF) is insufficient or equivocal at present,
   and B-EF science is not sufficiently mature to allow detailed
   predictions of precise outcomes of biodiyersity loss or management needs
   for fresh waters. In the face of such uncertainty, it would be prudent
   to adopt the precautionary principle and minimize further losses.
   Despite the need for additional B-EF research and more effective
   communication of the importance and value of freshwater biodiversity, it
   is imperative that scientists and stakeholders collaborate to apply
   existing, albeit incomplete, knowledge to mitigating impacts and
   implementing conservation, management and restoration strategies in an
   adaptive fashion.},

Title = {Climate responses to anthropogenic emissions of short-lived climate

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {8201-8216},
Abstract = {Policies to control air quality focus on mitigating emissions of
   aerosols and their precursors, and other short-lived climate pollutants
   (SLCPs). On a local scale, these policies will have beneficial impacts
   on health and crop yields, by reducing particulate matter (PM) and
   surface ozone concentrations; however, the climate impacts of reducing
   emissions of SLCPs are less straightforward to predict. In this paper we
   consider a set of idealized, extreme mitigation strategies, in which the
   total anthropogenic emissions of individual SLCP emissions species are
   removed. This provides an upper bound on the potential climate impacts
   of such air quality strategies.
   We focus on evaluating the climate responses to changes in anthropogenic
   emissions of aerosol precursor species: black carbon (BC), organic
   carbon (OC) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). We perform climate integrations
   with four fully coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models (AOGCMs),
   and examine the effects on global and regional climate of removing the
   total land-based anthropogenic emissions of each of the three aerosol
   precursor species.
   We find that the SO2 emissions reductions lead to the strongest
   response, with all models showing an increase in surface temperature
   focussed in the Northern Hemisphere mid and (especially) high latitudes,
   and showing a corresponding increase in global mean precipitation.
   Changes in precipitation patterns are driven mostly by a northward shift
   in the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone), consistent with the
   hemispherically asymmetric warming pattern driven by the emissions
   changes. The BC and OC emissions reductions give a much weaker response,
   and there is some disagreement between models in the sign of the climate
   responses to these perturbations. These differences between models are
   due largely to natural variability in sea-ice extent, circulation
   patterns and cloud changes. This large natural variability component to
   the signal when the ocean circulation and sea-ice are free-running means
   that the BC and OC mitigation measures do not necessarily lead to a
   discernible climate response.},

Abstract = {The present concern about future climate change and sea-level rise due
   to the: enhanced greenhouse effect is put In the context of past
   changes. Best estimates of future changes are detailed, with an
   explanation of methods and uncertainties, Considerable progress is being
   made in regard to estimates of future sealevel rise and its regional
   variation, and towards predicting likely changes in the behaviour of the
   El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and tropical cyclones. Changes in
   rainfall amounts and intensity, and in extremes of surface temperature
   are other critical climatic variables for coral reefs. Impacts on coral
   reefs will result from a combination of stresses arising from several
   aspects of global change, including stresses due to sea-level rise,
   extreme temperatures, human damage (from mining, dredging, fishing and
   tourism), and changes in salinity and pollutant concentrations
   (nutrients, pesticides, herbicides and particulates), and in ocean
   currents, ENSO, and storm damage, These may be exacerbated by any
   reduction in calcification rates of corals due to changes in ocean
   chemistry. In view of ongoing uncertainties regarding future rates of
   change, especially at the local scale, impact and adaptation assessments
   cannot provide unequivocal answers, but rather must be couched in terms
   of probabilities and risk. Reef communities which are presently under
   stress are likely to be particularly vulnerable, Both autonomous and
   managed (or planned) adaptations should be considered.},

Title = {Elucidating the picocyanobacteria salinity divide through ecogenomics of
   new freshwater isolates},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Background Cyanobacteria are the major prokaryotic primary producers
   occupying a range of aquatic habitats worldwide that differ in levels of
   salinity, making them a group of interest to study one of the major
   unresolved conundrums in aquatic microbiology which is what
   distinguishes a marine microbe from a freshwater one? We address this
   question using ecogenomics of a group of picocyanobacteria (cluster 5)
   that have recently evolved to inhabit geographically disparate salinity
   niches. Our analysis is made possible by the sequencing of 58 new
   genomes from freshwater representatives of this group that are presented
   here, representing a 6-fold increase in the available genomic data.
   Results Overall, freshwater strains had larger genomes (approximate to
   2.9 Mb) and \%GC content (approximate to 64\%) compared to brackish
   (2.69 Mb and 64\%) and marine (2.5 Mb and 58.5\%) isolates. Genomic
   novelties/differences across the salinity divide highlighted acidic
   proteomes and specific salt adaptation pathways in marine isolates
   (e.g., osmolytes/compatible solutes - glycine betaine/ggp/gpg/gmg
   clusters and glycerolipids glpK/glpA), while freshwater strains
   possessed distinct ion/potassium channels, permeases (aquaporin Z),
   fatty acid desaturases, and more neutral/basic proteomes. Sulfur,
   nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon (photosynthesis), or stress tolerance
   metabolism while showing distinct genomic footprints between habitats,
   e.g., different types of transporters, did not obviously translate into
   major functionality differences between environments. Brackish microbes
   show a mixture of marine (salt adaptation pathways) and freshwater
   features, highlighting their transitional nature. Conclusions The
   plethora of freshwater isolates provided here, in terms of trophic
   status preference and genetic diversity, exemplifies their ability to
   colonize ecologically diverse waters across the globe. Moreover, a trend
   towards larger and more flexible/adaptive genomes in freshwater
   picocyanobacteria may hint at a wider number of ecological niches in
   this environment compared to the relatively homogeneous marine system.},

Title = {The KULTURisk Regional Risk Assessment methodology for water-related
   natural hazards - Part 1: Physical-environmental assessment},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {18},
Number = {12},
Pages = {5399-5414},
Abstract = {In recent years, the frequency of catastrophes induced by natural
   hazards has increased, and flood events in particular have been
   recognized as one of the most threatening water-related disasters.
   Severe floods have occurred in Europe over the last decade, causing loss
   of life, displacement of people and heavy economic losses. Flood
   disasters are growing in frequency as a consequence of many factors,
   both climatic and non-climatic. Indeed, the current increase of
   water-related disasters can be mainly attributed to the increase of
   exposure (elements potentially at risk in flood-prone area) and
   vulnerability (i.e. economic, social, geographic, cultural and
   physical/environmental characteristics of the exposure). Besides these
   factors, the undeniable effect of climate change is projected to
   strongly modify the usual pattern of the hydrological cycle by
   intensifying the frequency and severity of flood events at the local,
   regional and global scale. Within this context, the need for developing
   effective and pro-active strategies, tools and actions which allow one
   to assess and (possibly) to reduce the flood risks that threatens
   different relevant receptors becomes urgent. Several methodologies to
   assess the risk posed by water-related natural hazards have been
   proposed so far, but very few of them can be adopted to implement the
   last European Flood Directive (FD). This paper is intended to introduce
   and present a state-of-the-art Regional Risk Assessment (RRA)
   methodology to appraise the risk posed by floods from a
   physical-environmental perspective. The methodology, developed within
   the recently completed FP7-KULTURisk Project (Knowledge-based approach
   to develop a cULTUre of Risk prevention - KR) is flexible and can be
   adapted to different case studies (i.e. plain rivers, mountain torrents,
   urban and coastal areas) and spatial scales (i.e. from catchment to the
   urban scale). The FD compliant KR-RRA methodology is based on the
   concept of risk being function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. It
   integrates the outputs of various hydrodynamic models with site-specific
   bio-geophysical and socio-economic indicators (e.g. slope, land cover,
   population density, economic activities etc.) to develop tailored risk
   indexes and GIS-based maps for each of the selected receptors (i.e.
   people, buildings, infrastructure, agriculture, natural and semi-natural
   systems, cultural heritage) in the considered region. It further
   compares the baseline scenario with alternative scenarios, where
   different structural and/or non-structural mitigation measures are
   planned and eventually implemented. As demonstrated in the companion
   paper (Part 2, Ronco et al., 2014), risk maps, along with related
   statistics, allow one to identify and classify, on a relative scale,
   areas at risk which are more likely to be affected by floods and support
   the development of strategic adaptation and prevention measures to
   minimizing flood impacts. In addition, the outcomes of the RRA can be
   eventually used for a further socio-economic assessment, considering the
   tangible and intangible costs as well as the human dimension of
   vulnerability.},

Abstract = {This work addresses the potential impact of large-scale deployment of
   photovoltaics in the urban environment on the local micro-climate. A
   one- and two-dimensional steady-state irradiance balance model was
   developed to estimate the impact of changing the effective albedo of
   rooftops and facades fully covered with photovoltaic modules. Results
   show that, albeit small, with current PV conversion efficiencies,
   photovoltaics on rooftops are expected to have a heating effect on the
   urban environment. The effect of facades depends strongly on the
   reflective properties of the surroundings (e.g., road albedo) but it is
   always small (below 4\%), and, therefore, photovoltaics ought not to be
   considered a mitigation strategy for urban heat island.},

Abstract = {Climate change, a global challenge facing mankind necessitates
   governments to develop mitigation and adaptation plans. The climate
   change has multidimensional impacts on environment, fishery, social,
   economic and development drivers. The perception level of the primary
   stakeholders leads to their proactive participation in disaster
   management plans. The present paper assessed the vulnerability of 318
   fisher households in Alappuzha District of Kerala using PARS (parameter,
   attribute, resilient indicator and score) methodology. The methodology
   provides prioritisation and ranking of the different impacts as
   perceived by the fishers on environment, fishery and socio-economic
   parameters. The vulnerability indices were worked out for the fisher
   households. The fisher's perception revealed that fishery was most
   impacted followed by economic and environmental impacts. Social impact
   was the least as opined by fishers. The study indicates that long term
   effects of climate change aren't realised/perceived/impacted much among
   the fisher households. The fishers were more prone to loss in fishing
   days due to erratic monsoon. The results suggest immediate need to
   improve the primary stakeholders awareness by involving them in disaster
   preparedness, management and mitigation planning as well as
   implementation process.},

Abstract = {Extreme flooding events in recent years have renewed interest in flood
   mitigation techniques, Presented is a dynamic flood control strategy
   that is consistent with risk-based flood management policy. Control of
   flood waves is achieved using an adjoint sensitivity method (ASM) based
   on the shallow-water equations in both one and two spatial dimensions.
   The efficiency of the ASM allows active control of flood waves, A
   deliberate levee breach at an optimal time and location during a
   flooding event is considered as a flood mitigation measure. A second
   order finite-volume scheme is presented for the monotonic solution of
   the adjoint shallow-water equations.},

Abstract = {A threat of irreversible damage should prompt action to mitigate climate
   change, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
   Change, which serves as a basis for international climate policy.
   CO2-induced climate change is known to be largely irreversible on
   timescales of many centuries(1), as simulated global mean temperature
   remains approximately constant for such periods following a complete
   cessation of carbon dioxide emissions while thermosteric sea level
   continues to rise(1-6). Here we use simulations with the Canadian Earth
   System Model to show that ongoing regional changes in temperature and
   precipitation are significant, following a complete cessation of carbon
   dioxide emissions in 2100, despite almost constant global mean
   temperatures. Moreover, our projections show warming at intermediate
   depths in the Southern Ocean that is many times larger by the year 3000
   than that realized in 2100. We suggest that a warming of the
   intermediate-depth ocean around Antarctica at the scale simulated for
   the year 3000 could lead to the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice
   Sheet, which would be associated with a rise in sea level of several
   metres(2,7,8).},

Abstract = {In data-limited fisheries, making informed management decisions based on
   scientific advice is challenging. Here, we evaluate a multi-indicator
   adaptive management framework (AMF) that allows dynamic responses to
   changing environmental, socioeconomic, and fishing conditions. Using
   stakeholder-defined goals as a foundation for specifying performance
   metrics, we employ management strategy evaluation (MSE) to explore the
   performance of the AMF relative to prescriptive alternatives that are
   sometimes used in data-limited situations. We conduct simulations
   involving the two most economically important fisheries in Belize, spiny
   lobster, Panulirus argus (Latreille, 1804), and queen conch, Strornbus
   gigas (Linnaeus, 1758). Spiny lobster fishery simulations demonstrate
   that when relatively stable catches have historically persisted, an AMF
   can help to ensure that stable catches continue to persist into the
   foreseeable future when faced with factors such as increased entry to
   the fishery or environmentally induced recruitment fluctuations. The
   queen conch fishery simulations demonstrate that optimizing economic
   performance is complicated without stock status indicators and depends
   greatly upon the current, yet typically unknown, state of the resource.
   Since our indicator-based approach could not provide direct information
   about resource status in relation to management reference points such as
   maximum sustainable yield, economic objectives could not be achieved.
   Nevertheless, implementing the AMF served as a beneficial control
   against stock collapse and could function well as an interim fishery
   policy during which sufficient fishery data could be collected to inform
   population modeling and quantitative stock assessment.},

Title = {Perception, physiological and psychological impacts, adaptive awareness
   and knowledge, and climate justice under urban heat: A study in
   extremely hot-humid Chongqing, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {79},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urban heat, the combined effect of heatwaves and urban heat islands
   (UHIs), is a severe challenge for many cities around the world. While
   there have been numerous studies on urban heat, society's understanding
   of it is still insufficient, hindering its mitigation and adaptation.
   This paper aims to investigate people's vulnerability to, and
   perception, awareness and knowledge of, urban heat. A questionnaire
   survey was conducted with 562 re-spondents in the hot and humid city of
   Chongqing, China in the summer of 2020. Data were analysed using
   descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test and
   logistic regression. Results indicated that urban heat is generally
   understood as having a moderate severity, while there is limited
   knowledge of heat-related risks. The perceived heat-related
   psychological impacts are more severe than physiological impacts. There
   is limited awareness and knowledge of heat-impact reduction methods.
   Nevertheless, people's awareness, perception and knowledge of urban heat
   increase once they suffer heat-induced impacts, indicating exposure/
   experience-driven awareness and knowledge. Moreover, climate injustice
   among different groups (e.g. gender, age, education, income, health) of
   people related to heat challenges was identified. People's perception,
   vulnerability, awareness and knowledge increased with age, but
   interestingly decreased with increasing edu-cation level and improved
   health conditions. Economic factor was not critical to heat-related
   responses. Men could be more vulnerable to physiological symptoms and
   daily functioning than women. The results of this study provide an
   understanding of urban heat perception and adaptive knowledge, enabling
   practitioners and policy makers to formulate effective urban heat
   mitigation and adaptation policies and regulations.},

Abstract = {Energy systems comprise a key sector of the U.S. economy, and one that
   is vulnerable to the effects of climate variability and change. However,
   the climate science community's understanding of adaptation processes in
   the energy sector is limited. It is unclear, for example, the extent to
   which energy companies' adaptation processes are well-served by existing
   knowledge and tools. To help inform a regional IAM project addressing
   the sector's vulnerability to climate change, we investigated available
   evidence of adaptation processes, with a particular emphasis on the U.S.
   Southeast and Gulf Coast region. A mixed methods approach of literature
   review and semi-structured interviews with key informants from energy
   utilities was used to compare existing knowledge from the IAV community
   with that of regional stakeholders. That comparison revealed that much
   of the IAV literature on the energy sector is climate-centric and
   therefore disconnected from the more integrated decision-making
   processes and institutional perspectives of energy utilities. Greater
   investment is needed in integrated assessment and modeling efforts that
   respond to practical decision-making needs as well as greater
   collaboration between energy utilities and researchers in the design,
   execution, and communication of those efforts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognized as sustainable
   approaches to address societal challenges. Disaster risk reduction (DRR)
   has benefited by moving away from purely `grey' infrastructure measures
   towards NbS. However, this shift also furthers an increasing trend of
   reliance on public acceptance to plan, implement and manage DRR
   measures. In this review, we examine how unique NbS characteristics
   relate to public acceptance through a comparison with grey measures, and
   we identify influential acceptance factors related to individuals,
   society, and DRR measures. Based on the review, we introduce the PA-NbS
   model that highlights the role of risk perception, trust, competing
   societal interests, and ecosystem services. Efforts to increase
   acceptance should focus on providing and promoting awareness of benefits
   combined with effective communication and collaboration. Further
   research is required to understand interconnections among identified
   factors and how they can be leveraged for the success and further uptake
   of NbS.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {120-143},
Abstract = {Providing a glimpse into the reality of wind energy development, the
   story of Alvaro Obregon is one of resistance. Alvaro Obregon is a
   primarily Zapotec semi-subsistence community located near the entrance
   of the Santa Teresa sand bar (Barra), where in 2011 Marena Renovables
   initiated the process of building 102 wind turbines. Demonstrating the
   complicated micro-politics of land acquisition, conflict and unrest,
   this article argues that climate change mitigation initiatives are
   sparking land grabs and conflict with the renewed valuation of wind
   resources. Insurrection against the Marena Renovables wind project has
   spawned a long-term conflict, which has created social divisions and a
   type of low-intensity civil war within the town. This article will
   chronicle the uprising against the wind company, battles with police,
   and the town hall takeover, which includes analyzing the conflict taking
   place between the cabildo comunitario and the constitucionalistas.
   Subsequent sections examine the different perspectives within the
   village and how this battle between the Communitarians and the wind
   company continues today. The article reveals the complications
   associated with land deals, the conflict generating potential of climate
   change mitigation practices and, finally, concludes by reflecting on the
   difficulties of formulating alternatives to development within a
   conflict situation.},

Title = {Risk communication and capacity-building: A case study on framing CBA
   strategies of artisanal fishing communities to sea-level rise using
   BASIEC},
Journal = {CLIMATE SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Accelerated rise in sea levels due to changing climate threatens the
   communities located in the low-lying coastal regions. Small-scale
   fishing communities such as artisanal fishing communities are vulnerable
   to the risk of sealevel rise. Climate services are considered to be
   effective instruments to communicate such risks and enhance the capacity
   of local communities. However, the application of climate services to
   build capacities of artisanal fishing communities remains sparse. In
   this context, this study attempted to address the risk of rising sea
   levels and building capacity of artisanal fishing communities of Ennore
   region in Chennai situated on the east coast of India, as a case study.
   The study has addressed the following research questions: What sea-level
   rise risk information is required? How should it be communicated
   effectively? and how efficiently climate services can be utilized to
   enhance the capacities of communities to rising sea levels? BASIEC
   coastal climate service framework methodology has been adopted.
   Sea-level rise risk campaign and adaptation workshops were served as
   climate service platforms to create awareness through narratives and
   visualization techniques as risk information, communication and
   education strategies. By adopting participatory techniques such as
   citizen science and pair-wise ranking methods, the study has identified
   and prioritized community-based adaptation strategies to sea-level rise.
   As a climate service, this case study provides a model to communicate
   the sea-level rise risk and build capacities of artisanal fishing
   communities in adaptation decision-making. The approach and methodology
   of this study are valuable for facilitating climate services to empower
   coastal communities.},

Abstract = {What, exactly, is a coral reef? And how have the world's reefs changed
   in the last several decades? What are the stressors undermining reef
   structure and function? Given the predicted effects of climate change,
   do reefs have a future? Is it possible to ``manage{''} coral reefs for

   Clearly, there are many challenging questions. In this chapter, we
   present some of our thoughts on monitoring and management of coral reefs
   in US national parks in the Caribbean and western Atlantic based on our
   experience as members of monitoring teams. We reflect on the need to
   characterize and evaluate reefs, on how to conduct high-quality
   monitoring programs, and on what we can learn from biological and
   geological experiments and investigations. We explore the possibility
   that specific steps can be taken to ``manage{''} coral reefs for greater

Title = {Coastal erosion driven Land-Sea Interactions in Maritime Spatial
   Planning - a case of Bulgaria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Human activities and natural processes interact with each other in
   complex ways along the land-sea interface. In order to promote
   sustainable use of coastal and marine resources, Land-Sea Interactions
   (LSI) should be taken into account when developing and implementing
   Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) as required by the MSP Directive
   (2014/89/EU). Coastal erosion is one of the critical land-sea
   interaction issues for the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, in particular in
   its northern part. Erosion can have negative impacts both on marine and
   coastal environments and on human activities (natural resources,
   ecosystem services and loss of habitats, with consequent environmental
   fragmentation, and loss of biodiversity, as well as of landscaping and
   environmental heritage, impacts on tourism, transport infrastructure,
   etc.). The present paper provides a detailed investigation with specific
   focus on coastal erosion driven Land-Sea Interactions as a case study in
   the Shabla Municipality, North Bulgarian Black Sea coast, where the
   highest rates of the cliff erosion occur. The study uses the Digital
   Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 5.0, a GIS extension tool for
   the analysis of shoreline movement (at sandy beaches -
   erosion/accretion) and cliff retreat (at rocky coasts). The most
   erosion-prone coastal segments along the cliff coast in the study area
   were identified (coastal erosion hot spot areas). Through this specific
   analysis, the paper aims to increase the knowledge and understanding of
   coastal erosion driven Land-Sea Interactions issues in Shabla
   Municipality using the best available data, and to utilise the best
   obtained results in coastal management and Maritime Spatial Planning,
   towards mitigation measures of coastal erosion impacts. This approach
   and the tested protocols are also applicable to other coastal change
   assessments in Bulgaria.},

Title = {A framework to investigate drivers of adaptation decisions in marine

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {637},
Pages = {758-770},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Traditional fishing livelihoods need to adapt to changing fish
   catch/populations, led by numerous anthropogenic, environmental and
   climatic stressors. The decision to adapt can be influenced by a variety
   of socio-economic and perceptual factors. However, adaptation
   decision-making in fishing communities has rarely been studied. Based on
   previous literature and focus group discussions with community, this
   study identifies few prominent adaptation responses inmarine fishing and
   proposes credible factors driving decisions to adopt them. Further, a
   household survey is conducted, and the association of these drivers with
   various adaptation strategies is examined among fisherfolk of
   Maharashtra (India). This statistical analysis is based on 601 responses
   collected across three regional fishing groups: urban, semi-urban and
   rural. Regional segregation is done to understand variability in
   decision-making among groups which might be having different
   socio-economic and perceptual attributes. The survey reveals that only
   few urban fishing households have been able to diversify into other
   livelihoods. While having economic capital increases the likelihood of
   adaptation among urban and semi-urban communities, rural fishermen are
   significantly driven by social capital. Perception of climate change
   affecting fish catch drives adoption of mechanized boats solely in urban
   region. But increasing number of extreme events affects decisions of
   semi-urban and rural fishermen. Further, rising pollution and trade
   competition is associated with adaptation responses in the urban and
   semi-urban community. Higher education might help fishermen choose
   convenient forms of adaptation. Also, cooperative membership and
   subsidies are critical in adaptation decisions. The framework and
   insights of the study suggest the importance of acknowledging
   differential decision-making of individuals and communities, for
   designing effective adaptation and capacity-building policies. (C) 2018

Title = {Effectiveness of cool walls on cooling load and urban temperature in a
   tropical climate},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {144-162},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The urban overheating, driven by the increasing expansion of our cities
   and the global climate change, is becoming one of the main environmental
   challenges of today. Consequently, cooling technologies are emerging as
   mitigation and adaptation strategies. Reflective roof and pavement
   surfaces have been widely studied for their potential benefits, but
   detailed evaluations of the effect of wall albedo on the urban
   microclimate are limited. This study addresses this gap by evaluating
   the effects of reflective walls on urban energy use and outdoor climate.
   The energy balance of an idealized neighborhood is represented using a
   3D numerical model, Temperature of Urban Facets Indoor-Outdoor Building
   Energy Simulator (TUF-IOBES), which determines the cooling loads and
   outdoor air temperature. The study focuses on the tropical climate of
   Singapore, addressing the urban climate in highly-populated cities in
   low latitudes that are significantly affected by the UHI. Simulations
   are conducted for two neighborhoods representative of low-rise
   residential and high-rise commercial urban areas, spanning a range of
   urban density, canyon geometry, building construction, and occupant
   schedules. The building thermal load and outdoor temperature are then
   calculated for these two idealized neighborhoods, analyzing the
   effectiveness of cool walls while also considering the role of other
   design factors such as window-to-wall ratio (WWR) and glazing solar heat
   gain coefficient (SHGC) in modulating the impact. Unlike the analysis of
   cool roofs, we find that a universal conclusion regarding the impact of
   cool walls cannot be drawn. The role of wall albedo significantly
   depends on the collective design of urban areas as well as the use and
   occupancy of buildings. We find that urban density (in other words the
   local climate zone) followed by window properties are important factors
   in determining the impact of wall albedo on thermal loads and UHI, as
   they determine the radiative exchange between and into the buildings.
   Accordingly, contrary to the general expectation, for a high urban
   density (commercial neighborhood LCZ6) and high WWR and SHGC, we observe
   that cool (reflective) walls can increase the building energy use.
   Regarding UHI, increasing the reflectivity of walls decreases the canopy
   air temperature but the impact is marginal (similar to 0.1 degrees C)
   compared to other urban design parameters. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The ongoing phenomenon of climate change is leading to an upsurge in the
   number of extreme events. Territories must adapt to these modifications
   in order to protect their populations and the properties present in
   coastal areas. The adaptation of coastal areas also aims to make them
   more resilient to future events. In this article, we examine two
   strategies for adapting to coastal risks: holding the coastal line
   through hard constructions such as seawalls or ripraps and the managed
   retreat of activities and populations to a part of the territory not
   exposed to hazards. In France, these approaches are financed by a
   solidarity insurance system at the national level as well as local
   taxes. These solidarity systems aim to compensate the affected
   populations and finance implementation of the strategies chosen by local
   authorities. However, the French mainland coast generally attracts
   affluent residents, the price of land being higher than inland. This
   situation induces the presence of inequalities in these territories,
   inequalities which can be maintained or reinforced in the short and
   medium term when a defense strategy based on hard constructions is
   implemented. In such a trajectory, it appears that these territories
   would be less resilient in the long term because of the maintenance
   costs of the structures and the uncertainties relating to the hazards
   (submersion, rising sea levels, erosion). Conversely, with a
   managed-retreat strategy, inequalities would instead be done away with
   since property and populations would no longer be exposed to hazards,
   which would cost society less and would lead these territories towards
   greater resilience in the long term. Only one social group would be
   strongly impacted by this strategy in the short term when they are
   subjected to a managed retreat to another part of the territory.},

Title = {Satellites to Sprinklers: Assessing the Role of Climate and Land Cover
   Change on Patterns of Urban Outdoor Water Use},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Outdoor water use represents over 50\% of total water demand in semiarid
   and arid cities and presents both challenges to and opportunities for
   improved efficiency and water resilience. The current work adapts a
   remote sensing-based methodology to estimate growing season irrigation
   rates at the census block group scale in Denver, Colorado. Results show
   that city-wide outdoor water use does not change significantly from 1995
   to 2018, while per capita water use and total water use significantly
   decrease from 2000 to 2018. Because total water use, but not outdoor
   use, is decreasing, the percent of water used outdoors significantly
   increases across the city from 2000 to 2018. Climate variables account
   for one-quarter of interannual variation in mean irrigation rates due
   primarily to changes in temperature, not precipitation. Percent
   impervious land cover exhibits a significant inverse nonlinear
   relationship with irrigation rates at the census block group scale.
   Finally, 38\% of Denver census block groups show significantly
   increasing irrigation rates between 1995 and 2018 driven primarily by
   increasing temperatures. The increasing proportion of water used for
   irrigation highlights the importance of outdoor demand management for
   urban water systems as indoor efficiencies improve. We advocate that
   resilient water systems necessitate integrated land use, infrastructure,
   and water planning in the face of urban growth and climate change. While
   minimizing irrigated urban areas may reduce demand, remaining green
   spaces should be designed to maximize multiple benefits including
   reductions in water demand and urban heat islands, stormwater
   management, and recreation to improve the sustainability of growing
   cities.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {145},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {431-444},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the context of growing concern about the threat of flooding posed by
   climate change in coastal areas, the Spanish plan for coastal adaptation
   to climate change gave rise to stringent requirements on risk
   consequence estimates at the regional scale O (100 km). Within this
   framework, we propose a methodology that combines high space-time
   resolution climate information (reanalysis databases and projections),
   local data on exposure that accounts for the most relevant sectors,
   site-specific vulnerability functions, and flood risk consequence
   valuation, gridded at 5 m. This approach involves efficient
   multiple-forcing flood modeling, in which the connection between climate
   change and potential inundation is primarily established through the
   definition of a total water level index. This research tackles
   challenging issues, including the importance of incorporating the
   effects of existing coastal defenses and local wave effects in port
   areas, dealing with data at different spatial scales and sectors in an
   integrated way, and the impact of discounting. The results provide
   insights into the possible consequences of inaction for a range of
   future scenarios based on changes in climate and socio-economics over
   the most relevant sectors. With the goal of prioritizing adaptive action
   and the efficient assignment of funds, we propose a weight-based
   integration of the sectoral value-at-risk through the application of
   Bayesian techniques and expert judgment. The methodology described here
   was applied to a pilot case study on the coast of Asturias in northern
   Spain.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the greatest threats to coastal zones.
   Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) considers the interaction
   between socioeconomic activities and environmental requirements to
   natural resources use in those coastal zones. It must now include
   measures to climate change adaptation, particularly directed to the most
   vulnerable areas such as estuaries, thus constituting a key component of
   spatial planning. This study aims to: (i) evaluate the integration of
   the concern of climate change adaptation in the Portuguese National
   Strategy for ICZM (PNSICZM), while a important spatial planning
   instrument at national level; and (ii) realize how this integration
   influences the management of the potential impacts of climate change at
   local level, in a temperate estuary, namely the Minho River Estuary
   (MRE) (located in NW-Portugal coastal zone). We verified that the
   PNSICZM integrates, both directly and indirectly, the concern of climate
   change adaptation. The PNSICZM highlights the need of climate change
   issue be integrated in coastal management and delivers a set of measures
   contributing to the effort of climate change adaptation and its
   guidelines must be included in the Spatial Planning Instruments (SPI) at
   regional and local level. In this context, the SPI covering the MRE must
   be adjusted to the PNSICZM guidelines in order to promote a planned
   adaptation of this estuary and of its adjacent coastal zone to the
   potential impacts of climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {117},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper studies the effects of mitigation and adaptation on coastal
   flood impacts. We focus on a scenario that stabilizes concentrations at
   450 ppm-CO2-eq leading to 42 cm of global mean sea-level rise in
   1995-2100 (GMSLR) and an unmitigated one leading to 63 cm of GMSLR. We
   also consider sensitivity scenarios reflecting increased tropical
   cyclone activity and a GMSLR of 126 cm. The only adaptation considered
   is upgrading and maintaining dikes. Under the unmitigated scenario and
   without adaptation, the number of people flooded reaches 168 million per
   year in 2100. Mitigation reduces this number by factor 1.4, adaptation
   by factor 461 and both options together by factor 540. The global annual
   flood cost (including dike upgrade cost, maintenance cost and residual
   damage cost) reaches US\$ 210 billion per year in 2100 under the
   unmitigated scenario without adaptation. Mitigation reduces this number
   by factor 1.3, adaptation by factor 5.2 and both options together by
   factor 7.8. When assuming adaptation, the global annual flood cost
   relative to GDP falls throughout the century from about 0.06 \% to
   0.01-0.03 \% under all scenarios including the sensitivity ones. From
   this perspective, adaptation to coastal flood impacts is meaningful to
   be widely applied irrespective of the level of mitigation. From the
   perspective of a some less-wealthy and small island countries, however,
   annual flood cost can amount to several percent of national GDP and
   mitigation can lower these costs significantly. We conclude that
   adaptation and mitigation are complimentary policies in coastal areas.},

Title = {Climate change and cultural responses of indigenous people: A case from
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {In recent decades, climate change has become a great concern all over
   the world and indigenous people espe-cially those who live in remote
   area and depend on natural resources are most vulnerable to this
   extremity. This research project is an attempt to find out the key
   indicators of cultural responses of indigenous people for adaption in
   climate change extremity. For conducting this study, 25 in-depth
   interviews were adopted by employing semi-structured and open-ended
   questionnaire to indigenous people in Rangamati sadar of Rangamati
   district in Bangladesh. The findings of the study indicate that
   indigenous people have idea about climate change and they get this idea
   from different media i.e., television, FM radio, local newspaper, peer
   groups etc. and blame developed countries for the causes of climate
   change events. The findings also indicate that for adapting to climate
   change, local people develop their own strategies, like planting trees
   surrounding their houses, per-forming religious activity, rendering
   mutual help to each other, taking relief or financial support from
   others for investment, applying indigenous technology, changing
   occupations etc. in their community. Very few empirical studies were
   conducted on cultural adaption of indigenous people in climate change,
   so this project findings can help policy makers as well as government to
   formulate policy to uplift this community in near future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},

Abstract = {Resilience theory has emerged as a holistic concept well suited to
   analyzing tourism systems and which promises important insights into the
   sustainability of tourism destinations in the face of accelerating
   global environmental change (GEC). This article presents empirical
   research into the social-ecological resilience of tour operators using
   the case study destination of the Otago Peninsula, Dunedin, New Zealand.
   It addresses the following research question: How do birdwatching tour
   operators build resilience to drivers of environmental change, including
   climatic drivers, into their operations? Qualitative interviews with
   providers of a specific nature tourism sector activity - birdwatching -
   were conducted with stakeholders including tour operators, conservation
   organizations, and local government members. The findings highlight
   current and possible future challenges to birdwatching tourism on the
   Otago Peninsula. The paper introduces a conceptual framework which
   highlights the tour operators' main coping strategies in response to key
   perceived social-ecological system (SES) drivers of change. Overall,
   tour operators perceived their main social-ecological resilience to be
   the diversity of the species of the Otago Peninsula, their business
   experience, and the strength of their local stakeholder network to
   respond to SES crises.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Flooding, as a result of heavy rains and/or storm surges, is a
   persistent problem in coastal areas. Under scenarios of climate change,
   there are expectations that flooding events will become more frequent in
   some areas and potentially more intense. This poses a potential threat
   to coastal communities relying heavily on coastal resources, such as
   beaches for tourism. This paper develops a methodology for the
   assessment of coastal flooding risks, based on an index that compares 16
   hydrogeomorphological, biophysical, human exposure and resilience
   indicators, with a specific focus on tourism. The paper then uses an
   existing flood vulnerability assessment of 724 beaches in Galicia
   (Spain) to test the index for tourism. Results indicate that
   approximately 10\% of tourism beaches are at high risk to flooding,
   including 10 urban and 36 rural beaches. Implications for adaptation and
   coastal management are discussed.},

Title = {Resilience of a tropical sport fish population to a severe cold event
   varies across five estuaries in southern Florida},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {For species that are closely managed, understanding population
   resilience to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances (i.e.,
   recovery trajectories across broad spatial areas) can guide which suite
   of management actions are available to mitigate any impacts. During
   January 2010, an extreme cold event in south Florida caused widespread
   mortality of common snook, Centropomus undecimalis, a popular sport
   fish. Interpretation of trends using fishery-independent monitoring data
   in five south Florida estuaries showed that changes in catch rates of
   adult snook (>500 mm standard length) varied between no effects
   postevent to large effects and 4-yr recoveries. The reasons for the
   variation across estuaries are unknown, but are likely related to
   differences in estuary geomorphology and habitat availability (e.g.,
   extent of deep rivers and canals) and differences in the proportions of
   behavior contingents (i.e., segments of the population that use
   divergent movement tactics) that place snook in different areas of the
   estuary during winter. Emerging awareness of the presence of behavior
   contingents, identification of overwintering sites, and improvements of
   abundance indices in remote nursery habitats should provide a better
   understanding of population resilience to disturbance events for snook.
   Given that changes in the frequency of short-lived, severe cold events
   are currently unknown, the findings and management actions described
   here for a tropical species living at the edge of its distribution
   should be useful to scientists forecasting the effects of climate
   change.},

Title = {Adaptive capacity and regional water governance in north-western Germany},
Journal = {WATER POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {794-815},
Abstract = {Successful adaptation to climate change requires flexible adaptation
   strategies which consider regional ecological, economic and social
   circumstances. Coastal zones are considered to be significantly
   vulnerable to climate change impacts. The projected impacts of climate
   change in the metropolitan region of Bremen-Oldenburg, Germany (a
   coastal area), are, for example, rising sea level, salt water intrusion,
   temporary groundwater scarcity in the summer and increased (heavy)
   rainfalls. This paper uses an existing framework, the Adaptive Capacity
   Wheel (ACW), complemented by two additional dimensions: adaptation
   motivation and adaptation belief. The objectives were first, to assess
   the adaptive capacity of water governance in the study region, and
   second, to show how the ACW can be used as an approach and a
   communication tool with stakeholders to identify strengths and
   weaknesses. Based on this, a further objective was to discover what
   lessons and recommendations can be drawn that could help water experts
   and stakeholders in the future. The results show a high adaptive
   capacity and that the addition of the psychological dimensions was
   valuable. However, it is important to look closely at each dimension
   assessed by the ACW. The key recommendations are: to improve public
   participation; to ensure better coordination; to raise awareness; and to
   reduce the lack of political will to overcome adaptation barriers.},

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {98-99},
Pages = {1-5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise is among the most important changes expected as a
   consequence of anthropogenic global warming. Climate model-based
   projections made until the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) yield a 21st century
   rise spanning nearly 20-60 cm. However, it is known that current climate
   models are likely to underestimate sea-level change in response to rapid
   climatic variations. Recent alternative semi-empirical approaches
   predict a much higher sea-level rise than the IPCC AR4 projections.
   Nevertheless, the underway depletion of conventional fossil fuels might,
   at least in principle, constrain future fossil CO2 emissions and, in
   turn, affect also the extent of sea-level rise. Here we project
   2000-2200 sea-level rise with a semi-empirical method coupled to a
   simple climate model that is run under a range of fossil-fuel exhaustion
   scenarios. We find that, in spite of fossil-fuel depletion, sea level is
   predicted to rise by at least similar to 80 cm at the end of this
   century and is expected to continue rising for at least the next two
   hundred years. The present results support the need for prompt and
   substantial emission cuts in order to slow down future sea-level rise
   and implement adaptation measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Improved understanding of the potential regional impacts of projected
   climatic changes on nitrogen yield is needed to inform water resources
   management throughout the United States (U.S.). The objective of this
   research is to look broadly at watersheds in the contiguous U.S. to
   assess the potential regional impact of changes in precipitation (P) and
   air temperature (T) on nitrogen yield. The SPAtially Referenced
   Regression On Watershed attributes model and downscaled P and T outputs
   from 14 general circulation models were used to explore impacts on
   nitrogen yield. Results of the analysis suggest that projected changes
   in P and T will decrease nitrogen yield for the majority of the
   contiguous U.S., including the watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay and Gulf
   of Mexico. Some regions, however, such as the Pacific Northwest and
   Northern California, are projected to face climatic conditions that,
   according to the model results, may increase nitrogen yield. Combining
   the projections of climate-driven changes in nitrogen yield with
   projected changes in watershed nitrogen inputs could help water resource
   managers develop regionally specific, long-term strategies to mitigate
   nitrogen pollution.},

Abstract = {The challenge of reaching common understanding of the processes and
   significance of environmental change amounts to a procedural
   vulnerability in climate change research that hinders successfully
   translating knowledge into equitable and effective adaptation policy.
   This article presents findings from research with Indigenous
   participants in West Arnhem, Australia, and identifies a procedural
   vulnerability to climate change research, where perceptions of change
   and their meaning have their context in Dreaming that supersedes and
   parallels Western scientific discourses of hazard and risk, but that are
   marginalised in studies and policies on climate change. This paper
   argues that moves to adapt remote Indigenous Australian communities to
   climate change risk missing the mark if they (a) assume that a strong
   reliance on particular ecosystem configurations makes Indigenous
   cultures universally vulnerable to environmental change, (b) do not
   recognise cosmologically embedded risks that are determined by
   Indigenous capacity to take care of country, and (c) do not recognise
   colonisation as an ongoing disaster in Indigenous Nations, and therefore
   treat secondary disasters such as poverty, ill health and welfare
   dependence as primary contributors to high climate change vulnerability.
   Procedural vulnerabilities contribute to policy failure, and in
   Australian contexts pose a risk of conceiving solutions to climate
   change vulnerability that involve moving people out of the way of
   environmental risks as they are conceived within colonial traditions,
   while moving them into the way of risks as conceived through the eyes of
   remote Indigenous communities. This research joins recent publications
   that encourage researchers and policy-makers to epistemologically ground
   proof risk assessments and to listen and engage in conversations that
   create ways of `seeing with both eyes', while not being blind to the
   hazards of colonisation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Synthesis of Opportunities for Applying the Telecoupling Framework to
   Marine Protected Areas},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The world's oceans face unprecedented anthropogenic threats in the
   globalized era that originate from all over the world, including climate
   change, global trade and transportation, and pollution. Marine protected
   areas (MPAs) serve important roles in conservation of marine
   biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, but their success is increasingly
   challenged in the face of such large-scale threats. Here, we illustrate
   the utility of adopting the interdisciplinary telecoupling framework to
   better understand effects that originate from distant places and cross
   MPA boundaries (e.g., polluted water circulation, anthropogenic noise
   transport, human and animal migration). We review evidence of distal
   processes affecting MPAs and the cutting-edge approaches currently used
   to investigate these processes. We then introduce the umbrella framework
   of telecoupling and explain how it can help address knowledge gaps that
   exist due to limitations of past approaches that are centered within
   individual disciplines. We then synthesize five examples from the recent
   telecoupling literature to explore how the telecoupling framework can be
   used for MPA research. These examples include the spatial subsidies
   approach, adapted social network analysis, telecoupled qualitative
   analysis, telecoupled supply chain analysis, and decision support tools
   for telecoupling. Our work highlights the potential for the telecoupling
   framework to better understand and address the mounting and
   interconnected socioeconomic and environmental sustainability challenges
   faced by the growing number of MPAs around the world.},

Abstract = {A resilient system is one that is able to sustain disruptions by been
   able to operate close to the optimum or acceptable sub optimum
   performance by reconfiguring itself to accommodate the disruptions.
   Resiliency is an important component of sustainability, as a
   non-resilient system will not be sustainable in the long term. The
   freight transportation chain that goes through ports is very susceptible
   to disruptions and poses important issues related to its resiliency.
   The purpose of this paper is to use optimization models to address
   freight chain disruption problems and evaluate their resiliency. Our
   approach is based on reconfiguration to include other resources and
   routes which in the absence of disruption were not cost effective, and
   therefore under normal conditions were not feasible choices. Using other
   resources and alternative routes depends on location, severity, and
   duration of disruption. Our approach identifies which of these resources
   and routes are best choices for the kind of disruption that took place.
   We use a simulation case study that focuses on disruption scenarios in
   the two major sea ports on the south west coast of the United States.
   The computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed
   algorithm in mitigating the impact of freight chain disruption.},

Title = {Climate change adaptation in small island developing states: Insights
   and lessons from a meta-paradigmatic study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {85},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {172-181},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper describes how an earlier study's novel, meta-paradigmatic
   approach was used to answer two research questions of international
   significance: (1) How are small island developing states (SIDS) adapting
   to climate change at the national level? and (2) What are the factors
   that affect adaptation at the national level in SIDS? As acknowledged in
   the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the
   2015 Paris Climate Agreement, SIDS are distinct from other developing
   countries. They are 58 countries spread across three main geographic
   regions that are disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change; they require special attention and support from the
   international community. Previous studies using a single theory to
   understand adaptation in SIDS were limited and unable to fully grapple
   with the totality, enormity and complexity of the climate challenge.
   This paper argues for capitalising on the value of the distinctiveness
   of different theories and approaches without having to integrate them
   into one paradigm. It further catalogues the earlier study's
   contributions to climate change adaptation scholarship and
   theory-building. It does not seek to rationalise the earlier study or
   justify any theoretical perspective. Instead, it seeks to serve as an
   incubator for new thinking on investigating climate adaptation in
   complex geographies. Additionally, it teases out lessons and insights
   for national governments and other actors that are designing and
   implementing climate change adaptation policies and programs in
   disproportionately vulnerable countries in the Global South.},

Title = {Are coastal managers ready for climate change? A case study from
   estuaries along the Pacific coast of the United States},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {143},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {38-50},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {A key challenge for coastal resource managers is to plan and implement
   climate change adaptation strategies inlight of uncertainties and
   competing management priorities. In 2014, we held six workshops across
   estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America with over 150
   participants to evaluate resource managers' perceived level of
   understanding of climate change science, where they obtain information,
   how they use this knowledge, and their preparedness for incorporating
   climate change into their management decisions. We found that most
   resource managers understood the types of climate change impacts likely
   to occur in their estuaries, but often lacked the scientific information
   to make decisions and plan effectively. Managers stated that time,
   money, and staff resources were the largest obstacles in their efforts.
   Managers identified that they learned most of their information from
   peers, scientific journals, and the Internet and indicated that
   sea-level rise was their greatest concern. There was, however, variation
   in managers' levels of readiness and perceived knowledge within and
   among workshop locations. The workshops revealed that some regions don't
   have the information they need or the planning capacity to effectively
   integrate climate change into their management, with eight out of
   fifteen site comparisons showing a significant difference between their
   level of preparedness (F-5,F-26 = 6.852; p = 0.0003), and their
   willingness to formally plan (F-5,F-26 = 12.84; p = 0.000002). We found
   that Urban estuaries were significantly different from Mixed Use and
   Rural estuaries, in having access to information and feeling more
   prepared to conduct climate change planning and implementation (F-2,F-29
   = 17.34; p = 0.00001). To facilitate climate change preparedness more
   comprehensive integration of science into management decisions is
   essential. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) increases the risk of permanent inundation of
   coastal lands and structures, while also increasing the risk of periodic
   damage from storms and risks to ecological resources. Prior studies have
   illustrated the importance of considering adaptation measures, such as
   armoring and beach nourishment, when estimating the economic cost of
   SLR, but these studies have taken the form either of careful,
   geographically limited case studies or national estimates based on
   limited samples. We present a framework for evaluating the economics of
   adaptation to permanent inundation from SLR that employs detailed local
   scale data and is spatially comprehensive, and apply the framework to
   estimate costs of adaptation for the full coastline of the continental
   US. Our results show that the economic cost of SLR is much larger than
   prior estimates suggest-more than \$63 billion cumulative discounted
   cost (at 3\%) for a 68 cm SLR by 2100, and \$230 billion
   undiscounted-yet is only one-fourth the total value of low-lying
   property vulnerable to SLR, illustrating the importance of careful
   site-specific consideration of adaptation. Further, the granularity of
   the framework provides spatial, temporal, and response mode details
   useful to both national policy-makers and local adaptation planners, and
   can readily incorporate estimates of ecological and storm surge damages
   as they become available. (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. WIREs Clim

Abstract = {A changing climate is expected to introduce uncertainty into water
   resource management decision making. We examined the latest
   publicly-available, state-level guidance regarding the management of
   water supplies and demands concerning risks associated with drought,
   flooding, and climate change. We found state-level guidance
   supplementing the federally-backed flood mitigation program to be
   updated most regularly (54\% in the last 5 years; 84\% in the last
   decade). Yet, the underlying floodplain mapping data these local
   planning efforts rely on are acknowledged by the Federal Emergency
   Management Agency (FEMA) to be chronically outdated. Drought planning
   guidance was found to be most outdated (16\% last updated in the last 5
   years; 18\% almost two decades ago), and across the U.S., almost
   universally (94\%) reactive (emergency response) rather than proactive
   (mitigation or management). Although 79-94\% of states provide some
   level of guidance regarding water supply and demand, the projections
   themselves may significantly predate the guidance. Many (70\%) U.S.
   states still lack climate change impact guidance, particularly
   non-coastal states and those impacted by increased water scarcity rather
   than flooding. Strategies are rare (4\%) for addressing the impacts of
   increased variability and uncertainty to meet inelastic demands with
   finite supplies. We conclude significant gaps exist in planning to
   address known or projected risks of climate-related impacts. Specific
   recommendations, including the implementation of a nationwide water
   census, are provided to improve both the data and knowledge base of
   water management and reduce current vulnerabilities. (c) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {Behavioral adaptation to heat-related health risks in cities},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {823-829},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Heat-related mortality is of growing concern for cities faced with the
   combined effects of increasing heat-wave frequency and intensity and
   stronger urban heat islands (UHI). In cities around the world, high air
   temperatures have been found to have strong repercussions in terms of
   heat-related mortality for populations aged 65 years and older,
   especially nighttime temperatures.
   In response, many measures have been proposed to counteract the effects
   of UHI such as cool roofs and materials or urban greening. While these
   approaches are promising and are rightfully explored, behavioral
   adaptation measures have not received as much attention. Given the
   importance of nighttime temperatures on heat-wave mortality and the
   importance of sleep quality for individuals to recover from intense
   daytime heat exposure, adapting sleeping habits to reduce sleep time
   exposure to intense heat may help reduce the health impacts of
   heat-waves.
   In this paper, outdoor and indoor temperature measurements conducted
   over the summer of 2015 in the bedrooms of two apartments in Paris,
   France are analyzed. The potential for this kind of behavioral
   adaptation to reduce occupant exposure to high sleep time temperatures
   is quantified and discussed. The policy implications of our findings and
   their practicality are also mentioned. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   impact of environmental degradation and housing policy},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {25789-25801},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The significance of the natural geographical characteristics and
   ecological formation of the Coastline Mediterranean Countries (CMC)
   suggests a further examination of the dynamics of the renewable energy
   consumption (renewables) within the aforesaid region. As such, the
   dynamic impact of carbon emissions and the housing construction policy
   vis-a-vis dwellings, building and residential developments on the
   renewable energy consumption is investigated among Spain, France,
   Slovenia, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon and Israel. The dynamic autoregressive
   distributed lag methods of the pooled mean group, mean group and dynamic
   fixed-effect estimators are adopted for the empirical investigation over
   the periods 1999-2014 with real income and tourism employed as an
   additional variable. Using the PMG estimators, empirical results show
   that positive and statistically significant relationship exists among
   the variables in the long run. A 1\% increase in housing construction
   policy, real income tourism and carbon emissions leads to (0.955),
   (8.622), (0.007) and (6.805) increase in renewable energy growth, while
   deviations in the short run significantly adjust to long-run equilibrium
   under an unforeseen disturbance at a moderate annual speed of about 73\%
   annually. The inference from the short-run estimated coefficients
   indicates that housing construction policy is not a driver of renewables
   in Israel. From a policy standpoint, proposed strategic housing
   development policy and environmental pollution mitigation policy by
   policymakers should be void of causing a disservice toward the
   enrichment of renewable energy generation domestically in the panel
   countries.},

Title = {Thermal-physics and energy performance of an innovative green roof
   system: The Cool-Green Roof},
Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {337-356},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Given the large amount of worldwide energy use associated to buildings'
   life cycle, in recent years various energy efficient strategies have
   been proposed to reduce buildings' environmental impact, e.g. green and
   cool roofs. The purpose of this work is to analyze an innovative type of
   green roof, named Cool-Green Roof combining the features of both green
   and cool roofs. In fact, it is characterized by a specific vegetative
   layer able to optimize the quote of short-wave radiation reflected by
   the selected vegetation. After the analytical dissertation of the
   system, the developed solution is studied when applied in a case study
   building represented by a multifamily XVI century building in central
   Italy, characterized by cement based roof ceiling needing to be
   retrofitted. Both in-lab and in-field experimental analyses were carried
   out for evaluating the building thermal-physics and the solar
   reflectance and thermal emittance of the selected plant compared to
   other flat roof materials and greeneries. Additionally, the year-round
   performance of Cool-Green Roof is assessed through calibrated and
   validated dynamic thermal-energy simulation. Main findings of the study
   show how the Cool-Green Roof is able to reduce the number of indoor
   overheating hours in summer by 98.2\%, with negligible penalties in
   winter, given its high insulation capability, typical of green roof
   solutions. Therefore, the Cool-Green Roof could be considered as (i) a
   strategy for roof retrofitting in existing (even historic) buildings,
   and (ii) a solution for improving urban environment quality. Finally,
   the Cool-Green Roof could represent a promising mitigation strategy
   against urban heat island phenomenon, suitable for application even in
   those dense historical cities where other invasive mitigation techniques
   are unlikely applicable. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Human competences that facilitate adaptation to climate change: a
   research in progress},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {246-259},
Abstract = {Purpose - For communities threatened by current or impending climate
   change, adaptation is becoming a necessity. Although little research has
   been done on human competences so far, this research shows that some
   appear to facilitate the adaptation process. The purpose of this
   multiple-case study is to identify adaptive competences demonstrated by
   two groups of Canadian citizens: municipal employees in a coastal
   community and farmers.
   Design/methodology/approach - As part of workshops based on a problem
   solving process, the two groups analyzed the impacts of climate change
   in their field of work and geographical area, chose a problem related to
   these impacts, suggested and then implemented adaptation measures. The
   municipal employees worked on sea level rise, whereas the farmers
   focused on poor soil quality, which makes it vulnerable to bad weather.
   Findings - By thematically analyzing the verbatim transcripts of the
   workshops and by building narratives, the authors were able to identify
   similar adaptive competences in both groups: local knowledge, futures
   thinking, hindsight, risk prediction, critical thinking,
   decision-making, and problem solving (highlighting key problem
   components, suggesting solutions, and identifying constraints). However,
   two competences were chiefly found in the group composed of farmers:
   optimism and openness to novelty.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the first to lead to
   recommendations regarding the pedagogical support of citizens during an
   adaptation process to climate change. These recommendations might be
   helpful in many communities where adaptation to climate change is a
   pressing issue.},

   Behavior of the Taiwanese Public},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study assessed people's water literacy awareness, attitudes, and
   behaviors to iden-tify strategies for coping with drought and water
   scarcity. The data from 653 questionnaires were analyzed by statistical
   validation and using IBM SPSS 22 and IBM AMOS 26.0. The views of
   students, housewives, swimming pool owners, schoolteachers, and experts
   were collected and finally examined by multivariate validation analysis.
   People have a high level of water literacy and developed sufficient
   water-saving habits (4.60). Although most people believe that tap water
   is of good quality, it is difficult to deliver and expensive, and cannot
   be consumed directly. Even though people are aware of the water shortage
   crisis, willing to carry water bottles instead of using plastic bottled
   water, choosing to buy environmentally friendly cleaning products
   (4.08), performing water conservation behaviors on the go, taking
   showers within 6-15 min, and taking the initiative to notify the
   relevant authorities to repair water facilities, the frequency of using
   bottled water is still high due to work and living habits, consumption
   ability, and mobility constraints (34.6), and they are less willing to
   buy products with the ``water proficiency label{''} (4.08) and
   participate in stream-cleaning activities (3.57). The willingness to
   participate in water purification activities is low. The public also
   feels that the government is responsible for solving the current water
   shortage crisis (3.71). There are significant differences in the
   perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors of water literacy among people of
   different genders, ages, and regions, depending on their work and
   consumption abilities, quality of life, and convenience (p < 0.05).
   Increasing water responsibility can enhance environmental management
   actions, consumer economic actions, and civic actions, while enhancing
   water perceptions and crisis awareness can further strengthen civic
   behaviors.},

Title = {Evidence of the Climate Mitigation Effect of Green Roofs-A 20-Year
   Weather Study on an Extensive Green Roof (EGR) in Northeast Germany},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Approximately 10 km(2) of new green roofs are built in Germany every
   year. About 85\% of these are Extensive Green Roofs (EGR). An EGR with
   several research features was installed on new buildings belonging to
   the University of Applied Sciences Neubrandenburg in 1999. The results
   of the almost 20-year permanent survey of the climate effects of the
   green roof in contrast to gravel roofs are presented here. High-quality
   sensors, similar to those used by official weather stations, are in use,
   and data is collected every 10 s and aggregated to hourly values which
   enable comparisons to official measurements made by the DWD in
   Neubrandenburg and Berlin. The results show the typical urban heat
   island effect (UHI) and the mitigation effect of EGR. Whilst the
   temperature increased over the years due to the urban heat island
   effect, the temperature within the growing media in the green roof
   remained constant. The EGR has a stabilization effect of 1.5 K. This is
   good news for all those seeking a UHI mitigation solution for city
   centers. In a best-case scenario, the green roof potential of cities in
   Germany is between 3 and 8\%. A value of 50\% can be achieved for all
   buildings; roofs represent about 1/4 of urban surfaces, and the cooling
   effect of 1.5 K in 20 years is a reasonable contribution to cooling
   cities and achieving environmental goals by greening urban surfaces.},

Title = {Hotspots of Yield Loss for Four Crops of the Belt and Road Terrestrial
   Countries under 1.5 \& DEG;C Global Warming},
Journal = {LAND},

Abstract = {The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   change (IPCC) shows that climate change poses severe risks to the Belt
   and Road region and could cut future crop production. Identifying the
   positions and features of hotspots, which refer to regions with severe
   yield loss at 1.5 \& DEG;C global warming, is the key to developing
   proper mitigation and adaptation policies to ensure regional food
   security. This study examined yield loss hotspots of four crops (maize,
   rice, soybean and wheat) at 1.5 \& DEG;C global warming under RCP8.5.
   Yield data were derived from simulations of multiple climate-crop model
   ensembles from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project
   (ISI-MIP). Hotspots were identified by setting a threshold of the 10th
   percentile of crop yields during the reference period (1986-2005). To
   quantify the likelihood of crop yield loss hotspots within multi-model
   ensembles, the agreement of model combinations for hotspots was
   calculated for each crop at the grid scale with 0.5 \& DEG; x 0.5 \&
   DEG; spatial resolution. Results revealed spatial heterogeneity of
   cultivation structure and hotspot likelihood for four crops. The four
   crops' production of SA (South Asia) and SEA (Southeast Asia) accounts
   for more than 40\% of the total production in the Belt and Road region,
   roughly four times the amount produced in CEE (Central and Eastern
   Europe) and NEA (Northeast Asia). Besides, the hotspots likelihood of
   maize, rice and soybean is generally larger in SA/SEA than that in
   CEE/NEA which means the risk of yield reduction is higher in the current
   main agricultural area. According to IPCC's classification rules for
   likelihood, four crops' hotspot patterns were displayed under the 1.5 \&
   DEG;C global warming. As the highest-yielding crop, maize shows the
   largest proportion of ``likely `` hotspots (hotspot likelihood > 66\%),
   which is about 6.48\%, accounting for more than four times that of the
   other three crops. In addition, four crops' hotspots are mainly
   distributed in SEA and SA. Overall, SEA and SA are vulnerable subregions
   and maize is the vulnerable crop of the Belt and Road region. Our
   results could provide information on target areas where mitigation or
   adaptations are needed to reduce the adverse influence of climate change
   in the agricultural system.},

Title = {Saving Shimla, North India, from the next earthquake},

Pages = {90-97},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Shimla is a teeming city, with a population of 140,000. It is located in
   the north Indian Himalayas, in on area of high seismicity that was
   rocked by a devastating earthquake 6 hundred years ago. However, it is
   oblivious of the ticking time bomb below its foundations. Initiating
   risk reduction in this fast growing urban economic hub is on enormous
   challenge. A national non-governmental organisation (NGO) called SEEDS
   (Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society) started
   working in the city just before the earthquake centenary, with the aim
   to identify ways of reducing earthquake risk through actions that could
   be carried out by the citizens and the local government.
   The experience has been unique, and has led to further refinement of the
   community action planning approach that SEEDS (Sustainable Environment
   and Ecological Development Society) has picked up and worked with over
   the lost ten years in different vulnerable communities in the region.
   What emerges from the experience is a mix of tools for the improvement
   of technical aspects, community-based working approaches and governance
   for risk reduction. It is evident that community-local govemment-NGO
   partnerships ore the key to solving such acute problems as earthquake
   safety in a resource stropped, vulnerable city. The assessment and
   planning phases initiate the building of these partnerships in the early
   stages of the process.
   This paper is on attempt to shore the experience of developing and
   testing a community based urban risk reduction approach for a city at
   extreme earthquake risk.},

Title = {Sustainable management of populations impacted by harvesting and climate
   change INTRODUCTION},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {1-7},
Abstract = {The sustainable use of natural resources is critical for addressing the
   global challenges of today. Strategies for sustainable harvesting need
   to consider not only harvested species, but also other non-harvested
   species interacting with them in the same ecosystem. In addition,
   environmental variation needs to be considered, with climate change
   currently being one of the main sources of this variation. Understanding
   the consequences of complex interactions between different drivers and
   processes affecting dynamics of species and ecosystems across spatial
   scales requires large-scale integrative research projects. The Norwegian
   research initiative ``Sustainable management of renewable resources in a
   changing environment: an integrated approach across ecosystems{''}
   (SUSTAIN) was launched to fill knowledge gaps related to the sustainable
   management of populations and ecosystems experiencing climate change.
   SUSTAIN investigated terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems in
   boreal and Arctic regions, using both theoretical developments and
   empirical analyses of long-term data. This Climate Research Special
   contains both synthesis articles and original research exemplifying some
   of the approaches used in SUSTAIN. In this introduction we highlight 4
   key topics addressed by SUSTAIN: (i) population structure, (ii)
   interactions between species, (iii) spatial processes, and (iv) adaptive
   management. These topics are fundamental to the understanding of
   harvested species from an ecosystem perspective, and to ecosystem-based
   management approaches, which we are striving to work towards.},

Title = {Adapting food systems to the twin challenges of phosphorus and climate
   vulnerability: the case of Sri Lanka},
Journal = {FOOD SECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {477-492},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Two of the biggest global challenges for food security - phosphorus
   scarcity and climate change - are threatening farmers' livelihoods,
   agricultural productivity and environmental integrity. In Sri Lanka, the
   agricultural sector is comprised largely of smallholder farmers where
   rain-fed rice is often a staple. Yet climate change projections indicate
   rice yields could drop by 40\%, affecting the majority of farmers, and
   poverty levels could increase from 17\% to 33\%. At the same time,
   fertilisers are highly subsidized, without which farmers in this
   import-dependent island state would be exposed to future price
   fluctuations like the 800\% phosphate price spike in 2008. Collaborative
   research between Sri Lankan and Australian researchers investigated the
   capacity of smallholder farmers, policy-makers and other food system
   stakeholders in Sri Lanka to adapt to these twin challenges via a
   participatory rapid integrated vulnerability assessment framework. We
   find that while Sri Lanka is vulnerable, there are many adaptive
   strategies already in place or planned. Although these strategies are
   not driven by climate change adaptation or phosphorus scarcity, they
   could be strengthened to support phosphorus and climate smart
   agriculture (PACSA). Sri Lanka's food production is in the midst of a
   major transformation, largely driven by the President's push for organic
   agriculture and organic fertilisers, waste-to-energy systems implemented
   through public-private partnerships, and the National Adaptation Plan
   for Climate Change. There are many `win-win' PACSA opportunities both
   on- and off-farm, such as developing crop varieties that are
   drought-tolerant and need less phosphorus fertiliser and improved cold
   storage in the food value chain to reduce food losses.},

Title = {Who are the losers? Gendered-migration, climate change, and the impact
   of large scale land acquisitions on food security in coastal Tanzania},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {101},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The recent wave of large scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) in low-income
   countries has engendered intense debate partly because of its impact on
   livelihoods and ecology, with outcomes structured by complex unequal
   power relations at multiple scales. Together with the onslaught of
   climate change on livelihoods, LSLA is contributing to new, and
   exacerbating old vulnerabilities in ways that raise important questions
   for research. We examined the impact of LSLAs on food security
   disparities across multiple intersections of vulnerabilities: gender,
   migration, and climate change. Guided by political ecology concepts, we
   analyzed cross-sectional data (n = 1136) from Tanzania using
   multivariate ordinal logistic regression and post-estimation margins.
   The analyses revealed that male non-migrants compared with female
   non-migrants were 58 \% more likely to report that LSLA was resulting in
   food insecurity. Individuals who experienced drought were 42 \% less
   likely, while those who perceived temperature to be hotter (OR = 0.58, p
   < 0.05), rapidly changing (OR = 0.21, p < 0.01), or even stable (OR =
   0.13, p < 0.01) compared to those who perceived temperature to be colder
   were less likely to report that LSLA was resulting in food insecurity.
   While male non-migrants reported the highest probability (0.81) of
   experiencing food insecurity as a result of LSLAs, with the added effect
   of climate change, the impact of LSLAs on food insecurity is reduced
   among non-migrants but exacerbated among migrants. These findings
   suggest the need for policy priority on smallholder agriculture as a
   climate change adaptation strategy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change footprints in the ocean go beyond the mixed
   layer depth, with considerable impacts throughout mesopelagic and
   deep-ocean ecosystems. Yet, little is known about the timing of these
   environmental changes, their spatial extent, and the associated
   timescales of recovery in the ocean interior when strong mitigation
   strategies are involved. Here, we simulate idealized rapid climate
   change and mitigation scenarios using the Norwegian Earth System Model
   to investigate timescales of climate change onset and recovery and the
   extent of change in the North Atlantic (NAtl) interior relative to
   Pre-industrial (PI) variability across a suite of environmental drivers
   (Temperature-Temp; pH; Dissolved Oxygen-DO; Apparent Oxygen
   Utilization-AOU; Export Production-EP; and Calcite saturation
   state-omega(c)). We show that, below the subsurface domains, responses
   of these drivers are asymmetric and detached from the anthropogenic
   forcing with large spatial variations. Vast regions of the interior NAtl
   experience detectable anthropogenic signals significantly earlier and
   over a longer period than those projected for the near-surface. In
   contrast to surface domains, the NAtl interior remains largely warmer
   relative to PI (up to +50\%) following the mitigation scenario, with
   anomalously lower EP, pH, and omega(c) (up to -20\%) south of 30 degrees
   N. Oxygen overshoot in the upper mesopelagic of up to +20\% is
   simulated, mainly driven by a decrease in consumption during
   remineralization. Our study highlights the need for long-term commitment
   focused on pelagic and deep-water ecosystem monitoring to fully
   understand the impact of anthropogenic climate change on the North
   Atlantic biogeochemistry.},

Title = {The European and global potential of carbon dioxide sequestration in
   tackling climate change},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {155-171},
Abstract = {Although, it has received relatively little attention as a potential
   method of combating climate change in comparison to energy reduction
   measures and development of carbon-free energy technologies,
   sequestration of carbon dioxide in geologic or biospheric sinks has
   enormous potential. This paper reviews the potential for sequestration
   using geological and ocean storage as a means of reducing carbon dioxide
   emissions.
   Considerable quantities of carbon dioxide separated from natural gas
   deposits and from hydrogen production from steam reforming of methane
   are already used in enhanced oil recovery and in extraction of coalbed
   methane, the carbon dioxide remaining sequestered at the end of the
   process. A number of barriers lie in the way of its implementation on a
   large scale. There are concerns about possible environmental effects of
   large-scale injection of carbon dioxide especially into the oceans.
   Available technologies, especially of separating and capturing the
   carbon dioxide from waste stream, have high costs at present, perhaps
   representing an additional 40-100\% onto the costs of generating
   electricity. In most of the world there are no mechanisms to encourage
   firms to consider sequestration.
   Considerable R\&D is required to bring down the costs of the process, to
   elucidate the environmental effects of storage and to ensure that carbon
   dioxide will not escape from stores in unacceptably short timescales.
   However, the potential of sequestration should not be underestimated as
   a contribution to global climate change mitigation measures.},

Title = {Rainfall distribution and trends of the daily precipitation
   concentration index in northern Morocco: a need for an adaptive
   environmental policy},
Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A national priority at the Moroccan level is to understand the
   spatiotemporal rainfall irregularity to anticipate suitable strategies
   for water and agriculture management. The most northern mountainous
   region shows intense sensitivity to extreme hydroclimatic hazards which
   may compromise the future of socioeconomic acceleration and further
   weaken environmental balances. However, planning and decision making
   require accurate data, on a detailed scale and with good spatial
   distribution which is not the case in several south-Mediterranean
   countries where rainfall data and/or well-established
   hydro-meteorological network is lacking. In this paper, abundant rain
   gauge measurements combined with time-series open data (1958-2015) were
   used to study the rainfall variability. Results show an annual rainfall
   increase trend since 1996 with frequent, intense and abundant rains
   causing violent torrents and floods. This humid trend alternates with
   short but severe dry periods. Spatial distribution shows a rainfall
   increase from eastern to western area and from the coastal plains to
   high mountains. Based on a continuous daily rainfall dataset (from 1988
   to 2012) from six scattered stations, it appears that the pattern of
   heavy and extreme wet days takes the form of an irregular interannual
   cycle. Trends of the annual precipitation daily concentration indicate a
   significant positive trend in the center than in the East of the study
   area. Considering these observations, a review of water
   needs/obligations priorities seems crucial so that a new conscious and
   adaptative environmental policy would approve new procedures for a
   sustainable management.},

Title = {Climate change health assessment: a novel approach for Alaska Native
   communities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {266-273},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives. Develop a process for assessing climate change impacts on
   public health that identifies climate-health vulnerabilities and
   mechanisms and encourages adaptation.
   Study design. Multi-stakeholder, participatory, qualitative research.
   Methods. A Climate Change Health Assessment (CCHA) was developed that
   involved 4 steps: (1) scoping to describe local conditions and engage
   stakeholders; (2) surveying to collect descriptive and quantitative
   data; (3) analysis to evaluate the data; and (4) planning to communicate
   findings and explore appropriate actions with community members. The
   health effects related to extreme weather, thinning ice, erosion,
   flooding, thawing permafrost and changing conditions of water and food
   resources were considered.
   Results. The CCHA process was developed and performed in north-west
   Arctic villages. Refinement of the process took place in Point Hope, a
   coastal Inupiat village that practices whaling and a variety of other
   traditional subsistence harvest practices. Local observers identified
   climate change impacts that resulted in damaged health infrastructure,
   compromised food and water security and increased risk of injury.
   Priority health issues included thawing traditional ice cellars,
   diminished quality of the community water source and increased safety
   issues related to sea ice change. The CCHA increased awareness about
   health vulnerability and encouraged informed planning and
   decision-making.
   Conclusion. A community-scale assessment process guided by
   observation-based data can identify climate health impacts, raise
   awareness and encourage adaptive actions, thereby improving the response
   capacity of communities vulnerable to climate change. (Int J Circumpolar
   Health 2011; 70(3):266-273)},

Title = {A model chain approach for coastal inundation: Application to the bay of
   Alghero},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {219},
Pages = {56-70},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Coastal inundation is an important threat for many nearshore regions
   worldwide, and has significantly increased in the last years also due to
   sea-level rise and augmented impact of extreme events, like sea storms.
   Many countries and regions have recently invested to overcome such
   problems, which commonly lead to structure damages, beach erosion and
   many other consequences. Numerical modeling is an important tool for
   coastal inundation prediction, being a valuable support for management
   issues to mitigate the inundation risk or suggest resilient solutions.
   The present work illustrates a novel approach, based on a numerical
   model chain that exploits a tide-surge-wave operational modeling system
   (Kassandra), a phase-averaged model (ROMS-SWAN) for the wave propagation
   towards the shore, and a phase-resolving solver (NSWE) for the
   prediction of runup and coastal inundation. Such a chain is applied to
   the bay of Alghero (Sardinia, Italy), where the results of the mentioned
   chain are compared to those obtained using, in place of the
   phase-averaged model, an analytical model for the wave propagation.
   Results confirm that both chain approaches provide comparable
   inundations, though the use of the analytical, more approximate (e.g.,
   less accurate and reliable description of wave breaking dissipation),
   model suggests more severe conditions and larger flooded areas. Our
   contribution provides a methodological approach for an accurate and
   reliable estimate of coastal flooding.},

Title = {Projected climate change impacts on the ecosystems of the Agulhas Bank,
   South Africa},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Marine ecosystems are expected to be increasingly affected by climate
   change, impacting their physical and biogeochemical environment. Changes
   in primary production, temperatures and hence species distribution, may
   lead to critical consequences for fishery exploitation. Therefore,
   future projections are essential to develop sustainable strategies and
   climate change adaptation plans for fisheries, and fishery-dependent
   societies. In this study, we focus on the Agulhas Bank, a broad
   extension of the continental shelf of the South African coast, along
   which flows the western boundary Agulhas Current. The Agulhas Bank is
   known for being biologically productive and is an important nursery
   ground for many commercially exploited fish species, including the
   chokka squid fishery, a vital source of income for many people in the
   Eastern Cape Province. Squid catches manifest strong interannual
   fluctuations, at times causing fishery crashes. Additional impacts due
   to climate change will have significant socio-economic consequences for
   this all-important fishery. To investigate future variations of the
   physical and biogeochemical environment on the Agulhas Bank, we used the
   global ocean model NEMOMEDUSA, forced by the high emissions scenario
   RCP8.5. Our simulations show a significant increase in sea surface
   temperature and bottom temperature, but limited changes in primary
   production. Projections highlight an increase in current velocity on the
   Agulhas Bank throughout the course of this century, induced by an
   onshore shift of the Agulhas current. This current shift may pose a
   threat to squid recruitment success as a large fraction of squid
   paralarvae may be removed from their shelf feeding grounds and lost to
   the greater ocean via the Agulhas current. The results further show that
   planktonic food for the paralarvae is less likely to become the main
   limiting factor in the future, while increasing temperatures may affect
   growth rates and spawning success.},

Title = {Modelled Impact of Vegetation Heterogeneity and Salt-Marsh Zonation on
   Wave Damping},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the effect of observed vegetation characteristics on
   modelled wave heights. Detailed information on species composition, as
   well as on height, number of stems, and diameter of the plant species of
   a restored salt marsh on the Wadden barrier island of Terschelling was
   used to parameterize and apply the Simulating Waves Nearshore Vegetation
   wave model to a schematized restored salt-marsh zone in front of the
   dike. The results indicate that wave damping by vegetated forelands is
   strongly related to vegetation heterogeneity and salt-marsh zonation.
   The modelling works suggest that at the study site under storm
   conditions with a frequency of 5-10 times/y, a vegetated foreland of
   some 90 m in width will dampen the wave height more than 80\%, whereas
   under extreme conditions (1/2000 y) a foreland covered with dense
   vegetation will dampen the wave height up to 50\%. These results imply
   that at the study site a vegetated foreland in front of the dike leads
   to reduced wave attack on the dike, which may result in changed
   requirements for both height and revetment of the dike while maintaining
   the required safety level. Although there are still many questions
   concerning dimensions, management, and performance, developing a
   vegetated foreland seems an interesting strategy to adapt existing flood
   protection works to the effects of climate change.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Decades after a ban on hunting, and despite focused management
   interventions, the endangered St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) beluga
   (Delphinapterus leucas) population has failed to recover. We applied a
   population viability analysis to simulate the responses of the SLE
   beluga population across a wide range of variability and uncertainty
   under current and projected changes in environmental and
   climate-mediated conditions. Three proximate threats to recovery were
   explored: ocean noise; contaminants; and prey limitation. Even the most
   optimistic scenarios failed to achieve the reliable positive population
   growth needed to meet current recovery targets. Here we show that
   predicted effects of climate change may be a more significant driver of
   SLE beluga population dynamics than the proximate threats we considered.
   Aggressive mitigation of all three proximate threats will be needed to
   build the population's resilience and allow the population to persist
   long enough for global actions to mitigate climate change to take
   effect.},

Title = {Adaptation to climate change in small coastal cities: The influence of
   development status on adaptation response},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {211},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {In contrast to coastal towns and small urban settlements, small coastal
   cities (population of between 50,000 and 100,000) may exhibit comparable
   knowledge and planning infrastructure as larger cities or be similarly
   connected to research institutions. However, at a global level, there is
   little statistical data about small cities, and their numbers and
   locations are thus so far unknown. In this paper, five cases of small
   coastal cities, two of which are located in the USA -Miami Beach and
   Milford -and three, in Australia (Mandurah), Bangladesh (Sundarbans),
   and South Africa (Knysna) respectively, are presented and discussed in
   view of adaptation to climate change. All cases reported vulnerability
   to sea level rise, with impacts compounded by increasing storminess (and
   even hurricanes of increasing intensity), tides, inland flooding and
   loss of natural habitat. Changes in precipitation resulted in both
   reduced river flow, leading to sediment deficits and coastal erosion
   (from the sea) or increased river flow with similar damage (from the
   land). Adaptation response was most clearly delineated along lines of
   development status with wealthier, more highly developed cities pursuing
   more technologically advanced solutions, whilst the two cities of the
   Global South focused more on governance and capacity building solutions.
   Also, it was clear from the Knysna case that if a city or municipality
   lacks the capacity to effectively respond with adaptation measures,
   local private wealth may dominate and result in haphazard adaptation
   responses to the detriment of regional adaptation planning efforts.
   While this paper provides a first step in establishing a richer
   understanding, it is clear that more case studies across global regions
   and economic categories are required to deepen our understanding of
   climate change adaptation planning in small cities.},

Title = {The potential relative resilience of coral reefs in Wakatobi as a

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The main objectives of this study are to determine the potential for
   relative resilience, identify the drivers of potential resilience and
   priority locations for resilience-based coral reef management in
   Wakatobi. Data collection locations are spread across four major
   Wakatobi islands: Wangi Wangi, Kaledupa, Tomia, and Binongko at 5 m
   depth respectively. Coral reefs resilience assessment in Wakatobi
   consists of several stages: selecting indicators, collecting and
   compiling data, analyzing data, and identifying management targets. The
   highest potential for relative resilience in Wakatobi are station 15
   with a value of 1.00 and the lowest is station 8 with a value of 0.69.
   Relative resilience in high category is 2 stations, med-high 7 stations,
   med-low 2 stations, and low 4 stations. Relative resilience in high
   category is able to be distinguished by the high values of bleaching
   resistant, herbivore biomass, coral cover, and supported by a high
   diversity of coral. The mid-high category is grouped by the contribution
   of indicator values coming from coral recruitment and coral diversity,
   as well as followed by two other indicators such as coral cover and alga
   cover. Last, the mid-low category and low category tend to be pushed by
   the low values of coral disease and followed by some other indicators
   like algae cover. Resilience approach to identify prioritizing stations
   for management actions is conservation (2 station), fishery management
   and enforcement (5 station), bleaching monitoring and supporting
   recovery (3 station), coral reef restoration (2 tation), tourism
   structuring (10 station), and Land-based sources of pollution reduction
   (5 station).},

Title = {Beyond protection: Fisheries co-benefits of no-take marine reserves},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {122},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Overfishing and other anthropogenic impacts to ocean ecosystems have
   motivated widespread implementation of no-take marine reserves to
   protect biodiversity and fished resources. Fully protected marine
   reserves now comprise approximately 2.5\% of the ocean and calls for
   enhanced protections abound. The benefits to marine biodiversity within
   reserve borders are clear, yet the contributions beyond borders remain
   the subject of continued scholarship. In this article, six co-benefits
   of marine reserves for fisheries are explored. Broadly, the six
   co-benefits fall within two categories 1) use of reserves as tools to
   adaptively learn, promote resiliency, and manage marine resources,
   especially in the face of a changing climate and 2) use of reserves to
   provide credit against uncertainty in management and sustainability
   criteria. Broader understanding and consideration of the benefits of
   marine reserves can further policy discussions and deepen conversations
   regarding social, ecological, and economic tradeoffs of implementing
   marine reserves.},

   Series of Scenario-Building Dialogues},
Journal = {WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Numerous decision support tools have been developed to assist stormwater
   managers to understand future scenarios and devise management
   strategies. This paper presents one such tool, the Vulnerability,
   Consequences, and Adaptation Planning Scenarios (VCAPS) process, and
   reports on experiences from its deployment in 10 coastal communities on
   the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. VCAPS helps to elucidate local
   complexities, couplings, and contextual nuance through dialogue among
   technical experts and those with detailed contextual knowledge of a
   community. Participants in the process develop qualitative scenarios of
   climate change impacts and how different management strategies may
   prevent or mitigate undesirable consequences. The scenarios help
   stormwater managers diagnose potential problems that may emerge from
   climate change and variability, which can then be subject to further
   detailed analysis. The authors describe five challenges faced by
   stormwater managers and how insights that emerge from scenario-based
   processes like VCAPS can help address them: characterizing the
   implications of interacting climate stressors that originate stormwater,
   bringing all available expertise and local knowledge to bear on the
   problem of stormwater management, integrating local and scientific
   information about coupled human-environment systems, identifying
   management actions and their trade-offs, and facilitating planning for
   sustained coordination among multiple public and private entities.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Wind energy is one of the key renewable resources contributing to
   climate change mitigation policies in national and international energy
   transition strategies. However, climate change itself can affect the
   availability of wind resources, due to possible future changes in
   large-scale circulation pattern. This study aims to understand whether
   how and to what extent current and future climate change is affecting
   wind producibility in Italy. In this analysis, the 10 m wind speed from
   Euro-CORDEX regional climate models was bias-corrected using MERIDA
   meteorological reanalysis and the wind producibility is calculated,
   using a reference turbine chosen among the most commonly installed in
   Italian wind farms. The changes in the availability of wind resources
   from the reference period 1986-2005 for the short (2021-2050), medium
   (2051-2080), and long term (2071-2100) are analyzed, considering both
   the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The results show a prevalently weak
   and not statistically significant climate signal for the RCP 4.5
   scenario, while a more pronounced and significant signal is highlighted
   for the RCP 8.5 scenario in the medium and long term, indicating a
   decrease in wind producibility. Specifically, the conclusions suggest
   that future planning of wind producibility should mainly focus in some
   specific areas of the eastern Italian coast and in the south-east
   Italian regions, mostly in the off-shore areas. In these regions,
   indeed, the RCP 8.5 scenario shows the lowest decrease in the overall
   annual producibility, while, for the RCP 4.5 scenario, the medium and
   the long term foresee a slight increase in wind producibility at the
   annual level, while, in the short term, an increasing trend is observed
   mostly in the spring season.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change - implications for transport infrastructure,

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {This paper reviews land based transport related issues from
   considerations of climate change adaptation in Australia. The two main
   issues for climate change adaptation are sea level rise and the
   increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These
   issues are considered in the paper. It considers the risks to existing
   transport infrastructure and the resulting considerations necessary in
   planning new infrastructure, transport systems operations under changing
   climatic conditions, and potential changes in travel behaviour. The use
   and capability of regional rural networks in emergency evacuation
   planning emerges as one particular area for further research. More
   generally, recognition of the risks associated with climate change is
   required for better planning of new infrastructure and mitigating
   potential damage to existing infrastructure. Climate change poses a
   significant risk to infrastructure and its owners, managers and
   operators. There is a need to undertake research into the likely impacts
   of climate change on Australia's transport infrastructure, establish the
   categories of infrastructure most at risk and outline opportunities for
   adaptation responses, and examine the current governance structures.
   Then the administrative, legal and other issues that may impact on
   climate change adaptation can be identified.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests of the tropical and subtropical regions provide
   critical ecosystem services, fulfill important socio-economic and
   environmental functions, and support coastal livelihoods. These forests
   are also among the most vulnerable ecosystems, both to anthropogenic
   disturbance and climate change. Yet, no map or published study exists
   showing detailed spatiotemporal trends of mangrove deforestation at
   local to regional scales. This study uses change point and mixed-pixel
   analyses with a time series (2000-2010) of high-fidelity imagery from
   NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for
   tracking deforestation of mangroves in the Mahakam Delta of Indonesia at
   250 m spatial scale and a 3-monthly temporal interval. The results show
   that a total of 21,000 +/- 152 ha of mangrove land in the Mahakam Delta
   were deforested and converted to shrimp ponds in 11 years. In 2000, the
   deforested lands covered 47\% of the entire delta, while in 2010 it
   increased to 75\%. Deforestation rates varied in each year, but peaked
   in 2002 and declined since then. The combination of high-fidelity time
   series data and a robust method of change detection resulted in a
   virtual reconstruction of 11 years of drastic land change history of the
   delta's mangrove areas at a consistent spatiotemporal scale. We
   anticipate that the methodology developed in this study will be useful
   to reconstruct deforestation histories of other places as well. Also,
   our findings can potentially be used to further explore the
   socioeconomic drivers of mangrove deforestation so that reliable,
   appropriate and sustainable methods of local and regional scale
   adaptation/mitigation strategies can be developed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Apply MIKE 11 model to study impacts of climate change on water

   case of Can Tho city},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Can Tho city in the Mekong Delta is in the top ten areas affected by
   climate change. Therefore, assessing climate change impacts, social and
   economic activities require proposed solutions to respond to climate
   change. This study aims to (i) apply the MIKE 11 model (Hydrodynamic
   module and Advection-Dispersion module) to simulate the impacts of
   climate change scenarios on water resources in Can Tho city; (ii)
   calculate water balance in Can Tho city; and (iii) suggest climate
   change adaptation plan for sustainable social-economic activities of the
   city. The results show that when the rainfall changes due to climate
   change, the flow rate tends to decrease at high tide and increase at low
   tide. When the sea level rises due to climate change, the flow rate
   tends to increase at high tide and decrease at low tide. For 2030, the
   flow will decrease up to 15.6\% and 14.3\% at the low tide period for
   RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 compared to the present, respectively. The flow will
   increase up to 63.5\% and 58.9\% at the high tide period for RCP 2.6 and
   RCP 8.5 compared to the present, respectively. The water demand
   evaluation shows that the water resource reserve in Can Tho city meets
   water demands in current and future scenarios under climate change.
   While rainwater and groundwater can provide enough water in the rainy
   season, the city has to use surface water during the dry season due to a
   lack of rainwater. Of these, agriculture contributes the most water
   demands (85\%). Eight adaptation measures to climate change for Can Tho
   city are developed from 2021 to 2050.},

Title = {Local-indigenous knowledge on disaster risk reduction: Insights from the
   Mamanwa indigenous peoples in Basey, Samar after Typhoon Haiyan in the
   Philippines},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There's a growing recognition by scholars that local-indigenous
   knowledge can make important contributions to both disaster risk
   reduction and managing environmental change. This paper interrogated the
   local-indigenous knowledge and practices of the Mamanwa indigenous
   peoples in Basey, Samar, after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in
   November 2013. Data for this study were drawn from ethnographic
   fieldwork from late 2018 to early 2020. This paper is broken up into
   three parts. The first part presents how Mamanwas utilize their
   local-indigenous knowledge in times of disaster in relation to 1)
   emergency evacuation and post-Haiyan relocation; 2) food and livelihood
   security strategies; 3) weather forecasts from animals, and 4) celestial
   bodies, and 5) the role of community elders as local hazard forecasters.
   Next, the study analyzes the lack of regard to integrate
   local-indigenous knowledge into disaster risk reduction (DRR) state
   policies such as the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act and the
   Indigenous Peoples Rights Act as well as the low regard on
   local-indigenous knowledge of non-indigenous people manifested in social
   prejudice and discrimination. Despite these, local DRR practitioners
   find innovative ways to integrate local-indigenous knowledge in local
   programs and activities. Following Haiyan, the elderly Mamanwas also
   dedicated special activities to ensure the transmission and
   pres-ervation of their local-indigenous knowledge in the younger members
   of their community. The authors argue that in addition to the inclusion
   and better articulation of local-indigenous knowledge in relevant State
   policies, the meaningful participation of local communities including
   Indigenous Peoples should be the focus of local DRR actors.},

Title = {Fine-resolution assessment of potential refugia for a dominant fir

   change},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Volume = {213},

Abstract = {The questions ``Will the environment surrounding moorlands become
   refugia for a Japanese subalpine coniferous species, Abies mariesii
   Mast., after climate change?{''} and ``How does the spatial resolution
   of a species distribution model affect the global warming
   predictions?{''} have been discussed in this study. This study was
   conducted at Hakkoda Mountains, the northern side of Honshu Island,
   Japan. We constructed 50-m mesh model using a climate variable, two
   topography variables and two variables relating to moorlands. We applied
   the model to eight global warming scenarios, including decreasing or
   non-decreasing scenarios of moorlands. We also constructed a
   coarse-resolution model at approximately 1-km resolution and compared
   the model predictions with the fine ones. The results showed that the
   coarse-resolution model tended to overestimate the range of suitable
   habitats for A. mariesii. On the other hand, some suitable habitats
   around moorlands could only be predicted by the fine-resolution model.
   The fine-resolution model indicated that the peripheries of the
   moorlands are the most important potential refugia for A. mariesii on
   Hakkoda Mountains. Although these suitable areas were notable in the +2A
   degrees C scenario, all suitable habitats completely disappeared in the
   +4A degrees C scenario. We concluded that it would be effective to
   conserve the A. mariesii populations around moorlands which are likely
   to persist after global warming, as well as moorlands themselves. This
   assessment could only be achieved by fine-resolution models that
   incorporate non-climatic variables including topography and
   moorland-related variables with climatic variables. In contrast, a
   coarse-resolution model overestimated the suitable habitats whilst
   underestimating potential local refugia. Thus, fine-resolution models
   are more effective for developing practical adaptation of conservation
   measures.},

Abstract = {Resilience-based management focuses on specific attributes or drivers of
   complex social-ecological systems, in order to operationalize and
   promote guiding principles for water quality management in urban
   systems. We therefore propose a resilience lens drawing on the theory of
   adaptive capacity and adaptive cycle to evaluate the urban resilience
   between water quality and land use type. Our findings show that the
   resilience of water quality variables, which were calculated based on
   their adaptive capacities, showed adaptive and sustainable trends with
   dramatic fluctuation. NH3-N, Cadmium and Total Phosphorus experienced
   the most vulnerable shifts in the built-up area, agricultural areas, and
   on bare land. Our framework provided a consistent and repeatable
   approach to address uncertainty inherent in the resilience of water
   quality in different landscapes, as well as an approach to monitor
   variables over time with respect to national water quality standards.
   Ultimately, we pointed to the political underpinnings for risk
   mitigation and managing resilient urban systemin a particular coastal
   urban setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {113-123},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal areas in South East Queensland (SEQ) are exposed to coastal
   hazards and climate change and Local Governments are responding to these
   threats by developing a range of strategies for adaptation. Here we show
   the results of a spatial vulnerability assessment for SEQ's coastal
   region and use them as the basis to assess progress in adaptation in
   five coastal Local Government areas. An integrated framework based on
   external (exposure) and internal (sensitivity and adaptive capacity)
   dimensions is used to produce one single index to provide a measure of
   SEQ's vulnerability to coastal hazards. Coastal Local Governments'
   progress in adaptation is evaluated based on a semi-quantitative
   assessment of pre-determined Adaptation Functions adapted to the SEQ
   context. The assessment reveals information specifically relevant for
   adaptation investment at the local government level. It is concluded
   that the five coastal Local Governments analysed have considerable
   capacity to deal with coastal hazards. However, there are numerous
   coastal suburbs that are highly vulnerable and this is mainly, due to
   the fact that the majority of the SEQ coastal region is intrinsically
   highly exposed and sensitive to climatic drivers. We argue that this
   vulnerability can be reduced if Local Governments continue to further
   their progress in adaptation through coastal planning and management
   frameworks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The concept of integrated coastal zone management must be rethought to
   adapt it to the geography and social conditions of small islands.
   Because of their size, all small islands are in the coastal zone.
   Defining the whole of the island and its coastal wafers as the
   management area may weaken a program's effectiveness. An alternative may
   he to adapt special area management planning to the socio-spatial
   organization found on small islands. Social conditions on islands, where
   people live in relatively small cohesive communities, makes resource
   user participation in planning and management particularly germane. This
   paper outlines an argument for small islands to use participation as a
   central strategy of coastal management based on experience with natural
   resource management efforts on the island of Pohnpei in the Federated

Title = {Effects of greenery enhancements for the resilience to heat waves: A
   comparison of analysis performed through mesoscale (WRF) and microscale
   (Envi-met) modeling},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {747},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Given the large transformation and fast-growing population that the
   Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is facing, and the increasing impact of
   climate change in urbanized areas, it is crucial to investigate
   strategies that could mitigate the effects of heat waves. In this paper,
   the effects of greenery enhancements are investigated using mesoscale
   and microscale simulations performed by theWeather Research and
   Forecasting model and the ENVI-met model, respectively. In particular,
   two vulnerable areas located in theGTA are investigated. Comparing the
   results of simulations with measurements show the differences in how
   mesoscale and microscale models predict the meteorological processes
   happening within the urban canopy and the local climate. Then, two
   mitigation scenarios, a moderate green scenario (MGS) and an intensive
   green scenario (IGS) are assessed considering different increases in the
   vegetation area. The results of the mesoscale simulations show that by
   increasing the greenery canopy, the maximum daily air temperature
   decreases by 1.6 to 2.3 degrees C, while the relative humidity increases
   by 10\% to 12\%. The microscale simulations show that increasing the
   tree canopy would cool the air temperature by 0.5 degrees C to 1.4
   degrees C locally. Overall, depending on wind conditions and the
   arrangement of buildings and existing green areas, the cooling effect is
   shown to have an impact on up to 250 m downwind from the new green area
   locations. Finally, this study demonstrates that bothmesoscale (WRF) and
   microscale (ENVI-met) modeling confirm similar results in how greenery
   enhancementsmay improve the human thermal comfort in the continental
   climate of the GTA. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the biophysical, socio-economic, environmental and
   human health dimensions of urban and peri-urban agriculture in Dakar
   city (Senegal) and identifies structural threats to urban agriculture,
   including those already induced, or have the potential to be induced, by
   climate change. Urban agriculture, which provides an important source of
   fresh vegetables and other fresh products for the city is being
   increasingly marginalised due to a combination of factors including
   diminished soil and water quality, increasing temperatures and reduced
   rainfall, urban encroachment and pollution from industrial sources. A
   lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities between local and
   national governments hinders the ability to protect urban agricultural
   land from urban encroachment and a lack of access to credit by farmers
   adds to their ability to cope with the multitude of other pressures.
   Dakar is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the northern, western and
   southern sides with no room for expansion, including any potential
   expansion of urban agriculture. Ground water in this urban zone is
   steadily deteriorating due to nitrate pollution of shallow groundwater
   in soil aquifers combined with increasing saltwater intrusion. Recycling
   of untreated wastewater for use in urban agriculture, a common practice
   in Dakar and other cities in Africa has increased the incidence of
   food-borne contamination. For example, recent microbial sampling of
   water showed a very high proportion of sites (87 \%) with contamination
   levels above World Health Organisation standards for irrigation without
   restriction. Solid and liquid waste management is one of the biggest
   problems Dakar is facing as are many other cities of developing
   countries. Climate change will further impact urban agriculture.
   Shortening of cold periods favorable to vegetable cropping in semi-arid
   areas, increasingly hotter summers, more frequent flooding and drought
   periods, and higher incidence of pest and diseases are among the
   potential impacts of climate change. Coastal zones of the city are
   particularly under threat due to the rising sea level with negative
   consequences of coastal erosion and salt-water intrusion in lowlands.
   Projection models show a strong warming trend in the region. Conversely,
   there is no agreed trend of rainfall prediction at present but deficits
   are anticipated by general circulation models. Adaptation strategies of
   farmers include lifting the ground surface with landfill in order to
   better cope with flooding (specifically for flower cultivation),
   development of soil and soilless micro gardens in boxes, crop
   diversification and use of hybrid seeds. Urban agriculture has the
   potential to contribute to climate change adaptation through
   reinforcement of urban agricultural systems resilience, water recycling,
   buffering thermal and hydraulic shocks, providing safe and nutritious
   food, recycling wastes and conserving biodiversity. Despite its huge
   potential to reduce poverty and make the city more resilient to impacts
   from climate change, urban agriculture is not high on the urban planning
   agenda. Recommendations are formulated towards taking into consideration
   urban agriculture in national and local planning, strengthening
   capacities of stakeholders and awareness at all levels of society on the
   economic, social and environmental role of urban agriculture can play in
   sustainable development and greening of the city and its economy.},

   HUMANS IN LOWLAND AND UPLAND AREAS},
Series = {Springer Climate},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {37-60},
Abstract = {The field research in this book is about human and natural replies to
   main climate change-associated effects as storms, floods, and landslides
   in two areas: the Ky Anh coastal district in the North Central Vietnam
   and the Van Chan mountainous district in the Northern Vietnam. While in
   the open literature ample attention is given to these climate
   change-associated effects in deltas and in the lowlands near the sea,
   less information is available about how people in the mountains
   experience and adapt to the changing mountainous climate.
   Climate variation exists in a long country as Vietnam bordered by an
   over 3000-km-long coast. Therefore this chapter overviews the changing
   climate in the wider geographical context of both study areas: the 6
   coastal provinces of North Central Vietnam and the 15 provinces of the
   Northern mountainous region. The first part of this regional approach
   describes core climate aspects as temperature and wet precipitation
   along the coast of Central Vietnam. This is followed by the
   phenomenology of storms, flash floods, droughts, and landslides. This
   section is concluded with an analysis of the vulnerability of the six
   main sectors in this area: agri-and aquaculture, forestry, industry,
   tourism, and the dense population living here. The second part of this
   chapter aims at a similar approach adapted to the mountains in the
   northern part of the country. Temperature changes and drought are
   analyzed, next to floods, flash floods, landslides, and periods of
   drought and (low) temperature extremes.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes Seoul, South Korea a city developed around three
   centers in the past half a century with an eye on its urban heat island
   (UHI). It specifically looks into how the city's eight city-wide master
   plans established between 1966 and 2014 have shaped the city so as to
   transform the spatial distribution of its UHI. Master planning of Seoul
   has been regulating growth of its traditional center, the central
   business district, while promoting growth of its two newer centers,
   Yeongdeungpo and Gangnam business districts. Plan effects include more
   new buildings, cars, roads, population, and employment in the two new
   centers. As a result, Seoul's UHI spatially transformed over time as its
   traditional center became cooler while the newer two warmed up. This
   study makes a case for the role of master plans in shaping a city's
   thermal environment in the age of climate change.},

Title = {Two decades of variable retention in British Columbia: a review of its
   implementation and effectiveness for biodiversity conservation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Stand-level retention is an important component of sustainable forest
   management which aims to balance ecological, social and economic
   objectives. Long-term retention of mature forest structures at the time
   of harvesting (variable retention) is intended to produce future forest
   stands that more closely resemble conditions that develop after natural
   disturbances, thereby maintaining greater diversity of habitats for a
   variety of organisms. Structure includes features such as live and dead
   trees representing multiple canopy layers, undisturbed understory
   vegetation and coarse woody debris. Over the past two decades, variable
   retention has become common on forest lands in the temperate rainforests
   of coastal British Columbia (BC) and has been applied to a lesser extent
   in inland forest types. Our review of studies in BC and in similar
   forest types in our region indicates that both aggregated and dispersed
   retention can contribute to biodiversity conservation by providing
   short-term life-boating' habitat for some species and by enhancing the
   structural characteristics of future stands. For example, greater
   abundance of species present in the pre-harvest forest have been
   documented for vegetation, birds, carabid beetles, gastropods,
   ectomycorrhizal fungi and soil fauna in retention cutblocks compared to
   clearcuts. There are, however, some negative consequences for timber
   production such as wind damage to retained trees and reduced growth
   rates of tree regeneration compared to clearcuts. The authors suggest an
   adaptive management approach for balancing competing objectives when
   faced with uncertainty. This includes monitoring the implementation and
   effectiveness of various strategies for achieving goals. Over two
   decades of experience applying variable retention harvesting to
   industrial-scale management of forest lands in BC suggests that it is
   possible to balance production of wood with biodiversity conservation.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {As of 2010, more than half of the global population resides in urban
   areas and relies to some extent on the functions, services and natural
   capital provided by urban soils. Greater extremes in climate predicted
   for the coming decades will impact on these urban soil functions to
   varying degrees. We provide an inventory of urban soil functions based
   on an extension to the typology of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
   (i.e. we added a carrying function' to those of supporting, regulating,
   provisioning and cultural functions) and review the climate drivers that
   are likely to have the most significant impacts upon them, using urban
   soils of England as an exemplar. We identify knowledge gaps, as in areas
   such as carbon cycling and storage, disease regulation and cultural
   services. We assess adaptation measures, which may ameliorate these
   potential, climate-change-related impacts including changes in
   construction practices, developments in green architecture and
   development proposals under the planning regime. We discuss the lack of
   policies relating to urban soils and the problem associated with
   monitoring their functions, as is often the case, when large quantities
   of soil are removed and replaced, leading to major transformation of
   soil properties, which may be unrelated to pedogenic processes.},

Title = {Assessing the bio-psychosocial correlates of flood impacts in coastal

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {445-463},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {This paper explores the complex heterogeneous experiences of flood
   impacts based on a bio-psychosocial model of socio-economic,
   demographic, behavioural and environmental factors. Using ordinary least
   squares regression on a cross-sectional survey of 1003 individuals,
   flood impacts in three contiguous coastal neighbourhoods in Lagos,
   Nigeria, were modelled. The results show that approximately 52\% of the
   variability in flood impact was accounted for by education, age, family
   structure, ethnicity, personal health concern and income. While
   involvement in coping was not a significant predictor of flood impacts,
   relocation emerged as a strong predictor. The inclusion of behavioural
   factors did not change the magnitude and significance of the
   relationship between demographic factors and flood impacts. However, the
   effects of age, education and personal health concern disappeared when
   environmental factors were controlled. The overall importance of the
   predictors for determining flood impact in decreasing order is as
   follows: income > coping strategies > ethnicity = participation in
   community development > family structure > personal health concerns >
   housing quality > reasons for living in residential locality >
   neighbourhood vulnerability to flood > housing vulnerability to flood.},

Abstract = {Operational approaches have been more and more widely developed and used
   for providing marine data and information services for different
   socio-economic sectors of the Blue Growth and to advance knowledge about

   years. Knowledge gaps and deficiencies are identified in relation to
   common scientific challenges in four EuroGOOS knowledge areas: European
   Ocean Observations, Modelling and Forecasting Technology, Coastal
   Operational Oceanography and Operational Ecology. The areas ``European
   Ocean Observations{''} and ``Modelling and Forecasting Technology{''}
   focus on the further advancement of the basic instruments and capacities
   for European operational oceanography, while ``Coastal Operational

Title = {Probabilistic extreme SST and marine heatwave forecasts in Chesapeake
   Bay: A forecast model, skill assessment, and potential value},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {We test whether skillful 35-day probabilistic forecasts of estuarine sea
   surface temperature (SST) are possible and whether these forecasts could
   potentially be used to reduce the economic damages associated with
   extreme SST events. Using an ensemble of 35-day retrospective forecasts
   of atmospheric temperature and a simple model that predicts daily mean
   SST from past SST and forecast atmospheric temperature, we create an
   equivalent ensemble of retrospective SST forecasts. We compare these SST
   forecasts with reference forecasts of climatology and damped persistence
   and find that the SST forecasts are skillful for up to two weeks in the
   summer. Then, we post-process the forecasts using nonhomogeneous
   Gaussian regression and assess whether the resulting calibrated
   probabilistic forecasts are more accurate than the probability implied
   by the raw model ensemble. Finally, we use an idealized framework to
   assess whether these probabilistic forecasts can valuably inform
   decisions to take protective action to mitigate the effects of extreme
   temperatures and heatwaves. We find that the probabilistic forecasts
   provide value relative to a naive climatological forecast for 1-2 weeks
   of lead time, and the value is particularly high in cases where the cost
   of protection is small relative to the preventable losses suffered when
   a heatwave occurs. In most cases, the calibrated probabilistic forecasts
   are also more valuable than deterministic forecasts based on the
   ensemble mean and naive probabilistic forecasts based on damped
   persistence. Probabilistic SST forecasts could provide substantial value
   if applied to adaptively manage the rapid impacts of extreme SSTs,
   including managing the risks of catch-and-release mortality in fish and
   Vibrio bacteria in oysters.},

Title = {Local farmer's perception and adaptive behavior toward climate change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {287},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Agriculture is greatly influenced by climate change, especially in
   developing countries. Farmers are both the basic executors of
   agricultural adaptation and among the most vulnerable groups to climate
   change. However, the understanding on climate change perception and
   adaptive behavior of local farmers is still very limited. This study
   develops a binary logistic regression (BLR) model to explore the
   underlying principles of local farmer's perception and adaptive behavior
   toward climate change, with a focus on influential farmers. Through a
   field survey with 117 head farmers from 89 farmers' cooperatives in
   Chongming Island of China the largest alluvial island in the world, we
   found that: 1) 92\% of the respondents thought climate change is
   happening; 59\% of the respondents thought climate change has an obvious
   impact on agriculture production; and 45\% of the respondents had a plan
   for future adaptation. 2) Based on BLR analysis, it was found that 3 out
   of 16 factors have significant impacts on head farmer's adaptive
   behavior toward climate change, including agricultural training,
   perceived temperature change, and education level. 3) The percentage of
   consistency (POC) is proposed to describe the performance of our BLR
   model. The overall POC of BLR model is 68.4\%, with a higher POC
   (85.7\%) for farmers who have no adaptive behavior. 4) Key measures to
   enhance local climate adaptation include an integrated and coordinated
   plan of farmer-level adaptation, tailored and specialized training
   programs, improvement of scientific research, and publicity of best
   practices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adaptive dynamic control allocation for dynamic positioning of marine
   vessel based on backstepping method and sequential quadratic programming},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {163},
Pages = {570-582},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {It is generally assumed in dynamic positioning of over-actuated marine
   vessels that the control effectiveness matrix (input matrix) is known
   and constant, or, in case of fault information, it is estimated by the
   fault detection and diagnosis system. The purpose of the study is to
   develop the adaptive dynamic positioning control system for an
   over-actuated marine vessel in the presence of uncertainties and with
   emphasis on limited information about thruster forces. The proposed
   approach bases on the MIMO adaptive backstepping method to design the
   high-level control law and then to give inputs to the control allocation
   unit. An adaptive solution allows to accommodate the unknown
   time-varying control effectiveness matrix and to update the thrust
   distribution due to actuator losses and failures. The effectiveness and
   correctness of the proposed control schema is demonstrated by
   simulations involving a redundant set of actuators when some of them
   have lost partially their efficiency or failed. The evaluation criteria
   include energy consumption, robustness and accuracy of dynamic
   positioning during typical vessel operations. Based on simulation tests
   results, the generated control inputs stabilize the ship position and
   orientation violated by thruster faults.},

Title = {Beach characteristics mitigate effects of onshore wind on horseshoe crab
   spawning: implications for matching with shorebird migration in Delaware
   Bay},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {575-584},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Disruption of food availability by unfavorable physical processes at
   energetically demanding times can limit recruitment of migratory species
   as predicted by the match-mismatch hypothesis. Identification and
   protection of disruption-resistant habitat could contribute to system
   resilience. For example, horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus spawning and
   shorebird stopover must match temporally in Delaware Bay for eggs to be
   available to shorebirds. Onshore winds that generate waves can create a
   mismatch by delaying horseshoe crab spawning. We examined effects of
   beach characteristics and onshore winds on spawning activity at five
   beaches when water temperatures were otherwise consistent with early
   spawning activity. Onshore winds resulted in reduced spawning activity
   during the shorebird stopover, when spawning typically peaks in late
   May. During the period with high onshore wind, egg density was highest
   on the foreshore exposed to the lowest wave heights. Onshore wind was
   low in early June, and spawning and egg densities were high at all
   sites, but shorebirds had departed. Beaches that can serve as a refuge
   from wind and waves can be identified by physical characteristics and
   orientation to prevailing winds and should receive special conservation
   status, especially in light of predicted increases in climate
   change-induced storm frequency. These results point to a potential
   conservation strategy that includes coastal management for adapting to
   climate change-induced mismatch of migrations.},

Abstract = {Reef corals are especially sensitive to environmental change since their
   survival is dependent on a delicate balance between the coral host and
   its algal endosymbiont. Predicting the responses of reef ecosystems to
   global climate change requires a detailed understanding of the diversity
   of both partners in this symbiosis. The current perception of
   coral-inhabiting symbiont diversity at nuclear ribosomal DNA is shown in
   this issue of Molecular Ecology to be a significant underestimate of the
   wide diversity that in fact exists. Apprill \& Gates (2007) reveal
   eight- to tenfold greater diversity than previous methods had
   identified. The authors underline the importance of detailed knowledge
   of such diversity if we are to predict, or possibly manage, the
   acclimatization and adaptation of reef corals to climatic change.},

Abstract = {The state of Hawaii and city of Honolulu experienced an unprecedented
   number of minor flooding episodes during 2017 due to the combination of
   seasonal high tides and record-high mean sea levels. To quantify the
   impact of sea level rise on the tendency for flooding events to cluster
   in future years, we developed a hierarchical statistical model
   describing the number of days per year for which sea level exceeds a
   prescribed threshold in Honolulu as a function of annual mean sea level
   and the amplitude of the highest tides. Based on this model, we generate
   probabilistic projections of exceedance days per year for the 21st
   century, which show pronounced inflections in the frequency of
   exceedance days due to the interaction between sea level rise and
   long-period (18.6year) modulation of tidal amplitude. Analysis of the
   projections demonstrates how planning for the typical future year can
   substantially underestimate flooding impacts during inevitable severe
   years that experience many more exceedance days than expected in a
   probabilistic sense. The projections also show the potential for rapid,
   subdecadal transitions from occasional to chronic threshold exceedance
   during the second half of the century, suggesting that implementation of
   adaptation and mitigation strategies may need to begin prior to the
   emergence of occasional minor impacts in affected areas.},

Title = {Exploring climate change uncertainties to support adaptive management of

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {133-142},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Increasing intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events
   projected as a consequence of global warming pose significant challenges
   for decision-making. Climate change creates a dynamic risk, but flood
   risk management decision-making based on single `best estimate'
   scenarios is entrenched within decision-making frameworks and
   professional operating practices. This conceals uncertainties and
   focuses attention on enhancements to existing `protection' structures,
   giving a false sense of security to those living within presumed `safe'
   areas. A more nuanced, risk-based approach to flood frequency changes is
   needed to reflect climate change uncertainties, but this is constrained
   by the high cost and complexity of modelling. We present a quick and
   relatively low-cost methodology to explore the implications of
   alternative climate change scenarios for flood frequency, and apply it
   for illustrative purposes, to the Hutt River located in New Zealand's
   lower North Island. Annual exceedance probabilities increase under all
   scenarios but with considerable differences between alternative
   emissions scenarios and climate models. We evaluated the salience of
   this information for planning responses with flood management and
   planning practitioners. We found that `mind-sets' changed to consider a
   greater range of response options according to their lock-in potential
   in existing and Greenfield urban settlements. Tools to rapidly explore
   alternative futures can therefore support evaluation of a wider range of
   response options at the exploratory stages of decision-making, which
   helps avoid planning responses that are predicated on historical
   experience and a single `best estimate' scenario. This encourages
   responses that better reflect the changing nature of the risk. (C) 2013

Title = {Carbon sequestration scenarios in Portugal: which way to go forward?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Assessing carbon storage and sequestration is key for defining effective
   conservation actions to mitigate climate change. Forest species changes
   have direct impacts on carbon stocks and may lead to undesirable climate
   trade-offs. In this paper, we measure aboveground biomass (AGB) and the
   impact of forest changes on climate regulation through three land policy
   scenarios by 2030 in continental Portugal. We found that a High
   intervention scenario, supported by an important increase in ``Other
   coniferous trees{''} class, will provide 29.5\% more of carbon
   sequestration, whereas a Low intervention scenario, in which there is a
   moderate increase in all forest classes, will result in an increase of
   5.7\%. A business as usual (BAU) scenario, supported by an increase in
   eucalyptus forests and a decrease in autochthonous species, will
   decrease carbon sequestration (-2.7\%), particularly Lisboa, Algarve and
   North regions. Economic valuation shows that the High intervention
   scenario will generate the highest economic outcome for climate
   regulation by 2030. This study provides a spatial-based methodology for
   monitoring carbon sequestration and new insights about the impact of
   policies for Green House Gas (GHG) mitigation, supporting the 2030
   Sustainable Development Goals achievement.},

   high-density residential areas},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {186},
Pages = {368-383},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic heat is constantly emitted to the urban environment in
   which could trigger a vicious cycle: risen the air temperature,
   subsequently increase the cooling-energy consumption and further
   intensify the urban heat island effect. While extensive studies had been
   conducted to estimate the magnitude of anthropogenic heat emission in
   urban areas, research that investigates the behaviour of anthropogenic
   heat dispersion in the outdoor environment is limited. This research
   aims to understand the interaction between the airflow and the flux of
   heat rejected from the high-rise residential buildings, and effects of
   heat flux on the air temperature in the street canyon. Parametric study
   is performed by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation
   method, and the results indicate that, emission position and building
   porosity play an important role in anthropogenic heat removal from the
   street canyon. Single strategy, such as building height variance, can
   help to reduce the street canyon temperature to some extents, but the
   impact can be more significant when it is coupled with other strategies.
   At the end, a case study is conducted to evaluate the practicability of
   the suggested mitigation strategies in real urban design practice. This
   study bridges the knowledge gap between the complex aerodynamic physics
   and the real urban planning and design practices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Natural resource management in mitigating climate impacts: the example

Abstract = {The risk that tropical storm occurrence may alter as a result of global
   warming presents coastal managers, particularly in vulnerable areas,
   with a serious challenge. Many countries are hard-pressed to protect
   their coastal resources against present-day hazards, let alone any
   increased threat in the future. Moreover, the threat posed by climate
   change is uncertain making the increased costs of protection difficult
   to justify. Here, we examine one management strategy, based on the
   rehabilitation of the mangrove ecosystem, which may provide a dual,
   ``win-win{''} benefit in improving the livelihood of local resource
   users as well as enhancing sea defences. The
   strategy,therefore,represent a precautionary approach to climate impact
   mitigation. This paper quantifies the economic benefits of mangrove
   rehabilitation undertaken, inter alia, to enhance sea defence systems in
   three coastal Districts of northern Vietnam. The results of the analysis
   show that mangrove rehabilitation can be desirable from an economic
   perspective based solely on the direct use benefits by local
   communities. Such activities have even higher benefit cost ratios with
   the inclusion of the indirect benefits resulting from the avoided
   maintenance cost for the sea dike system which the mangrove stands
   protect from coastal storm surges. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {Multidecadal trends in the nesting phenology of Pacific and Atlantic
   leatherback turtles are associated with population demography},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {197+},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanisms influencing phenology can provide insights
   into the adaptability of species to climate change. Here, we
   investigated the factors influencing multidecadal trends in the nesting
   phenology of the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea at Playa
   Grande, Costa Rica, in the eastern Pacific Ocean and at Sandy Point, US
   Virgin Islands, in the western Atlantic Ocean. Between 1993 and 2013,
   the median nesting date (MND) at Playa Grande occurred later, at a rate
   of similar to 0.3 d yr(-1). In contrast, between 1982 and 2010, the MND
   at Sandy Point occurred earlier, at a rate of similar to 0.17 d yr(-1).
   The opposing trends in the MND of each population were not explained by
   variation in the multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation index, North
   Atlantic Oscillation index, or Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index;
   however, the MND at Playa Grande was significantly correlated with
   nesting population size. We propose that changes in demography, linked
   to the population decline at Playa Grande, and the population recovery
   at Sandy Point may explain the contrasting trends in MNDs. If the
   observed trends in MND continue into the future, the nesting season at
   Playa Grande will coincide with increasingly adverse conditions for
   hatching success, exacerbating the already detrimental effects of
   climate change. Alternatively, shifts in the nesting phenology may make
   the Atlantic populations more resilient to climate change. Our findings
   highlight the increasing need for conservation efforts for eastern
   Pacific leatherback turtles to consider climate change mitigation
   practices.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There is a growing interest in understanding how the built environment
   affects temperature in cities. This study explores the impact of land
   use on temperature and how it varies by season and time of day in Seoul,
   South Korea. Unlike other studies that rely on extracted data from
   remotely sensed information, this study uses land use data from local
   GIS and near-ground temperature data from a network of state-run weather
   stations. To deal with multicollinearity among the land use variables,
   partial least squares regression models were used for analysis. Results
   suggest that residential and commercial uses and roads increase the
   temperature while open spaces decrease it. In detail, central commercial
   use, high-density residential use, and roads were influential heaters,
   while greenery was an influential cooler throughout the year. This study
   suggests the need for place-based planning and design solutions that
   help build climate resilience of cities.},

Abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity measures the long-term response of
   surface temperature to changes in atmospheric CO2. The range of climate
   sensitivities in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth
   Assessment Report is unchanged from that published almost 30years
   earlier in the Charney Report. We conduct perfect model experiments
   using an energy balance model to study the rate at which uncertainties
   might be reduced by observation of global temperature and ocean heat
   uptake. We find that a climate sensitivity of 1.5 degrees C can be
   statistically distinguished from 3 degrees C by 2030, 3 degrees C from
   4.5 degrees C by 2040, and 4.5 degrees C from 6 degrees C by 2065.
   Learning rates are slowest in the scenarios of greatest concern (high
   sensitivities), due to a longer ocean response time, which may have
   bearing on wait-and-see versus precautionary mitigation policies.
   Learning rates are optimistic in presuming the availability of whole
   ocean heat data but pessimistic by using simple aggregated metrics and
   model physics.},

Abstract = {Alteration of climatic conditions and the urban heat island effect (UHI)
   are consequences of increased human population and activities in urban
   zones. Determining the magnitude of the UHI is important to improve
   urban planning in medium-size cities like Queretaro. Increase and
   conservation of vegetated areas is a mitigation option for UHI. Here we
   characterized both the UHI and the role of vegetation cover over
   temperature regularization in urban zones. Four local climatic zones
   were defined: three urban and one rural, each with two plots with low
   and high canopy cover defined by their average leaf area index (0.5 and
   2.0, respectively). Air temperature and relative humidity were measured
   with data loggers at a 30 min time step from June 2012 to May 2013.
   Climatic data from six weather stations was also analyzed. Daily mean
   temperature increased at a rate of 0.75 degrees C per decade (r(2) =
   0.38, P < 0.0001), and this was related to population dynamics (r(2) =
   0.52, P < 0.0001). Patterns of air temperature defined a cold and a warm
   season: July to March and April to June for maximum temperature, and
   November to March and April to October for minimum temperature. The
   difference between cold and warm seasons was 5 degrees C (P < 0.0001).
   The minimum temperature was similar between canopy cover levels.
   However, relative humidity was higher in high canopy cover plots. The
   relationship between UHI and the pervious surface fraction of the city
   was inversely proportional. The UHI ranged from 0.1 to 5 degrees C and
   this magnitude was similar between the warm and cold seasons. Vegetation
   with high canopy cover had lower temperature at 17:00 LT and higher at
   9:00 to 10:00 LT during the warm season. Increasing the urban zone
   canopy cover by 50\% would reduce the UHI by 2.05 degrees C. In
   conclusion, vegetation with higher canopy cover improved environmental
   conditions in terms of relative humidity and regularization of extreme
   temperatures during the warm season.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the vulnerability of sea dikes in Western Canada,
   including examples of existing dike designs in British Columbia (BC). A
   dike means an embankment, revetment wall, or other coastal structures
   that protect upland areas and prevent the flooding of the land. There
   are more than 200 regulated dikes in BC, with a total length of over
   1100 km, protecting 160,000 ha of valuable land. The BC Ministry of
   Environment guidelines for the design of sea dikes to protect low lying
   lands are used to define the upgraded sea dikes flood construction
   levels (FCL) that are now necessary due to climate change and sea-level
   rise (SLR). Thus, dike crest elevations will need to rise so that they
   continue to exert their protective function in the future, towards a
   lifetime up to the year 2100 and beyond. The vulnerability of sea dikes
   is evaluated using an example dike for the application of the PIEVC
   (Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee) Protocol
   method, which is used to identify the sea dike components that are
   especially vulnerable to climate- and weather-related impacts and to
   evaluate the risks to these infrastructure elements, as well as to
   propose typical mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {Adapting to changing coastlines is an unprecedented planning challenge
   as coastal hazards, including those associated with climate change,
   influence all areas of resource management. Tools have been developed to
   aid in understanding coastal hazards and to facilitate the planning and
   implementation of adaptation strategies. Through interviews with members
   of eight geographically distributed state Coastal Zone Management (CZM)
   Programs and several federal and nonprofit partners, we explored the
   utility of current tools for on-the-ground adaptation planning and
   implementation needs. State CZM Programs operate as trusted information
   brokers at the nexus between national resources and local needs. Here we
   provide seven recommendations for how to overcome the challenges
   identified with tool discovery, lack of trust, and the coarse spatial
   resolution of national tools. Our findings suggest local community needs
   are better addressed when end-users play a role in the tool development
   process. We also recommend leveraging CZM Program connections because
   they have the knowledge and expertise to identify solutions and
   disseminate information. While the recommendations presented here were
   taken from the perspective of state CZM Programs regarding coastal
   tools, the lessons learned may provide valuable insight into the tool
   development process for other resource management fields.},

Abstract = {Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to
   the impacts of climate change. Food security is a key issue in the
   region, and is related to vulnerability in the natural and human system.
   This short research paper, which reports on a systematic search of the
   academic literature and is part of a larger research project on climate
   change adaptation in Caribbean coastal communities, investigates two
   central questions: (1) what challenges to food security are Caribbean
   SIDS facing due to climate change? and (2) what strategies, if any, are
   being used to adapt to these challenges? We review peer-reviewed
   articles published after the release of Working Group II's contribution
   to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change in 2014, which included a chapter on vulnerability and
   impacts in small islands (Chapter 29). We find that post AR5 articles
   confirm that climate change will have a significant effect on
   agriculture and fisheries in the Caribbean, mainly through changing
   patterns of weather, air and sea surface temperatures, and water
   availability. These studies highlight the importance of considering the
   social dimensions of food security in the region when identifying and
   implementing adaptation strategies, particularly in the context of
   achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. These social dimensions
   include the Caribbean's historical and social context as well as its
   demographics, which feature varying population densities and poverty
   rates. They serve to increase vulnerability but are imperative
   considerations for understanding and minimizing the threat climate
   change poses to food security in the region.},

Title = {Between a rock and a hard place: the impacts of climate change and
   housing development on breeding birds in California},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-200},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Although the effects of climate change on species distributions have
   received considerable attention, land-use change continues to threaten
   wildlife by contributing to habitat loss and degradation. We compared
   projected spatial impacts of climate change and housing development
   across a range of housing densities on California's birds to evaluate
   the relative potential impacts of each. We used species-distribution
   models in concert with current and future climate projections and
   spatially explicit housing-development density projections in
   California. We compared their potential influence on the distributions
   of 64 focal bird species representing six major vegetation communities.
   Averaged across GCMs, species responding positively to climate change
   were projected to gain 253,890 km 2 and species responding negatively
   were projected to lose 335,640 km(2). Development accounted for 32 \% of
   the overall reductions in projected species distributions. In terms of
   land area, suburban and exurban development accounted for the largest
   portion of land-use impacts on species' distributions. Areas in which
   climatic suitability and housing density were both projected to increase
   were concentrated along the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and areas of
   the north coast. Areas of decreasing climatic suitability and increasing
   housing density were largely concentrated within the Central Valley. Our
   analyses suggest that the cumulative effects of future housing
   development and climate change will be large for many bird species, and
   that some species projected to expand their distributions with climate
   change may actually lose ground to development. This suggests that a key
   climate change adaptation strategy will be to minimize the impacts of
   housing development. To do this effectively, comprehensive policies to
   guide land use decisions are needed at the broader scales of climate
   change.},

Title = {Mitigating cetacean bycatch in coastal Ecuador: Governance challenges
   for small-scale fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {110},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Bycatch of marine fauna by small-scale (artisanal) fisheries is an
   important anthropogenic mortality source to several species of
   cetaceans, including humpback whales and odontocetes, in Ecuador's
   marine waters. Long-term monitoring actions and varied conservation
   efforts have been conducted by non-governmental organizations along the
   Ecuadorian coast, pointing toward the need for a concerted mitigation
   plan and actions to hamper cetaceans' bycatch. Nevertheless, little has
   currently been done by the government and regional authorities to
   address marine mammal interactions with fisheries in eastern Pacific
   Ocean artisanal fisheries. This study provides a review of Ecuador's
   current status concerning cetacean bycatch, and explores the strengths
   and weaknesses of past and current programs aiming to tackle the
   challenges of bycatch mitigation. To bolster our appraisal of the
   policies, a synthesis of fishers' perceptions of the bycatch problem is
   presented in concert with recommendations for fostering fishing
   community-based conservation practices integrated with policies to
   mitigate cetacean bycatch. Our appraisal, based upon the existing
   literature, indicates a situation of increasing urgency. Taking into
   consideration the fishers' perceptions and attitudes, fisheries
   governance in Ecuador should draw inspiration from a truly bottom-up,
   participatory framework based on stakeholder engagement processes; if it
   is based on a top-down, regulatory approach, it is less likely to
   succeed. To carry out this process, a community-based conservation
   programs to provide conditions for empowering fishing communities is
   recommend. This would serve as an initial governance framework for
   fishery policy for conserving marine mammals while maximizing the
   economic benefits from sustainable small-scale fisheries in Ecuador.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Human-induced environmental change increasingly threatens the stability
   of socio-ecological systems. Careful statistical characterization of
   environmental concentrations is critical to quantify and predict the
   consequences of such changes on human and ecosystems conditions.
   However, while concentrations are naturally defined as the ratio between
   solute mass and solvent volume, they have rarely been treated as such,
   typically limiting the analysis to familiar distributions generically
   used for any other environmental variable. To address this gap, we
   propose a more general framework that leverages their definition
   explicitly as ratios of random variables. We show that the resulting
   models accurately describe the behavior of nitrate plus nitrite in US
   rivers and salt concentration in estuaries in the Everglades by
   accounting for heavy tails potentially emerging when the water volume
   fluctuates around low values. Models that preclude the presence of heavy
   tails and the related high probability of extreme concentrations could
   significantly undermine the accuracy of diagnostic frameworks and the
   effectiveness of mitigation interventions, especially for soil
   contamination characterized by a water volume (i.e. soil moisture)
   frequently approaching zero.},

   projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) {[}12] and Internet infrastructure deployment data from Internet
   Atlas {[}24]. We align the data formats and assess risks in terms of the
   amount and type of infrastructure that will be under water in different
   time intervals over the next 100 years. We find that 4,067 miles of
   fiber conduit will be under water and 1,101 nodes (e.g., points of
   presence and colocation centers) will be surrounded by water in the next
   15 years. We further quantify the risks of sea level rise by defining a
   metric that considers the combination of geographic scope and Internet
   infrastructure density. We use this metric to examine different regions
   and find that the New York, Miami, and Seattle metropolitan areas are at
   highest risk. We also quantify the risks to individual service provider
   infrastructures and find that CenturyLink, Inteliquent, and AT\&T are at
   highest risk. While it is difficult to project the impact of
   countermeasures such as sea walls, our results suggest the urgency of
   developing mitigation strategies and alternative infrastructure
   deployments.},

Abstract = {There is increasing interest in the use of nature-based approaches for
   mitigation of storm surges along coasts, deltas, and estuaries. However,
   very few studies have quantified the effectiveness of storm surge height
   reduction by a real-existing, estuarine-scale, nature-based, and
   engineered flood defense system, under specific storm surge conditions.
   Here, we present data and modelling results from a specific storm surge
   in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium), where a hybrid flood defense system is
   implemented, consisting of flood control areas, of which some are
   restored into tidal marsh ecosystems, by use of culvert constructions
   that allow daily reduced tidal in- and outflow. We present a hindcast
   simulation of the storm surge of 6 December 2013, using a TELEMAC-3D
   model of the Scheldt estuary, and model scenarios showing that the
   hybrid flood defense system resulted in a storm surge height reduction
   of up to half a meter in the estuary. An important aspect of the work
   was the implementation of model formulations for calculating flow
   through culverts of restored marshes. The latter was validated comparing
   simulated and measured discharges through a physical scale model of a
   culvert, and through a real-scale culvert of an existing restored marsh
   during the storm surge.},

Title = {Understanding institutional barriers in the climate change adaptation
   planning process of the city of Beirut: vicious cycles and opportunities},

Abstract = {Cities around the world are confronted with the need to put in place
   climate adaptation policies to protect citizens and properties from
   climate change impacts. This article applies components of the framework
   developed by Moser and Ekstrom (2010) onto empirical qualitative data to
   diagnose institutional barriers to climate change adaptation in the
   Municipality of Beirut, Lebanon. Our approach reveals the presence of
   two vicious cycles influencing each other. In the first cycle, the root
   cause barrier is major political interference generating competing
   priorities and poor individual interest in climate change. A second
   vicious cycle is derived from feedbacks caused by the first and leading
   to the absence of a dedicated department where sector specific climate
   risk information is gathered and shared with other departments, limited
   knowledge and scientific understanding, as well as a distorted framing
   or vision, where climate change is considered unrelated to other issues
   and is to be dealt with at higher levels of government. The article also
   highlights the need to analyze interlinkages between barriers in order
   to suggest how to overcome them. The most common way to overcome
   barriers according to interviewees is through national and international
   support followed by the creation of a data bank. These opportunities
   could be explored by national and international policy-makers to break
   the deadlock in Beirut.},

Title = {Assessing mortality risk from heat stress due to global warming},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {339-354},
Abstract = {With gradually progressing climate change in the future, the frequency
   and scale of hot summers like those observed in various places around
   the world in recent years will undoubtedly increase, giving rise to
   strong concerns over increased risk of death due to heat stress. Based
   on this background, we have developed a method to assess future changes
   in mortality due to heat stress with the entire globe as the target, and
   performed trial calculations using this method. The purpose of this
   report is to draw people's attention to the possible severe consequences
   of climate change by presenting the severest estimates in the
   uncertainty range due to adaptation/acclimation expected in the future,
   so as to induce further analysis and discussion on policies and
   measures. For the trial calculations, future changes in temperature were
   derived from the results of simulation using an Atmosphere-Ocean General
   Circulation Model with the highest spatial resolution in the world at
   the time of the study. Population densities were assumed not to alter in
   the future. Assuming that no adaptation or acclimation takes place, when
   the rates of change of excess mortality due to heat stress are examined
   by country, the results of our calculations show increases of
   approximately 100\% to 1000\%. It is confirmed that the burden of
   climate change impact is quite unequal among countries, at least from
   the viewpoint of heat stress mortality. When considered together with
   present population densities, significant increases in excess mortality
   density can be seen in China, India, and Europe. These regions are
   characterized by large losses due to climate change in absolute
   quantitative terms. The need to consider the adoption of adaptation
   measures is therefore most urgent in these regions.},

Abstract = {The unavoidable physical consequences of increased sea-level due to
   global warming and the large concentration of socio-economic and natural
   assets at the coast raise much concern about possible economic damages.
   When discussing climate related threats with decision makers,
   cost-benefit analyses that support decisions are often demanded. The
   Dynamical Interactive Vulnerability Tool (DIVA) allows calculating the
   benefits of a normative coastal protection target versus a business as
   usual (BAU) scenario for the European Union (EU) coastal states. Results
   show that for most EU coastal countries long-term economic benefits are
   expected for a well-defined adaptation strategy during the second half
   of the 21(st) century. By 2 100, about 200 bio \$US are expected to be
   avoided if all EU coastal countries target the 100 year coastal
   protection goal. The situation is not equal for all countries, for some
   like Netherlands and Irish Republic large benefits up to 5.5\% of the
   2007 GDP are expected, while for countries like Estonia and Cyprus the
   adaptation level chosen proved to be too costly when compared with the
   impact costs of a BAU scenario.},

Title = {Disentangling spatio-temporal processes in a hierarchical system: a case
   study in fisheries discards},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {569-578},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the last decade, various spatial and temporal methodologies were
   developed to investigate the processes that drive ecological and
   evolutionary patterns. However, these methods frequently fail to
   acknowledge that the observed patterns result from the overlap of
   different underlying processes. In order to understand how the patterns
   are formed, we must have recourse to methods that allow us to
   disentangle these simultaneous processes. Here we develop a hierarchical
   spatial predictive process (PP) combined with a separable temporal PP to
   disentangle and describe those overlapping processes in one very
   frequent setting in ecology and evolution: multilevel spatio-temporally
   indexed data. We present our methodology through a case study of
   fisheries discards and investigate for example whether the inclusion of
   the hierarchical structure and the temporal processes of the system
   alter the observed spatial patterns. Recently it is recognized that
   understanding the processes driving discards is essential to sustainably
   manage and conserve marine resources. The results show that
   consideration of multiple underlying processes dramatically changes the
   pattern and characteristics of the discards hot- and coldspots. In the
   Irish Sea, the inclusion of the hierarchical structure of the system
   leads to the reduction of the hot- and coldspots. Simultaneously, our
   model identifies key bi-annual fluctuations in the temporal process
   which, together with the variance associated at the level of individual
   fishing trips in the hierarchical structure of the data explained most
   of the variance driving discards. Whether the hierarchical, spatial and
   temporal processes are considered together or not can profoundly alter
   our understanding of what constitutes an appropriate mitigation measure.
   Misidentification of hotspots can culminate in inappropriate mitigation
   practices which can sometimes be irreversible. As the proposed method
   offers a unified approach for understanding the processes that drive
   observed patterns, many areas in ecology such as conservation and
   epidemiological studies can benefit from its use, increasing the
   effectiveness of management plans.},

Title = {An Integrated Approach for Urban Pluvial Flood Risk Assessment at
   Catchment Level},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of urbanization and global climate change,
   urban pluvial floods have occurred more frequently in urban areas.
   Despite of the increasing urban pluvial flood risk, there is still a
   lack of comprehensive understanding of the physical and social
   influencing factors on the process. To fill this knowledge gap, this
   paper proposes a novel approach to calculate the comprehensive urban
   pluvial flooding risk index (PFRI) and investigates the interplay
   impacts from different components at catchment level. To be more
   specific, PFRI is determined by two components, Exposure Index (EI) and
   Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI). EI is evaluated based on two
   indicators, the depression-based Topographic Control Index (TCI) and
   impervious area ratio. SoVI is measured based on a set of demographic
   and socio-economic indicators. Our results demonstrated the spatial
   heterogeneity of urban pluvial flood exposure and social vulnerability,
   as well as the composite flooding risk across the study area. Our
   catchment-based urban pluvial flooding risk assessment method can
   provide a comprehensive understanding of urban flooding and promote the
   formulation of effective flood mitigation strategies from the catchment
   perspective.},

Abstract = {Most existing coastal climate-adaptation planning processes, and the

   biases against and delays decisions to take more discontinuous, yet
   proactive, actions to adapt-for example, relocation and aggressive
   individual protection investments. Public policies should anticipate
   real estate market responses to risk reduction to avoid large
   costs-social and financial-when and if sea level rise and other
   climate-related factors elevate the risks to such high levels that
   discontinuous responses become the least bad alternative.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on tourism has been examined in terms of
   changes in a destination's climate; the impact of ancillary effects such
   as sea-level rise has been neglected. In this study the role that
   coastal and other landscape features have on the attractiveness of
   tourist destinations is examined using the hedonic price technique. The
   average price of accommodation in the coastal districts of
   Schleswig-Holstein, Germany is explained using landscape and other
   characteristics of these districts. As parts of the coastline of
   Schleswig-Holstein are protected by dikes, adaptation measures as well
   as natural coastal features are represented in the dataset. The analysis
   shows that an increase in the length of dikes in a given district would
   result in a reduction in the average price of accommodation. An increase
   in the length of open coast results in an increase in the average price
   of accommodation. For two districts, the impact of sea-level rise is
   examined through a comparison of the costs of different coastal
   protection measures compared to the resulting changes in revenue from
   accommodation. The costs of dike construction along with the effect of
   reduced accommodation prices favour the use of beach nourishment to
   protect the coast. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Salt-tolerant rice variety adoption in the Mekong River Delta: Farmer
   adaptation to sea-level rise},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Rice production in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam (MRD) is endangered
   by sea-level rise and an associated increase in the incidence of
   salinity intrusion. This paper examines the diffusion of salt tolerant
   rice varieties in the MRD that were promoted through Consortium for
   Unfavorable Rice Environments (CURE) activities. Factors associated with
   adoption of CURE-related varieties are estimated using a random utilty
   model and a dataset of 800 farm households with rice fields in salinity
   prone areas of the MRD. Results suggest that there has been widespread
   adoption of CURE-related varieties in salinity-prone areas. Further,
   multivariate analysis reveals that environment and location
   characteristics, rather than household characteristics, are the most
   important determinants of adoption. In particular, CURE-related
   varieties are more likely to be adopted in high-salinity-risk areas that
   are not protected by salinity barrier gates. Neighbhors' adoption
   decisions also strongly influence household decisions to adopt
   CURE-related varieties. The contracting of mechanization, particularly
   for land preparation and harvest, requires the coordination of village
   households in timing of planting, harvest and varietal duration. This
   coordination appears to extend to choice of CURE-related varieties.
   Finally, CURE-related varieties and other varieties generate similar net
   revenues in a year with low salinity exposure, suggesting that
   CURE-related varieties are a low-cost insurance policy against salinity
   inundation in high risk areas. Combined, these results highlight the
   need to address complex factors beyond current economic profits, like
   environment, community choices, and risk mitigation, when designing
   technologies and policies that support farmer adaptation to climatic
   change.},

Number = {6548, SI},
Pages = {1294-1299},

Abstract = {Human societies will transform to address climate change and other
   stressors. How they choose to transform will depend on what societal
   values they prioritize. Managed retreat can play a powerful role in
   expanding the range of possible futures that transformation could
   achieve and in articulating the values that shape those futures.
   Consideration of retreat raises tensions about what losses are
   unacceptable and what aspects of societies are maintained, purposefully
   altered, or allowed to change unaided. Here we integrate research on
   retreat, transformational adaptation, climate damages and losses, and
   design and decision support to chart a roadmap for strategic, managed
   retreat. At its core, this roadmap requires a fundamental
   reconceptualization of what it means for retreat to be strategic and
   managed. The questions raised are relevant to adaptation science and
   societies far beyond the remit of retreat.},

Abstract = {The Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest warming marine areas on the
   planet: The industries and creatures that call it home face an
   unprecedented shift in their interactions and existence. Scientists,
   policy makers, and practitioners often want to communicate to the public
   about the seriousness of the situation to encourage mitigation and
   adaptation. Many standard communication strategies that rely on fear and
   scientific authority alone-rather than comprehensive explanations that
   include solutions-can leave audiences feeling overwhelmed and
   disengaged, instead of hopeful and motivated to act. In this practice
   bridge, we showcase a social science research-based climate change
   communication ``tool-kit{''} for the Gulf of Maine, using one example
   for each climate driver addressed at the Gulf of Maine 2050 Symposium
   (temperature and circulation: lobster fisheries; coastal and ocean
   acidification: seagrass restoration; sea-level rise: coastal
   development). Communication models that involve the head (understanding
   of climate change), heart (hope through agency and efficacy), and hands
   (intentions to participate in community action) further engagement in
   climate change conversations. We explain the research behind our
   communication framework, enabling practitioners to extend this case

Title = {Negative CO2 emissions via enhanced silicate weathering in coastal
   environments},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Negative emission technologies (NETs) target the removal of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and are being actively investigated
   as a strategy to limit global warming to within the 1.5-2 degrees C
   targets of the 2015 UN climate agreement. Enhanced silicate weathering
   (ESW) proposes to exploit the natural process of mineral weathering for
   the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Here, we discuss the potential
   of applying ESW in coastal environments as a climate change mitigation
   option. By deliberately introducing fast-weathering silicate minerals
   onto coastal sediments, alkalinity is released into the overlying
   waters, thus creating a coastal CO2 sink. Compared with other NETs,
   coastal ESW has the advantage that it counteracts ocean acidification,
   does not interfere with terrestrial land use and can be directly
   integrated into existing coastal management programmes with existing
   (dredging) technology. Yet presently, the concept is still at an early
   stage, and so two major research challenges relate to the efficiency and
   environmental impact of ESW. Dedicated experiments are needed (i) to
   more precisely determine the weathering rate under in situ conditions
   within the seabed and (ii) to evaluate the ecosystem impacts-both
   positive and negative-from the released weathering products.},

Title = {Urban heat stress and human health in Bangkok, Thailand},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {185},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Heat stress has been recognized as one of the consequences of climate
   change in urban areas. Its adverse effects on the urban population range
   from economy, social, environment, and human health. With the increasing
   urbanization and economic development in cities, heat stress is expected
   to worsen. This particular study aims to achieve two objectives: (1) to
   understand the determinants of heat stress, especially the roles of the
   urban environment in exacerbating the heat stress, and (2) to explore
   the effects of heat stress to human health using self-reported health
   assessment. We employed a cross-sectional study using a survey
   questionnaire from 505 respondents living in the urban area of Bangkok,
   Thailand. We found that socioeconomic conditions of the individual and
   urban environment were significant determinants of urban heat stress.
   Low-income urban populations living in high-density areas with less
   green open space were more likely to experience heat stress. We also
   found that heat stress significantly affects human health. Those who
   reported a higher level of heat stress were more likely to have adverse
   health and well-being outcomes. The findings suggest that the increased
   risk of heat stress represents a major problem in the Bangkok, Thailand.
   It is necessary to address heat stress in adaptation policy and measures
   at the city levels amid the continued increase of global temperature and
   climate change.},

Title = {Assessing the impact of climate change on agriculture in Quang Nam
   Province, Viet Nam using modeling approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {757-771},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to evaluate the impact of climate change on some
   specific areas of agricultural production in Quang Nam Province,
   including assessing the possibility of losing agricultural land owing to
   sea level rise; assessing the impact on rice productivity; and,
   assessing the impact on crop water demand.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study used the method of collecting and processing statistics data;
   method of analysis, comparison and evaluation; method of geographic
   information system; method of using mathematical model; and method of
   professional solution, to assess the impacts of climate change.
   Findings
   Evaluation results in Quang Nam Province show that, by the end of the
   21st century, winter-spring rice productivity may decrease by 33\%,
   while summer-autumn rice productivity may decrease by 49\%. Under
   representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario, water demand
   increases by 31.1\% compared to the baseline period, of which the
   winter-spring crop increases by 28.4\%, and the summer-autumn crop
   increased by 34.3\%. Under RCP 8.5 scenario, water demand increases by
   54.1\% compared to the baseline period, of which the winter-spring crop
   increases by 46.7\%, and the summer-autumn crop increased by 63.1\%. The
   area of agricultural land likely to be inundated by sea level rise at 50
   cm is 418.32 ha, and at 80 cm, it is 637.07 ha.
   Originality/value
   To propose adaptation solution to avoid the impacts of climate change on
   agriculture, it is necessary to consider about the impact on losing land
   for agriculture, the impact on rice productivity, assess the impact on
   crop water demand and other. The result of this assessment is useful for
   policymakers for forming the agriculture development plan.},

Abstract = {The life and survival of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi during its
   adaptation in natural aquatic systems is highly influenced by the
   availability of nutrients and temperature. To learn about adaptation
   strategies evolved by this bacterium to cope with drastic temperature
   downshifts and nutrients depletion, we have studied the phenotypical and
   gene expression changes occurring in V.harveyi during its adaptation to
   cold seawater. We found that incubation in cold seawater up to 12h did
   not cause any significant morphological changes in V.harveyi and had no
   effect on the number of viable and culturable cells. Microarray analysis
   revealed that the V.harveyi response to cold seawater leads to up- and
   downregulation of numerous genes controlling the central carbon
   metabolism, nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis as well as DNA
   repair. In addition, expression of some genes controlling biosynthesis
   of lipids, molecular transport, and energy production was altered to
   likely affect the composition and properties of the V.harveyi cell
   envelope, thus implying the putative role of this compartment in
   adaptation to stress. Here, we discuss these results with regard to the

Title = {Rainwater lens dynamics and mixing between infiltrating rainwater and

   field},

Abstract = {Thin rainwater lenses (RW-lenses) near the land surface are often the
   only source of freshwater in agricultural areas with
   regionally-extensive brackish to saline groundwater. The seasonal and
   inter-annual dynamics of these lenses are poorly known. Here this
   knowledge gap is addressed by investigating the transient flow and
   mixing processes in RW-lenses beneath two tile-drained agricultural
   fields in the Netherlands. Evidence of RW-lens dynamics was
   systematically collected by monthly ground- and soil water sampling, in
   combination with daily observations of water table elevation, drain tile
   discharge and drain water salinity. Based on these data, and numerical
   modeling of the key lens characteristics, a conceptual model of seasonal
   lens dynamics is presented. It is found that variations in the position
   of the mixing zone and mixing zone salinities are small and vary on a
   seasonal timescale, which is attributed to the slow transient
   oscillatory flow regime in the deepest part of the lens. The flow and
   mixing processes are faster near the water table, which responds to
   recharge and evapotranspiration at a timescale less than a day.
   Variations of drain tile discharge and drain water salinity are also
   very dynamic as they respond to individual rain events. Salinities of
   soil water can become significantly higher than in the groundwater. This
   is attributed to the combined effect of capillary rise of saline
   groundwater during dry periods and incomplete flushing by infiltrating
   freshwater due to preferential flow through cracks in the soil. The
   results of this study are the key to understanding the potential impact
   of future climate change and to designing effective mitigating measures
   such as adapting tile-drainage systems to ensure the future availability
   of freshwater for agriculture. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {One of the most important and visible indicators of global climate
   change is the recession of glaciers in many parts of the world. The
   findings of the IPCC Assessment Report (2007) suggest that there has
   been a significant decline in mountain glaciers and snow cover, which
   has contributed to the increased sea levels and water flow changes in
   river basins. In the latter half of 20th century, an increase in the
   rate of retreat has been observed in Himalayan Glaciers since advent of
   industrialization. The paper attempts to present a critical review and
   understanding of the recent changes in retreat of selected Himalayan
   glaciers from potential climate change. The study explores scientific
   evidence and analysis of observed data from a large and a small glacier
   in the Indian Himalaya. This will help in understanding the
   vulnerability of retreat of the glaciers based on their size. The larger
   glaciers are unlikely to disappear in the near future, due to its large
   mass balance and large response time due to climatic changes. Future
   adaptation needs, research and action for downstream communities,
   ecosystems and impacts on power sector are discussed.},

Number = {10},
Pages = {3793-3804},

Abstract = {As climate change shifts marine species distribution and abundance
   worldwide, projecting local changes over decadal scales may be an
   adaptive strategy for managers and industry. In Iceland, one of the top
   fish-producing nations globally, long-term monitoring enables model
   simulations of groundfish species habitat distribution. We used
   generalized additive models to characterize suitable thermal habitat for
   51 fish species in Iceland's waters. We projected changes in suitable
   thermal habitat by midcentury with an ensemble of five general
   circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Program 6
   (CMIP6) and NOAA (CM2.6) and two scenarios (SSP 5-8.5 and SSP 2-4.5). We
   found a general northward shift in suitable thermal habitat
   distribution, with variable regional dynamics among species. Species
   thermal bias index was a weak predictor of projected thermal habitat
   change, with warmer-water species more likely to see increases in
   thermal habitat and southern warm-edge range expansions. While these
   results isolate the effects of future changes in temperature, providing
   an indication of suitable thermal habitat, low model explanatory power
   suggests that additional variables may improve distribution projections.
   Such projections might serve as guideposts to inform long-term
   management decisions about regional and species-specific suitability for
   Iceland's fisheries, infrastructure investment, and risk evaluation
   under climate change.},

Abstract = {Coastal zones are suffering from severe changes Dune systems are
   forecasted to be impacted severely by such changes Since shifts in
   coastal dynamics may drive modifications in the floristic composition of

   support adaptive measures We performe here an assessment of the relative
   efficiency of functional and phytosociological classifications in the
   analysis of structure and dynamics in foredune vegetation Our results
   identified common signals but also highlighted some differences among
   results from different classifications with potential consequences for
   the monitoring of changes in dune ecosystems The coincident signals
   provided by the analysed classification systems suggest that they are
   effective in capturing the major rules involved in the structure and
   dynamics of foredune vegetation Since the disturbance regime in
   foredunes is mostly related to prevailing coastal dynamics,
   compositional shifts in phytosociological or functional spectra are thus
   useful in the establishment of reliable indicators and protocols to

Abstract = {Tardigrades form an important component of meiofaunal communities across
   the globe. However, our knowledge on tardigrade ecology is very limited.
   Here, we report the results of 21 field samplings of the marine
   tardigrade Halobiotus crispae collected over a period of 74 months at
   the locality of Vellerup Vig, Denmark, with the aim of providing novel
   insights into its ecology. Uniquely, H. crispae is characterized by the
   presence of seasonal cyclic changes in the phenotype of the animal, i.e.
   cyclomorphosis. Our sampling data include (i) total number of animals
   extracted, (ii) dominant cyclomorphic stage found, and (iii) important
   environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity and pH. Our
   accumulated data constitute a tentative model for the annual
   fluctuations in animal density, which reveals an annual peak in
   abundance during the months of February and March. In contrast,
   tardigrade density appears to decrease in response to increasing
   temperatures during late spring/early summer. The thermal tolerance of
   H. crispae was therefore investigated experimentally for the
   pseudosimplex 2 stage, active stage and pseudosimplex 1 stage, revealing
   LTmin values of 24.6 degrees C, 14.2 degrees C and 24.7 degrees C, LT50
   values of 30.6 degrees C, 29.6 degrees C and 30.8 degrees C, and LTmax
   values of 35 degrees C, 35.8 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively.
   In general, our thermal tolerance data reveal that (i) the entry into
   the pseudosimplex 1 stage represents an adaptive strategy that enables
   the survival of the Vellerup Vig population during periods of heat
   stress, and (ii) temperature is an important factor in limiting the
   geographic distribution of H. crispae.},

Title = {Forecasting future drowning of coastal waterbird habitats reveals a
   major conservation concern},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {171},

Abstract = {Climate change-induced rising sea levels are expected to affect coastal
   habitats worldwide, and the associated coastal squeeze in protected
   coastal areas might significantly alter availability of coastal
   habitats. This study combines coastal bathymetry and elevation models to
   develop a continuous topographic model covering coastal areas on a large
   geographical scale, and predicts the areal change in five habitats
   important to numerous breeding and migrating birds. Our model indicates
   considerable declines in coastal habitats as a result of coastal
   squeeze, and reveals major conservation concerns regarding future
   preservation of essential waterbird habitats. In our study area this
   will directly influence seven species of herbivorous waterbirds
   occurring at internationally important numbers, and a total of 41
   species of coastal birds protected under the EU Birds Directive, many of
   which are currently designated as having an unfavourable conservation
   status. Declines in coastal habitats will also affect invertebrates and
   fish, and through effects on food webs have an even wider ecological
   implication. These findings highlight the need of focused coastal
   management, and illustrate the cost of uncritically protecting human
   agricultural interests while preventing natural dynamics of the coastal
   zone. Our analysis indicate that pulling down existing sea walls will
   reduce the loss by 37-65\% dependent on habitat type, but that complete
   compensation is unlikely in our study area due to local topography.
   Managed retreat of coastlines might be an efficient solution to
   counteract the effects of coastal squeeze, but the time and interests
   associated with implementation of such mitigation measures imply that
   the time for action is now. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {`A Chain of Creation, Continuation, Continuity': Feminist dramaturgy and
   the matter of the sea},
Journal = {PERFORMANCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {17-24},
Abstract = {This article considers what remnants of the imaginary link established
   between the maternal and the sea may still be useful in feminist
   performance practice and theory. It does so by discussing a
   practice-as-research experiment that adapted strategies from Helene
   Cixous's ecriture femininethat performs a liquification of ordering
   structures in prose writinginto a dramaturgical form based on the logic
   of waves. The article goes on to suggest that such a dramaturgy recasts
   creation as a fluid state of becoming ex tempore, resisting the
   masculine-connoted vision of creation as an act of the singular genius
   ex nihilo. It further argues that drawing on a non-human phenomenon, the
   sea, to describe and theorize a type of dramaturgical composition may be
   read as a twofold attempt on the hegemony of patriarchal culture:
   through its associative link with the maternal body the creative
   potential of the feminine is revalued while at the same time the
   generative capacity of the non-human is recognized via Gaston
   Bachelard's notion of the material imagination. The article concludes by
   proposing that the sea, together with its analogic association to the
   maternal, can be instated as a figure that gives temporary shape to an
   alternative vision of cultural production.},

Title = {Physical basis of coastal adaptation on tropical small islands},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {327-344},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Small tropical islands are widely recognized as having high exposure and
   vulnerability to climate change and other natural hazards. Ocean warming
   and acidification, changing storm patterns and intensity, and
   accelerated sea-level rise pose challenges that compound the intrinsic
   vulnerability of small, remote, island communities. Sustainable
   development requires robust guidance on the risks associated with
   natural hazards and climate change, including the potential for island
   coasts and reefs to keep pace with rising sea levels. Here we review
   these issues with special attention to their implications for
   climate-change vulnerability, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction in
   various island settings. We present new projections for 2010-2100 local
   sea-level rise (SLR) at 18 island sites, incorporating crustal motion
   and gravitational fingerprinting, for a range of Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change global projections and a semi-empirical model.
   Projected 90-year SLR for the upper limit A1FI scenario with enhanced
   glacier drawdown ranges from 0.56 to 1.01 m for islands with a measured
   range of vertical motion from -0.29 to +0.10 m. We classify tropical
   small islands into four broad groups comprising continental fragments,
   volcanic islands, near-atolls and atolls, and high carbonate islands
   including raised atolls. Because exposure to coastal forcing and hazards
   varies with island form, this provides a framework for consideration of
   vulnerability and adaptation strategies. Nevertheless, appropriate
   measures to adjust for climate change and to mitigate disaster risk
   depend on a place-based understanding of island landscapes and of
   processes operating in the coastal biophysical system of individual
   islands.},

Title = {Trend analysis of weather variables in Sagar Island, West Bengal, India:
   a long-term perspective (1982-2010)},
Journal = {CURRENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {105},
Number = {7},
Pages = {947-953},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Sagar Island, a gargantuan low-lying archipelago setting on the
   continental shelf of the Bay of Bengal is one of the most vulnerable
   deltas to climate change. Extreme climate-driven multifarious threats,
   including tidal gushes, deluge with sea water, permanent submergence of
   land, occurrence of droughts and water scarcity have taken a toll on
   food and environmental security of the island. Knowing the trend of
   long-term weather variables responsible for the climate of the island
   holds importance in adaptation and mitigation strategies to sustain food
   production. In the present article, weather variables of the island
   (1982-2010) have been analysed to detect the changes in trend using
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and the magnitudes of such trends have
   been estimated using Sen's slope. The island receives an annual average
   rainfall of 1735 352 mm, with an inter-annual deviation exceeding 40\%
   and exhibits a decreasing trend (-5.79 mm year(-1)). Significant (P <
   0.05) anomalies in inter- as well intra-annual rainfall distributions
   (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon months) were observed.
   Contribution of monsoon and post-monsoon months showed a decreasing
   trend (-3.84 to -4.42 mm year(-1)), while pre-monsoon rainfall showed an
   increasing trend (+0.98 mm year(-1)). Wide variability in inter-annual
   rainy days (76-139 days) and a decreasing trend (-0.24 days year(-1))
   may further complicate the existing anomalies. The island is
   experiencing a significant (P < 0.05) rising trend of inter-annual mean
   (+0.021 degrees C year(-1)) and maximum temperatures (+0.060 degrees C
   year(-1)), with a reverse trend (decline) in minimum temperature (-0.031
   degrees C year(-1)). Other weather variables like sunshine duration,
   wind speed, atmospheric evaporative demand, etc. also manifested a
   complex interaction and significant (P < 0.05) decreasing trend over the
   study periods (1982-2010). Implications of these changes were manifested
   on water balance front: rising trend of water scarcity during
   post-monsoon months (December February) in the island.},

Title = {Evaluation of green infrastructure effects on tropical Sri Lankan urban
   context as an urban heat island adaptation strategy},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {212-222},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Incorporation of strategic green infrastructure into urban settings has
   a potential to mitigate climate change, urban heat island (UHI) effect,
   flood risk and subsequent increase in quality of human life in general.
   UHI induces through low surface albedo, building geometry and absence of
   greenery and it deteriorates the thermal comfort and well-being of city
   dwellers and occupants. This study examined the implication of urban
   green infrastructure on enhanced microclimatic condition in tropical
   urban perspective while evaluating the best suitable strategy by
   modeling a designated site with ENVI-met microclimatic software (V4).
   The calibration procedure of ENVI met has been undertaken through a real
   ground monitoring process and the software modeling was done for
   selected urban setting. The model was firstly validated by
   reconciliation of observed in-situ measurements with simulated values.
   R-squared (R-2) values for three different surface types such as
   asphalt, cement and grass were 0.91, 0.96, 0.88 for near ground (0m) and
   0.78, 0.81, 0.92 for 1.5 m, respectively. The parametric studies
   verified that ENVI-met model can be effectively utilized to improve
   urban micro-scale thermal conditions in tropical Sri Lanka. The
   numerical simulation model of ENVI-met was used to generate
   micro-climatic data for the selected area of Colombo metropolitan region
   with six greening design scenarios such as prevailing UHI condition
   (T1), trees in curbsides (T2), 100\% green roofing (T3), 50\% green
   roofing (T4), 50\% green walls (T5) and a combination (T6) of above
   mentioned green strategies (trees in curbsides+ 50\% green roofs+ 50\%
   green walls). Temperature reductions obtained from all green strategies
   were compared with existing UHI (T1) scenario during peak temperature in
   given time. The temperature reductions accomplished by T2, T3, T4, T5
   and T6 green infrastructure options compared to T1 were 1.87 degrees C,
   1.76 degrees C, 1.79 degrees C, 1.86 degrees C and 1.90 degrees C,
   respectively. It can be concluded that strategic design of urban
   greenery can effectively enhance the urban environment and outdoor
   thermal comfort in tropical Sri Lanka.},

Title = {Prioritizing actions: spatial action maps for conservation},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES},
Abstract = {Spatial prioritization is a critical step in conservation planning, a
   process designed to ensure that limited resources are applied in ways
   that deliver the highest possible returns for biodiversity and human
   wellbeing. In practice, many spatial prioritizations fall short of their
   potential by focusing on places rather than actions, and by using data
   of snapshots of assets or threats rather than estimated impacts. We
   introduce spatial action mapping as an approach that overcomes these
   shortfalls. This approach produces a spatially explicit view of where
   and how much a given conservation action is likely to contribute to
   achieving stated conservation goals. Through seven case examples, we
   demonstrate simple to complex versions of how this method can be applied
   across local to global scales to inform decisions about a wide range of
   conservation actions and benefits. Spatial action mapping can support
   major improvements in efficient use of conservation resources and will
   reach its full potential as the quality of environmental, social, and
   economic datasets converge and conservation impact evaluations improve.},

Abstract = {Optimal settings of traffic lights and traffic light cycles are
   important tasks of modeling a modern ordered traffic in smart cities.
   This article analyzes the comparative effectiveness of selected
   optimization algorithms for the identified area. In particular, it
   involves the comparison of the concepts of genetic algorithm using
   particle swarm optimization, the differential evolution and the Monte
   Carlo method with two new approaches: evolution strategy involving the
   adaptation of the covariance matrix and topology archipelago consisting
   of four islands - different algorithms to optimize the length of the
   phase in fixed time traffic signals. Developed simulation solutions
   allowed to achieve a quantitative improvement in the selection of the
   optimal durations of the phases of traffic lights for the tested roads
   with junctions.},

Abstract = {Purpose Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, ventilation in a small
   cabin where social distancing cannot be guaranteed is extremely
   important. This study aims to find out the best configuration of open
   and closed windows in a moving car at varying speeds to improve the
   ventilation efficiency. The effectiveness of other mitigation measures
   including face masks, taxi screens and air conditioning (AC) systems are
   also evaluated. Design/methodology/approach Each window is given three
   opening levels: fully open, half open and fully closed. For a car with
   four windows, this yields 81 different configurations. The location of
   virus source is also considered, either emitting from the driver or from
   the rear seat passenger. Then three different travelling speeds, 5 m/s,
   10 m/s and 15 m/s, are examined for the window opening/closing
   configurations that provide the best ventilation effect. A study into
   the effectiveness of face masks is realised by adjusting virus injection
   amounts; and the simulation of taxi screens and AC system simply
   requires a small modification to the car model. Findings The numerical
   studies identify the top window opening/closing configurations that
   provide the most efficient ventilation at different moving speeds, along
   with a comprehensive ranking list. The results show that fully opening
   all windows is not always the best choice. Simulations evaluating other
   mitigation measures confirm good effect of face masks and poor
   performance of taxi screens and AC systems. Originality/value This work
   is the first large-scale numerical simulation and parametric study about
   different window opening/closing configurations of a moving car. The
   results provide useful guides for travellers in shared cars to mitigate
   Covid-19 transmission risks. The findings are helpful to both
   individuals' health and society's recovery in the Covid-19 era and they
   also provide useful information to protect people from other respiratory
   infectious diseases such as influenza.},

Abstract = {Monitoring within an adaptive management framework provides important
   insights about system responses to management and information on which
   management actions to adjust to improve outcomes over time. We evaluated
   the range-wide monitoring survey of the New England cottontail
   (Sylvilagus transitionalis) and assessed its ability to track changes in
   species' population status over time using data gathered under the
   original protocol in 2016-2017 from 204 sites in 5 states (Connecticut,
   Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York, USA). We used
   occupancy analysis and structured decision making to evaluate 2
   questions: 1) Does the monitoring survey provide the information needed
   to meet monitoring goals? and 2) What changes in the monitoring
   protocol, survey-site selection, or field-data collection are needed to
   better meet monitoring goals? A power analysis applied to data from the
   2016-2017 survey indicated insufficient power (<0.80) to detect a large
   (0.50) change in occupancy, and either increasing the number of sites
   sampled, the number of occupied sites sampled, or both actions were
   needed to increase power and enable range-wide survey objectives to be
   met. A revised study design was implemented in 2017-2018 that included
   sampling 146 of about 210 known occupied sites in 6 states (Connecticut,
   Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island, USA)
   and provided sufficient power (0.81) to detect a small (0.30) change in
   occupancy. The revised study design revealed a 50\% decline in the
   number of known occupied sites has occurred over the last decade. Our
   findings highlight the importance of study-design considerations in
   monitoring protocols and the important role of structured
   decision-making in making transparent, data-informed, and defendable
   decisions when developing, evaluating, and revising monitoring plans for
   cryptic and rare species such as the New England cottontail. (c) 2020

Abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of marine recreational fishing,
   recreational fisheries management is often hampered by lack of adequate
   data and limited effectiveness of conventional regulations. In Shark
   Bay, Western Australia, snapper (Pagrus auratus) in the Eastern Gulf,
   Denham Sound and Freycinet Estuary have been a major attraction for
   recreational fishers since the 1960s. Various management measures were
   progressively introduced from 1998 onwards to limit snapper catches,
   including increases in minimum length, introduction of a maximum length,
   reductions in daily bag limit, a moratorium in the Eastern Gulf (June
   1998-March 2003), a 6-week spawning closure in the Freycinet Estuary
   and, finally, the introduction of a Total-Allowable-Catch-based system
   in 2003. Stock assessments in 2011 indicated that spawning biomass in
   the Eastern Gulf and Denham Sound had rebuilt to the management target
   level while biomass in the Freycinet Estuary remained below the
   threshold level but was continuing to slowly rebuild. This paper
   summarising the research and adaptive management of the snapper fishery
   over the last 15+ years represents an important case study that
   addresses a range of issues typically associated with marine
   recreational fisheries, including assessment of stock size and
   recreational catch, evaluation of management regulations and active
   engagement with the recreational fishing community.},

Title = {Monitoring surface urban heat island formation in a tropical mountain
   city using Landsat data (1987-2015)},
Journal = {ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {133},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since it was first described about two centuries ago and due to its
   adverse impacts on urban ecological environment and the overall
   livability of cities, the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has been,
   and still is, an important research topic across various fields of
   study. However, UHI studies on cities in mountain regions are still
   lacking. This study aims to contribute to this endeavor by monitoring
   and examining the formation of surface UHI (SUHI) in a tropical mountain
   city of Southeast Asia-Baguio City, the summer capital of the
   Philippines- using Landsat data (1987-2015). Based on mean surface
   temperature difference between impervious surface (IS) and green space
   (GS1), SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area increased from 2.7
   degrees C in 1987 to 3.4 degrees C in 2015. Between an urban zone (>86\%
   impervious) and a rural zone (<10\% impervious) along the urban-rural
   gradient, it increased from 4.0 degrees C in 1987 to 8.2 degrees C in
   2015. These results are consistent with the rapid urbanization of the
   area over the same period, which resulted in a rapid expansion of
   impervious surfaces and substantial loss of green spaces. Together with
   landscape composition variables (e.g. fraction of IS), topographic
   variables (e.g. hillshade) can help explain a significant amount of
   spatial variations in surface temperature in the area (R-2 = 0.56-0.85)
   (p < 0.001). The relative importance of the `fraction of IS' variable
   also increased, indicating that its unique explanatory and predictive
   power concerning the spatial variations of surface temperature increases
   as the city size becomes bigger and SUHI gets more intense. Overall,
   these results indicate that the cool temperature of the study area being
   situated in a mountain region did not hinder the formation of SUHI.
   Thus, the formation and effects of UHIs, including possible mitigation
   and adaptation measures, should be considered in landscape planning for
   the sustainable urban development of the area. (C) 2017 International

Abstract = {With the rapid development of society and the economy and the increasing
   seriousness of environmental problems, renewable energy and high-quality
   energy services in low-carbon communities have become popular research
   topics. However, a large number of volatile distributed generation power
   systems in the community are connected to the grid. It is difficult to
   stabilize and efficiently interact with fragmented and isolated energy
   management systems, and it is difficult to meet energy management needs
   in terms of low-carbon emissions, stability, and intelligence.
   Therefore, by considering operation costs, pollution control costs,
   energy stability, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, this article
   proposes a regional energy supply model called community energy Internet
   and builds a low-carbon community energy adaptive management model for
   smart services. Then, to address energy supply instability, an adaptive
   feedback control mechanism developed based on model predictive control
   is introduced to adapt to the changing environment. Finally, a long
   short-term memory-recurrent neural network-based Tabu search is
   introduced to prevent the multiobjective particle swarm optimization
   algorithm from easily falling into a local optimum. The simulation
   results show that the proposed model can effectively realize the optimal
   allocation of energy, which solves the problem of fragmented energy
   islands caused by distributed power access. This method has quality of
   service benefits for users, such as cost, time, and stability, and
   realizes wide interconnections, high intelligence, and low-carbon
   efficiency of community energy management.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the repair and replacement of an existing 90-yr old
   timber berth and trestle to meet the operational and seismic demands
   mandated by the Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and Maintenance
   Standards (MOTEMS). Many older marine oil terminals in California have
   been required to meet the MOTEMS regulations. However, many operators
   are looking for innovative ways to achieve the regulation requirements
   with restricted capital budgets. This terminal meets the MOTEMS
   requirements and capital constraints by replacing and repairing portions
   of the trestle. The strengthened structures meet the present demands for
   operational and seismic conditions as well as climate change issues. The
   author and his colleagues have recently completed the design and
   permitting of the first timber structure in the San Francisco Bay Area
   that includes operational, seismic, and sea level impact design
   requirements. The paper discusses the geotechnical and operational
   constraints, design criteria, permitting coordination, climate change
   adaptive measures, instrumentation requirements, early construction
   issues, and path forward for future waterfront structures. This paper
   also discusses the various alternative replacement and repair designs,
   the selection of the most cost effective options, lessons learned and
   some pitfalls to avoid for future rehabilitation projects.},

   County, New York},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {133-148},
Abstract = {Climate change is perhaps the most controversial environmental issue of
   recent times. Despite uncertainty about either its cause or ultimate
   magnitude, the potential impact suggests that scenarios of possible
   changes should be incorporated into future planning. Yet communities
   continue to settle, develop and invest in hazardous locations along the
   coast. Through a case study of Suffolk County on Long Island, New York,
   this research explores three scenarios to model climatic conditions over
   the next few decades. GIS, geophysical data, land use, housing and
   economic characteristics, and storm history are combined to estimate
   potential losses, in both absolute and relative terms. Findings suggest
   that potential absolute and relative losses will increase from 5.5 to
   8.6 per cent compared to current expected losses. Though rather small
   proportional increases, these translate to an additional USD500 million
   in losses compared to a no climate change scenario, with significant
   spatial variations throughout the county. Understanding where and how
   much climate change may affect local flooding is critical to recognizing
   the need for adaptive measures. What has been missing in much research
   is the ability to translate climate change models into local planning
   priorities. This study relies on existing data and rather
   straightforward models that can be applied at many locations and, as a
   result, is a first step in moving toward local application of the
   findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in an American
   context.},

Abstract = {For implementation of climate change adaptation in communities on the
   islands of Java and Lombok, Indonesia, a new extension approach was
   designed and carefully further developed while establishing it. It is
   called ``Science Field Shops (SFSs){''}. In these ``Shops{''}, farmers,
   scientists/scholars and (where possible, so ideally) local extension
   officers meet to discuss and solve vulnerabilities and actual local
   problems expressed by farmers. In such context, agricultural extension
   is defined best as: ``bringing new knowledge to farmers{''} and this is
   coordinated at these SFSs.
   We use SFSs to temporarily bridge the gap in availability and training
   of extension intermediaries by using farmer facilitators (FFs). Farmers
   are confused by consequences of climate change and want answers on
   questions that are related to local climate problems but also many other
   issues in growing their crops, among which rice is most important.
   Giving and discussing answers and predictions demand real dialogues in
   an agrometeorological learning approach to response farming.
   Farmers start to believe in their attempts to understand and reduce
   yield differences with the past and between them, by actively learning
   about consequences of climate change and how we can jointly fight them
   in such and otherwise changing environments. Anthropology and
   climatology are combined.},

Title = {Twentieth-Century Climate Change over Africa: Seasonal Hydroclimate
   Trends and Sahara Desert Expansion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3349-3370},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Twentieth-century trends in seasonal temperature and precipitation over
   the African continent are analyzed from observational datasets and
   historical climate simulations. Given the agricultural economy of the
   continent, a seasonal perspective is adopted as it is more pertinent
   than an annual-average one, which can mask offsetting but agriculturally
   sensitive seasonal hydroclimate variations. Examination of linear trends
   in seasonal surface air temperature (SAT) shows that heat stress has
   increased in several regions, including Sudan and northern Africa where
   the largest SAT trends occur in the warm season. Broadly speaking, the
   northern continent has warmed more than the southern one in all seasons.
   Precipitation trends are varied but notable declining trends are found
   in the countries along the Gulf of Guinea, especially in the source
   region of the Niger River in West Africa, and in the Congo River basin.
   Rainfall over the African Great Lakes-one of the largest freshwater
   repositories-has, however, increased. It is shown that the Sahara Desert
   has expanded significantly over the twentieth century, by 11\%-18\%
   depending on the season, and by 10\% when defined using annual rainfall.
   The expansion rate is sensitively dependent on the analysis period in
   view of the multidecadal periods of desert expansion (including from the
   drying of the Sahel in the 1950s-80s) and contraction in the 1902-2013
   record, and the stability of the rain gauge network. The desert expanded
   southward in summer, reflecting retreat of the northern edge of the
   Sahel rainfall belt, and to the north in winter, indicating potential
   impact of the widening of the tropics. Specific mechanisms for the
   expansion are investigated. Finally, this observational analysis is used
   to evaluate the state-of-the-art climate simulations from a comparison
   of the twentieth-century hydroclimate trends. The evaluation shows that
   modeling regional hydroclimate change over the African continent remains
   challenging, warranting caution in the development of adaptation and
   mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {This article aims to identify conditions of success for European
   fisheries co-management and its integration in broader strategies for
   sustainable resource management. Co-management of fisheries, broadly
   defined as the involvement of users in management, developed in Europe
   in various experimental forms of participation of fishermen in the
   management process, in advisory roles or through delegation and sharing
   of power. During its history, fisheries co-management has been revealed
   as multi-functional, addressing different knowledge and resource
   management problems, with varying success. This analysis focuses on
   knowledge-related issues that are important for the functioning of
   co-management, especially the combination of scientific and local
   knowledge. First we review European literature on co-management and
   secondly we analyse two exemplary case studies (EU Regional Advisory
   Councils and Fisheries Local Action Groups). Thereupon the possibilities
   for future development of co-management in Europe are discussed with
   regard to knowledge integration and environmental governance. Under the
   influence of the ideas of adaptive governance and sustainable resource
   management, modifications of forms and functions of co-management
   systems are described. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Selective breeding of edible bivalves and its implication of global

Journal = {REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Bivalve molluscs are very nutritious and are an important source of
   human animal protein. To date, bivalve farming has contributed to about
   15\% of the mean per capita animal protein intake of approximate 1.5
   billion people around the world. Unfortunately, the effects of climate
   change, mainly global warming and ocean acidification, have had many
   deleterious effects on bivalve aquaculture, not only leading to mass
   mortalities of bivalves in farms and hatcheries, but also causing
   collapse of natural bivalve populations. In response to the recurrent
   mass mortalities of farmed bivalves, many selective breeding programmes
   have been launched with the breeding goal of reducing mortality rate
   caused by disease outbreaks and changing ocean conditions. This article
   reviews the progress and potential of selective breeding of edible
   bivalves in the context of global climate change. It is clear from the
   literature that in terms of environmental sensitivity, and disease
   resistance and tolerance, selective breeding has great potential for
   improving the robustness of edible bivalves with significant
   heritability and genetic gain. Because the robustness of edible bivalves
   to climate change is a complex trait affected by multiple genes, the
   application of modern genomic tools in selective breeding is expected to
   dramatically enhance the accuracy and efficacy of genetic improvements
   and produce bivalve strains that are robust to climate change. The
   information in this article is very useful for guidance on adaptation
   strategies for climate-smart bivalve aquaculture solutions to be
   implemented in bivalve hatcheries and farms.},

   analysis. The trees were of the same age and growing on a plantation in
   the semiarid coastal area of southern Spain. Cluster and PC analyses
   showed a clear separation into four groups of trees. Autocorrelation and
   mean sensitivity showed significant differences between the two size
   classes. PCA recognised four representative principal components where
   PC1 represented the tree-ring-climate variability common to both species
   and sizes, whereas PC2, PC3 and PC4 represented a species-specific and
   size-dependent response of trees to climate. The differences between the
   two size classes were greater than those between the two species. The
   results suggest that future tree-ring studies should include trees
   stratified by size. Only this would make it possible to produce unbiased
   predictions on the consequences of climate change and to devise suitable
   mitigation strategies for preserving Mediterranean forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Modelling the morphological response of the Oka estuary (SE Bay of
   Biscay) to climate change},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {279},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Adaptation in and around estuaries, to ensure the future resilience of
   both the natural environment and the communities that are located
   alongside is an increasingly pressing need. As part of an adaptation
   planning program for the Basque estuaries (northern Spain, south-eastern
   Bay of Biscay), a modelling system to simulate the morphological
   response of the Oka estuary to climate change has been developed.
   Existing knowledge was used as the basis to frame this pilot modelling
   examining both the short-term change (storm, seasonal, annual) and the
   longer-term changes (decades to eons). In this paper, we focus on the
   long-term response and consid-eration of the output from the process
   model is limited to the data that was extracted to help parameterize the
   long-term model. The latter was then used to examine the response of the
   estuary to the past changes over a historical time scale, where
   observations from foraminiferal analysis and saltmarsh response were
   used to establish the predictive validity of the model.Forcing the model
   with a linear rate of sea level rise representative of the 20th century,
   the estuary keeps pace with sea level rise in agreement with the
   observations. An 18.6-year periodic variability was identified over the
   saltmarshes, by including the effect of the nodal tide, with the last
   deposition maximum occurring in 2020.The effect of the opening of a
   saltmarsh that was drained at the beginning of the 18th century was
   investigated using a simplified schematization and showed sedimentation
   rates of up to one order of magnitude larger than in natural marsh, in
   general agreement with the rates obtained in previous studies.To predict
   the future response of the estuary, simulations with an exponential sea
   level rise were performed using scenarios obtained from the latest IPCC
   projections. The estuary fails to keep pace with sea level rise in any
   of the scenarios considered. The attendant increase in the hydroperiod
   over the saltmarshes is also likely impact to saltmarsh species
   productivity and distribution.Despite the simplifications inherent to
   the model, and the simplifications made in the representation of the
   estuary and forcing conditions, the methods presented here provide
   additional insights into long-term behaviour that complement information
   obtained from more detailed, but short-term, process models. The
   combined modelling approach allows adaptation measures to climate change
   to be considered over longer timescales.},

Title = {Streams in an uninhabited watershed have predictably different thermal
   sensitivities to variable summer air temperatures},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {63},
Number = {7},
Pages = {676-686},

Abstract = {Warming temperatures from climate change are altering the distributions
   and abundances of many species. Aquatic organisms, however, may be
   buffered from the immediate impacts of air temperature change due to the
   thermal inertia of water. The extent of this buffering in freshwater
   ecosystems will determine the fate and possible management strategies
   for many ecologically and economically important species. Using 11years
   of air and stream temperature data collected from an uninhabited New
   Hampshire watershed, we investigated the relationship between air and
   water temperature change throughout the summer months. Maximum daily
   stream temperatures during the summer months are known to influence the
   distribution and phenology of aquatic organisms. As such, we built a
   predictive model of maximum daily stream temperature as a function of
   air temperature change, discharge and stream order. Diurnal changes in
   stream temperatures and changes in stream temperature through the summer
   consistently lagged changes in air temperature, and deviations in daily
   air temperatures from seasonally predicted means were a strong driver of
   water temperatures. A mean increase in residual air temperature over the
   past 5days of 1.0 degrees C corresponded to a 0.5-0.8 degrees C increase
   in maximum daily stream temperature. Smaller, headwater streams were
   colder and less sensitive to changes in air temperature. Although stream
   temperatures did not increase as much as air temperatures, our results
   suggest that even small increases in water temperatures will extend the
   duration of physiologically stressful conditions for biota in this
   watershed. Thus, preserving thermal heterogeneity and unrestricted
   access to thermal refuges may be key for species' persistence. We
   encourage continued use of monitoring data to document within-stream and
   within-watershed thermal heterogeneity and to generate stream
   temperature models. These tools will be key for developing management
   strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on streams and
   their biota.},

Abstract = {Changes in the position of the low salinity zone, a habitat suitability
   index, turbidity, and water temperature modeled from four 100-year
   scenarios of climate change were evaluated for possible effects on delta
   smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, which is endemic to the Sacramento-San
   Joaquin Delta. The persistence of delta smelt in much of its current
   habitat into the next century appears uncertain. By mid-century, the
   position of the low salinity zone in the fall and the habitat
   suitability index converged on values only observed during the worst
   droughts of the baseline period (1969-2000). Projected higher water
   temperatures would render waters historically inhabited by delta smelt
   near the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers largely
   uninhabitable. However, the scenarios of climate change are based on
   assumptions that require caution in the interpretation of the results.
   Projections like these provide managers with a useful tool for
   anticipating long-term challenges to managing fish populations and
   possibly adapting water management to ameliorate those challenges.},

Title = {Buying Time with Runnels: a Climate Adaptation Tool for Salt Marshes},

Volume = {45},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1491-1501},

Abstract = {A prominent form of salt marsh loss is interior conversion to open
   water, driven by sea level rise in interaction with human activity and
   other stressors. Persistent inundation drowns vegetation and contributes
   to open water conversion in salt marsh interiors. Runnels are shallow
   channels originally developed in Australia to control mosquitoes by
   draining standing water, but recently used to restore marsh vegetation
   in the USA. Documentation on runnel efficacy is not widely available;
   yet over the past 10 years dozens of coastal adaptation projects in the
   northeastern USA have incorporated runnels. To better understand the
   efficacy of runnels used for restoration, we organized a workshop of 70
   experts and stakeholders in coastal resource management. Through the
   workshop we developed a collective understanding of how runnels might be
   used to slow or reverse open water conversion, and identified unresolved
   questions. In this paper we present a synthesis of workshop discussions
   and results from a promising case study in which vegetation was restored
   at a degraded marsh within a few years of runnel construction. Despite
   case study outcomes, key questions remain on long-term runnel efficacy
   in marshes differing in elevation, tidal range, and management history.
   Runnel construction is unlikely to improve long-term marsh resilience
   alone, as it cannot address underlying causes of open water conversion.
   As a part of holistic climate planning that includes other management
   interventions, runnels may ``buy time{''} for salt marshes to respond to
   management action, or adapt to sea level rise.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lake evaporation plays an important role in the water budget of lakes.
   Predicting lake evaporation responses to climate change is thus of
   paramount importance for the planning of mitigation and adaption
   strategies. However, most studies that have simulated climate change
   impacts on lake evaporation have typically utilised a single mechanistic
   model. Whilst such studies have merit, projected changes in lake
   evaporation from any single lake model can be considered uncertain. To
   better understand evaporation responses to climate change, a multi-model
   approach (i.e., where a range of projections are considered), is
   desirable. In this study, we present such multi-model analysis, where
   five lake models forced by four different climate model projections are
   used to simu-late historic and future change (1901-2099) in lake
   evaporation. Our investigation, which focuses on sub-tropical Lake
   Kinneret (Israel), suggested considerable differences in simulated
   evaporation rates among the models, with the annual average evaporation
   rates varying between 1232 mm year(-1) and 2608 mm year(-1) during the
   historic period (1901-2005). We explored these differences by comparing
   the models with reference evaporation rates estimated using in-situ data
   (2000-2005) and a bulk aerodynamic algorithm. We found that the model
   ensemble generally captured the intra-annual variability in reference
   evaporation rates, and compared well at seasonal timescales (RMSEc =
   0.19, R = 0.92). Using the model ensemble, we then projected future
   change in evaporation rates under three different Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5. Our
   projections indicated that, by the end of the 21st century (2070-2099),
   annual average evaporation rates would increase in Lake Kinneret by 9-22
   \% under RCPs 2.6-8.5. When compared with pro-jected regional declines
   in precipitation, our projections suggested that the water balance of
   Lake Kinneret could experience a deficit of 14-40 \% this century. We
   anticipate this substantial projected deficit combined with a
   considerable growth in population expected for this region could have
   considerable negative impacts on water availability and would
   consequently increase regional water stress.},

Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Policymakers have to assess and optimize neighborhood-scale planning
   aspects to profit from climate mitigation and adaptation measures due to
   various thermal environmental concerns. There are many models to
   evaluate the local thermal environment, but their outputs or complexity
   limit their application in performance-oriented neighborhood planning.
   In this study, the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) was updated to meet the
   needs of neighborhood planners. The model improves the radiation,
   vegetation, and convective heat transfer calculation processes to better
   match the actual physical representation of the neighborhood. Besides,
   the functions of the model are extended to calculate the mean radiant
   temperature (MRT) and water temperature for the evaluation of outdoor
   human thermal comfort and blue infrastructure effects. A new graphical
   interface also makes it easier for planning decision-makers to start
   quickly. Then, the prediction results of the updated model are evaluated
   with the neighborhood observations of the hot and humid regions of
   Guangzhou and Nanning. The air temperature, relative humidity (RH), and
   MRT results revealed that this novel model performs quite consistently
   and demonstrated the reliability and computational efficiency of the UWG
   model. In the early stages of thermal environment evaluation, the UWG
   model can be used for performance-oriented neighborhood planning.},

Abstract = {Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a halophile that is the predominant cause of
   bacterial seafood-related gastroenteritis worldwide. To survive in the
   marine environment, V. parahaemolyticus must have adaptive strategies to
   cope with salinity changes. Six putative compatible solute (CS)
   transport systems were previously predicted from the genome sequence of
   V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633. In this study, we determined the role
   of the four putative betaine-carnitine-choline transporter (BCCT)
   homologues VP1456, VP1723, VP1905, and VPA0356 in the NaCl stress
   response. Expression analysis of the four BCCTs subjected to NaCl
   upshock showed that VP1456, VP1905, and VPA0356, but not VP1723, were
   induced. We constructed in-frame single-deletion mutant strains for all
   four BCCTs, all of which behaved similarly to the wild-type strain,
   demonstrating a redundancy of the systems. Growth analysis of a
   quadruple mutant and four BCCT triple mutants demonstrated the
   requirement for at least one BCCT for efficient CS uptake. We
   complemented Escherichia coli MHK13, a CS synthesis- and
   transporter-negative strain, with each BCCT and examined CS uptake by
   growth analysis and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
   analyses. These data demonstrated that VP1456 had the most diverse
   substrate transport ability, taking up glycine betaine (GB), proline,
   choline, and ectoine. VP1456 was the sole ectoine transporter. In
   addition, the data demonstrated that VP1723 can transport GB, proline,
   and choline, whereas VP1905 and VPA0356 transported only GB. Overall,
   the data showed that the BCCTs are functional and that there is
   redundancy among them.},

Abstract = {With the majority of the global human population living in coastal
   regions, correctly characterizing the climate risk that ocean-dependent
   communities and businesses are exposed to is key to prioritizing the
   finite resources available to support adaptation. We apply a climate
   risk analysis across the European fisheries sector to identify the most
   at-risk fishing fleets and coastal regions and then link the two
   analyses together. We employ an approach combining biological traits
   with physiological metrics to differentiate climate hazards between 556
   populations of fish and use these to assess the relative climate risk
   for 380 fishing fleets and 105 coastal regions in Europe. Countries in
   southeast Europe as well as the United Kingdom have the highest risks to
   both fishing fleets and coastal regions overall, while in other
   countries, the risk-profile is greater at either the fleet level or at
   the regional level. European fisheries face a diversity of challenges
   posed by climate change; climate adaptation, therefore, needs to be
   tailored to each country, region, and fleet's specific situation. Our
   analysis supports this process by highlighting where and what adaptation
   measures might be needed and informing where policy and business
   responses could have the greatest impact.},

Abstract = {Global sea-level rise (SLR) is among the most alarming aspects of
   anthropogenic climate change. The human impacts of SLR are experienced
   unequally between and within municipalities. Existing research has
   identified social variables that predict municipal adoption of adaptive
   SLR policy, but this work does not account for the locally specific
   social factors that shape particular policies to fit particular cases.
   This study describes social conceptions of the ocean and SLR policy for
   two coastal cities in western Washington: Aberdeen and Bainbridge
   Island. Examining conceptions of marine spaces provides insight into the
   complex process by which local physical and socio-demographic
   characteristics shape local policy. The study uses a grounded
   theoretical approach to content analyses, resulting in localized
   typologies of marine spaces as well as SLR policy profiles for each
   case. Results indicate that municipalities vary by both social
   conception of the ocean and SLR policy form. These findings elaborate
   upon the relationship between socioeconomic conditions and municipal
   climate change policy adoption, suggesting that in local media and
   policy discourse, the absence of relevant resources is related to
   adversarial conceptions of local marine spaces, while abundance of
   relevant resources is associated with a conception of marine spaces as
   natural resources.},

Title = {Applying collective impact in Aboriginal health services and research:
   three case studies tell an important story},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH \& PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Co-design is the latest buzzword in healthcare services and
   research and is ubiquitous in Australian funding grants and policy
   documents. There are no standards for what constitutes co-design and it
   is often confused with less collaborative processes such as
   consultation. Collective impact is a co-design tool used for complex and
   entrenched problems. It uses a systematic approach and requires power
   and resource sharing. We applied collective impact to three research
   projects with Aboriginal communities. This paper explores how collective
   impact can enhance participation and outcomes in healthcare services and
   research.Methods: We evaluated the collective impact process and
   outcomes in three translational health research projects with Aboriginal
   people and communities using a case study approach. We adapted the model
   using an iterative co -design approach.Results: We adapted the
   collective impact model in three ways: 1) replaced the precondition of
   `problems that are urgent' with `problems that are complex and
   entrenched'; 2) added to the `common agenda' the requirement to
   establish a planned exit and long-term sustainability strategy from the
   outset; and 3) added the delivery of a public policy outcome as a result
   of the collective impact process.Conclusions: Aboriginal and Torres
   Strait Islander health is an important public policy priority that
   requires new and different approaches to service delivery and research.
   This study adapted the collective impact approach and developed the
   Rambaldini model through three translational health research case
   studies and found that a modified collective impact approach is an
   effective tool for engagement and outcomes.},

Abstract = {The hydropower production, water supply and aquaculture services of the
   Itaparica Reservoir are of immense importance for the Brazilian
   Northeast. Uncontrolled water resources consumption (e.g. irrigation,
   water supply), climate and land use change effects deteriorated the
   water quantity and quality in the reservoir, leading to socio-economic
   and environmental problems. In this work, a depth-averaged shallow water
   model was set up for the Ico-Mandantes Bay, one major branch of the
   reservoir, using the open TELEMAC-MASCARET system. The aim was to assess
   the impacts of the newly built water diversion channel, as well as the
   effects of a flood and tracer transport from an intermittent tributary,
   both located in the bay. An alternative approach to estimate the water
   retention times was additionally implemented. The simulations showed
   that though the diversion channel did not significantly influence the
   hydrodynamics of the bay, it is necessary to continuously monitor water
   quality parameters in the withdrawal, especially during rainy periods
   after droughts, because of the nutrient inputs from the tributary and
   the overflows of the nearby drainage systems. Management measures
   adapting to the continuously changing natural conditions and
   anthropogenic impacts are thus indispensable and the model presented can
   be a valuable supporting tool for this purpose.},

Abstract = {Liquid CO2 sequestration in a bathymetric depression at depths greater
   than 3700 m in the ocean has been proposed as a mitigation strategy for
   the reduction of atmospheric CO2 emissions. Kinetic studies on the
   dissolution of CO2 from the liquid CO2 pool, the diffusion in the ocean,
   and advection of CO2 by the bottom ocean current are carried out. A thin
   membrane of CO2 hydrate on the liquid CO2 pool controls the CO2
   dissolution into the overlaying seawater, the thickness of a static
   layer between the surface of liquid CO2 and the upper bottom ocean
   current reduces the CO2 diffusion, and the bottom ocean current dilutes
   the CO2 concentration. These effects are explicitly formulated in an
   equation, and it is predicted that ocean CO2 sequestration at a depth
   larger than 3700 m will greatly reduce the pH change caused by CO2
   dispersion in the ocean. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with how Strategic Environmental Assessment
   (SEA) practice handles climate change uncertainties within the Danish
   planning system. First, a hypothetical model is set up for how
   uncertainty is handled and not handled in decision-making. The model
   incorporates the strategies `reduction' and `resilience', `denying',
   `ignoring' and `postponing'. Second, 151 Danish SEAs are analysed with a
   focus on the extent to which climate change uncertainties are
   acknowledged and presented, and the empirical findings are discussed in
   relation to the model. The findings indicate that despite incentives to
   do so, climate change uncertainties were systematically avoided or
   downplayed in all but 5 of the 151 SEAS that were reviewed. Finally, two
   possible explanatory mechanisms are proposed to explain this: conflict
   avoidance and a need to quantify uncertainty. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {Vulnerability assessment frameworks are used in many countries to
   provide a primary assessment status of marine fish stocks and their
   susceptibility to change in response to external factors. With
   increasing evidence that the marine fisheries of India are likely to
   face major impacts of changing climate along with other natural and
   anthropogenic factors, a study was carried out to determine the relative
   vulnerability of 68 species of finfish and shellfish along the Indian
   coast. Species selection was based on their abundance and importance in
   the fishery across 4 zones in the country (northeast, northwest,
   southeast and southwest) and on biological characteristics like growth,
   reproduction and predator-prey interactions. Vulnerability assessment
   was based on the relation between exposure, sensitivity and adaptability
   attributes, expressed as V = (E + S) - A. The exposure attributes
   selected were environmental parameters that have a direct impact on the
   fish stocks. Sensitivity attributes were biological characteristics that
   are indicative of the ability or inability of the species to respond to
   external pressures. Adaptive capacity attributes were biological and
   ecological traits that could help the species to adapt to a fluctuating
   or changing environment. About 69\% of the species studied are highly
   vulnerable along the Indian coast, with their susceptibility being
   higher along the east coast. Fishing pressure contributes significantly
   to stock fluctuations and reproductive output. Species with restricted
   geographic distribution are especially vulnerable to climate change. The
   outcome of this study will serve as an effective tool in prioritizing
   mitigation and fishery management strategies on a regional basis in the
   country.},

Abstract = {Recent assessment reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
   Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) have highlighted the risks
   to humanity arising from the unsustainable use of natural resources.
   Thus far, land, freshwater, and ocean exploitation have been the chief
   causes of biodiversity loss. Climate change is projected to be a rapidly
   increasing additional driver for biodiversity loss. Since climate change
   and biodiversity loss impact human societies everywhere, bold solutions
   are required that integrate environmental and societal objectives. As
   yet, most existing international biodiversity targets have overlooked
   climate change impacts. At the same time, climate change mitigation
   measures themselves may harm biodiversity directly. The Convention on
   Biological Diversity's post-2020 framework offers the important
   opportunity to address the interactions between climate change and
   biodiversity and revise biodiversity targets accordingly by better
   aligning these with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
   Change Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. We
   identify the considerable number of existing and proposed post 2020
   biodiversity targets that risk being severely compromised due to climate
   change, even if other barriers to their achievement were removed. Our
   analysis suggests that the next set of biodiversity targets explicitly
   addresses climate change-related risks since many aspirational goals
   will not be feasible under even lower-end projections of future warming.
   Adopting more flexible and dynamic approaches to conservation, rather
   than static goals, would allow us to respond flexibly to changes in
   habitats, genetic resources, species composition, and ecosystem
   functioning and leverage biodiversity's capacity to contribute to
   climate change mitigation and adaptation.},

Title = {Incorporating fishers' evaluation of adaptive capacity in policy making
   in Thailand},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {254},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Small-scale fishers around the world are facing many challenges in
   sustaining viable livelihoods due to diverse factors such as declining
   fisheries resources, degradation of coastal habitats, and climate change
   impact, among others. How fishers respond to change depends in part on
   their evaluations of adaptive capacity, and an understanding of factors
   underlying their evaluations can be helpful in guiding policies and
   programs to reduce vulnerability and build resilience. The paper
   presents a study of twelve small-scale fishing communities in eastern
   Thailand, which illustrates the multiplicity of factors influencing
   attitudes, beliefs, values and cognitive biases (ABVCs) concerning
   adaptive capacity. First, the ABVCs of small-scale fishers toward
   adaptation to changes and the reduction of fishery resources were
   elicited using a structured survey. Next, principle component analysis
   was performed on the survey results of 266 respondents, which revealed
   that the ABVCs concerning adaptive capacity are related to three main
   components: ability to change occupation (Options component), ability to
   compete (Ability component), and ability to plan for changes (Plan
   component). The final step identified factors influencing the adaptive
   capacity components with the use of regression analysis. Specifically,
   the ability to change work is positively related to level of education,
   and negatively associated with age and high dependency on fishing
   income. Satisfaction with income and with individual well-being
   determine the ability to compete. The ability to plan for changes, on
   the other hand, is influenced by evaluated level of closeness to nature,
   the factor that is expected to be associated with conservation behavior.
   The findings can aid in designing policies and interventions that align
   with the adaptive capacity of fishers; hence, enhancing viability and
   contributing to increasing resilience of small-scale fishing
   communities.},

   international database of global climate model projections used for
   assessment of climate change impacts as defined by the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
   The statistical linkage at the core of the SDM is based on the idea of
   daily meteorological analogues where optimal matching synoptic weather
   patterns are searched for in a historical database. The historical
   database employed here is made up of reanalyses of atmospheric
   circulation as observations for the large-scale predictors, and the
   Bureau of Meteorology's high quality in-situ observations consisting of
   a sparse network of about 100 to 200 stations across the continent. A
   combination of daily atmospheric variables are used for regional and
   seasonal optimization of the SDM (e. g. mean sea level pressure combined
   with an upper air moisture variable to predict rainfall or an upper
   level measure of temperature and air flow to predict surface
   temperatures) resulting in a total of 120 individual statistical models
   that describe a wide variety of Australian climates spanning from the
   tropical monsoon in the north to cool and temperate in the south. The
   120 models are a product of:
   Regionalisation of the Australian continent into 10 climate zones where
   a different statistical model is optimized for each region;
   Meteorological analogues are chosen from within the same calendar
   season, thus 4 different models are optimized for each calendar season;
   and
   Analogues are searched separately for the three surface predictands
   (Rainfall, T-max and T-min).
   While the optimization and original application of the SDM was based on
   in-situ data, here we present the application of the technique to the
   latest surface gridded observations produced by the Bureau of
   Meteorology as part of the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP).
   In this communication, we present and discuss the evaluation of the
   results using the gridded observations, including:
   The ability of the technique to reproduce the mean and variance of the
   observed local series;
   The ability of the technique to reproduce day-to-day variability,
   inter-annual variability and long-term trends; and
   The ability of the technique, despite being based on a univariate
   approach, to reproduce the observed relationships amongst individual
   predictands (rainfall and temperature).
   Following this, each of the individual SDMs are applied to climate
   scenarios described by a suite of global climate models. The flexibility
   and low cost of the SDM makes for easy application to the large number
   of existing climate simulations, and to sample the uncertainties
   attached to the plausible future emission trajectories as well as the
   possible response of the climate system as modelled by the current
   climate models. In this regard, the SDM represents an essential
   ingredient for assessing future climate change uncertainties at a scale
   relevant for local climate impact studies. It has been noted in recent
   applications of downscaled climate projections presented here, that
   researchers can produce detailed climate change impact studies allowing
   for the development of well informed climate change adaptation policies.},

Title = {Generational retreat: locally driven adaption to coastal hazard risk in
   two Indigenous communities in Fiji},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The relocation and retreat of low-lying coastal communities are expected
   to increase in anticipation of, and response to, sea-level rise and
   subsequent coastal hazard risks. As such, there is burgeoning attention
   in research and policy surrounding relocation that is managed and
   supported through external sources. Yet there exists limited research
   into the ways Indigenous communities are autonomously retreating from
   emerging coastal hazard risk, despite long histories of mobility and
   inherent adaptive capacities. We contribute to this gap through
   qualitative data derived from two low-lying coastal iTaukei (Indigenous
   Fijian) communities that are exposed to coastal erosion, storm surges,
   and flooding events, alongside other socioeconomic pressures. We explore
   the approach of ``generational retreat{''} which is emerging as a
   long-term relocation strategy employed by village residents.
   Generational retreat is a form of mobility whereby households, namely,
   younger generations, incrementally retreat in response to existing,
   emerging, and anticipated coastal changes while maintaining connections
   to place and village life. We show how communities are drawing on local
   processes and resources to direct autonomous adaptation pathways which
   are suited to local sociopolitical, cultural, and environmental
   contexts. We further explore opportunities for governments and external
   actors in supporting these locally conceived and driven forms of retreat
   as an adaptive and sustainable response to coastal change.},

Title = {Laboratory-simulated investigation on thermal behaviours of permeable
   concrete pavements},
Journal = {ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {97-108},
Abstract = {Impermeable pavements are recognised as one of the biggest contributors
   to the urban heat island effect, because they not only increase local
   temperatures through additional heat storage in the paving materials,
   but also reduce evaporative cooling on the ground surfaces. Therefore,
   permeable pavements are considered an effective solution for mitigating
   the thermal discomforts in hot climates. In this study, the thermal
   behaviours and performances of permeable concrete pavement were
   investigated with a series of simulation experiments in the laboratory.
   For comparison purposes, traditional Portland cement concrete (PCC) and
   Portland cement porous concrete (PCPC), which are commonly used in
   municipal pavements, were considered for the study. The thermal
   properties of those materials and their thermal impacts on the
   surroundings were discussed with specially designed tests. It is
   verified that the laboratory simulation tests and corresponding analysis
   methods proposed in the study could be utilised to characterise the
   thermal behaviours of pavement materials effectively. The testing
   results showed that the surface temperature of PCPC was higher than that
   of PCC under the same thermal conditions, which indicates that permeable
   concrete pavements usually absorb more heat from solar radiations and
   present higher surface temperatures than those of traditional concrete
   pavements. Due to the relatively higher density, thermal conductivity,
   and specific heat capacity, the PCC specimen stored more thermal energy
   in the material during the temperature-rise period and dissipated more
   heat back to the ambient environments during the temperature-fall
   period, which is considered one of the negative contributions of PCC
   pavements to the thermal environments of residential districts. In
   addition, under windy conditions, the differences between impermeable
   and permeable concrete were more significant. Compared to the PCC, the
   surface temperatures of PCPC increased more slowly and decreased faster
   under windy conditions, and the higher the speed of wind, the more
   apparent differences could be observed. This indicates that thermal
   evaporation of permeable pavements is the main function in abating their
   thermal impacts on environments.},

Abstract = {Soft robotics is a growing field of research and one of its challenges
   is how to efficiently design a controller for a soft morphology. This
   paper presents a marine soft robot inspired by the ghost knifefish that
   swims on the water surface by using an undulating fin underneath its
   body. We investigate how propagating wave functions can be evolved and
   how these affect the swimming performance of the robot. The fin and body
   of the robot are constructed from silicone and six wooden fin rays
   actuated by servo motors. In order to bypass the reality gap, which
   would necessitate a complex simulation of the fish, we implemented a
   Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) directly on the
   physical robot to optimize its controller for travel speed. Our results
   show that evolving a simple sine wave or a Fourier series can generate
   controllers that outperform a hand programmed controller. The results
   additionally demonstrate that the best evolved controllers share
   similarities with the undulation patterns of actual knifefish. Based on
   these results we suggest that evolution on physical robots is promising
   for future application in optimizing behaviors of soft robots.},

Abstract = {Distributed energy resources (DERs) can be utilized as alternative power
   sources for fast service recovery in cases of distribution system
   outages. However, the diverse characteristics and stochastic nature of
   DERs impose challenges on the optimal operation of diverse resources
   during the restoration phase. In this article, we introduce a
   hierarchical structure to coordinate distribution system entities and
   propose an adaptive restoration strategy to sustain a reliable power
   supply to outage loads in an unbalanced distribution system utilizing
   DERs. An efficient system reconfiguration model is developed to
   guarantee the radiality of restoration islands. The flexibility of DERs
   is evaluated by a novel method that focuses on the cumulative energy
   consumption, the superiority of which is also proven. Model predictive
   control (MPC) is adopted to enable the adjustment of system topology and
   DER operation strategies based on up-to-date data. The performance of
   the proposed restoration model is validated on a modified IEEE 123-bus
   test system. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed novel
   flexibility assessment and the MPC-based adaptive restoration strategy
   are verified through comparative studies.},

Title = {Chilling accumulation in fruit trees in Spain under climate change},

Abstract = {Growing trees are quite vulnerable to cold temperatures. To minimise the
   effect of these cold temperatures, they stop their growth over the
   coldest months of the year, a state called dormancy. In particular,
   endodormancy requires accumulating chilling temperatures to finish this
   sort of dormancy. The accumulation of cool temperatures according to
   specific rules is called chilling accumulation, and each tree species
   and variety has specific chilling requirements for correct plant
   development. Under global warming, it is expected that the fulfilment of
   the chilling requirements to break dormancy in fruit trees could be
   compromised. In this study, the impact of climate change on the chilling
   accumulation over peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands was
   assessed. For this purpose, bias-adjusted results of 10 regional climate
   models (RCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and
   8.5 were used as inputs of four different models for calculating
   chilling accumulation, and the results for each model were individually
   compared for the 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 future periods under both RCPs.
   These results project a generalised reduction in chilling accumulation
   regardless of the RCP, future period or chilling calculation model used,
   with higher reductions for the 2071-2100 period and the RCP8.5 scenario.
   The projected winter chill decrease may threaten the viability of some
   tree crops and varieties in some areas where the crop is currently
   grown, but also shows scope for varieties with lower chilling
   requirements. The results are relevant for planning future tree
   plantations under climate change, supporting adaptation of spatial
   distribution of tree crops and varieties in Spain.},

Title = {Lost Material Stock in Buildings due to Sea Level Rise from Global
   Warming: The Case of Fiji Islands},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study developed a methodology to estimate the amount of
   construction material in coastal buildings which are lost due to climate
   change-induced sea level rise. The Republic of Fiji was chosen as a case
   study; sea level rise is based on predictions by the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change for the years 2050 and 2100. This study combines
   the concept of a geographic information system based digital inundation
   analysis with the concept of a material stock analysis. The findings
   show that about 4.5\% of all existing buildings on Fiji will be
   inundated by 2050 because of an expected global sea level rise of 0.22 m
   (scenario 1) and 6.2\% by 2100 for a sea level rise of 0.63 m (scenario
   2). The number of buildings inundated by 2050 is equivalent to 40\% of
   the average number of new constructed buildings in Fiji Islands in a
   single year. Overall, the amount of materials present in buildings which
   will be inundated by 2050 is 900,000 metric tons (815,650 metric tons of
   concrete, 52,100 metric tons of timber, and 31,680 metric tons of
   steel). By 2100, this amount is expected to grow to 1,151,000 metric
   tons (1,130,160 metric tons of concrete, 69,760 metric tons of timber,
   and 51,320 metric tons of steel). The results shall contribute in
   enhancing urban planning, climate change adaptation strategies, and the
   estimation of future demolition flows in small island developing states.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities are some of the most at-risk populations with
   respect to climate change impacts. It is therefore important to
   determine the vulnerability of such communities to co-develop viable
   adaptation options. Global efforts to address this issue include
   international scientific projects, such as Global Learning for Local
   Solutions (GULLS), which focuses on five fast warming regions of the
   southern hemisphere and aims to provide an understanding of the local
   scale processes influencing community vulnerability that can then be
   up-scaled to regional, country and global levels. This paper describes
   the development of a new social and ecological vulnerability framework
   which integrates exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity with the
   social livelihoods and food security approaches. It also measures
   community flexibility to understand better the adaptive capacity of
   different levels of community organization. The translation of the
   conceptual framework to an implementable method is described and its
   application in a number of ``hotspot{''} countries, where ocean waters
   are warming faster than the rest of the world, is presented.
   Opportunities for cross-cultural comparisons to uncover similarities and
   differences in vulnerability and adaptation patterns among the study's
   coastal communities, which can provide accelerated learning mechanisms
   to other coastal regions, are highlighted. The social and ecological
   framework and the associated survey approach allow for future
   integration of local-level vulnerability data with ecological and
   oceanographic models.},

Title = {A Framework for Assessing Climate Adaptation Governance on the Caribbean
   Island of Curacao},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that Caribbean islands are very
   vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as sea level rise,
   longer periods of droughts, loss of biodiversity, more extreme weather
   events (flooding and hurricanes), and increased freshwater demands.
   Addressing these issues encourages good climate change adaptation
   governance. So far, however, the literature has not discussed what good
   governance could mean in this context. The aim of this paper is,
   therefore, to address this knowledge gap by developing an assessment
   framework and showing its usefulness. The framework is based on a review
   of the literature and is applied in an assessment of adaptation
   practices in Curacao. The assessment is based on a review of Curacao
   policy documents and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. We found
   that the developed framework was useful for obtaining a better insight
   into the quality of adaptation governance on Caribbean islands, and that
   in the Curacao practices, the good governance principles of transparency
   and inclusiveness are better elaborated in comparison to connectivity,
   accountability and government effectiveness. We conclude the paper with
   some reflections on the potential of the framework and some suggestions
   for further research.},

Title = {Observations and Analysis of the Horizontal Structure of a Tidal Jet at

Abstract = {Scour in the vicinity of a hydraulic structure may compromise its
   geotechnical stability or that of nearby structures. Much fundamental
   research has been dedicated to the understanding and prediction of these
   processes, in order to enable the efficient design of mitigation
   measures. While most of these efforts consider laterally uniform flows,
   nonuniformity is the rule rather than the exception. This study presents
   field observations near the storm surge barrier in the Eastern Scheldt
   estuary, The Netherlands, where significant scour holes have developed.
   The tidal flow through this semi-open barrier exhibits characteristics
   of a shallow jet. A pronounced contraction of this jet toward the nearby
   scour hole during particular stages of the tidal cycle is revealed,
   attributed to potential vorticity conservation; the depth-averaged
   vertical vorticity increases proportionally to the depth increase.
   Measurements show a vertically uniform velocity profile in the scour
   hole that is attributed to a reduction of the adverse pressure gradient
   due to the contraction, that suppresses boundary layer separation from
   the upstream slope of the scour hole. A positive feedback mechanism is
   thus revealed; lateral velocity gradients lead to relatively high
   near-bed velocities in the scour hole which enhances erosioncausing an
   even stronger horizontal contractionmaintaining the scouring potential.
   If the upstream flow field is laterally uniform (observed around slack
   tide), horizontal contraction does not occur, and the boundary layer
   separates from the upstream slope. The scour depth will then tend to an
   equilibrium. The results infer the importance of the nonuniformity of
   the horizontal flow field.
   Plain Language Summary Large-scale erosion of an alluvial bed in the
   vicinity of hydraulic structures (scour) is a common problem, with
   potentially large consequences: the geotechnical stability of the
   structure may get compromised. A detailed understanding of the
   interaction between the hydrodynamics (flow) and the morphodynamics
   (response of the sandy bed) is crucial to accurately predict the scour
   process and subsequent mitigation strategies. In this study, we show
   that under certain conditions, the scour process may be self-amplifying.
   For a flow with large horizontal velocity differences, the scour hole
   may sustain (or increase) these velocity differences, leading to a
   concentrated flow in the deepest part of the scour hole. As a result,
   the scour potential remains high, whereas it would be expected that the
   scour potential decreases proportionally to the increase in scour depth.
   A good understanding of these conditions may help in assessing the
   vulnerability of hydraulic structures located in waterways like rivers,
   tidal channels, or estuaries and determine optimal strategies to
   mitigate potential risks from scour hole formation.},

Title = {Comparative ribosome profiling reveals distinct translational landscapes
   of salt-sensitive and -tolerant rice},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Background Soil salinization represents a serious threat to global rice
   production. Although significant research has been conducted to
   understand salt stress at the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic
   levels, few studies have focused on the translatomic responses to this
   stress. Recent studies have suggested that transcriptional and
   translational responses to salt stress can often operate independently.
   Results We sequenced RNA and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) from
   the salt-sensitive rice (O. sativa L.) cultivar `Nipponbare' (NB) and
   the salt-tolerant cultivar `Sea Rice 86' (SR86) under normal and salt
   stress conditions. A large discordance between salt-induced
   transcriptomic and translatomic alterations was found in both cultivars,
   with more translationally regulated genes being observed in SR86 in
   comparison to NB. A biased ribosome occupancy, wherein RPF depth
   gradually increased from the 5 ` ends to the 3 ` ends of coding regions,
   was revealed in NB and SR86. This pattern was strengthened by salt
   stress, particularly in SR86. On the contrary, the strength of ribosome
   stalling was accelerated in salt-stressed NB but decreased in SR86.
   Conclusions This study revealed that translational reprogramming
   represents an important layer of salt stress responses in rice, and the
   salt-tolerant cultivar SR86 adopts a more flexible translationally
   adaptive strategy to cope with salt stress compared to the salt
   susceptible cultivar NB. The differences in translational dynamics
   between NB and SR86 may derive from their differing levels of ribosome
   stalling under salt stress.},

Title = {Fast Edit Propagation for 360 Degree Panoramas Using Function
   Interpolation},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {43882-43894},
Abstract = {Due to its intuitive stroke-based user interface, edit propagation has
   wide applications such as image recoloring and relighting, tone editing,
   image matting, etc. This paper presents a function interpolation method
   for efficient edit propagation on 360 degree panoramas. Given a
   panoramic image as input and user-specified strokes as edit hints, our
   approach adopts an adaptive sampling strategy based on the diversity of
   local color distribution. By selecting the most representative samples,
   this strategy can significantly reduce the number of samples. We assume
   that the projection of the input panorama is known, so that it can be
   mapped to a 3D unit sphere where the spherical distance metric can be
   defined. Then edit propagation is formulated as a radial basis function
   interpolation problem, which can be efficiently solved by using the
   non-negative linear least squares. We also utilize a multi-resolution
   strategy and a function look-up table for further acceleration.
   Experimental results show that our method can efficiently propagate
   edits on high-resolution panoramas and produce seam-free and smooth
   editing results.},

Volume = {17},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {1117-1126},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are widely recognised as being
   very vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In some manner,
   climate change will impact on the livelihoods of most individuals in the
   twenty-first century. Some of the risks for small islands are risk of
   death, injury, ill-health or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying coastal
   zones due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise. The
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that in small
   islands, which have diverse physical and human attributes,
   community-based adaptation has been shown to generate larger benefits
   when delivered in conjunction with other developmental activities. One
   of the adaptive responses suggested is to improve the efficacy of
   traditional community coping strategies; this can be facilitated by
   social work intervention at the macro-level. The role of social workers
   in SIDS can impact on sustainable development and towards improved
   livelihoods of a country's human resources. According to the Council on
   Social Work Education, the purpose of the social work profession is to
   promote human and community well-being. This purpose is put into
   practice through a quest for social and economic justice, the prevention
   of conditions that limit human rights, the elimination of poverty and
   the enhancement and quality of life for all persons. Key strategies by
   which social workers can promote sustainable development include
   building relations with communities, helping individuals to deepen their
   understanding of sustainable development, and assisting them to develop
   and work towards goals and objectives that lead towards the integration
   and improvement of economic, social and environmental outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for quasi real-time and adaptive

   This paper argues that optimal operation can be achieved by defining new

   demonstrate how utilizing accurate load models can improve ac/dc
   microgrid efficiency. To test the performance and the applicability of
   the proposed solution, a modified 33-node islanded ac/dc microgrid is
   used as a case study in the presence of various types of ac/dc

Abstract = {In May 2010, major flooding has occurred along the Kura and Araz Rivers
   in Azerbaijan. After this event, Deltares and Royal HaskoningDHV were
   asked to provide assistance in the development of measures to prevent
   future flooding. Since then, for short-term flood risk reduction
   appropriate measures have been taken, such as: dike reinforcements,
   adapted reservoir operations and the construction of a flood bypass in
   the Araz River. Moreover, urgent dredging has been executed to reduce
   the flow attack at endangered banks. However, for longer-term flood
   reduction, the excessive sedimentation in the Kura River has to be
   mitigated, as identified in earlier studies, e.g. Abbasov (2009).
   Different processes may have contributed to this sedimentation, like:
   deforestation, Caspian sea level rise, increased meandering, irrigation
   demand and reservoir management that focused on energy yield. This paper
   addresses the improved understanding of the physical system of the Kura,
   based on field visits, data collection and analysis, hydraulic and
   morphological model development (1D SOBEK and Delft3D). The relative
   importance of the different processes is also indicated. Furthermore,
   the increased knowledge base contributed to the development of urgent
   and strategic dredging plans necessary for respectively improved bank
   stability and future overall flood risk reduction. The dredging plans
   have been implemented for nearly two years now and dredging has been
   being carried out since by newly procured cutter dredgers.},

Title = {Towards integrated flood management along the lower Rhine and

   Hurricanes Katrina-Rita flood disaster},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {273-285},
Abstract = {Large lowland rivers and deltas with high concentrations of human
   activities are vulnerable to different forms of global environmental
   change and depend upon effective flood management. This study utilizes
   the approaches and experiences of the lower Mississippi (Louisiana) and
   lower Rhine Rivers (the Netherlands) to examine the development of
   integrated flood management (IFM). The development of an `integrated'
   approach to flood management informed by climate change science and
   oriented to environmental restoration is strongly present in Europe, and
   the Netherlands in particular. The epic 2005 New Orleans flood disaster
   associated with Hurricanes Katrina-Rita represented a paradigm change in
   flood management with international implications, and in particular the
   management of embanked floodplains. In contrast to the `incremental'
   evolutionary model of flood management in the Netherlands, the US and
   lower Mississippi are characterized by large `pendulum' style changes in
   flood management, alternating from federal-to local-scale dominance with
   the environmental change being a lower priority. An important
   distinction between the lower Rhine and Mississippi is the governmental
   structure of management, and particularly the role of local-scale
   entities. US flood management is more top-down than Dutch flood
   management, with Dutch water boards having more input into water
   management than US levee boards. The Dutch approach, by comparison,
   provides elasticity to develop a true `integrated' approach to flood
   management adaptable to global environmental change and suited for
   environmental management and restoration. The 2005 New Orleans and Gulf
   Coast flood disaster initiated a new era of US flood management
   characterized by the return of a robust federal presence, and stimulated
   an international exchange of ideas regarding IFM that embraces climate
   change science and environmental restoration.},

Title = {Beyond stakeholder engagement in the coastal zone: Toward a systems
   integration approach to support just transformation of the blue economy},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL},
Abstract = {Transformation has become a prevailing and desirable concept in blue
   economy literature. In parallel, researchers have been considering ways
   to effectively engage stakeholders to support just transformational
   agendas. Globally, coastal communities are already being affected by the
   inevitable impacts of climate change and changes to the blue economy.
   These pressures present complex contexts for coastal zone stakeholder
   engagement. In this paper, I argue that taking a systems integration
   approach to interacting with stakeholders is needed to support just
   transformational change. Assessing stakeholder systems and their
   relationship to coastal resources is imperative for understanding
   dynamics that may promote or hinder just transformation. Taking an
   adaptive management approach to working alongside stakeholders through
   transitional processes, thus building capacity, is needed to generate
   momentum toward just transformational change. Lastly, I explain how
   applications of the subsidiarity principle in integrating stakeholder
   systems can support a just transformational process and can inform more
   durable transformational outcomes.},

   communities are facing a wider array of different stressors that affect
   the sustainability of natural resources and the adaptive capacity of
   local residents. The ability of communities and households to adapt is
   influenced by the nature, number, and magnitude of the changes with
   which they have to contend. In this paper, we present the range of 36
   socio-economic (i.e. economic, social, governance and conflict) and
   biophysical (i.e. climate change and other environmental) stressors that
   emerged from qualitative interviews in seven coastal communities on the
   Andaman coast of Thailand. These stressors were then integrated into a
   quantitative survey of 237 households wherein participants were asked to
   rate the level of impact of these stressors on household livelihoods.
   Ratings showed that economic and some climate change stressors - extreme
   weather events and changes in rainfall patterns and seasons - were
   scored higher than other stressors. The paper also examines the
   relationships between community and various individual and household
   characteristics - such as gender, age, livelihoods, levels of social
   capital, and socio-economic status - and the perceived level of impacts
   of various stressors on household livelihoods. Overall, community and
   livelihoods had the most differentiated impacts on perceptions of
   stressors but few other prominent patterns emerged. In conclusion, this
   paper discusses the implications of the results for current climate
   change vulnerability and adaptation policy and practice in Thailand and
   elsewhere.},

Title = {Coastal vulnerability to climate change in China's Bohai Economic Rim},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change and human activities exert a wide range of stressors on
   urban coastal areas. Synthetical assessment of coastal vulnerability is
   crucial for effective interventions and long-term planning. However,
   there have been few studies based on integrative analyses of ecological
   and physical characteristics and socioeconomic conditions in urban
   coastal areas. This study developed a holistic framework for assessing
   coastal vulnerability from three dimensions biophysical exposure,
   sensitivity and adaptive capacity - and applied it to the coast of Bohai
   Economic Rim, an extensive and important development zone in China. A
   composite vulnerability index (CVI) was developed for every 1 km(2)
   segment of the total 5627 km coastline and the areas that most prone to
   coastal hazards were identified by mapping the distribution patterns of
   the CVIs in the present and under future climate change scenarios. The
   CVIs show a spatial heterogeneity, with higher values concentrated along
   the southwestern and northeastern coasts and lower values concentrated
   along the southern coasts. Currently, 20\% of the coastlines with
   approximately 350,000 people are highly vulnerable to coastal hazards.
   With sea-level rises under the future scenarios of the year 2100, more
   coastlines will be highly vulnerable, and the amount of highly
   threatened population was estimated to increase by 13-24\%. Among the
   coastal cities, Dongying was categorized as having the highest
   vulnerability, mainly due to poor transportation and medical services
   and low GDP per capita, which contribute to low adaptive capacity. Our
   results can benefit decision-makers by highlighting prioritized areas
   and identifying the most important determinants of priority,
   facilitating location-specific interventions for climate-change
   adaptation and sustainable coastal management.},

Abstract = {As climate change accelerates the dynamism of natural processes, its
   impacts are likely to be most keenly felt in the coastal zone where
   littoral communities may face an increasing risk of both erosion and
   flooding. As a response to climate change the primary mechanism on a
   geopolitical scale has been one of mitigation, as an attempt to reduce
   the anthropogenic causes at its root. However, perceived limitations of
   this approach led Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change (UNFCC) to agree in Bali, 2007 that the alternative
   approach of adaptation should play a significantly greater role in the
   future global response, and this is now embedded as one of the post 2012
   pillars.
   There is evidence of adaptation already taking place but this is
   currently piecemeal in nature, with research showing distinct challenges
   and barriers to its introduction. Nevertheless, enhanced vulnerability
   facing coastal communities requires novel solutions to enable its
   implementation, thus allowing for a more strategic approach to ensure
   that timely and effective measures are taken, and to ensure coherence
   across different sectors and levels of governance.
   The research presented in this paper is concerned with exploring the
   capacity of coastal areas to adapt to change in terms of policy, spatial
   planning and development options, and is geographically focussed on the
   Solent. This estuarine complex is an area of coast likely to be
   particularly vulnerable to coastal change since it is densely populated,
   low-lying and highly contested by a range of competing interests. It is
   also likely to include specific areas defined as Coastal Change
   Management Areas (CCMAs) that will not be protected by any new measures;
   hence requiring communities to adapt.
   The paper will outline an EU Interreg IVa - 2 seas funded project
   entitled `Coastal Communities 2150 and Beyond' (CC2150), and in
   particular its application in the Solent. On the basis of vulnerability
   and coastal risk, this project is aimed at informing communities of
   predicted climate change impacts in order that they might be empowered
   to find proactive responses to the problem of coastal change. Central to
   this is the need to communicate science and build capacity within
   coastal areas, so as to enable effective planning, the conclusions of
   which are horizontally transferrable to other vulnerable areas of the UK
   coast and beyond.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bayesian belief networks are finding increasing application in adaptive
   ecosystem management where data are limited and uncertainty is high. The
   combined effect of multiple stressors is one area where considerable
   uncertainty exists. Our study area, the Great Barrier Reef is
   simultaneously data-rich - concerning the physical and biological
   environment - and data-poor - concerning the effects of interacting
   stressors. We used a formal expert-elicitation process to obtain
   estimates of outcomes associated with a variety of scenarios that
   combined stressors both within and outside the control of local
   managers. There was much stronger consensus about certain stressor
   effects - such as between temperature anomalies and bleaching - than
   others, such as the relationship between water quality and coral cover.
   In general, the expert outlook for the Great Barrier Reef is
   pessimistic, with the potential for climate change effects potentially
   to overshadow the effects of local management actions. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Using Watered Landscapes to Manipulate Urban Heat Island Effects: How
   Much Water Will It Take to Cool Phoenix?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {76},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-121},
Abstract = {Problem: The prospect that urban heat island (UHI) effects and climate
   change may increase urban temperatures is a problem for cities that
   actively promote urban redevelopment and higher densities. One possible
   UHI mitigation strategy is to plant more trees and other irrigated
   vegetation to prevent daytime heat storage and facilitate nighttime
   cooling, but this requires water resources that are limited in a desert
   city like Phoenix. Purpose: We investigated the tradeoffs between water
   use and nighttime cooling inherent in urban form and land use choices.
   Methods: We used a Local-Scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization
   Scheme (LUMPS) model to examine the variation in temperature and
   evaporation in 10 census tracts in Phoenix's urban core. After
   validating results with estimates of outdoor water use based on
   tract-level city water records and satellite imagery, we used the model
   to simulate the temperature and water use consequences of implementing
   three different scenarios. Results and conclusions: We found that
   increasing irrigated landscaping lowers nighttime temperatures, but this
   relationship is not linear; the greatest reductions occur in the least
   vegetated neighborhoods. A ratio of the change in water use to
   temperature impact reached a threshold beyond which increased outdoor
   water use did little to ameliorate UHI effects. Takeaway for practice:
   There is no one design and landscape plan capable of addressing
   increasing UHI and climate effects everywhere. Any one strategy will
   have inconsistent results if applied across all urban landscape features
   and may lead to an inefficient allocation of scarce water resources.

   Foundation (NSF) under Grant SES-0345945 (Decision Center for a Desert
   City) and by the City of Phoenix Water Services Department. Any

Abstract = {Despite growing concern about climate change and the potential impacts
   of tourism on the environment, little is known about visitor responses
   toward climate mitigation strategies in nature-based tourism settings or
   factors that influence them. This study examined the influence of travel
   distance and Experience Use History (EUH) on visitor willingness to
   engage in climate friendly behavior in state parks and their support for
   management actions to minimize climate change impacts. Following a
   stratified-cluster sampling approach, a total of 1,775 visitors (69.7\%
   response rate) completed online or paper surveys at 20 pre-selected
   Missouri state parks and historic sites. Results indicated that visitors
   living within 100 miles of these locations were more willing to engage
   in climate friendly behavior, but less supportive of climate friendly
   management actions, as compared to those living farther away. Visitors'
   EUH was only associated with their willingness to engage in climate
   friendly behavior, but not with support for climate friendly management
   actions. In addition to some theoretical and methodological
   contributions, this paper sheds light on management of nature-based
   tourism destinations such as state parks.},

Title = {Long-term vegetation changes in a temperate forest impacted by climate
   change},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Pervasive forest mortality is expected to increase in future decades as
   a result of increasing temperatures. Climate-induced forest dieback can
   have consequences on ecosystem services, potentially mediated by changes
   in forest structure and understory community composition that emerge in
   response to tree death. Although many dieback events around the world
   have been documented in recent years, yellow-cedar (Callitropsis
   nootkatensis) decline provides an opportunity to study vegetation
   changes occurring over the past century. Current research identifies
   climate-related reductions in snow cover as a key driver of this species
   dieback. To examine the process of forest development post-dieback, we
   conducted vegetation surveys at 50 plots along the outer coast of
   southeast Alaska across a chronosequence of mortality. Our main study
   objectives were to examine changes in seedling and sapling abundance,
   and community structure of conifer species in the overstory; effects of
   yellow-cedar mortality on plant diversity and community composition of
   functional groups in the understory; and volume of key forage species
   for Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) managed
   throughout the region. The probability of yellow-cedar sapling
   occurrence was reduced across the chronosequence. Yellow-cedar seedling
   and sapling abundance also decreased. We observed a turnover from
   yellow-cedar to western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) dominated forests.
   Functional plant diversity increased and the community composition of
   the understory changed across the chronosequence. Bryophytes became less
   abundant and grasses more abundant in the early stages of stand
   development, and shrubs increased in relative abundance in latter
   stages. Our results demonstrate that yellow-cedar is significantly less
   likely to regenerate in forests affected by widespread mortality, and a
   species dieback can dynamically rearrange the plant community over time.
   These findings emphasize the importance of considering long-term
   temporal dynamics when assessing the impacts of climate change on
   biodiversity and ecosystem services, and adapting forest management to a
   changing climate.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the major challenges affecting cities. Extreme
   natural events continues to hit our cities harder and more frequently
   with extreme weather conditions. The reality of climate change is also
   one of the causes of the shift in city agenda that also include the
   general decline of infrastructure, conspicuous resource depletion, and
   the emergence of ecology as a new paradigm in urban studies.
   This paper reviews the outcome of an Australian Government funded
   project implemented in the City of Geelong. The project provides an
   example of how to integrate ecological principles with engineering
   solutions in order not only to regenerate a city centre of a large
   coastal city but also to redefine Geelong's approach to resilience.
   Johnstone Park integrated water Master Plan aims to rebuild the green
   infrastructure in the Geelong, making use of floodwater to irrigate a
   proposed urban green spine. The project, part of a larger master plan
   for the city (VISION II) becomes a catalyst for an ecological approach
   to urban development in the region, setting up a successful example of
   integrated approach to a number of environmental challenges in the
   region. The paper reviews the project, identifies the ecological
   principles, and set out a number of lessons learnt.},

   known for its poor water quality. In the present study, concentrations
   of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia, nitrates, chloride, sulphates, sodium
   and calcium were assessed together with conductivity and pH, compared to
   legislated guidelines and to previous studies of 1964 and 2000. The
   results indicate that with the exception of calcium, the Mvoti system
   has been experiencing long-term deterioration. Presently, ammonium ions,
   nitrate and chloride exceed the acceptable guideline target limits, and
   DO levels are extremely low. The biotic integrity of the system is
   therefore seriously compromised with the threat of detrimental effects
   to all users if mitigation measures aimed at improving water quality are

Title = {The dilemmas of normalising losses from climate change: Towards hope for
   Pacific atoll countries},
Journal = {ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-13},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The idea that climate change may cause the loss of atoll countries is
   now taken for granted in much of climate change science, policy and
   media coverage. This normalisation of loss means atoll countries now
   face a future that is apparently finite, which is a grievous situation
   no other country has to contend with. This paper explains the dilemmas
   this presents to atoll countries. If there is a risk of forced
   migration, then strategic planning can minimise its social impacts. Yet,
   doing so may bring future dangers into the present by undermining
   efforts to facilitate adaptation to climate change, creating new
   identities and deterring investments in sustainable resource management.
   To overcome this dilemma, the paper argues for a more hopeful approach
   to the future of atoll countries, because for as long as the science of
   loss remains uncertain, and the limits to adaptation are unknown, forced
   migration cannot be taken as a matter of fact and could possibly be
   averted through emission reductions and a vastly improved and
   significantly more creative approach to adaptation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1098-1108},
Abstract = {Wildfires can have devastating effects on life, property and the
   environment. Official inquiries following major damaging fires often
   recommend management actions to reduce the risk of future losses from
   wildfires. Understanding where wildfires are most likely to occur in the
   landscape is essential to determining where wildfires pose the greatest
   risk to people and property. We investigated the spatial patterns of
   wildfire ignitions at a bioregional scale in New South Wales and
   Victoria using generalised linear models. We used a combination of
   social and biophysical variables and examined whether different
   categories of ignitions respond to different explanatory variables.
   Human-caused ignitions are the dominant source of ignitions for
   wildfires in south-eastern Australia and our results showed that for
   such ignitions, population density was the most important variable for
   the spatial pattern of ignitions. In future years, more ignitions are
   predicted in the coastal and hinterland areas due to population
   increases and climate change effects.},

Title = {Differential Growth Responses of Alternanthera philoxeroides as Affected
   by Submergence Depths},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Global climate change has resulted in an increase in intensity and
   frequency of flooding, plants living in lowlands, and shore areas have
   to confront submergence caused by flooding, submergence-tolerant plants
   usually respond by adopting either escape or quiescence strategies.
   While certain plants exhibit a changeover from escape strategy upon
   partial submergence to quiescence strategy under complete shallow
   submergence, it remains unknown whether plants completely submerged at
   different water depths would adjust their strategies to cope with the
   change in submergence depth. Alternanthera philoxeroides is an ideal
   species to explore this adjustment as it is widely distributed in
   flood-disturbed habitats and exhibits an escape strategy when completely
   submerged in shallow waters. We investigated the responses of A.
   philoxeroides in terms of morphology, anatomy, and non-structural
   carbohydrate metabolism by conducting experiments using a series of
   submergence depths (0, 2, 5, and 9 m). During the submergence treatment,
   environmental factors such as light, dissolved oxygen, and temperature
   for submerged plants were kept constant. The results showed that A.
   philoxeroides plants submerged at depth of 2 m presented an escape
   strategy via fast stem elongation, extensive pith cavity development,
   and small biomass loss. However, the retarded stem elongation, reduced
   pith cavity transverse area, and increased biomass loss along the water
   depth gradient indicated that A. philoxeroides altered its growth
   response as water depth increased from 2 to 9 m. It is found that the
   changeover of response strategies occurred at higher submergence depths
   (5-9 m). Based on the results of our experiments, we demonstrated that
   water depth played an important role in driving the change in strategy.
   The water-depth-dependent growth performance of A. philoxeroides would
   benefit the species in habit exploration and exploitation. Further
   studies should focus on the performances of plants when submerged at
   varied water depths with different light climates and dissolved oxygen
   content, and how water depths drive the response behaviors of the
   submerged plants.},

Abstract = {Torbay, located in South West England, UK, is one of the Case Studies on
   the EU-funded project EU-CIRCLE, which is aimed at enhancing resilience
   of Critical Infrastructures (CI) to natural hazards. The region includes
   three urban centres (Torquay, Paignton and Brixham) and hosts more than
   3 million tourists every year that contribute over 450 pound million to
   local economy. However, flooding, including coastal, fluvial and
   pluvial, has been a major threat to the area with more than 15 major
   incidents occurring since 1999. Rising sea levels, combined with
   increasing rainfall intensity, linked to climate change, are expected to
   exacerbate the problem. Better adaptation strategies are needed to
   safeguard CIs and services while improving resilience to climate
   hazards. EUCIRCLE partners are engaged in a review of the existing
   capacity of flood defenses and the drainage systems in Torbay. To
   enhance the risk communication with the stakeholders, we adopted a high
   performance flood model to analyse the flood risk to Cis under a wide
   range of scenarios. The results are integrated into an innovative 3D
   visualization tool, showing the progress over time of any flood scenario
   in the region, via a fully interactive interface allowing stakeholders
   to better understand flood impacts to CIs. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Title = {Dual adaptive cycles in implementing integrated coastal management},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {23-30},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite the place-based nature of integrated coastal management (ICM)
   implementation and the importance of considering country-specific
   knowledge, a number of uniformities in ICM implementation have been
   distinguished. In this paper, the theoretical validation of a
   place-based ICM implementation model developed for South Africa's
   sector-based governance system is undertaken using predefined
   theoretically based evaluation criteria derived from such uniformities.
   Using an incremental, adaptive research process, the original
   place-based model is evaluated and then refined to enhance its
   theoretical validity. During the refinement of the implementation model,
   two interdependent yet distinctive cycles, the resource cycle and the
   actor cycle, emerged. The dual cycles in ICM implementation represent
   the process of inclusive ecosystem-based resource management (the
   resource cycle) capacitated by a supporting network of actors (the actor
   cycle). The new model incorporates insights from the recent literature
   on adaptive management in the fields of integrated water management and
   social ecological systems into ICM theory and practice. Further, the
   learning-by-doing process that characterises ICM implementation is
   expanded by connecting place-based design and theoretically based
   learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Many genome-wide assays involve the generation of a subset (or
   representation) of the genome following restriction enzyme digestion.
   The use of enzymes sensitive to cytosine methylation allows
   high-throughput analysis of this epigenetic regulatory process. We show
   that the use of a dual-adapter approach allows us to generate genomic
   representations that includes fragments of < 200bp in size, previously
   not possible when using the standard approach of using a single adapter.
   By expanding the representation to smaller fragments using HpaII or
   MspI, we increase the representation by these isoschizomers to more than
   1.32 million loci in the human genome, representing 98.5\% of CpG
   islands and 91.1\% of refSeq promoters. This advance allows the
   development of a new, high-resolution version of our HpaII-tiny fragment
   Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR (HELP) assay to study cytosine
   methylation. We also show that the MspI representation generates
   information about copy-number variation, that the assay can be used on
   as little as 10ng of DNA and that massively parallel sequencing can be
   used as an alternative to microarrays to read the output of the assay,
   making this a powerful discovery platform for studies of genomic and
   epigenomic abnormalities.},

Title = {Sport fisheries: Opportunities and challenges for diversifying coastal
   livelihoods in the Pacific},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {305-314},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {High population growth rates and poverty are likely to elevate the
   vulnerability of many coastal communities in the Pacific region to
   climate change. Alternative livelihood strategies which can generate
   income and simultaneously conserve fish stocks and their habitats are a
   priority. This paper investigates the feasibility of `sport fishing'
   (recreational catch and release angling for particular species of
   predatory game fish) as such a strategy. The limited research of sport
   fisheries in developing countries is augmented with a review of
   community-based ecotourism, integrated conservation and development
   projects (ICDPs) and common property management literature to propose
   design principles. Five prerequisite principles for the success of sport
   fishery enterprises are suggested. First, adequate local capacity must
   be available to manage a tourism business and facilities, supported by
   cross-scale co-management amongst stakeholders. Second, appropriate
   governance arrangements must be in place to ensure the equitable
   dispersal of benefits to all members of the local community, and
   conflict resolution. Third, resource-ownership boundaries and rights
   must be clearly delineated before the enterprise begins in order to
   minimise the potential for future conflict. Fourth, social, biodiversity
   and ecosystem service co-benefits should result from the enterprise.
   These should include improvements in income, health, education, food
   security, the status of the target and non-target species and their
   habitat and non-fishery ecosystem services. Fifth, monitoring and
   evaluation of these principles is required within an adaptive
   co-management framework which takes a social-ecological systems approach
   and includes all stakeholders in social learning and power-sharing.
   Through this, broader impacts of the enterprise may emerge which go
   beyond the standard assessment of ecotourism and ICDP success in
   financial or biodiversity terms. These principles now need to be tested
   by researching the experiences of case studies of sport fishing
   enterprises in the Pacific. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Temporal dynamics of urban warming have been extensively studied at the
   diurnal scale, but the impact of background climate on the observed
   seasonality of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) remains largely
   unexplored. On seasonal time scales, the intensity of urban-rural
   surface temperature differences (Delta T-s) exhibits distinctive
   hysteretic cycles whose shape and looping direction vary across climatic
   zones. These observations highlight possible delays underlying the
   dynamics of the coupled urban-biosphere system. However, a general
   argument explaining the observed hysteretic patterns remains elusive. A
   coarse-grained model of SUHI coupled with a stochastic soil water
   balance is developed to demonstrate that the time lags between radiation
   forcing, air temperature, and rainfall generate a rate-dependent
   hysteresis, explaining the observed seasonal variations of Delta T-s. If
   solar radiation is in phase with water availability, summer conditions
   cause strong SUHI intensities due to high rural evaporative cooling.
   Conversely, cities in seasonally dry regions where evapotranspiration is
   out of phase with radiation show a summertime oasis effect controlled by
   background climate and vegetation properties. These seasonal patterns of
   warming and cooling have significant implications for heat mitigation
   strategies as urban green spaces can reduce Delta T-s during summertime,
   while potentially negative effects of albedo management during winter
   are mitigated by the seasonality of solar radiation.},

Abstract = {This study aims to create insight in how Integrated Assessment Models
   (IAMs) perform in describing the climate forcing by non-CO2 gases and
   aerosols. The simple climate models (SCMs) included in IAMs have been
   run with the same prescribed anthropogenic emission pathways and
   compared to analyses with complex earth system models (ESMs) in terms of
   concentration and radiative forcing levels. In our comparison,
   particular attention was given to the short-lived forcers' climate
   effects. In general, SCMs show forcing levels within the expert model
   ranges. However, the more simple SCMs seem to underestimate forcing
   differences between baseline and mitigation scenarios because of
   omission of ozone, black carbon and/or indirect methane forcing effects.
   Above all, results also show that among IAMs there is a significant
   spread (0.74 W/m(2) in 2100) in non-CO2 forcing projections for a 2.6
   W/m(2) mitigation scenario, mainly due to uncertainties in the indirect
   effects of aerosols. This has large implications for determining optimal
   mitigation strategies among IAMs with regard to required CO2 forcing
   targets and policy costs.},

Abstract = {Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) is one of the most ecologically
   important seabirds in New Zealand and depends strongly on terrestrial
   ecosystems for nesting, moulting and breeding. Wellington, New Zealand,
   is one of the world's most important biodiversity hot spots for this
   species, mostly in confluence with human urban settlements. This species
   is currently suffering from the local impacts of climate change
   associated with urbanisation. Two suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand,
   that are used seasonally by Little Penguin as terrestrial habitat were
   selected as the study area to address two issues: (i) how local impacts
   of climate change may affect the population and habitat structure of
   species in urban coastal zones where land cover change occurs; and (ii)
   how landscape management practices may help to mitigate the impacts
   imposed by climate change on the species in such a context. Remote
   Sensing and Geographical Information Systems techniques were applied to
   quantify and measure the extent of the prehuman forests and current land
   cover classes in the study area to reveal the degree to which land cover
   has changed from predevelopment to the present time. The research shows
   that land cover change in the study area has been widespread and partly
   irreversible, particularly in areas covered by the class Built-up Area.
   Results reveal that there are still spatial opportunities to safeguard
   this vulnerable species against the ill effects of climate change
   through landscape management practices.},

Abstract = {This chapter presents climate change adaptation (CCA) interventions
   proposed for implementation in the three municipalities of Dar es
   Salaam, namely Kinondoni, Ilala and Temeke. The proposed measures were
   developed through participatory approaches involving consultative
   stakeholder workshops. The research presented below is one of the
   outputs of the Adapting to Climate Change in Coastal Dar es Salaam (ACC
   Dar) project. The aim of the ACC Dar project is to improve the
   effectiveness of municipal council initiatives in Dar es Salaam in
   supporting the efforts of coastal peri-urban dwellers, partially or
   totally dependent on natural resources, to adapt to climate change (CC)
   impacts. The interventions proposed by the municipalities focus on
   reducing saltwater intrusion into the shallow aquifer, since this is one
   of the main factors of vulnerability. Indeed, there is evidence that
   this environmental phenomenon is already contributing to the degradation
   of the ground water upon which a large portion of peri-urban inhabitants
   relies for access to water. Specifically, those proposals are: (i) to
   conserve water resources along the coastal belt; (ii) to harvest
   rainwater as a CCA strategy; and (iii) to build capacity and community
   awareness of CC impacts on saltwater intrusion. The chapter also
   highlights the important role played by local government authorities
   (LGAs) in designing and implementing CCA and how their proposals fit
   into national strategies linked to CC.},

Title = {The Statistical DownScaling Model - Decision Centric (SDSM-DC):
   conceptual basis and applications},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {259-276},
Abstract = {Regional climate downscaling has arrived at an important juncture. Some
   in the research community favour continued refinement and evaluation of
   downscaling techniques within a broader framework of uncertainty
   characterisation and reduction. Others are calling for smarter use of
   downscaling tools, accepting that conventional, scenario-led strategies
   for adaptation planning have limited utility in practice. This paper
   sets out the rationale and new functionality of the Decision Centric
   (DC) version of the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM-DC). This tool
   enables synthesis of plausible daily weather series, exotic variables
   (such as tidal surge), and climate change scenarios guided, not
   determined, by climate model output. Two worked examples are presented.
   The first shows how SDSM-DC can be used to reconstruct and in-fill
   missing records based on calibrated predictor-predictand relationships.
   Daily temperature and precipitation series from sites in Africa, Asia
   and North America are deliberately degraded to show that SDSM-DC can
   reconstitute lost data. The second demonstrates the application of the
   new scenario generator for stress testing a specific adaptation
   decision. SDSM-DC is used to generate daily precipitation scenarios to
   simulate winter flooding in the Boyne catchment, Ireland. This
   sensitivity analysis reveals the conditions under which existing
   precautionary allowances for climate change might be insufficient. We
   conclude by discussing the wider implications of the proposed approach
   and research opportunities presented by the new tool.},

Abstract = {The Sacramento and San Joaquin Basins Study is a collaborative long
   range planning study conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and
   state and local partner agencies to assess the impacts of future changes
   in climate and socioeconomic conditions on water resource management in
   the Central Valley of California. To account for a range of uncertainty
   in future conditions through 2100, a scenario-based approach was
   developed using climate projections available from Couple Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model simulations and
   sea level rise projections consistent with National Research Council
   (NRC) and the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) Assessment Report 5 (AR5). The performance of the Central Valley
   water system was evaluated for a range of metrics including water
   deliveries, water quality, hydropower, flood control, recreation, fish,
   and wildlife habitats, ESA species, flow dependent ecological resiliency
   and the economic impacts of water supply changes using an integrated
   model package that simulates the federal Central Valley Project, the
   State Water Project and local system operations and regulatory
   requirements. The study also included the development and evaluation of
   a range of water management actions that can help reduce or manage
   future risks posed by potential changes in climate and socioeconomic
   conditions. Seven adaptation portfolios were explored that each
   consisted of a variety of water management actions. These thematic
   portfolios were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in adapting
   to potential risks posed by future socioeconomic and climate changes and
   to assess tradeoffs between their relative performances.},

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},

Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {354-359},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the field of adaptation governance research, current discussion on
   the barriers to adaptation shows that theoretical explanations for why
   institutions emerge and how they enable or constrain adaptation are
   underdeveloped. In this Perspective, we show that there is a significant
   opportunity to advance the understanding of adaptation governance by
   integrating insights that have been developed in the extensive commons
   literature on the institutions that work to overcome social conflicts or
   dilemmas. `Realist-materialist' approaches to understanding such
   collective action are particularly valuable to adaptation governance
   research because they emphasize how biophysical conditions give rise to
   certain types of social dilemma. Climate change affects these
   biophysical conditions, and thus may alter dilemmas or create new ones.
   Based on realist-materialist reasoning, this Perspective describes six
   types of dilemma, illustrates each with a case from the adaptation
   literature and draws on insights from the commons literature regarding
   relevant contextual conditions and effective policy instruments for
   overcoming social dilemmas. The dilemma types provide entry points for
   rigorous comparative adaptation research to deepen understanding of how
   context influences adaptation governance processes.},

Title = {An Analytical Model for the Corrosion Risk of Water Alternating Gas
   Injection Wells in CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery},
Journal = {ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {1},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {An analytical model is proposed to describe the corrosion risk profile
   of a well tube in water alternating gas (WAG) CO2 injection conditions
   based on the assumption that the drying process of the water layer on
   the inner wall of the well tube plays a crucial role in controlling
   corrosion. In this model, the fluid properties, the thermodynamic
   equilibrium of CO2 and water steam, and an empirical CO2 corrosion
   equation are systematically considered. The description by this model
   reasonably indicates that fast injection can decrease the corrosion risk
   and push the highest risk region to a deeper zone, while a longer drying
   time for a thicker water layer left on the well inner wall can lead to
   higher corrosion risk. It can also be deduced that the offshore WAG case
   is more aggressive than the onshore case and some mitigation strategies
   are suggested for reducing the corrosion risk. These should be helpful
   for corrosion management and leakage monitoring in the practical WAG CO2
   injection.},

Abstract = {Climate impacts are now widely reported from coastal marine systems, but
   less is known for the open ocean. Here we review progress in
   understanding impacts on large pelagic species presented at an
   international workshop for the Climate Impacts on Oceanic Top Predators
   programme, and discuss the future with regard to the next phase of
   adaptation-focused research. Recent highlights include a plan to map the
   distribution of key species in the foodweb using both acoustics and
   biochemical techniques, and development of a new data sharing and access
   tool for fisheries and associated data, including socio-economic
   information. A common research focus in pelagic ecosystems is on
   understanding climate variability and climate change impacts on marine
   species, but a greater emphasis on developing future scenarios and
   adaptation options is needed. Workshop participants also concluded that
   engagement with and provision of science support to regional fisheries
   management organisations are critical elements for ensuring successful
   uptake of research. This uptake will be required for future management
   of fisheries as global warming continues such that some open ocean top
   predators can be sustainably harvested, impacts on
   conservation-dependent species can be avoided, and ecosystem function is
   not compromised.},

Abstract = {Climate change presents an emerging challenge to the sustainable
   management of tuna fisheries, and robust information is essential to
   ensure future sustainability. Climate and harvest affect tuna stocks,
   populations of non-target, dependent species and the ecosystem. To
   provide relevant advice we need an improved understanding of oceanic
   ecosystems and better data to parameterise the models that forecast the
   impacts of climate change. Currently ocean-wide data collection in the
   Pacific Ocean is primarily restricted to oceanographic data. However,
   the fisheries observer programs that operate in the region offer an
   opportunity to collect the additional information on the mid and upper
   trophic levels of the ecosystem that is necessary to complement this
   physical data, including time-series of distribution, abundance, size,
   composition and biological information on target and non-target species
   and mid trophic level organisms. These observer programs are in their
   infancy, with limited temporal and spatial distribution but recent
   international and national policy decisions have been made to expand
   their coverage. We identify a number of actions to initiate this
   monitoring including: consolidating collaborations to ensure the use of
   best quality data; developing consistency between sub-regional observer
   programmes to ensure that they meet the objectives of ecosystem
   monitoring; interrogating of existing time series to determine the most
   appropriate spatial template for monitoring; and exploring existing
   ecosystem models to identify suitable indicators of ecosystem status and
   change. The information obtained should improve capacity to develop
   fisheries management policies that are resilient and can be adapted to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {This article presents a restoration approach for improving the
   resilience of electric distribution systems (EDSs) by taking advantage
   of several operational resources. In the proposed approach, the
   restoration process combines dynamic network reconfiguration, islanding
   operation of dispatchable distributed generation units, and the
   prepositioning and displacement of mobile emergency generation (MEG)
   units. The benefit of exploring a demand response (DR) program to
   improve the recoverability of the system is also taken into account. The
   proposed approach aims to separate the in-service and out-of-service
   parts of the system while maintaining the radiality of the grid. To
   assist the distribution system planner, the problem is formulated as a
   stochastic-scenario-based mixed-integer linear programming model, where
   uncertainties associated with PV-based generation and demand are
   captured. The objective function of the problem minimizes the amount of
   energy load shedding after a fault event as well as PV-based generating
   curtailment. To validate the proposed approach, adapted 33-bus and
   83-bus EDSs are analyzed under different test conditions. Numerical
   results demonstrate the benefits of coordinating the dynamic network
   reconfiguration, the prepositioning and displacement of MEG units, and a
   DR program to improve the restoration process.},

Abstract = {Percnon gibbesi, a subtropical crab recently recorded for the first time
   in the Mediterranean, has now been found at Pantelleria (Strait of
   Sicily) and on the coast of mainland Sicily. The main morphological
   traits of the collected specimens are presented. It seems that P gibbesi
   is forming stable populations in Sicilian waters, where juveniles as
   well as ovigerous females have been found. A few hypotheses are
   suggested to explain the spread of this species into the western
   Mediterranean: (i) wide capability of adaptation, (ii) larval strategy,
   (iii) favourable environmental conditions, probably linked to recent
   climate change, and (iv) absence of competitors.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh has a primarily agrarian economy. Agriculture is the single
   largest producing sector of the economy. Soil is the predominant aspect
   for a successful crop production; whereas, good soil health is a
   prerequisite for sustainable agriculture and food security. On the other
   hand, more than 30 \% of the cultivable land in Bangladesh is in the
   coastal area. Out of 2.86 million hectares (ha) of coastal and off-shore
   lands about 1.056 million ha of arable lands are affected by varying
   degrees of salinity. Hence, this chapter would deal with status of soil
   parameters including soil salinity, its threat to sustainable crop
   production and food securities. Then the focus shifts to find out
   possible ways and few recommendations towards improving the soil health
   as well as reduction of the risk in southwestern coastal region of
   Bangladesh.},

Title = {Planned retreat in Global South megacities: disentangling policy,
   practice, and environmental justice},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {157},
Number = {2},
Pages = {299-317},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The retreat of urban populations as an adaptation strategy has the
   potential to protect people, businesses, and infrastructure from the
   severe impacts of climate change. However, it can also lead to the
   unjust dislocation of the urban poor whose contributions to climate
   change are negligible but whose exposure to climatic risk is high. These
   groups of people also have little say in the decision-making about
   whether to retreat, when and how, thus raising concerns about equity and
   justice. In this paper, I examine the policy and practice of managed
   retreat and its environmental justice dimensions in Manila (Philippines)
   and Lagos (Nigeria) from 2010 to 2018. Expert interviews, focus group
   discussions, and policy documents were collected and analyzed for both
   cities. Findings reveal a complex picture of contradictions. In Lagos,
   retreat was stated in climate change policy but in practice only the
   urban poor were forcibly removed from waterfront areas and in their
   place new urban development projects are being constructed. In Manila,
   retreat was not mentioned in policy but evidence indicates informal
   settlers and national government offices were the target of planned
   retreat. Unlike Lagos, the urban poor in Manila were offered a mortgaged
   pathway to homeownership outside the city. However, the lack of
   livelihood opportunities in relocation sites engendered a cycle of
   retreat and return. This study further discusses how climatic
   uncertainties, property values, government distrust, utopian
   imaginaries, and environmental injustices served as barriers to managed
   retreat in both cities. The paper concludes with a call for an
   environmentally and socially just approach to retreat. It argues that
   the rights of the urban poor to the city must be taken into
   consideration even under complex climatic and socio-ecological
   disruptions.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a tricky issue. The Indian subcontinent has
   experienced many regional and local climatic changes in its past. There
   is overwhelming geological evidence of global climatic changes which are
   associated with extinctions and new life form adaptations. The Indian
   subcontinent is governed by monsoonal precipitation inextricably linked
   with the socioeconomic conditions of its citizenry. The subcontinent has
   a long coastline which is prone to sea level changes having potential to
   displace millions of people. The agriculture, dependent on the monsoonal
   precipitation, is already showing signs of disarray. Floods and droughts
   have been visiting regions that were hitherto immune to these hazards.
   The fast-eroding green cover and forests has unleashed extinctions of
   life forms that are so vital to the well-being of the environment. In
   climate change dynamics, many variables, and not a single one, have a
   role to play. Humans have the capacity to tackle this situation, and all
   the nations need to come together to fight the menace of climate change,
   that is part natural and part man-made. The technological innovations
   are long overdue to mitigate the hazards faced.},

   temperature effects of Asian aerosols spread across the whole globe.
   Here, we remove Asian anthropogenic aerosols from two independent
   climate models (ECHAM6.1 and NorESM1) using the same representation of
   aerosols via MACv2-SP (a simple plume implementation of the second
   version of the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology). We then
   robustly decompose the global distribution of surface temperature
   responses into contributions from atmospheric energy flux changes. We
   find that the horizontal atmospheric energy transport strongly moderates
   the surface temperature response over the regions where Asian aerosols
   reside. Atmospheric energy transport and changes in clear-sky long-wave
   radiation redistribute the temperature effects efficiently across the
   Northern Hemisphere and to a lesser extent also over the Southern
   Hemisphere. The model-mean global surface temperature response to Asian
   anthropogenic aerosol removal is 0.26 +/- 0.04 degrees C (0.22 +/- 0.03
   for ECHAM6.1 and 0.30 +/- 0.03 degrees C for NorESM1) of warming.
   Model-to-model differences in global surface temperature response mainly
   arise from differences in longwave cloud (0.01 +/- 0.01 for ECHAM6.1 and
   0.05 +/- 0.01 degrees C for NorESM1) and shortwave cloud (0.03 +/- 0.03
   for ECHAM6.1 and 0.07 +/- 0.02 degrees C for NorESM1) responses. The
   differences in cloud responses between the models also dominate the
   differences in regional temperature responses. In both models, the
   northernhemispheric surface warming amplifies towards the Arctic, where
   the total temperature response is highly seasonal and weakest during the
   Arctic summer. We estimate that under a strong Asian aerosol mitigation
   policy tied with strong climate mitigation (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway
   1-1.9) the Asian aerosol reductions can add around 8 years' worth of
   current-day global warming during the next few decades.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {336-347},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Island ecosystems have rich marine biodiversity and high levels of
   terrestrial endemism, but are potentially the most vulnerable to climate
   change and anthropogenic stressors. To effectively manage environments,
   scholars and conservation practitioners have increasingly turned their
   attention to local islander knowledge (LK) and practices. To date, much
   of the literature treats LK definitionally rather than examining its
   theoretical underpinnings. This review focuses explicitly on the concept
   of LK and it describes three discernible phases of research marked by
   conceptual shifts. Over the 20th century, LK underwent a dramatic
   reversal from something understood as inferior and deficient to
   something that is valuable and empirically sound. This shift ushered in
   widespread acceptance of local islander knowledge as a unique, rich
   corpus of information that could be tapped by Western science to enhance
   community-based resource management. Over the last several decades, a
   third phase of LK research has emerged in which a more dynamic framing
   has developed, emphasizing LK's hybrid and adaptive dimensions, as well
   as its constitutive entanglements with other social-ecological
   processes. This has expanded the scope of inquiry into the strategies
   islanders employ as they adapt to changing social and environmental
   milieus, and as they attempt to co-produce knowledge with scientists and
   conservation practitioners.},

Journal = {RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wildfire is increasing in frequency and size in the western United
   States with climate change and invasive species such as cheatgrass. This
   increase is also causing an increase in the need for restorationd
   techniques, especially in low-elevation, arid shrublands. Sagebrush
   shrublands are home to the threatened Gunnison sage-grouse and can take
   decades, if not longer, to recover after fire. We investigated
   management-friendly restoration techniques aimed at increasing sagebrush
   cover in a sagebrush system important to Gunnison sage-grouse and
   impacted by fire in western Colorado. We tested several restoration
   techniques that could be replicated in management actions to mitigate
   stressors on sagebrush recruitment, specifically herbivory by large
   ungulates, water limitation, and competition with other plants. We found
   that sagebrush grew and survived better when planted as transplanted
   seedlings versus seeds, when planted in areas where herbicide had been
   applied versus when vegetation was removed by hand tools, and when caged
   to prevent herbivory than when not caged. Surprisingly, providing
   supplementary water did not improve sagebrush transplant growth or
   survival over use of a microsite (small structure made of wood collected
   from the burn scar). Constructed microsites were meant to provide
   protection from wind, retain moisture, and provide shade. Overall, our
   results indicate that if sagebrush seedlings are provided shelter and
   structure, then survival can approach natural (not planted) rates and
   sagebrush can be successfully established in low-elevation sites.

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {85},
Number = {1},

Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The continuing degradation of coral reefs has serious consequences for
   the provision of ecosystem goods and services to local and regional
   communities. While climate change is considered the most serious risk to
   coral reefs, agricultural pollution threatens approximately 25\% of the
   total global reef area with further increases in sediment and nutrient
   fluxes projected over the next 50 years. Here, we aim to inform coral
   reef management using insights learned from management examples that
   were successful in reducing agricultural pollution to coastal
   ecosystems. We identify multiple examples reporting reduced fluxes of
   sediment and nutrients at end-of-river, and associated declines in
   nutrient concentrations and algal biomass in receiving coastal waters.
   Based on the insights obtained, we recommend that future protection of
   coral reef ecosystems demands policy focused on desired ecosystem
   outcomes, targeted regulatory approaches, up-scaling of watershed
   management, and long-term maintenance of scientifically robust
   monitoring programs linked with adaptive management. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {This study proposes a weighted average heterogeneous ensemble of
   meta-models for approximating seawater intrusion phenomena in coastal
   aquifer systems. Root mean square error criterion of standalone
   meta-models is used to assign the corresponding weight to each
   meta-model. Results indicate that the ensemble model's prediction is
   better than all considered meta-models except the best model in the
   ensemble. In the next step, individual meta-models are combined with a
   multiple objective optimization algorithm within the framework of
   multiple realization optimization to develop reliability based
   management models for coastal aquifers. Four different reliability
   levels (0.99, 0.83, 0.67, and 0.5) are considered. It is observed from
   the Pareto optimal fronts of the management models that total objective
   function value (total production well pumping for beneficial purposes)
   decreases as the reliability increases. A demonstrative multilayered
   coastal aquifer system is selected for assessing the suitability of the
   evaluated methodology. Results obtained demonstrate the capability of
   this approach to develop a reliable management strategy in mitigating
   the extent salinity intrusion in coastal aquifer systems.},

Abstract = {Coral reef species are frequently the focus of bio-prospecting, and when
   promising bioactive compounds are identified there is often a need for
   the development of responsible harvesting based on relatively limited
   data. The Caribbean gorgonian Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae has been
   harvested in the Bahamas for over a decade. Data on population age
   structure and growth rates in conjunction with harvest data provide an
   opportunity to compare fishery practices and outcomes to those suggested
   by a Beverton-Holt fishery model. The model suggests a minimum colony
   size limit of 7-9 years of age (21-28 cm height), which would allow each
   colony 2-4 years of reproduction prior to harvesting. The Beverton-Holt
   model assumes that colonies at or above the minimum size limit are
   completely removed. In the P. elisabethae fishery, colonies are
   partially clipped and can be repeatedly harvested. Linear growth of
   surviving colonies was up to 3 times that predicted for colonies that
   were not harvested and biomass increase was up to 9 times greater than
   that predicted for undisturbed colonies. The survival of harvested
   colonies and compensatory growth increases yield, and yields at sites
   that had previously been harvested were generally greater than predicted
   by the Beverton-Holt model. The model also assumes recruitment is
   independent of fishing intensity, but lower numbers of young colonies in
   the fished populations, compared to unfished populations, suggest
   possible negative effects of the harvest on reproduction. This suggests
   the need for longer intervals between harvests. Because it can be
   developed from data that can be collected at a single time, the
   Beverton-Holt model provides a rational starting point for regulating
   new fisheries where long-term characterizations of population dynamics
   are rarely available. However, an adaptive approach to the fishery
   requires the incorporation of reproductive data.},

Abstract = {Black carbon is generated by fossil-fuel combustion and biomass burning.
   Black-carbon aerosols absorb solar radiation, and are probably a major
   source of global warming(1,2). However, the extent of
   black-carbon-induced warming is dependent on the concentration of
   sulphate and organic aerosols-which reflect solar radiation and cool the
   surface-and the origin of the black carbon(3,4). Here we examined the
   impact of black-carbon-to-sulphate ratios on net warming in China, using
   surface and aircraft measurements of aerosol plumes from Beijing,
   Shanghai and the Yellow Sea. The Beijing plumes had the highest ratio of
   black carbon to sulphate, and exerted a strong positive influence on the
   net warming. Compiling all the data, we show that solar-absorption
   efficiency was positively correlated with the ratio of black carbon to
   sulphate. Furthermore, we show that fossil-fuel-dominated black-carbon
   plumes were approximately 100\% more efficient warming agents than
   biomass-burning-dominated plumes. We suggest that
   climate-change-mitigation policies should aim at reducing fossil-fuel
   black-carbon emissions, together with the atmospheric ratio of black
   carbon to sulphate.},

Abstract = {Understanding cross-sectoral impacts is important in developing
   appropriate adaptation strategies to climate change, since such insight
   builds the capacity of decision-makers to understand the full extent of
   climate change vulnerability, rather than viewing single sectors in
   isolation. A regional integrated assessment model that captures
   interactions between six sectors (agriculture, forests, biodiversity,
   water, coasts and urban) was used to investigate impacts resulting from
   a wide range of climate and socio-economic scenarios. Results show that
   Europe will be significantly influenced by these possible future changes
   with between 79 and 91 \% of indicator-scenario combinations found to be
   statistically significantly different from the baseline. Urban
   development increases in most scenarios across Europe due to increases
   in population and sometimes GDP. This has an indirect influence on the
   number of people affected by a 1 in 100 year flood which increases in
   western and northern Europe. Changes in other land uses (intensive
   farming, extensive farming, forests and unmanaged land) vary depending
   on the scenario, but food production generally increases across Europe
   at the expense of forest area and unmanaged land to satisfy increasing
   food demand. Biodiversity vulnerability and water exploitation both
   increase in southern and Eastern Europe due to direct effects from
   climate and indirect effects from changes in land use and irrigation
   water use. The results highlight the importance of considering
   non-climatic pressures and cross-sectoral interactions to fully capture
   climate change impacts at the regional scale.},

Title = {Territorial governance of managed retreat in Sweden: addressing

Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {376-391},

Abstract = {Many climate adaptation options currently being discussed in Sweden to
   meet the challenge of surging seas and inland flooding advocate holding
   the line through various hard and soft measures to stabilize the
   shoreline, while managed retreat is neither considered as feasible
   option nor has it been explicitly researched in Sweden. However, failure
   to consider future flooding from climate change in municipal planning
   may have dangerous and costly consequences when the water does come. We
   suggest that managed retreat practices are challenging in Sweden, not
   only due to public opinions but also because of a deficit of uptake of
   territorial knowledge by decision-makers and difficulties in realizing
   flexible planning options of the shoreline. A territorial governance
   framework was used as a heuristic to explore the challenges to managed
   retreat in four urban case studies (three municipalities and one county)
   representing different territorial, hydrological and oceanographic
   environments. This was done through a series of participatory
   stakeholder workshops. The analysis using a territorial governance
   framework based on dimensions of coordination, integration,
   mobilization, adaptation and realization presents variations in how
   managed retreat barriers and opportunities are perceived among case
   study sites, mainly due to the differing territorial or place-based
   challenges. The results also indicate common challenges regardless of
   the case study site, including coordination challenges and unclear
   responsibility, the need for integrated means of addressing goal
   conflicts and being able to adapt flexibly to existing regulations and
   plans. Yet rethinking how managed retreat could boost community
   resilience and help to implement long-term visions was seen as a way to
   deal with some of the territorial challenges.},

Title = {Exploring requirements for sustainable energy supply planning with
   regard to climate resilience of Southeast Asian islands},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Southeast Asia is one of the regions most affected by impacts of climate
   change underlying the urgency to build resilience especially for remote
   and isolated island communities. Moreover, these islands face the
   problem of expensive and unreliable electricity supply. The large number
   of island communities further magnifies the difficulty of reaching
   universal sustainable electricity supply. Off-grid electrification
   technologies promise to tackle this challenge entailing high investments
   yet also market potential. Currently both aspects - electricity access
   and climate resilience - are barely linked in electrification planning.
   Energy planning in a region highly affected by climate change requires
   integrative planning considering these risks. Here, to enhance
   integrative planning, we study the status quo of energy access and risk
   exposure of non-electrified Southeast Asian islands. We identify 1932
   islands with a population greater than 21 million having limited access
   to electricity. Our study reveals three risk-specific island archetypes,
   which need different technical measures to enhance climate resiliency of
   future electricity systems. We conclude that future energy planning in
   Southeast Asia requires climate resilience as an additional planning
   dimension. The identified cluster groups serve as a blueprint for
   decision makers to support measures improving energy systems' resilience
   avoiding expensive re-investments in the future.},

Title = {Vegetation Dynamics in Rhode Island Salt Marshes During a Period of
   Accelerating Sea Level Rise and Extreme Sea Level Events},

Volume = {40},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sea level rise is a major stressor on many salt marshes, and its impacts
   include creek widening, ponding, vegetation dieback, and drowning. Marsh
   vegetation changes have been associated with sea level rise across
   southern New England, but most of these studies pre-date the current
   period of rapidly accelerating sea level rise coupled with episodic
   events of extreme increases in water levels. Here, we combine data from
   two salt marsh monitoring and assessment programs in Rhode Island that
   were designed to assess marsh responses to sea level rise and use these
   data to document temporal and spatial patterns in marsh vegetation
   during the current period of extreme water level increases. Vegetation
   monitoring at two Narragansett Bay salt marshes confirms the ongoing
   decline of the salt meadow species Spartina patens during this period as
   it becomes replaced by Spartina alterniflora. Bare ground resulting from
   vegetation dieback was significantly related to mean high water levels
   and led to the rapid conversion of mixed Spartina assemblages to S.
   alterniflora monocultures. A broader spatial assessment of RI marshes
   shows that S. alterniflora dominance increases at lower elevation
   marshes toward the mouth of Narraganset Bay. Our data provide additional
   evidence that S. patens continues to decline in southern New England
   marshes and show that losses can accelerate during periods of extreme
   high water levels. Unless adaptive management actions are taken, we
   predict that marshes throughout RI will continue to lose salt meadow
   habitat and eventually resemble lower elevation marshes that are already
   dominated by S. alterniflora monocultures.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},

Volume = {2674},
Number = {11},
Pages = {207-219},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Tidal flooding, a tangible, present-day result of sea-level rise, has
   caused roadway damage and transportation system closures as well as
   delays, disruptions, and economic losses. There is a need for more
   research, understanding, and planning for the management of this threat
   to transportation services. Using data on tidal flooding, transportation
   networks, land use, and population characteristics, the vulnerability of
   transportation systems to tidal flooding is assessed for Honolulu,
   Hawaii. Accessibility measures coupled with population characteristics
   provide quantitative estimates of travelers' underlying exposures and
   vulnerabilities to disruptions. Using GIS and overlay mapping
   techniques, at-risk roadway segments are identified and Traffic Analysis
   Zones (TAZs) are ranked in relation to accessibility changes. Trips to
   work and school, grocery shopping, recreational activities, and
   emergency services are analyzed. In addition to identifying critical,
   at-risk facilities, the analysis includes the consideration of
   vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, young people, those on low
   incomes, and those with limited transportation options. Using a
   nonparametric, mean-shift clustering method, TAZs are ranked and
   prioritized for potential mitigation actions. While 90\% of TAZs
   suffered minimal effects, several experienced up to 100\% accessibility
   reduction. High priority areas are located in Laie, Punalua, Kailua,
   Waimanalo, Hawaii Kai, and near Honolulu Harbor. The analysis is useful,
   not just for transportation system planners but also for first
   responders, emergency managers, and others working to increase
   transportation system resilience. Designed as a flexible planning and
   decision-support tool, the approach could be adapted to plan for other
   types of hazards such as tsunamis or storm surges as well.},

Title = {Implementation of a framework for multi-species, multi-objective
   adaptive management in Delaware Bay},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {191},
Pages = {759-769},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Decision analytic approaches have been widely recommended as well suited
   to solving disputed and ecologically complex natural resource management
   problems with multiple objectives and high uncertainty. However, the
   difference between theory and practice is substantial, as there are very
   few actual resource management programs that represent formal
   applications of decision analysis. We applied the process of structured
   decision making to Atlantic horseshoe crab harvest decisions in the
   Delaware Bay region to develop a multispecies adaptive management (AM)
   plan, which is currently being implemented. Horseshoe crab harvest has
   been a controversial management issue since the late 1990s. A largely
   unregulated horseshoe crab harvest caused a decline in crab spawning
   abundance. That decline coincided with a major decline in migratory
   shorebird populations that consume horseshoe crab eggs on the sandy
   beaches of Delaware Bay during spring migration. Our approach
   incorporated multiple stakeholders, including fishery and shorebird
   conservation advocates, to account for diverse management objectives and
   varied opinions on ecosystem function. Through consensus building, we
   devised an objective statement and quantitative objective function to
   evaluate alternative crab harvest policies. We developed a set of
   competing ecological models accounting for the leading hypotheses on the
   interaction between shorebirds and horseshoe crabs. The models were
   initially weighted based on stakeholder confidence in these hypotheses,
   but weights will be adjusted based on monitoring and Bayesian model
   weight updating. These models were used together to predict the effects
   of management actions on the crab and shorebird populations. Finally, we
   used a dynamic optimization routine to identify the state dependent
   optimal harvest policy for horseshoe crabs, given the possible actions,
   the stated objectives and our competing hypotheses about system
   function. The AM plan was reviewed, accepted and implemented by the
   Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in 2012 and 2013. While
   disagreements among stakeholders persist, structured decision making
   enabled unprecedented progress towards a transparent and consensus
   driven management plan for crabs and shorebirds in Delaware Bay.

Title = {Livelihood vulnerability of char land communities to climate change and
   natural hazards in Bangladesh: an application of livelihood
   vulnerability index},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Abstract = {Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to
   climate change. In general, Char land (Riverine Island) communities are
   frequently affected by floods, riverbank erosion, and other climatic
   hazards, including drought, cyclones, tornadoes, salinity intrusion,
   water logging, cold waves, etc., which cause many to lose their sources
   of livelihoods and properties and make them more vulnerable. Using
   survey data of 262 rural households, this study investigates the extent
   of livelihood vulnerability to climate change and natural hazards in the
   Char land communities by applying the climate change vulnerability index
   (CVI) (i.e., UN-IPCC vulnerability framework) and the livelihood
   vulnerability index (LVI) to develop context-specific interventions for
   building climate and livelihood resilience. The two approaches to
   vulnerability assessment were modified to incorporate local contexts and
   indigenous knowledge into 41 sub-components. The result shows that LVI
   and CVI values are different between Char land communities. The LVI
   index shows that households in Char Jotindro-Narayan (0.148) are more
   vulnerable than those in Char Kulaghat (0.139). The CVI values for Char
   Jotindro-Narayan (0.633) are slightly lower than for Char Kulaghat
   (0.639). The major vulnerability factors were access to food and water,
   social networks, natural disasters, and climatic variability. The study
   also indicates that flood, riverbank erosion, unemployment, and access
   to communication, market, and basic service opportunities are the major
   biophysical and socioeconomic factors determining livelihood
   vulnerability. Context-specific sustainable policies and development
   initiatives are required to improve the adaptive capacity of Char land
   communities across Bangladesh, thereby building their climate and
   livelihood resilience.},

Abstract = {Current planning for the future of coastal zones in England is occurring
   at a time of great change and uncertainty. Alongside the expectation of
   increased storminess and impending sea-level rise associated with
   climate change, coastal decision-making is subject to a whole host of
   institutional shifts and the legacy of past coastal management
   decisions. Changing official policy, administrative arrangements and
   jurisdictions, the need to create conditions for community involvement
   and local and national level budgetary constraints are all issues in the
   melting pot.
   This chapter summarises recent and current decision-making practice as
   it applies to Norfolk, UK, and suggests how coastal management for a
   changing coastline may generally become more adaptive, socially fair and
   effectively implemented. In Norfolk, coastal change is a complex and
   emotive issue, the management of which has evolved significantly over
   the last two decades. This chapter specifically addresses the ways in
   which national, regional and local stakeholder interests have interacted
   during this tumultuous time in North Norfolk to negotiate pathways for
   adapting to coastal change. The case example presented in this chapter,
   and more broadly in this book, illustrates that there are social limits
   and barriers, which hinder the conditions most likely to enable
   progressively more adaptive coastal governance.
   Many lessons have been learned from this experience and these are
   outlined in the context of how coastal governance in England and further
   afield may seek to become more adaptive. Integrated approaches to the
   management of future coasts are needed, encompassing robust science,
   genuine stakeholder commitment and inclusion, and funding arrangements
   (as adaptation always comes at a cost). In this regard, the deployment
   of the Tyndall Coastal Simulator approach can help to support this need.
   Within the Tyndall Coastal Simulator, this work provided an important
   context for all the model development. With the visualisations (Chap.
   10) and interface (Chap. 11), it also provided a conduit from the models
   to a true two-way stakeholder interaction and feedback. This experience
   showed that regular stakeholder engagement activities should always be a
   core part of integrated assessment exercises.},

Title = {Understanding gender intersectionality for more robust ocean science},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The UN Decade of Ocean Science (UNDOS) aims to: ``Generate knowledge,
   support innovation, and develop solutions for equitable and sustainable
   development of the ocean economy under changing environmental, social
   and climate conditions.{''} Changing conditions affect certain groups
   more than others, depending on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
   capacity. Gendered differentiation has been studied in small scale
   coastal fisheries. However, this approach is often limited to
   male-female gender dichotomies. In contrast, the present analysis takes
   a more expansive approach centered around the concept of
   intersectionality, to demonstrate more nuanced differences in terms of
   individuals' access to resources for adaptation. We build on multiple
   Earth System Governance contextual conditions and research lenses to
   demonstrate that an intersectional approach allows greater understanding
   of gendered adaptation options impacted by various other factors. This
   must include investigations beyond the traditional gender binary, which
   we have sought to achieve in this study by using broader local and
   individualistic context to observe different communities. We compare
   gender intersectionality in case studies from India and Tanzania. The
   evidence demonstrates that intersectional factors vary, impacting
   adaptiveness to changing Anthropocene conditions, depending upon
   cross-cutting context-specific systems of hierarchy and discrimination.
   However, despite variation, we demonstrate there are common factors to
   be investigated across all locations when identifying possible
   intersectional impacts of ocean policy interventions, particularly
   wealth, marriage and family roles, and social networks.},

Abstract = {Almost three out of four EU citizens live in urban areas. Knowledge on
   the city's environmental structure and capabilities is needed as
   urbanization is expected to continue. In this study, eight indicators on
   urban ecosystems condition (ECIs) were quantified for 305 EU cities
   (>100.000 inhabitants). A composite indicator (CI), based on the ECIs,
   indicated differences between northern and southern EU countries, with
   Umea having the highest CI value (1.56) and Napoli the lowest (-1.21).
   Positive effects of urban green infrastructure (GI) were found for NO2
   removal, recreation opportunities and lowered urban heat island effect.
   The proportion of green and built infrastructure differs between city
   cores and larger urban zones, and the area outside the core hosts a
   considerable part of the overall GI. This zone is thus of importance for
   the provisioning of urban ecosystem services, to be considered when
   planning for urban growth and climate adaptation strategies.},

Title = {How local communities attribute livelihood vulnerabilities to climate
   change and other causes: a case study in North Vanuatu},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Number = {3-4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Understanding the causal factors of livelihood challenges and associated
   vulnerabilities is essential for developing viable adaptation
   strategies. However, clarifying which livelihood challenges can be
   attributed to which causal factors remains a challenge. In this paper,
   we used a case study in Vanuatu to show how local populations attribute
   subsistence challenges to underlying causes. Particularly, we are
   interested in whether there is a tendency to view climate change as the
   primary cause, and if so, why. We followed a participatory approach
   involving local community members and experts at all stages of the study
   process. For this, we used complementary research methods such as
   resource mapping, participant observation, and in-depth interviews with
   local community members and local agriculture experts. The results show
   that local populations are indeed inclined to attribute problems to
   external causes, particularly climate change. However, the results also
   indicate that this external attribution is not definitive. Rather, we
   find that over the course of participatory reflection, attribution to
   climate change was supplemented and even replaced by internal causal
   factors, such as changes in garden practices. Our findings suggest that
   the initial emphasis on climate change may be related to prevailing
   narratives that may have influenced individual perceptions of the study
   participants and created social desirability. If such bias is not
   recognized, the narratives risk being reified, with potential new
   insights being overlooked. As a result, local attribution may overstate
   or understate specific causes, such as climate change.},

Abstract = {The annual hurricane related losses to Caribbean residential buildings
   in the past two decades highlight the societal and socioeconomic
   vulnerability of these islands. Despite considerable hurricane disaster
   mitigation activity in the Caribbean Community and Common Market
   (CARICOM), the housing sector in particular remains at an elevated risk
   for damage. Improving the structural resiliency of homes has been
   largely ineffective, as was illustrated by damage to most of the
   Grenadian housing stock from Hurricane Ivan in 2004. While international
   and regional interventions have provided emergency postdisaster aid,
   sustained efforts to improve design and construction practices and
   foster sustainable mitigation activity are lacking, with the limited
   projects not gaining much traction in the construction sector. This
   paper provides an exploratory framework of the issues surrounding wind
   damage mitigation and the construction of residential structures to
   improve overall hurricane resilience in the CARICOM states. It
   synthesizes 35 years of research findings about Caribbean hazard
   mitigation initiatives, many of which are not available to researchers
   in other geographic settings. The uniqueness of the Caribbean housing
   stock, the importance of small-scale economies, the existing
   socioeconomic constraints, and the effectiveness of regional and
   international residential construction mitigation strategies are also
   evaluated. Finally, the paper identifies and prioritizes critical
   avenues of future research to improve the resiliency of the CARICOM
   residential building stock.},

Title = {Community assembly, niche conservatism, and adaptive evolution in

Abstract = {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and
   environmental conditions, the ``fit{''} of organisms to their
   environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits.
   Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological
   sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance
   of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat
   tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at
   the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities,
   plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are
   well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of
   associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal
   or near-optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The
   predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related
   to habitat occupancy, e. g., environmental tolerances, will be under
   stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed
   pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i. e., ecological and
   phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche
   conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck's
   concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which
   a species' distributional responses to environmental conditions will
   lead to a ``mismatch{''} between its environmental tolerances and the
   environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive
   evolution: (1) the colonization of ``environmental islands{''} (habitats
   that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive
   shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the
   persistence of ``trailing-edge{''} populations in species tracking
   changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent
   competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses
   to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space,
   in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which
   they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary
   response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These
   three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role
   of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context
   for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous
   and changing environments.},

Title = {Assessing the vulnerability of beach tourism and non-beach tourism to
   climate change: a case study from Jamaica},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1197-1215},
Abstract = {The Jamaican tourism industry is very climate sensitive, and, like most
   Caribbean islands, Jamaica's main tourism product is coastal, centered
   on ``sun, sea and sand{''}. The island is susceptible to many risks
   posed by climate change, including sea level rise and extreme events,
   with resultant impacts such as beach erosion, flooding, saline intrusion
   into aquifers and general coastal degradation. This paper evaluates the
   relative vulnerability of beach versus non-beach tourism in Jamaica,
   using 43 pre-determined literature-linked indicators. These comprise
   bio-geophysical, social, technological, economical, technological and
   institutional factors. Four case areas are assessed using multi-criteria
   decision analysis to derive vulnerability scores for each area. The
   study finds that non-beach tourism operations should not be
   automatically perceived as less vulnerable than beach-based operations.
   Sustainable adaptation options are complex and numerous, and overall
   beach tourism businesses have better insurance, emergency savings,
   disaster plans and backup power facilities, among others. They also have
   the advantage of being in business longer than the inland resorts, a
   firmer business structure and an extensive marketing budget. In the long
   term, better adaptation and planning by inland businesses could change
   this balance.},

Title = {Adapting to climate change at the national level in Caribbean small
   island developing states},
Journal = {ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-100},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) are distinct from other developing
   countries: they are particularly and comparatively more vulnerable to
   the impacts of climate change. Efforts to understand national-level
   vulnerability in these countries are limited. This paper helps to fill
   this gap and has two main aims. First, it identifies trends in
   national-level climate change adaptation among SIDS in the Caribbean
   region. Second, it identifies the limits to adaptation at the national
   level in these countries. In applying a resilience lens, and using
   summative content analysis techniques and semi-structured interviews
   with 26 senior policy-makers, this paper finds that Caribbean SIDS are
   primarily adapting to changes in hurricane, rainfall, and drought
   patterns. It also finds that most adaptations are being undertaken in
   the coastal zone and the water and agriculture sectors, and that there
   are many factors limiting national-level adaptation. The most commonly
   reported limit is financing, though not all policy-makers agree that
   financing is a limit. These findings are important for national SIDS
   governments and international donors and agencies that will be better
   able to identify and fill gaps in their adaptation actions and
   financing. This paper's findings also highlight the importance of
   depoliticising climate change and prioritising good governance,
   improving SIDS' access to international adaptation financing, and making
   the road to a climate-resilient future by walking.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {831-842},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change will have pervasive effects on the world's coasts, but at
   broad scales these changes have typically proven difficult to analyse in
   a systematic manner. This paper explores an outcome-driven deductive
   methodology for geomorphological analysis that recognises the
   nonlinearity of coastal morphology and organises current knowledge and
   understanding using fuzzy logic concepts. Building on recent large-scale
   coastal investigations and with reference to a case study of the East
   Anglian coast, U.K., the methodology defines the active coastal system
   using a flexible generic classification and integrates expert opinion,
   using the notion of possibility, as a basis for the assessment of
   potential future geomorphological response to changes in sea level and
   sediment supply.
   Preliminary results for the East Anglian coast suggest that the
   constraining of the active coastal system by sea defences is already
   having, and will continue to be, a significant influence on coastal
   evolution irrespective of the rate of sea-level rise. Therefore,
   significant potential exists to guide future coastal evolution toward
   preferred outcomes by using this approach as a component of adaptive
   shoreline management. This methodology could be applied to a wide range
   of problems both in geomorphology and other subjects.},

Title = {Nature-based solutions for urban heat mitigation in historical and
   cultural block: The case of Beijing Old City},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urban heat island can exacerbate the harmful influence on human health
   and urban environment in historical and cultural block within Beijing
   Old City, China. To improve urban resilience and human well-being,
   protect historical and cultural heritage, nature-based solutions for
   urban heat mitigation are being the hotspot of research. However, only
   few studies focused on the comprehensive thermal environment of
   historical and cultural block from the social, ecological and technical
   aspects. Thus, we set-up scenarios combining with the three domains, to
   explore the cooling effect and thermal comfort improvement of Dashilar
   Block through ENVI-met. The results showed that 1) The areas with
   highest air temperature (Ta) and physiological equivalent temperature
   (PET) were mainly distributed in Peizhi Hutong and Zongshu Toutiao. 2)
   Five mitigation scenarios adapting to historical protection requirements
   and public preferences were vertical greening, traditional greening,
   quality improvement greening, high-albedo paving, and comprehensive. 3)
   The comprehensive and vertical greening scenarios could reduce the mean
   Ta of whole block by 1.01 degrees C or 0.38 degrees C, decrease the
   percentage of Ta hotter zone by 13.87\% or 19.63\%, and reduce the local
   Ta inside the block by 0.65 degrees C-1.80 degrees C or 0.33 degrees
   C-1.05 degrees C, respectively, which turned out the cooling effect and
   thermal comfort improvement of abovementioned two scenarios could
   significantly alleviate the heat stress. The comprehensive and vertical
   greening can act as the preferred nature-based solution for heat
   mitigation in Dashilar Block. We believed that this study would provide
   novel insights into the balance between urban heat mitigation and
   heritage protection during the renewal of Beijing Old City.},

Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {12-22},

Abstract = {Climate change is projected to alter the geographic distribution of
   forest ecosystems. This study aimed to evaluate the consequences of
   climate change on geographical distributions and habitat suitability of
   14 threatened forest tree species in the Philippines. Based on the
   principle of maximum entropy, it utilized a machine algorithm called
   Maxent to estimate a target probability distribution and habitat
   suitability of the selected species. Threatened forest tree species
   occurrence records and sets of biophysical and bioclimatic variables
   were inputted to Maxent program to predict current and future
   distribution of the species. The Maxent models of the threatened species
   were evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under Curve
   (ROC AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS) tests which revealed that the
   models generated were better than random. The Maxent models ROC AUC
   values of the 14 species range from 0.70 to 0.972 which is higher than
   0.5 of a null model. Based on TSS criteria, Maxent models performed good
   in two species, very good in ten species, and excellent in two species.
   Seven species (Afzelia rhomboidea; Koordersiodendron pinnatum; Mangifera
   altissima; Shorea contorta; Shorea palosapis; Shorea polysperma; Vitex
   parviflora) were found to likely benefit from future climate due to the
   potential increase in their suitable habitat while the other seven
   species (Agathis philippinensis; Celtis luzonica; Dipterocarpus
   grandiflorus; Shorea guiso; Shorea negrosensis; Toona calantas; Vatica
   mangachapoi) will likely experience decline in their suitable habitat.
   This study provided an initial understanding on how the distribution of
   threatened forest trees will be affected by climate change in the
   Philippines. The generated species distribution models and habitat
   suitability maps could be used as basis in formulating appropriate
   science-based adaptation policies, strategies and measures that could
   enhance the resilience of those threatened forest tree species and their
   natural ecosystems to current and future climate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Purpose Considering the varied and dynamic workload of vessel traffic
   service (VTS) operators, design an adaptive rotating shift solution to
   prevent them from getting tired while ensuring continuous high-quality
   services and finally guarantee a benign maritime traffic environment.
   Design/methodology/approach The problem of rotating shift in VTS and its
   influencing factors are analyzed first, then the framework of automatic
   identification system (AIS) data analytics is proposed, as well as the
   data model to extract spatial-temporal information. Besides,
   K-means-based anomaly detection method is adjusted to generate
   anomaly-free data, with which the traffic trend analysis and prediction
   are made. Based on this knowledge, strategies and methods for adaptive
   rotating shift design are worked out. Findings In VTS, vessel number and
   speed are identified as two most crucial factors influencing operators'
   workload. Based on the two factors, the proposed data model is verified
   to be effective on reducing data size and improving data processing
   efficiency. Besides, the K-means-based anomaly detection method could
   provide stable results, and the work shift pattern planning algorithm
   could efficiently generate acceptable solutions based on maritime
   traffic information. Originality/value This is a pioneer work on
   utilizing maritime traffic data to facilitate the operation management
   in VTS, which provides a new direction to improve their daily
   management. Besides, a systematic data-driven solution for adaptive
   rotating shift is proposed, including knowledge discovery method and
   decision-making algorithm for adaptive rotating shift design. The
   technical framework is flexible and can be extended for managing other
   activities in VTS or adapted in diverse fields.},

Title = {Future variability of solute transport in a macrotidal estuary},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {88-99},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {The physical controls on salt distribution and river-sourced
   conservative solutes, including the potential implications of climate
   change, are investigated referring to model simulations of a macrotidal
   estuary. In the UK, such estuaries typically react rapidly to rainfall
   events and, as such, are often in a state of non-equilibrium in terms of
   solute transport; hence are particularly sensitive to climate extremes.
   Sea levels are projected to rise over the 21st century, extending the
   salinity maximum upstream in estuaries, which will also affect
   downstream solute transport, promoting estuarine trapping and reducing
   offshore dispersal of material. Predicted `drier summers' and `wetter
   winters' in the UK will influence solute transport further still; we
   found that projected river flow climate changes were more influential
   than sea-level rise, especially for low flow conditions. Our simulations
   show that projected climate change for the UK is likely to increase
   variability in estuarine solute transport and, specifically, increase
   the likelihood of estuarine trapping during summer, mainly due to drier
   weather conditions. Future changes in solute transport were less certain
   during winter, since increased river flow will to some extent counteract
   the effects of sea-level rise. Our results have important implications
   for non-conservative nutrient transport, water quality, coastal
   management and ecosystem resilience. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Similar thermal breadth of two temperate coral species from the
   Mediterranean Sea and two tropical coral species from the Great Barrier
   Reef},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1281-1295},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Temperate organisms are generally exposed to a more variable and cooler
   climate than tropical organisms, and are therefore expected to have
   broader thermal tolerance and a different thermal performance curve.
   This study investigated these hypotheses by comparing the thermal
   performance of two common tropical coral species found in the Great
   Barrier Reef with the two most common temperate coral species from the
   Mediterranean Sea. Photosynthesis rates, dark respiration rates, maximum
   PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and electron transport rates (rETR(m)) were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the average environmental
   seawater temperature. Dark respiration rates and F-v/F-m increased
   linearly with temperature, suggesting broad thermal tolerance. For
   photosynthesis and rETR(m), the performance breadths were surprisingly
   similar between the tropical and temperate species. However, the thermal
   optimum for performance was generally below the local average
   temperature, and only coincided with the prevailing environmental
   temperature for one of the tropical species. The broad thermal tolerance
   for photosynthesis displayed in this study supports previous
   observations that corals can survive short periods of abnormally warm
   temperatures and suggests that corals adopt thermal generalist
   strategies to cope with temperature variation in the environment.
   Nevertheless, current mean temperatures are 10-30\% above the thermal
   optimum for the species studied here, demonstrating that conditions are
   already pushing the boundaries of coral thermal tolerance.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, was introduced to Europe for
   aquaculture purposes, and has had a rapid and unforeseen northward
   expansion in northern Europe. The recent dramatic increase in number of
   C. gigas populations along the species' northern distribution limit has
   questioned the efficiency of Skagerrak as a dispersal barrier for
   transport and survival of larvae. We investigated the genetic
   connectivity and possible spreading patterns between Pacific oyster
   populations on the southern Norwegian coast (4 localities) and Swedish
   and Danish populations by means of DNA microsatellite analysis of adult
   oysters, and by simulating larvae drift. In the simulations we used a 3D
   oceanographic model to explore the influence of recent climate change
   (1990 - 2010) on development, survival, and successful spreading of
   Danish and Swedish Pacific oyster larvae to Norwegian coastal waters.
   The simulations indicated adequate temperature conditions for
   development, survival, and settlement of larvae across the Skagerrak in
   warm years since 2000. However, microsatellite genotyping revealed
   genetic differences between the Norwegian populations, and between the
   Norwegian populations and the Swedish and Danish populations, the latter
   two populations being more similar. This patchwork pattern of genetic
   dissimilarity among the Norwegian populations points towards multiple
   local introduction routes rather than the commonly assumed
   unidirectional entry of larvae drifted from Denmark and Sweden.
   Alternative origins of introduction and implications for management,
   such as forecasting and possible mitigation actions, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Non-coastal flood events in the UK are usually associated with extreme
   rainfall and can last from minutes to weeks. Efficient management and
   mitigation of flood risk requires accurate and reliable precipitation
   forecasts as inputs to flood risk models. We constructed an archive of
   British Rainfall data from 1866 to the present day to improve our
   understanding of historical extreme rainfall events. The relationship
   between record rainfall and flooding is nonlinear and uncertain,
   implying that probabilistic forecasts of rainfall are required. We
   developed an objective classification scheme of extreme rainfall events
   consisting of eight types, analysed extreme rainfall events and produced
   probabilistic forecasts by combining statistical techniques with the
   outputs of ensemble predictions from a numerical weather predictions

Abstract = {Psychrophilic microorganisms are cold-adapted with distinct properties
   from other thermal classes thriving in cold conditions in large areas of
   the earth's cold environment. Maintenance of functional membranes,
   evolving cold-adapted enzymes and synthesizing a range of structural
   features are basic adaptive strategies of psychrophiles. Among the
   cold-evolved enzymes are the cold-active lipases, a group of microbial
   lipases with inherent stability-activity-flexibility property that have
   engaged the interest of researchers over the years. Current knowledge
   regarding these cold-evolved enzymes in psychrophilic bacteria proves a
   display of high catalytic efficiency with low thermal stability, which
   is a differentiating feature with that of their mesophilic and
   thermophilic counterparts. Improvement strategies of their adaptive
   structural features have significantly benefited the enzyme industry.
   Based on their homogeneity and purity, molecular characterizations of
   these enzymes have been successful and their properties make them unique
   biocatalysts for various industrial and biotechnological applications.
   Although, strong association of lipopolysaccharides from Antarctic
   microorganisms with lipid hydrolases pose a challenge in their
   purification, heterologous expression of the cold-adapted lipases with
   affinity tags simplifies purification with higher yield. The review
   discusses these cold-evolved lipases from bacteria and their peculiar
   properties, in addition to their potential biotechnological and

Abstract = {Deep-sea ecosystems share a common physical parameter, namely high
   hydrostatic pressure (HHP). Some of the microorganisms isolated at great
   depths have a high physiological plasticity to face pressure variations.
   The adaptive strategies by which deep-sea microorganisms cope with HHP
   variations remain to be elucidated, especially considering the extent of
   their biotopes on Earth. Herein, we investigated the gene expression
   patterns of Thermococcus piezophilus, a piezohyperthermophilic archaeon
   isolated from the deepest hydrothermal vent known to date, under
   sub-optimal, optimal and supra-optimal pressures (0.1, 50, and 90 MPa,
   respectively). At stressful pressures {[}sub-optimal (0.1 MPa) and
   supra-optimal (90 MPa) conditions], no classical stress response was
   observed. Instead, we observed an unexpected transcriptional modulation
   of more than a hundred gene clusters, under the putative control of the
   master transcriptional regulator SurR, some of which are described as
   being involved in energy metabolism. This suggests a fine-tuning effect
   of HHP on the SurR regulon. Pressure could act on gene regulation, in
   addition to modulating their expression.},

Title = {Cascading effects of cyclones on the biodiversity of Southwest Pacific
   islands},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {193},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Human induced climate change is having a dramatic impact on global
   biodiversity and insular assemblages are particularly vulnerable.
   However, the cascading impacts of tropical cyclones on insular
   ecosystems are poorly understood and expected to grow with the
   increasing intensity of these events associated with future
   anthropogenic climate change. This problem is particularly relevant to
   islands of the Southwest Pacific, which are cyclone prone and support
   high levels of endemic biodiversity. In this perspective, we present new
   information from a case study of the indirect effects of a tropical
   cyclone (Ita) on forest extent and integrity from an endemic hotspot,
   the Louisiade Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. We highlight how a
   cyclone event can be a catalyst for human coping strategies that
   increase pressures on forest ecosystems and expose them to invasive
   plant species. These changes represent a major threat to
   forest-dependent bird species, many of which are endemic. Rather than
   being an isolated example, these observations provide an insight into
   human responses to climate change over cyclone-prone tropical
   islands/regions where human populations are reliant upon subsistence
   agriculture and the resources provided by forests. The cumulative
   anthropogenic impacts on forest ecosystems are potentially catastrophic
   to the future of island biodiversity and greater than the long-term
   shifts in mean climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate variability and farmer's vulnerability in a flood-prone district
   of Assam},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-200},
Abstract = {Purpose - The Indian state of Assam is situated in a high rainfall zone
   and the river Brahmaputra flowing through the state causes annual floods
   which adversely impact the agro-economic base of the region. The
   situation is likely to become exacerbated under the impact of climate
   change. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the vulnerability of
   the farmers in Assam to floods in the scenario of the present climate
   variability taking a case study of the Majuli Island of Jorhat district.
   Design/methodology/approach - The current vulnerability of the farmers
   in the Majuli Island of Jorhat district of Assam is quantified using the
   ``indicator method{''}. A Composite Vulnerability Index is calculated
   taking into account various indicators reflective of the exposure,
   sensitivity and the adaptive capacity of the farmers' community to
   floods. The indicators have been quantified based on the data obtained
   from household surveys and participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) in the
   villages and secondary data sources.
   Findings - The results show that biophysical factors have the greatest
   impact on the overall vulnerability of the study area and that
   strengthened adaptive capacity, proper scientific planning and
   management is required to protect the Majuli Island from the adverse
   effects of recurrent floods.
   Originality/value - This paper shows that the more decentralized the
   spatial unit of vulnerability assessment is, the more helpful it would
   be for policy makers and stakeholders to formulate efficient mitigation
   measures, plan apposite developmental programmes and improve the
   adaptive capacity of Assam as a whole to face the natural phenomenon of
   floods.},

Title = {Modeling Epidemic Spread among a Commuting Population Using Transport
   Schemes},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 between connected
   communities is fundamental in planning appropriate mitigation measures.
   To that end, we propose and analyze a novel metapopulation network
   model, particularly suitable for modeling commuter traffic patterns,
   that takes into account the connectivity between a heterogeneous set of
   communities, each with its own infection dynamics. In the novel
   metapopulation model that we propose here, transport schemes developed
   in optimal transport theory provide an efficient and easily
   implementable way of describing the temporary population redistribution
   due to traffic, such as the daily commuter traffic between work and
   residence. Locally, infection dynamics in individual communities are
   described in terms of a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR)
   compartment model, modified to account for the specific features of
   COVID-19, most notably its spread by asymptomatic and presymptomatic
   infected individuals. The mathematical foundation of our metapopulation
   network model is akin to a transport scheme between two population
   distributions, namely the residential distribution and the workplace
   distribution, whose interface can be inferred from commuter mobility
   data made available by the US Census Bureau. We use the proposed
   metapopulation model to test the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 on
   two networks, a smaller one comprising 7 counties in the Greater
   Cleveland area in Ohio, and a larger one consisting of 74 counties in
   the Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Detroit corridor following the Lake Erie's
   American coastline. The model simulations indicate that densely
   populated regions effectively act as amplifiers of the infection for the
   surrounding, less densely populated areas, in agreement with the pattern
   of infections observed in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computed
   examples show that the model can be used also to test different
   mitigation strategies, including one based on state-level travel
   restrictions, another on county level triggered social distancing, as
   well as a combination of the two.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variations in seabird bycatch: Incidental bycatch
   in the Norwegian coastal gillnet-fishery},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {The general decline of seabird populations worldwide raises large
   concerns. Although multiple factors are interacting to cause the
   observed trends, increased mortality from incidental bycatch in
   fisheries has proven to be important for many species. However, the bulk
   of published knowledge is derived from longline fisheries, whereas
   bycatch in gillnet fisheries is less studied and even overlooked in some
   areas. We present seabird bycatch data from a 10-year time-series of
   fishery data from the large fleet of small-vessels fishing with gillnets
   along the Norwegian coast a large area and fishery with no prior
   estimates of seabird bycatch. In general, we document high rates of
   incidental bycatch (averaging 0.0023 seabirds/net, or approximately 0.08
   seabirds/fishing trip). This results in an estimated annual bycatch
   between 1580 and 11500 (95\% CI) birds in this fishery. There was a
   surprisingly high percentage (43\%) of surface-feeding seabirds in the
   bycatch, with northern fulmar being the most common species. Among the
   diving seabirds caught, common guillemot was most numerous. Our findings
   suggest that coastal gillnet fisheries represent a more general threat
   to a wider range of seabird populations, as opposed to longline
   fisheries where surface-feeding seabird species seem to dominate the
   bycatch. The bycatch estimates for the Norwegian gillnet-fishery varied
   in time, between areas, and with fishing depth and distance from the
   coast, but we found no clear trends in relation to the type of gillnets
   used. The results enabled us to identify important spatio-temporal
   trends in the seabird bycatch, which can allow for the development and
   implementation of more specific mitigation measures. While specific time
   closures might be an efficient option to reduce bycatch for diving
   seabirds, measures such as gear modification and reduction in release of
   wastewater during fishing operation are probably a more effective
   mitigation approach for reducing bycatch of surface-feeding seabirds.},

Abstract = {The Magdalena River, located in Colombia, is considered the longest
   South American interandino river and the most important in the country.
   It has a length of 1,550 km from its origin at 3,385 meters above sea
   level to its mouth at the Caribbean Sea. In the last 10 years, the
   hydrological regime of the river has changed by having more frequently
   high and low flow rates which have caused a relatively rapid
   morphological changes in the delta area. This paper reports the results
   of evaluating the hydro-morphodynamic conditions of the river at its
   delta area form the river mouth to 115 Km upstream, under extreme high
   and low events. A 2D/3D numerical model was setup in Delft-3D. The
   results reported in the hydro-morphodynamic analysis suggest that
   temporary hydrological changes may cause significant short-term
   morphological changes in the delta area of Magdalena River. In addition,
   it suggests that river training works should include adaptive strategies
   for hydrological regime changes caused by climate change, watershed
   modification or El Nino and La Nina. phenomena.},

Abstract = {Urban landscape and land-use structure, particularly that of built
   space, were found to have a significant impact on environmental
   exposures, e.g., on the level and spatial distribution of particle and
   noise exposure in cities. Climate change will increase the frequency,
   duration and intensity of heat waves. Hence, the question arises: how do
   urban structures affect the shape and intensity of urban temperature
   conditions? To answer this question, multiple urban structures have been
   quantified in terms of their structural patterns and configuration using
   the landscape metric (BM) approach. The results of a linear regression
   analysis showed that both the edge density and patch size ratio are
   significantly correlated with the spread and intensity of temperatures
   across all urban built structures. The analysis shows that the higher
   the proportion and structural complexity of the built area, the higher
   are the morning and evening surface temperatures. LSMs were found to be
   very well suited as analysis models of the site-specific temperature
   impact beyond the aggregate city level. Hence, they may serve as a
   planning tool for urban adaptation measures to climate change. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Under ocean warming and acidification, diatoms use a unique acclimation
   and adaptation strategy by saving energy and utilizing it for other
   cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this
   reprogramming of energy utilization are currently unknown. Here, we
   investigate the metabolic reprogramming of the ecologically important
   diatomSkeletonema dohrniigrown under two different temperature (21
   degrees C and 25 degrees C) andpCO(2)(400 and 1000 ppm) levels,
   utilizing global transcriptomic analysis. We find that evolutionary
   changes in the baseline gene expression, which we termed transcriptional
   up- and downregulation, is the primary mechanism used by diatoms to
   acclimate to the combined conditions of ocean warming and acidification.
   This transcriptional regulation shows that under higher temperature
   andpCO(2)conditions, photosynthesis, electron transport and
   carboxylation were modified with increasing abundances of genes encoding
   ATP, NADPH and carbon gaining for the carbon-dioxide-concentrating
   mechanisms (CCMs). Our results also indicate that changes in the
   transcriptional regulation of CCMs led to a decrease in the metabolic
   cost to save energy by promoting amino acid synthesis and nitrogen
   assimilation for the active protein processing machinery to adapt to
   warming and ocean acidification. This study generated unique metabolic
   insights into diatoms and suggests that future climate change conditions
   will cause evolutionary changes in oceanic diatoms that will facilitate
   their acclimation strategy.},

Title = {Ensemble projections of fish distribution in response to climate changes
   in the Yellow and Bohai Seas, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {146},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change is an important driving force affecting species
   distribution, so quantifying the influences of climate change on species
   distributions is necessary for effective fishery management. To identify
   the geographical distribution pattern and future potential suitable
   habitat area of fishes in the Yellow and Bohai Seas (YBS), we built
   ensemble models of spatial distribution for 22 important fish species
   using 3185 valid distributional records and 9 environmental variables
   extracted from multiple databases. The constructed ensemble models
   showed high accuracy with mean AUC, Kappa and TSS values of 0.97, 0.82
   and 0.84. Salinity and temperature proximal to the seabed were the main
   environmental factors affecting the distribution of fishes. Presently,
   the number of important fish species (NIFS) tends to be low in the Bohai
   Sea and high in the Yellow Sea. Future projections indicated that there
   would be obvious interspecific differences in the geographical
   distribution of fishes, and the number of species with range
   contractions is predicted to be greater than that of range expansions.
   Coastal fishes and cold temperate fishes are predicted to narrow their
   occupied areas. In the future, the NIFS in the YBS is expected to
   increase overall. Spatially, sporadic areas in the central and southern
   Yellow Sea will have a reduced NIFS, while the Bohai Sea, coastal waters
   near the southern Shandong Peninsula and the northern East China Sea may
   experience increased NIFS. Our results provide a theoretical basis for
   predicting the climate-driven range shifts of fishes in one of the
   world's most heavily impacted marine ecosystems, that can be extended to
   develop climate-adaptive management strategies.},

Title = {Development of a comprehensive assessment model for coral reef island
   carrying capacity(CORE-CC)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Coral reef islands provide precious living space and valuable ecological
   services for human beings, and its sustainability cannot be ignored
   under the pressure of human activities. Carrying capacity (CC)
   assessment has gradually become an important means to measure
   sustainability of islands. However, there is little comprehensive
   evaluation of the carrying capacity of coral reef islands, and
   traditional evaluation methods are difficult to express the
   social-ecological characteristics of coral reef islands. The present
   paper proposes a comprehensive assessment model for coral reef island
   carrying capacity (CORE-CC) which comprises dimensions of resources
   supply, environmental assimilative, ecosystem services, and
   socio-economic supporting. According to the characteristics of the coral
   reef islands, the core factors and indicators of each dimension are
   selected and the corresponding assessment index system of
   ``pressure-support{''} is constructed. The assessment involves (1)
   identification of carrying dimensions and core factors, (2)
   pressure/support measurement and (3) assessment of carrying state. A
   case study is conducted in Zhaoshu Island of China, demonstrating the
   applicability of CORE-CC model and serving as a reference for adaptive
   management.},

Title = {Exposure of Santos Harbor Metropolitan Area (Brazil) toWave and Storm
   Surge Climate Changes},
Journal = {WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {73-88},

Abstract = {Santos Harbor Metropolitan Area (SHMA) in Sao Paulo Coastline (Brazil)
   is the most important marine cargo transfer terminal in the Southern
   Hemisphere. In previous studies, the authors showed how this area is
   subject to climate changes determining, in the long run, a sea level
   rise and, as a consequence, a consistent impact on the global sea level
   rise and subsidence. In this research, a further and innovative analysis
   of a long-term-wave database (1957-2002) generated from a comparison
   between wave data modeled on a ``deep water model{''} (ERA-40 Wave
   model-ECMWF) and wave data measured by a coastal buoy, over the years
   19821984, in SHMA littoral (Sao Paulo State, Brazil) was carried out.
   The calibration coefficients, according to angular sectors of the wave
   direction, were obtained by comparing the measured data with the modeled
   data and applying them to the original scenarios using a near-shore
   wavemodel (MIKE21). The analysis of the wave climate changes on the
   extreme storm surge wave conditions, selecting cases of H-s > 3.0 m and
   using that virtual database, has shown an increase in the wave
   significant height (H-s) and in the wave peak period (T-p) and also in
   the frequency of storm surge events in the last decades. Considering the
   increase in the sea hazards and the high values of the facilities and
   infrastructures in SHMA, it is necessary to minimize the risks. Hence,
   the adaptation policies linked to climate changes which determine an
   impact on storm surges either for the SHMA or for Sao Paulo coastal area
   are highlighted on the basis of the results obtained by the authors.},

Abstract = {Root morphology and root system architecture of young Posidonia oceanica
   plants established on two contrasting substrate types, sand and rock,
   were examined to provide insights into the strategy of adaptation of
   seagrasses to their environment. After germination, seedlings were
   planted on sandy patches and on rock within the same area, and survived
   plants were collected five years later for measurements of the size of
   the entire root complex and analysis of individual morphological and
   architectural root traits. Collected plants exhibited up to nine highly
   intermingled root systems and approx. 2.5 m of total root length.
   Maximum horizontal extension, total biomass and total length of roots
   were not significantly affected by substrate. However, on sand roots
   grew vertically reaching up to 13 cm, while on rock they extended more
   horizontally and did not penetrate deeper than 5-7 cm leading to the
   formation of a shallow, densely packed root complex. On rock, the number
   and the length of second-order laterals on an individual root system
   were reduced and the topological index higher than on sand (0.8 vs. 0.7)
   reflecting a more simple (herringbone) branching pattern. Again, root
   diameter was greater than on sand. The results suggest that P. oceanica
   can adjust root traits early during plant development according to
   substrate typology to maximize anchorage and substrate exploration
   efficiency. This plasticity enables the species to establish and persist
   also on rocky bottoms which generally prevent establishment of the
   majority of seagrasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) poses a significant threat to many coastal areas
   and will likely have important impacts on socio-economic development in
   those regions. Located on the eastern coast in China, the megacity of
   Shanghai is particularly vulnerable to SLR and associated storm surge
   risks. Using the municipality of Shanghai as a case study, the possible
   impacts of flooding risks caused by SLR and associated storm surges on
   socio-economic development in the region were analysed by a
   Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence (SPRC) conceptual model. The
   projections of flooding risk in the study area were simulated by MIKE21
   (a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model) for the three time periods of
   2030, 2050 and 2100. An index system for vulnerability assessment was
   devised, in which flooding depth, density of population, GDP per capita,
   GDP per unit land, loss rate under flooding and fiscal revenue were
   selected as the key indicators. A quantitative spatial assessment method
   based on a GIS platform was established by quantifying each indicator,
   calculating and then grading the vulnerability index. The results showed
   that in the 2030 projection, 99.3 \% of the areas show no vulnerability
   to SLR and associated storm surges under the present infrastructure. By
   2050, the areas with low, moderate and high vulnerabilities change
   significantly to 5.3, 8.0 and 23.9 \%, respectively, while by 2100, the
   equivalent figures are 12.9, 6.3 and 30.7 \%. The application of the
   SPRC model, the methodology and the results from this study could assist
   with the objective and quantitative assessment of the socio-economic
   vulnerability of other similar coastal regions undergoing the impacts of
   SLR and associated storm surges. Based on the results of this study,
   mitigation and adaptation measures should be considered, which include
   the controlling the rate of land subsidence, the reinforcement of
   coastal defence systems and the introduction of adaptation in long-term
   urban planning.},

Abstract = {The climate change and human development in lake catchments have put
   these habitats in drying conditions, e.g. Aral Sea in Asia, Lake Chad in
   Africa, Lake Mead in USA, Lake Urmia in Iran, etc. These ecosystems play
   an important role in social, ecological, and economic activities. Lake
   Urmia, recognized as an international wetland in 1973 and located in
   Iran, which is the second largest hypersaline lake in the world, is in
   the same state. Lake Urmia biologically and ecologically is one of the
   most interesting places in the world. This lake is a habitat for various
   species. The lake's surface has shrunken from 6000 km(2) to 900 km(2) in
   2013. The statistics indicate that the population has increased by 13\%
   during this period, which shows that in addition to natural causes such
   as climate change and global warming, human related issues like
   population growth and urban development have the most important role in
   the lake's status. This paper presents an innovative method for
   estimating the wetland HSE statues to make preventive measures and bring
   an acceptable coexistence of both the lake with all its ecological and
   environmental features and the urban areas as sustainable and resilient
   cities. (C) 2016 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Linking the social, economic, and agroecological: a resilience framework
   for dairy farming},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Agriculture is a major economic driver in Aotearoa-New Zealand (New
   Zealand), led by export earnings from dairy farming. Dairying is
   uniquely exposed to climatic- and nonclimatic socioeconomic stressors,
   which have their greatest effects on production and yield. The growing
   need to consider these and other changes is accelerating efforts aimed
   at ensuring greater resilience, adaptability, and flexibility within the
   industry. To gain insight into these dynamics at the farm-level, a
   resilience-based assessment framework was piloted with three different
   types of dairy farming systems, following extensive drought on the east
   coast of the North Island. Using a participatory and bottom-up approach,
   the framework was used to qualitatively explore the potential
   significance of varying social, economic, and agroecological attributes
   between high-input, low-input, and organic systems, and their
   implications for resilience. The ``lock in trap{''} of highly intensive
   systems, although profitable in the near term, may be less resilient to
   climate shocks because these are likely to occur in conjunction with
   changing market and financial risks. Low-input systems are less
   dependent, in particular, on fossil fuels and are associated with higher
   levels of farmer satisfaction and well-being. Organic farming provides
   ecological benefits, and the financial premium paid to farmers may act
   as a short-term buffer. The framework provides insight into the current
   context at the farm level and can draw out individual perspectives on
   where to target interventions and build resilience. Results demonstrate
   the potential of in-depth qualitative assessments of resilience, which
   can usefully complement quantitative metrics. The framework can be used
   as the basis for further empirical assessment and inform the design of
   similar approaches for cross-sector comparative analysis, large-N
   surveys, or modelling. Furthermore, the preliminary characterization of
   resilient farm-systems has the potential to contribute to broader
   sustainability frameworks for agriculture and can inform strategic
   adaptation planning in the face of climate change.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Sea level rise represents potentially one of the costliest
   impacts of climate change on the Croatian coast. Therefore, the purpose
   and goal of this paper in analysing the potential effects of sea level
   rise on Croatia and the preventive measures to be taken in order to
   reduce the negative effects of sea level rise.
   Methodology - In the paper, the authors developed a model which allows
   calculations of the cost of land loss, the cost of relocating people and
   the cost of protection as a result of future sea level rise by 50 and 88
   cm in Croatia.
   Findings - The main findings of this work refer to the estimate of
   economic costs of future sea level rise. The model consists of three
   parameters to be considered, namely: the value of the submerged land,
   the cost of protection as a result of sea level rise and the costs
   caused by the displacement of people due to the loss of land.
   Contribution - The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that,
   in Croatia, there is presently a limited number of studies dealing with
   current and future sea level rise caused by climate change. In case of a
   significant sea level rise in the future, certain problems are to be
   expected, such as: the destruction of a number of commercial and fishing
   ports, the contamination of coastal freshwater springs, potential damage
   to swamps and wetlands, destruction and submersion of beaches, and the
   negative impact on tourism. It is important to emphasize that the rise
   of sea level is a slow and gradual process, and that the possibility of
   a sudden large increase of sea level is very low.},

Title = {The exposure, sensitivity and vulnerability of natural vegetation in
   China to climate thermal variability (1901-2013): An indicator-based
   approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {258-272},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Vulnerability assessments can be helpful in assessing the impact of
   climate change on natural ecosystems and are expected to support
   adaptation and/or mitigation strategies in the 21st century. A challenge
   when conducting such assessments is the integration of the multi-level
   properties and processes of ecosystems into an assessment framework.
   Focusing on the primary stresses of climate thermal variability (at both
   upper and lower extremes), this study proposes a quantitative indicator
   system following the IPCC framework of vulnerability assessment that
   assesses the impact of historical climate change, during 1901-2013, on
   the natural terrestrial vegetation types in China. The final output of
   the vulnerability assessment was expressed as a composite index,
   composed of ecosystem exposure, sensitivity and resilience to climate
   thermal change, and including biological, ecological and spatial traits
   of vegetation types in the assessment. The exposure to temperature
   variability was generally higher in January than in July, and higher in
   non-arborous vegetation types than forests. In contrast, sensitivity was
   higher for forests, wetlands and alpine tundra regions, especially for
   small areas and areas with scattered patterns. Original forests
   especially those distributed in the north had lower resilience than
   other vegetation types. The vulnerability of natural vegetation types in
   China to the temperature variability of the past century was very low to
   moderate, with a few exceptions, including tropical mangroves and the
   semiarid to arid vegetation types in northwestern China, which had high
   vulnerability. Vulnerability was stronger in winter than in summer. Our
   results are generally in accord with the scenario-based projections on
   the geographical pattern of vegetation vulnerability to climate change,
   and revealed the difference caused by not considering moisture. The
   risks for these fragmented and narrow-range ecosystems are highlighted,
   and the importance of natural resilience is stressed for the assessment
   of vegetation vulnerability to climate change. Given the inadequate
   coverage of the natural reserve network in China (after the large
   investment in recent decades) found in the high-vulnerability vegetation
   types (with a few exceptions), the assessment of natural resilience of
   ecosystems could be critical for the optimal design of socio-economic
   strategies in response to the impacts of future climate change. (C) 2015

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Half of humanity now lives in cities and the cities of the world
   continue to expand. However, inappropriate design of buildings combined
   with heat island conditions in dense urban areas and the effects of
   climate change may result in unsuitable accommodation, which is
   inherently unsustainable.
   An underlying problem in the long term housing supply has led to demand
   not being met for many years. The British government therefore announced
   that it is committed to increase the rate of house-building and support
   the use of Modern Methods of Construction as a possible solution.
   Simultaneously, in an attempt to tackle climate change, an ambitious
   target has been set for all new houses to meet net zero carbon dioxide
   emissions from 2016.
   The Mark Group Research House, a super insulated steel frame home, was
   designed to test MMC solutions and innovative technologies, and to
   achieve `zero carbon' without compromising user's comfort. A computer
   model was used to investigate the house's potential for overheating in
   today's weather as well as in future climate scenarios. The simulations
   have found that generally the house is comfortable but, despite the
   addition of mitigating strategies, there is a risk of overheating which
   is aggravated in future scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Because of the heat island phenomenon and undeniable climatic change,
   the temperature of cities continues to increase in recent years and is
   considered as one of the major problems in the 21st century. Due to the
   severity of high temperatures in city, vast research has been carried
   out to quantify the mitigation potential of quite many strategies. In
   this paper, studies about the strategies that can be applied for
   mitigating high surface temperatures were reviewed. These strategies
   could be categorized into vegetation cover, building greening, albedo
   and urban design etc. The discussion of this paper exposes the effects
   of different elements on surface temperatures and how urban structure
   can be modified to improve thermal environment. It was concluded that
   future research work should be focused on planning and design parameters
   which was helpful for planning and design professionals to improve urban
   thermal environment, and ultimately constructing a better environment

Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage is a mitigation strategy that can be used to
   aid the reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This process aims to
   capture CO2 from large point-source emitters and transport it to a
   long-term storage site. For much of Europe, these deep storage sites are
   anticipated to be sited below the sea bed on continental shelves. A key
   operational requirement is an understanding of best practice of
   monitoring for potential leakage and of the environmental impact that
   could result from a diffusive leak from a storage complex. Here we
   describe a controlled CO2 release experiment beneath the seabed, which
   overcomes the limitations of laboratory simulations and natural
   analogues. The complex processes involved in setting up the experimental
   facility and ensuring its successful operation are discussed, including
   site selection, permissions, communications and facility construction.
   The experimental design and observational strategy are reviewed with
   respect to scientific outcomes along with lessons learnt in order to
   facilitate any similar future. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate change may drive shifts in global agriculture that will affect
   remaining natural lands, with important consequences for the
   conservation of species and ecosystems. Wine production is an excellent
   model for examining this type of impact, because suitable climate is
   central to product quality and production is centered in Mediterranean
   climate regions that are all global biodiversity hotspots. Adaptation to
   climate change in existing vineyards may involve water use to ameliorate
   heat stress or drought, resulting in additional conservation issues.
   Global studies of wine, climate, and conservation have highlighted the
   need for more detailed regional analyses to better understand these
   complex multiple issues. Here we examine impacts of climate change on
   winegrape suitability in California and its possible implications for
   nature conservation and water use. Under two global climate models and
   two emissions scenarios, winegrape suitability in California is
   projected to decline overall and to move into undeveloped areas that
   provide important habitats for native species. Coastal and upslope areas
   retain and improve in suitability, respectively, while inland areas see
   the largest losses in suitability. Areas of declining suitability are
   regions in which heightened water use for vineyard adaptation may lead
   to declines in stream flow or conflicts with other water uses. Continued
   growth in global demand for wine and reduced production in areas of
   declining suitability will drive expansion into newly suitable areas,
   potentially impacting important species native to California. Existing
   vineyards in areas of declining suitability will likely need to adapt to
   remain viable. Advance planning for a changing climate and adaptation
   options that are not water intensive (e. g. vine orientation,
   trellising, or varietal switch) will help reduce potential water
   conservation issues in those areas. (JEL Classifications: Q15, Q54, Q57)},

Abstract = {Urban environmental health hazards, including exposure to extreme heat,
   have become increasingly important to understand in light of ongoing
   climate change and urbanization. In cities, neighborhoods are often
   considered a homogenous and appropriate unit with which to assess heat
   risk. This manuscript presents results from a pilot study examining the
   variability of individually experienced temperatures (IETs) within a
   single urban neighborhood. In July 2013, 23 research participants were
   recruited from the South End neighborhood of Boston and equipped with
   Thermochron iButtons that measured the air temperatures surrounding
   individuals as they went about their daily lives. IETs were measured
   during a heat wave period (July 17-20), which included 2 days with
   excessive heat warnings and 1 day with a heat advisory, as well as a
   reference period (July 20-23) in which temperatures were below seasonal
   averages. IETs were not homogeneous during the heat wave period; mean
   IETs were significantly different between participants (p < 0.001). The
   majority of participants recorded IETs significantly lower than outdoor
   ambient temperatures (OATs), and on average, the mean IET was 3.7 A
   degrees C below the mean OAT. Compared with IETs during the reference
   period, IETs during the heat wave period were 1.0 A degrees C higher.
   More than half of participants did not experience statistically
   different temperatures between the two test periods, despite the fact
   that the mean OAT was 6.5 A degrees C higher during the heat wave
   period. The IET data collected for this sample and study period suggest
   that (1) heterogeneity in individual heat exposure exists within this
   neighborhood and that (2) outdoor temperatures misrepresent the mean
   experienced temperatures during a heat wave period. Individual
   differences in attributes (gender, race, socioeconomic status, etc.),
   behaviors (schedules, preferences, lifestyle, etc.), and access to
   resources are overlooked determinants of heat exposure and should be
   better integrated with group- and neighborhood-level characteristics.
   Understanding IETs for the population at large may lead to innovative
   advances in heat-health intervention and mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Small populations with unusual characteristics subject to extreme
   conditions provide opportunities for exploring adaptability in the face
   of environmental changes. Two sets of data have been examined to
   determine how unusual is the population of Hipparchia semele on the
   Great Orme's Head, North Wales, compared with other sites in the UK. The
   population on the Great Orme is shown to have unique features, including
   significantly reduced wing expanse and wing ocellation and extreme
   flight period characteristics. Analyses of flight period data from the
   UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) using over a 100 sites reveals
   that, although the Great Orme population is one of a number of sites
   from the Channel Islands to northern Scotland with an early mean flight
   period, it has by far the earliest flight period and longest flight
   period of all populationsthe latter raising the mean flight period date.
   Furthermore the unique characteristics of H. semele on the Orme may well
   be underestimated, inasmuch as sampling of individuals for the phenotype
   study is incomplete, including only the area along the North Wales coast
   into Cheshire, while the UKBMS transect is restricted to the south-west
   portion of the headland. Unique populations are often accorded focused
   conservation effort; especially potential flagship species in decline as
   in the case of British H. semele. As the Great Orme population presents
   a rare opportunity for studying adaptations in an extreme local
   environment, particularly considering current projections for climate
   changes, we advocate further research and attention being given to this
   unusual population.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Evolution and Relationship between Night Time Light and
   Land Surface Temperature: A Case Study of Beijing, China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization has triggered significant changes in urban land
   surface temperature (LST), which in turn affects urban ecosystems and
   the health of residents. Therefore, exploring the interrelationship
   between urban development and LST can help optimize the urban thermal
   environment and promote sustainable development. Based on remote sensing
   data from 2004-2019 within the sixth ring road of Beijing, this study
   investigates the spatiotemporal coupling law of night time light (NTL)
   and LST using an overall coupling model and analyzes the degree of
   coordination between them using a coordination model. The spatial
   response law between them was also analyzed using standard deviation
   ellipses and bivariate spatial autocorrelation. The results show that,
   from the perspective of spatiotemporal evolution, the spatial
   distributions of NTL and LST within the sixth ring road of Beijing were
   closely related from 2004 to 2019, although the overall coupling of NTL
   and LST was initially decreased and then continuously increased. From
   the perspective of coordination types, the main types of coordination
   between NTL and LST deteriorated over time. The increase in LST lagged
   behind NTL from 2004 to 2009 (heating hysteresis type), while LST
   increased ahead of NTL from 2014 to 2019 (heating advance type). This
   suggests that urban development became less efficient, while LST
   increases became more significant. In terms of correlation, NTL and LST
   showed significant positive correlation and spatial positive
   correlation; the correlation coefficient first decreased significantly
   and then continued to increase. From 2004 to 2009, the temperature
   increase caused by urbanization was suppressed due to the 2008 Beijing
   Olympics and related ecological protection policies, resulting in a
   significant decrease in the correlation coefficient between NTL and LST.
   From 2009 to 2019, short-term measures taken by Beijing during the
   Olympic Games were no longer effective, and the opposition between urban
   development and related policies made the policies increasingly less
   effective, thereby increasing the correlation coefficient between NTL
   and LST, and the increase in LST was more significant. This will greatly
   affect the urban ecological environment and residents' health and make
   the previous government investment to suppress the temperature increase
   all in vain. This study can provide theoretical and practical support
   for the development of thermal environment optimization schemes and LST
   mitigation strategies in Beijing and other cities.},

   or destroyed. Disruptions of CI systems frequently cause major social
   and economic losses, both directly and through failures in one system
   leading to disruptions in another (cascading effects). The ability to
   ensure continuity in services provided by CI directly relates to the
   resilience of communities to withstand and recover from disasters. The
   approach adopted by the INTACT-project recognizes that a European-wide
   coordinated and cooperative effort is required because of cross border
   CI-activities and impacts as well as an integrated EU-policy.
   The INTACT-case studies and their expected outcomes are designed to
   bring added value for the concerned stakeholders locally and demonstrate
   the validity and applicability of the INTACT approach at the broader
   (European) scale. To achieve this, the selected case studies are
   geographically spread across Europe encompassing different climate,
   landscape and environmental zones, as to provide coverage of a
   representative range of CI types and also including different levels of
   governance.
   One of the case studies is located in the Netherlands and deals with the
   port of Rotterdam. The situation in Rotterdam is representative for many
   other main ports in Europe. These ports are all situated in a delta
   area, near the sea and rivers or canals. Also, these ports are close to
   urban areas and industrial complexes. Finally, these ports have a
   multimodal transport infrastructure to and from its hinterland, which is
   also vulnerable for extreme weather events. The case study is not only
   significant for the development of methods and tools, but also of direct
   interest for the region itself. The combination of the National Water
   safety policy and the best practices from the INTACT cases offer
   challenges to create better adaptation options and coping capacity to
   these relatively unforeseen and unexpected impacts based on climate
   change scenario's and socio-economic megatrends.},

Abstract = {The management and mitigation of natural hazards and the response to
   disasters has become increasingly important for local and national
   authorities in the last decade. Geological hazards are an ever present
   danger in New Zealand, which straddles the Pacific and Australian
   crustal plates. The frequency of severe weather-related events is
   increasing, not only because of global warming, but people also tend to
   be more vulnerable especially when attracted to settle in areas which
   are inherently at risk from natural hazards such as the coast or flood
   plains. These potential perils require tools and decision support
   systems that facilitate the analysis and comparison of risks from
   different hazards. Current national scientific and engineering knowledge
   is combined to develop a powerful software program called RiskScape for
   analyzing potential impacts from various hazards in New Zealand. At
   present it covers five natural hazards: earthquake shaking, volcanic
   ashfall, river floods, wind storms and tsunami.
   The prime goal is to develop an easy-to-use decision-support tool that
   converts hazard exposure information into likely consequences for a
   region, such as damages and replacement costs, casualties, disruption
   and number of people affected. Consequences for each region presented in
   a common platform across all natural hazards can then form the basis of
   prudent planning and prioritized risk-mitigation measures that link
   directly to the severity of the risks
   The development of Regional RiskScape New Zealand has been underway for
   three years of its four year development phase. The paper will describe
   the status quo of the development and will also address problems and
   areas where further work is required.},

Title = {Large-scale interventions may delay decline of the Great Barrier Reef},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {On the iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the cumulative impacts of
   tropical cyclones, marine heatwaves and regular outbreaks of
   coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) have severely depleted
   coral cover. Climate change will further exacerbate this situation over
   the coming decades unless effective interventions are implemented.
   Evaluating the efficacy of alternative interventions in a complex system
   experiencing major cumulative impacts can only be achieved through a
   systems modelling approach. We have evaluated combinations of
   interventions using a coral reef meta-community model. The model
   consisted of a dynamic network of 3753 reefs supporting communities of
   corals and CoTS connected through ocean larval dispersal, and exposed to
   changing regimes of tropical cyclones, flood plumes, marine heatwaves
   and ocean acidification. Interventions included reducing flood plume
   impacts, expanding control of CoTS populations, stabilizing coral
   rubble, managing solar radiation and introducing heat-tolerant coral
   strains. Without intervention, all climate scenarios resulted in
   precipitous declines in GBR coral cover over the next 50 years. The most
   effective strategies in delaying decline were combinations that
   protected coral from both predation (CoTS control) and thermal stress
   (solar radiation management) deployed at large scale. Successful
   implementation could expand opportunities for climate action, natural
   adaptation and socioeconomic adjustment by at least one to two decades.},

Title = {Future Changes in Built Environment Risk to Coastal Flooding, Permanent
   Inundation and Coastal Erosion Hazards},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise will cause erosion of land, deeper and increasingly
   frequent flooding and will eventually permanently inundate low-elevation
   land, forcing the adaptation of seaside communities to avoid or reduce
   risk. To inform adaptation planning, we quantified the effects of
   incremental relative sea-level rise (RSLR) on exposed land area, number
   and replacement value of buildings within Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand.
   The assessment compared three coastal hazards: flooding, permanent
   inundation and erosion. Increasingly frequent coastal flooding will be
   the dominant trigger for adaptation in Tauranga. In the absence of
   adaptation, coastal flooding, recurring at least once every 5 years on
   average, will overtake erosion as the dominant coastal hazard after
   about 0.15-0.2 m RSLR, which is likely to occur between the years
   2038-2062 in New Zealand and will rapidly escalate in frequency and
   consequence thereafter. Coastal erosion will remain the dominant hazard
   for the relatively-few properties on high-elevation coastal cliffs. It
   will take 0.8 m more RSLR for permanent inundation to reach similar
   impact thresholds to coastal flooding, in terms of the number and value
   of buildings exposed. For buildings currently within the mapped 1\%
   annual exceedance probability (AEP) zone, the flooding frequency will
   transition to 20\% AEP within 2-3 decades depending on the RSLR rate,
   requiring prior adaptive action. We also compared the performance of
   simple static-planar versus complex dynamic models for assessing coastal
   flooding exposure. Use of the static-planar model could result in sea
   level thresholds being reached 15-45 years earlier than planned for in
   this case. This is compelling evidence to use dynamic models to support
   adaptation planning.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal patterns in coastal turbidity - Long-term trends and
   drivers of variation across an estuarine-open coast gradient},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {137-151},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Turbidity in the coastal environment is greatly affected by human
   activities on the land and this is likely to be exacerbated with
   expanding urbanisation and climate change. Investigating the temporal
   and spatial drivers of variation in turbidity is key to understanding
   processes influencing turbidity and for developing management strategies
   to mitigate future increases in turbidity. We analyse 22 years of
   monthly turbidity data from 1992 to 2013 in New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf
   to determine whether turbidity has changed in response to implementation
   of land management regulations. We also investigate how spatial and
   temporal patterns in turbidity relate to meteorological and
   oceanographic variables along an estuarine to open-coast gradient.
   Turbidity, total suspended solids and chlorophyll a declined along the
   estuarine to open-coast gradient. Correlation analysis suggested that
   suspended sediment was the major determinant of turbidity along this
   gradient. Improvements in turbidity were evident at some harbour sites,
   but overall there were no consistent trends across the sites. Some
   cyclical patterns in turbidity were evident, but these were only weakly
   related to ENSO. The greatest component of temporal variation at all
   sites was between samples (months). The primary correlates of this
   variation in turbidity differed across the estuarine-open coast
   gradient; recent wave conditions explained the greatest variation in
   turbidity at open coast sites, whereas tidal currents and daily rainfall
   were the primacy correlates at harbour channel and estuarine sites. The
   strong coupling found between meteorological factors and coastal
   turbidity highlight a number of mechanisms whereby turbidity will likely
   increase as a result of climate change along this coastal gradient.
   Improvements in land management practices, particularly in rural areas,
   as well as coastal protection are therefore essential to offset the
   likely effects of climate change on coastal turbidity. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Combining participatory approaches and an agent-based model for better
   planning shrimp aquaculture},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {149-159},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the Mekong Delta coastal zone, decision makers must weigh trade-offs
   between sustaining the shrimp sector and thus ensuring economic
   development, while also promoting sustainable, environmentally friendly
   practices and planning for climate change adaptation. This study
   investigates future scenarios for development of shrimp aquaculture
   using a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) simulating farmers'
   production system choices. A role playing game (RPG) with farmers was
   used to calibrate and validate the model. Four scenarios, representing
   different visions of aquaculture in the next 15 years, were elaborated
   with decision makers before discussing the different outputs of the
   model. Iterative consultation with farmers helped to fine-tune the model
   and identify key parameters and drivers in farmers' decision-making. The
   recursive process allowed us to construct a model that validly
   represents reality. Participants stated that use of the RPG improved
   their insight for planning. Results of the scenarios indicate that (i)
   intensification of production is unsustainable, (ii) market-based
   incentives are too limited to stimulate development of an integrated
   mangrove-shrimp production system and (iii) climate change will cause
   rapid decline of production in the absence of adaptation measures. RPG
   appeared to be a valuable method for formalizing local farmers'
   knowledge and integrating it into the planning approaches used by
   decision makers. The ABM, thus, can also be considered a medium or
   communication tool facilitating knowledge-sharing between farmers and
   decision makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A GIS-based screening method to identify climate change-related threats
   on road networks: A case study from Sweden},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {Extreme weather-related events are likely to increase in both frequency
   and intensity if current emission rates continue. Particularly
   vulnerable to the potential effects of climate change is the
   transportation sector, which fully relies on the uninterrupted
   accessibility of the road network. With the Swedish Government adopting
   a National Adaptation Strategy in 2018, creating a coordinated
   cross-disciplinary strategy underpinned by international frameworks, new
   ambition levels regarding climate change adaptation efforts have been
   established. Identifying particularly vulnerable parts of the road
   network is an essential step for National Road Authorities (NRAs) in
   early planning stages to prioritize adaptation efforts around high-risk
   areas to safeguard the road network. By utilizing both publicly and
   commercially available climate-related data, as well as applying and
   assessing new terrain analysis techniques, a large-scale vulnerability
   assessment is carried out for Halland County in southwestern Sweden by
   assessing three climate-adjusted extreme weather events (a 100-year
   pluvial flood event, a 100-year fluvial flood event, and an extreme
   coastal storm surge event) projected to exacerbate in the region. The
   study demonstrates how a GIS-based screening method, specifically
   adapted for NRAs or similar stakeholders, may provide quick overviews of
   potentially at-risk areas along road networks through a simple
   vulnerability index assigned to individual road segments. Further
   studies are recommended to compare modeled results to recorded flood
   events if available and incorporate updated climate change trajectories
   from upcoming IPCC reports.},

Title = {The process of social adaptation towards climate change among Malaysian
   fishermen},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-53},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the level of
   social adaptation to climate change among fishermen in the East Coast
   Region of Peninsular Malaysia.
   Design/methodology/approach - A set of questionnaires was developed
   based on the individual adaptive capacity framework on social adaptation
   to climate change developed by the International Union for Conservation
   of Nature and Natural Resources. Based on multi-stage simple random
   sampling, a total of 300 registered fishermen in the East Coast Region
   of Peninsular Malaysia were chosen as the respondents.
   Findings - The fishermen surveyed had a high level of adaptation with
   regards to two aspects: first, environmental awareness, attitudes and
   beliefs; and second, local environmental knowledge. In contrast, they
   showed a low level of adaptation with regards to three aspects:
   attachment to place; formal and informal networks; and attachment to
   occupation. In addition, the fishermen had a moderate level of
   adaptation in relation to ten other aspects.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study reflect
   social adaptation towards climate change among registered fishermen in
   the East Coast Region of Malaysia and results might be different if
   registered fishermen from other regions are included.
   Practical implications - The study demonstrated the strengths and
   weaknesses of the fishermen's adaptations to climate change. Such
   strengths and weaknesses have resulted in a number of suggestions and
   recommendations, which may work as tools by which to generate
   well-planned and systematic adaptation options for dealing with the
   threatening impacts of climate change.
   Originality/value - Previous studies, both local and international, have
   consistently provided comprehensive explanatory reviews regarding
   climate change impacts on fishermen's activities. However, the common
   constraint of these studies is that aspects of adaptation are not under
   their radar; therefore, this study aims to fill this gap.},

Abstract = {Due to its complex topography and diverse climate (e.g. monsoonal
   rainfall, tropical cyclones), Vietnam is expected to be greatly affected
   by climate change. Therefore, detailed information about possible
   changes is crucial for the planning of climate adaptation measures. The
   most recent climate projections generated by coupled global climate
   models (GCMs) as well as earth system models (ESMs) for the CMIP5
   experiment are still too coarse to provide this information. Using the
   conformal-cubic atmospheric model (CCAM), a stretched-grid atmospheric
   model, regional climate projections with approximately 10 km horizontal
   resolution over Vietnam have been produced. The downscaling method
   involves two steps. First, a global 50 km even-grid run is conducted
   driven just by bias and variance corrected monthly sea surface
   temperatures and sea ice concentrations from six different CMIP5
   GCMs/ESMs and two RCP emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). In the
   second step of the downscaling method, a 10 km stretched-grid version of
   CCAM is forced by spectrally filtered results from the 50 km global
   simulations.
   Validation of the 50 km and the 10 km simulations of the present climate
   will be presented. The climate projections from the GCMs, 50 km and 10
   km simulations will also be discussed to show some of the impact of the
   downscaling method and resolution on the projections for Southeast Asia
   and Vietnam.},

Abstract = {Fossil records are replete with examples of long-term biotic responses
   to past climate change. One particularly useful set of records are those
   preserved in lake and marine sediments, recording both climate changes
   and corresponding biotic responses. Recently there has been increasing
   focus on the need for conservation of ecological and evolutionary
   processes in the face of climate change. We review key areas where
   palaeoecological archives contribute to this conservation goal, namely:
   (i) determination of rates and nature of biodiversity response to
   climate change; (ii) climate processes responsible for ecological
   thresholds; (iii) identification of ecological resilience to climate
   change; and (iv) management of novel ecosystems. We stress the
   importance of long-term palaeoecological data in fully understanding
   contemporary and future biotic responses.},

Abstract = {Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are the center of origin and diversity
   for several root, fruit and nut crops, which are indispensable for food
   security, rural livelihoods, and cultural identity of local communities.
   However, declining genetic diversity of traditional food crops and high
   vulnerability to climate change are major impediments for maintaining
   agricultural productivity. Limited initiatives to achieve food
   self-sufficiency and utilization of Plant Genetic Resources (PGR) for
   enhancing resilience of agro-ecosystems are other serious constraints.
   This review focuses on the visible and anticipated impacts of climate
   ge, on major food and tree crops in agriculture and agroforestry systems
   in the PICs. We argue that crop improvement through plant breeding is a
   viable strategy to enhance food security and climatic resilience in the
   region. The exploitation of adaptive traits: abiotic and biotic stress
   tolerance, yield and nutritional efficiency, is imperative in a world
   threatened by climatic extremes. However, the insular constraints of
   Fiji and other small PICs are major limitations for the utilization of
   PGR through high throughput techniques which are also cost prohibitive.
   Crop Improvement programs should instead focus on the identification,
   conservation, documentation and dissemination of information on unique
   landraces, community seed banks, introduction of new resistant
   genotypes, and sustaining and enhancing allelic diversity.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {110},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {783-799},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, change-points in time series of annual extremes in
   temperature and precipitation in the Zhujiang River Basin are analyzed
   with the CUSUM test. The data cover the period 1961-2007 for 192
   meteorological stations. Annual indicators are analyzed: mean
   temperature, maximum temperature, warm days, total precipitation, 5-day
   maximum precipitation, and dry days. Significant change-points (1986/87,
   1997/98, 1968/69, and 2003/04) are detected in the time series of most
   of the indicators. The change-point in 1986/87 is investigated in more
   detail. Most stations with this change-point in temperature indicators
   are located in the eastern and coastal areas of the basin. Stations with
   this change-point in dry days are located in the western area. The means
   and trends of the temperature indicators increase in the entire basin
   after 1986/87. The highest magnitudes can be found at the coast and
   delta. Decreasing (increasing) tendencies in total and 5-day maximum
   precipitation (dry days) are mostly observed in the western and central
   regions. The detected change-points can be explained by changes in the
   indices of the Western Pacific subtropical high and the East Asian
   summer monsoon as well as by change-points in wind directions. In years
   when the indices simultaneously increase and decrease (indices taking
   reverse directions to negative and positive) higher annual temperatures
   and lower annual precipitation occur in the Zhujiang River Basin. The
   high station density and data quality are very useful for spatially
   assessing change-points of climatic extreme events. The relation of the
   change points to large-scale oscillation can provide valuable data for
   planning adaptation measures against climate risks, e.g. for flood
   control, disaster preparedness, and water resource management.},

Title = {Golden carbon of Sargassum forests revealed as an opportunity for
   climate change mitigation},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {729},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Marine climate change mitigation initiatives have recently attracted a
   great deal of interest in the role of natural carbon sinks, particularly
   on coastal systems. Brown seaweeds of the genus Sargassum are the
   largest canopyforming algae in tropical and subtropical environments,
   with a wide global distribution on rocky reefs and as floating stands.
   Because these algae present high amounts of biomass, we suggest their
   contribution is relevant for global carbon stocks and consequently
   formitigating climate change as CO2 remover. Wemodelled global
   distributions and quantified carbon stocks as above-ground biomass (AGB)
   with machine learning algorithms and climate data. Sargassum AGB totaled
   13.1 Pg C at the global scale, which is a significant amount of carbon,
   comparable to other key marine ecosystems, such as mangrove forests,
   salt marshes and seagrass meadows. However, specific techniques related
   to bloom production and management, or the utilization of biomass for
   biomaterials, should be fostered. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Vulnerability assessment of the coastal wetlands in the Yangtze Estuary,
   China to sea-level rise},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {156},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {42-51},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) caused by global climate change will have
   significant impacts on the low-lying coastal zone. The coastal wetlands
   in the Yangtze Estuary, with their low elevation, are particularly
   sensitive to SLR. In this study, the potential impacts of SLR on the
   coastal wetlands in the Yangtze Estuary were analyzed by adopting the
   SPRC (Source Pathway Receptor Consequence) model. Based on the SPRC
   model and IPCC vulnerability definition, an indicator system for
   vulnerability assessment on the coastal wetlands to SLR was developed,
   in which the rate of SLR, subsidence rate, habitat elevation, mean daily
   inundation duration of habitat and sedimentation rate were selected as
   the key indicators. A spatial assessment method based on a GIS platform
   was established by quantifying each indicator, calculating the
   vulnerability index and grading the vulnerability. Vulnerability
   assessment, based on the projection of SLR rates from the present trend
   (0.26 cm/yr) and IPCC's A(1)F(1) scenario (0.59 cm/yr), were performed
   for three time periods: short-term (2030s), medium-term (2050s) and
   long-term (2100s). The results indicated that in the 2030s, 6.6\% and
   9.0\% of the coastal wetlands were within the grade of low vulnerability
   under the scenarios of present trend and A(1)F(1), respectively. In the
   2050s, the percentage of coastal wetlands within the grades of low and
   moderate vulnerability increases to 9.8\% and 0.2\%, 9.5\% and 1.0\%
   under the scenarios of present trend and A(1)F(1), respectively. In the
   2100s, 8.1\% and 3.0\% of the coastal wetlands were within the grade of
   low vulnerability, 0.8\% and 2.8\% were within the grade of moderate
   vulnerability under the scenarios of present trend and A(1)F(1),
   respectively. The percentage of coastal wetlands within the grade of
   high vulnerability increases significantly, amounting to 2.3\% and 6.9\%
   under the scenarios of present trend and A(1)F(1), respectively. The
   application of the SPRC model, the methodology developed and the results
   could assist with the objective and quantitative assessment of the
   vulnerability of coastal wetlands undergoing the impacts of SLR
   elsewhere. Without proper mitigation measures, the potential decrease in
   the area and loss of habitats and ecosystem services from the wetlands
   is inevitable. Based on the results of this study, mitigation measures
   should be considered for securing the future of the coastal wetlands in
   the Yangtze Estuary, which include the management of sedimentation,
   rehabilitation and re-creation of wetland habitat, reduction of land
   subsidence and control of reclamation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Analysis of Urban Heat Island and Heat Waves Using Sentinel-3 Images: a
   Study of Andalusian Cities in Spain},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {199-219},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {At present, understanding the synergies between the Surface Urban Heat
   Island (SUHI) phenomenon and extreme climatic events entailing high
   mortality, i.e., heat waves, is a great challenge that must be faced to
   improve the quality of life in urban zones. The implementation of new
   mitigation and resilience measures in cities would serve to lessen the
   effects of heat waves and the economic cost they entail. In this
   research, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the SUHI were
   determined through Sentinel-3A and 3B images of the eight capitals of
   Andalusia (southern Spain) during the months of July and August of years
   2019 and 2020. The objective was to determine possible synergies or
   interaction between the LST and SUHI, as well as between SUHI and heat
   waves, in a region classified as highly vulnerable to the effects of
   climate change. For each Andalusian city, the atmospheric variables of
   ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and direction were
   obtained from stations of the Spanish State Meteorological Agency
   (AEMET); the data were quantified and classified both in periods of
   normal environmental conditions and during heat waves. By means of Data
   Panel statistical analysis, the multivariate relationships were derived,
   determining which ones statistically influence the SUHI during heat wave
   periods. The results indicate that the LST and the mean SUHI obtained
   are statistically interacted and intensify under heat wave conditions.
   The greatest increases in daytime temperatures were seen for Sentinel-3A
   in cities by the coast (LST = 3.90 degrees C, SUHI = 1.44 degrees C) and
   for Sentinel-3B in cities located inland (LST = 2.85 degrees C, SUHI =
   0.52 degrees C). The existence of statistically significant positive
   relationships above 99\% (p < 0.000) between the SUHI and solar
   radiation, and between the SUHI and the direction of the wind,
   intensified in periods of heat wave, could be verified. An increase in
   the urban area affected by the SUHI under heat wave conditions is
   reported.},

Title = {Assessing the importance of net colour as a seabird bycatch mitigation
   measure in gillnet fishing},

Abstract = {Gillnets are used widely in fisheries throughout the world and known to
   cause the death of thousands of seabirds each year. Currently few
   practical or technical options are available to fishers for preventing
   seabird mortalities.
   The ability of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) to differentiate
   between different coloured netting materials was tested under controlled
   conditions to ascertain if changes in gillnet colour could facilitate a
   potential mitigation measure by improving visibility of nets.
   The study involved a repeated-measures design with penguins exposed to
   variously coloured mono-filament threads creating a gillnet mimic. The
   gillnet mimic was made up of gillnet material configured as a series of
   vertical lines 25mm apart stretched tightly across a stainless steel
   frame that measured 1160mmx1540mm and divided into two equal panel
   areas. The panels were placed in a large tank within an enclosure that
   housed 25 penguins. Penguins were able to readily access the tank and
   swim freely. The frame was always introduced into the tank with one
   panel containing a gillnet mimic, and the other panel left empty as a
   control.
   Gillnet filament colours tested were clear, green and orange. Orange
   coloured monofilament lines resulted in lower collision rates (5.5\%),
   while clear and green monofilament lines resulted in higher rates of
   collision (35.9\% and 30.8\%, respectively).
   These results suggest that orange-coloured lines were more apparent to
   the birds. Constructing nets of orange-coloured material may be
   effective in reducing bycatch in gillnets set in shallow waters and high
   light levels where seabirds are able to identify fine colour
   differences.
   Further testing under experimental conditions, accompanied with at-sea
   trials to verify effectiveness in varied light conditions is warranted,
   together with an assessment of the effect of gillnet colour on catch
   efficiency of target species.},

Title = {Groundwater system and climate change: Present status and future
   considerations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {589},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change will impact every aspect of biophysical systems and
   society. However, unlike other components of the climate system, the
   impact of climate change on the groundwater system has only recently
   received attention. This focus is due to the realization that
   groundwater is a vital freshwater resource crucial to global food and
   water security, and is essential in sustaining ecosystems and human
   adaptation to climate variability and change. This paper synthesizes
   findings on the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the
   entire groundwater system and each component. Also, we appraise the use
   of coupled groundwater-climate and land surface models in groundwater
   hydrology as a means of improving existing knowledge of climate
   change-groundwater interaction, finding that most models anticipate
   decreases in groundwater recharge, storage and levels, particularly in
   the arid/semi-arid tropics. Reducing uncertainties in future climate
   projections and improving our understanding of the physical processes
   underlying models to improve their simulation of real-world conditions
   remain a priority for climate and Earth scientists. Despite the enormous
   progress made, there are still few and inadequate local and regional
   aquifer studies, especially in less developed regions. The paper
   proposes two key considerations. First, physical basis: the need for a
   deeper grasp of complex physical processes and feedback mechanism with
   the use of more sophisticated models. Second, the need to understand the
   socioeconomic dimensions of climate-groundwater interaction through
   multidisciplinary synergy, leading to the development of better
   groundwater-climate change adaptation strategies and modeling.},

Title = {Restore or retreat? Saltwater intrusion and water management in coastal
   wetlands},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands perform a unique set of physical, chemical, and
   biological functions, which provide billions of dollars of ecosystem
   services annually. These wetlands also face myriad environmental and
   anthropogenic pressures, which threaten their ecological condition and
   undermine their capacity to provide these services. Coastal wetlands
   have adapted to a dynamic range of natural disturbances over recent
   millennia, but face growing pressures from human population growth and
   coastal development. These anthropogenic pressures are driving saltwater
   intrusion (SWI) in many coastal systems. The position of coastal
   wetlands at the terrestrial-marine interface also makes them vulnerable
   to increasing rates of sea-level rise and changing climate. Critically,
   anthropogenic and natural stressors to coastal wetlands can act
   synergistically to create negative, and sometimes catastrophic,
   consequences for both human and natural systems. This review focused on
   the drivers and impacts of SWI in coastal wetlands and has two goals:
   (1) to synthesize understanding of coastal wetland change driven by SWI
   and (2) to review approaches for improved water management to mitigate
   SWI in impacted systems. While we frame this review as a choice between
   restoration and retreat, we acknowledge that choices about coastal
   wetland management are context-specific and may be confounded by
   competing management goals. In this setting, the choice between
   restoration and retreat can be prioritized by identifying where the
   greatest return in ecosystem services can be achieved relative to
   restoration dollars invested. We conclude that restoration and proactive
   water management is feasible in many impacted systems.},

Title = {Cascading climate change impacts and implications},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to have adverse impacts and implications for
   a range of human-environment systems. However, our understanding of the
   extent to which these impacts may propagate as cascades, compounding to
   form multiple impacts across sectors, is limited. Cascades result from
   interdependencies between systems and sub-systems of coupled natural and
   socio-economic systems in response to changes and feedback loops. The
   combined effects of interacting stressors may affect the ability of
   individuals, governments, and the private sector to adapt in time,
   before widespread damage occurs. We discuss the origins of cascading
   impacts thinking and present the results of an investigation of
   cascading impacts and implications in New Zealand. A participatory and
   collaborative approach was used through workshops and semi-structured
   interviews with sector informants, including engineers, local government
   staff, and financial risk managers and analysts from the financial
   services sectors. Qualitative data collection was combined with network
   and systems analysis to examine increased frequency of high-intensity
   rainfall events, sea-level rise and drought, across urban water
   infrastructure and the financial services, and the implications of
   cascading climate change impacts for governance. Results demonstrate
   that closer consideration of the combined effects of linked stressors
   can facilitate a better understanding of the scope and scale of climate
   change impacts. By using critical systems thinking in characterising and
   assessing how climate change impacts cascade across domains, we show the
   implications of cascades for their governance and reveal where climate
   change adaptation interventions might be focused. The research methods
   and insights into cascades provide a conceptual and practical basis for
   further development, which can inform the design of additional studies
   in other domains and jurisdictions.},

Abstract = {The aims of this work are to provide an overview of the current stresses
   of estuaries in Argentina and to propose adaptation strategies from an
   ecohydrological approach. Several Argentinian estuaries are impacted by
   pollutants, derived mainly from sewage discharge and agricultural or
   industrial activities. Anthropogenic impacts are expected to rise with
   increasing human population. Climate-driven warmer temperature and
   hydrological changes will alter stratification, residence time, oxygen
   content, salinity, pollutant distribution, organism physiology and
   ecology, and nutrient dynamics. Good water quality is essential in
   enhancing estuarine ecological resilience to disturbances brought on by
   global change. The preservation, restoration, and creation of wetlands
   will help to protect the coast from erosion, increase sediment accretion
   rates, and improve water quality by removing excess nutrients and
   pollutants. The capacity of hydrologic basin ecosystems to absorb human
   and natural impacts can be improved through holistic management, which
   should consider social vulnerability in complex human natural systems.

Abstract = {Hurricane flooding is a leading natural threat to coastal communities
   Recent evidence of sea level rise coupled with potential future global
   warming indicate that sea level rise will accelerate and hurricanes may

   Texas USA hurricane flooding is projected to rise between 20\% and 70\%
   by the 2030s resulting in an increase in property damages and impacted

Title = {Gear-based fisheries management as a potential adaptive response to
   climate change and coral mortality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {724-732},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change is emerging as one of the greatest threats to coral reef
   ecosystems. Climate-induced warming events trigger coral bleaching and
   mortality, which can indirectly affect coral reef fishes. Managing
   fisheries across coral mortality events is expected to influence the
   persistence of species and reef recovery potential. The most common
   management recommendation has been to prohibit fishing using fisheries
   closures, but this response often has limited support from resource
   users.
   Here, we explore an alternative of managing fishing gear commonly used
   in artisanal coral reef fisheries. We examined fisheries landing data
   from 15 sites in Papua New Guinea and Kenya to explore whether or how
   specific gears select for: (i) species that depend on coral reefs for
   feeding or habitat and are likely to be susceptible to the loss of
   coral, and (ii) different functional groups of fishes.
   Only 6\% of the fishes targeted by fishers were susceptible to the
   immediate effects of coral mortality; however, loss of habitat structure
   following coral mortality is expected to affect 56\% of targeted
   species.
   Importantly, 25\% of target species had feeding characteristics (i.e.
   reef scrapers/excavators and grazers) that contribute to the recovery of
   coral reef ecosystems, and gears differed considerably in catches of
   these species.
   Spear guns and traps target a high proportion of species likely to be
   affected by bleaching and key for the recovery of corals. These gears
   are strong candidates for management restrictions in reefs with high
   coral mortality. In contrast, line fishing catches the lowest proportion
   of susceptible and recovery-enabling species and is preferential for
   increasing recovery rates on coral reefs.
   Synthesis and applications. Fisheries managers will require a range of
   tools to meet the novel challenges posed by climate change. This study
   presents a way to help reduce the negative impacts of climate change and
   potentially increase resilience of marine ecosystems by managing fishing
   gear. Specific gears used by artisanal fishers differentially target
   fish functional groups. In the coral reefs that we studied, traps and
   spear guns targeted a high proportion of species highly susceptible to
   coral mortality and critical to coral reef resilience through their
   top-down control. Given that full fisheries closures are not always
   practical, selectively banning or restricting fishing gears is a
   potentially powerful tool for reducing the detrimental ecosystem effects
   of climate change disturbances.},

Title = {Using a new local high resolution daily gridded dataset for Attica to
   statistically downscale climate projections},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Abstract = {In this study we present a methodological framework to obtain
   statistically downscaled high resolution climate projections over the
   Attica region in Greece. The framework relies on the construction of a
   local daily gridded dataset for temperature variables (maximum, minimum
   and mean daily temperatures) and daily precipitation sums. To this aim,
   a mosaic of data that includes observations derived from ground stations
   and a high resolution simulation, performed by the Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model, for 1 year (1995) are blended using various
   gridding techniques to produce a 1 km 1 km high resolution daily gridded
   dataset for the period 1981-2000. The comparison of the gridded dataset
   against the observations reveals that the produced dataset maintains the
   observed long term statistical properties over the period 1981-2000 for
   both temperature and precipitation variables. Consequently, the produced
   dataset is used to statistically downscale Regional Climate Model
   simulations from the EURO-CORDEX initiative for the present (1981-2000)
   and the future climate (2081-2100) under the Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 climate scenario using two different
   bias adjustment techniques. The results indicate that the selection of
   the bias adjustment method is important and can affect the simulated
   climate change signals in a different way. Thus bias adjustment should
   be performed with caution and examined thoroughly before any such
   downscaled climate change projection dataset reach decision and policy
   makers in order to plan climate change related adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {The risks to human populations in coastal areas are changing due to
   climate and socio-economic changes, and these trends are predicted to
   accelerate during the twenty-first century. To understand these changing
   risks, and the resulting choices and pathways to successful management
   and adaptation, broad-scale integrated assessment is essential. Due to
   their complexity the two risks of flooding and erosion are usually
   managed independently, yet frequently they are interconnected by
   longshore exchange of sediments and the resulting broad scale
   morphological system behaviour. In order to generate new insights into
   the effects of climate change and coastal management practises on
   coastal erosion and flood risk, we present an integrated assessment of
   72 km of shoreline over the twenty-first century on the East Anglian
   coast of England which is a site of significant controversy about how to
   manage coastal flood and erosion risks over the twenty-first century. A
   coupled system of hydrodynamic, morphological, reliability and
   socio-economic models has been developed for the analysis, implemented
   under scenarios of coastal management, climate and socio-economic
   change. The study is unique in coastal management terms because of the
   large spatial scale and extended temporal scale over which the analysis
   is quantified. This study for the first time quantifies what has for
   some years been argued qualitatively: the role of sediments released
   from cliff erosion in protecting neighbouring low-lying land from
   flooding. The losses and benefits are expressed using the common
   currency of economic risk. The analysis demonstrates that over the
   twenty-first century, flood risk in the study area is expected to be an
   order of magnitude greater than erosion risk. Climate and socio-economic
   change and coastal management policy have a significant influence on
   flood risk. This study demonstrates that the choices concerning coastal
   management are profound, and there are clear tradeoffs between erosion
   and flood impacts.},

Title = {An approach for assessing ecosystem-based adaptation in coral reefs at
   relatively high latitudes to climate change and human pressure},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {192},

Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Relatively high-latitude waters are supposed as a refuge for corals
   under ocean warming. A systematic assessment of the Weizhou Island reef
   in the northern South China Sea, a relatively high-latitude region,
   shows that the ecosystem restoration index decreased from 0.96 to 0.62
   during the period between 1990 and 2015. Although the biotic community,
   supporting services, and regulating services remained at good or very
   good states, the provisioning services, cultural services, and
   especially habitat structure deteriorated to very poor or moderate
   states. Gray relational analysis showed that these ecological declines
   exhibited a strong relationship with human pressures from tourism
   activities and the petrochemical industry. The recoveries of the biotic
   community and supporting services that benefited from wintertime warming
   appeared to be partly offset by intensive human pressures. The long-term
   effects on ecosystem structure and functions suggest that anthropogenic
   disturbances have impaired the possibility of this area serving as a
   potential thermal refuge for reef-building corals in the South China
   Sea. This study thus provides an integrated approach for assessing the
   adaptive responses of coral reef ecosystems to climate change and local
   human activities.},

Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {136-142},
Abstract = {Using high-resolution elevation data (2 m x 2 m), obtained during a 2012
   aerial Lidar survey as part of the Chao Phraya River basin flood
   management project in Thailand, we assessed the impact of sea level rise
   due to climate change on the Bangkok metropolitan area. The area below
   the current median tide of 1.11 m was estimated to be 2,520 km(2), with
   a vulnerable population of 3.9 million, equivalent to 23\% of the total
   population of the Bangkok metropolitan area. In the worst-case scenario
   of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 (sea level rise of
   +1.10 m), the affected area would extend to 6,140 km(2), increasing the
   estimated vulnerable population by 86\% to 7.2 million. With a sea level
   rise of less than +1.10 m, the affected area would extend from the Chao
   Phraya River mouth to Suphan Buri, which is about 80 km inland; however,
   the density of the vulnerable population would increase. The results of
   this study suggest that sea level rise adaptation measures, such as
   migration and settlement, must be developed as soon as possible.},

Title = {Hydrodynamic modelling of estuarine flood defence realignment as an
   adaptive management response to sea-level rise},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2B, S},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A numerical hydrodynamic model is used to investigate the sensitivity of
   a morphologically complex and heavily ``engineered{''} mesotidal estuary
   to idealized sea-level rise scenarios and to evaluate the
   appropriateness of managed realignment as an adaptive response to
   sea-level rise. The hydrodynamic regime of the Blyth estuary (Suffolk,
   eastern England) is governed by a distinctive morphology that has
   resulted from the abandonment of a reclaimed midestuary tidal floodplain
   in the 1920s and 1940s. Hypsometric characteristics (extensive
   intertidal area and constricted inlet dimensions) make the outer estuary
   potentially sensitive to sea-level rise. Model results indicate that a
   sea-level rise of 0.3 m (as a best estimate scenario for 2050) could
   increase peak tidal current velocities and discharges by up to 20\% and
   28\%, respectively. Extensive areas of potential tidal floodplain remain
   protected by embankments that will require upgrading to cope with
   sea-level rise. Realignment (or ``managed retreat{''}) of these defences
   can reduce local flood defence costs by eliminating unsustainable
   seawall but needs to be evaluated in the light of wider impacts.
   Modelling of hypothetical realignment scenarios shows that restoration
   of tidal exchange to the largest flood compartments could have an
   immediate effect on outer estuary hydrodynamics that is larger than
   worst case scenarios for half a century of accelerated sea-level rise
   (peak velocity and discharge increased by up to 35\% and 32\%,
   respectively). More generally, incompatibilities are apparent between
   flood defence and habitat restoration objectives, such that the
   appropriateness and feasibility of large-scale flood defence realignment
   could be questionable in estuarine contexts.},

Abstract = {Global warming is leading to increased frequency and severity of storms
   that are associated with flooding, increasing the risk to urban, coastal
   populations. This study examined perceptions of the relationship between
   severe storms, sea level rise, climate change and ecological barriers by
   a vulnerable environmental justice population in New Jersey. Patients
   using New Jersey's Federally Qualified Health Centers were interviewed
   after Hurricane {[}Superstorm] Sandy because it is essential to
   understand the perceptions of uninsured, underinsured, and economically
   challenged people to better develop a resiliency strategy for the most
   vulnerable people. Patients (N = 355) using 6 centers were interviewed
   using a structured interview form. Patients were interviewed in the
   order they entered the reception area, in either English or Spanish.
   Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with environmental
   statements. Respondents 1) agreed with experts that ``severe storms were
   due to climate change{''}, ``storms will come more often{''}, and that
   ``flooding was due to sea level rise{''}, 2) did not agree as strongly
   that ``climate change was due to human activity{''}, 3) were neutral for
   statements that ``Sandy damages were due to loss of dunes or salt
   marshes{''}. 4) did not differ as a function of ethnic/racial
   categories, and 5) showed few gender differences. It is imperative that
   the public understand that climate change and sea level rise are
   occurring so that they support community programs (and funding) to
   prepare for increased frequency of storms and coastal flooding. The lack
   of high ratings for the role of dunes and marshes in preventing flooding
   indicates a lack of understanding that ecological structures protect
   coasts, and suggests a lack of support for management actions to restore
   dunes as part of a coastal preparedness strategy. Perceptions that do
   not support a public policy of coastal zone management to protect
   coastlines can lead to increased flooding, extensive property damages,
   and injuries or loss of life.},

Journal = {URBAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The waste heat generated from the use of air conditioning systems in
   cities significantly contributes to the urban heat island effect (UHI)
   during the summer months. Thus, one of the key measures to mitigate this
   effect is to limit the use of active cooling systems. In the city of
   Vienna, air conditioning units are common in nonresidential buildings,
   but have so far been much less installed in residential buildings. This
   is mainly due to the fact that the Viennese summertime climate is still
   considered to be relatively comfortable and planning guidelines related
   to energy efficiency are already strict, resulting in high-quality
   buildings in regard to thermal performance. However, during the last
   decade, an increase in summertime temperatures and so called ``tropical
   nights{''} has been recorded in Vienna and subsequently the
   postconstruction installation of air conditioning systems in residential
   buildings has significantly increased. In a study undertaken for the
   City of Vienna, a series of passive design measures have been simulated
   with current and future climate scenarios in order to determine the most
   effective combination of architecturally driven actions to avoid the use
   of air conditioning systems in residential buildings whilst maintaining
   comfortable indoor temperatures.},

Abstract = {With development displacing more people and planned relocation being
   espoused as an adaptation strategy in response to climate change,
   research that explores the experiences of those who have been resettled
   is needed. The Maldives has a history of resettlement based on an
   ongoing policy of consolidation of dispersed populations to ensure
   access to services. The paper explores the history, politics, and
   perceptions and experiences of Gaadhoo Islanders in the Maldives during
   their involuntary resettlement to Fonadhoo Island in January 2016.
   Through in-depth interviews and ethnographic fieldwork among the
   resettled, a range of subjective experiences is identified. Although
   only a small proportion of participants wanted to leave and the process
   was undemocratic and politically motivated, both positive and negative
   outcomes were identified. In line with existing research, greater access
   to services and employment were positive outcomes of the resettlement.
   However, the process led to non-tangible loss of identity, culture and
   community cohesion. It is suggested that transparency, consistency and
   open communication should be central to the process throughout, from
   pre-decision to the resettlement process itself, and during the
   compensation and post-resettlement stages. The lessons drawn from this
   case study may help mitigate potential negative impacts from
   resettlements which will likely continue and increase into the future.},

Abstract = {Environmental and anthropogenic factors often drive population declines
   in top predators, but how their influences may combine remains unclear.
   Albatrosses are particularly threatened. They breed in fast-changing
   environments, and their extensive foraging ranges expose them to
   incidental mortality (bycatch) in multiple fisheries. The albatross
   community at South Georgia includes globally important populations of
   three species that have declined by 40-60\% over the last 35 years. We
   used three steps to deeply understand the drivers of such dramatic
   changes: (i) describe fundamental demographic rates using multievent
   models, (ii) determine demographic drivers of population growth using
   matrix models, and (iii) identify environmental and anthropogenic
   drivers using ANOVAs. Each species was affected by different processes
   and threats in their foraging areas during the breeding and nonbreeding
   seasons. There was evidence for two kinds of combined environmental and
   anthropogenic effects. The first was sequential; in wandering and
   black-browed albatrosses, high levels of bycatch have reduced juvenile
   and adult survival, then increased temperature, reduced sea-ice cover,
   and stronger winds are affecting the population recovery potential. The
   second was additive; in gray-headed albatrosses, not only did bycatch
   impact adult survival but also this impact was exacerbated by lower food
   availability in years following El Nino events. This emphasizes the need
   for much improved implementation of mitigation measures in fisheries and
   better enforcement of compliance. We hope our results not only help
   focus future management actions for these populations but also
   demonstrate the power of the modelling approach for assessing impacts of
   environmental and anthropogenic drivers in wild animal populations.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION},
Year = {2001},

Abstract = {A direct data domain (D-3) least-squares space-time adaptive processing
   (STAP) approach is presented for adaptively enhancing signals in a
   nonhomogeneous environment. The nonhomogeneous environment may consist
   of nonstationary clutter and could include blinking jammers. The D-3
   approach is applied to data collected by an antenna array utilizing
   space and in time (Doppler) diversity. Conventional STAP generally
   utilizes statistical methodologies based on estimating a covariance
   matrix of the interference using data from secondary range cells. As the
   results are derived from ensemble averages, one filter (optimum in a
   probabilistic sense) is obtained for the operational environment,
   assumed to be wide sense stationary. However, for highly transient and
   inhomogeneous environments the conventional statistical methodology is
   difficult to apply Hence, the D-3 method is presented as it analyzes the
   data in space and time over each range cell separately. The D-3 method
   is deterministic in approach. From an operational standpoint, an optimum
   method could be a combination of these two diverse methodologies. This
   paper represents several new D-3 approaches. One is based on the
   computation of a generalized eigenvalue for the signal strength and the
   others are based on the solution of a set of block Hankel matrix
   equations. Since the matrix of the system of equations to be solved has
   a block Hankel structure, the conjugate gradient method and the fast
   Fourier transform (FFT) can be utilized for efficient solution of the
   adaptive problem. illustrative examples presented in this paper use
   measured data from the multichannel airborne radar measurements (MCARM)
   database to detect a Sabreliner in the presence of urban, land, and sea
   clutter. An added advantage for the D-3 method in solving real-life
   problems is that simultaneously many realizations can be obtained for
   the same solution for the signal of interest (SOI), The degree of
   variability amongst the different results can provide a confidence level
   of the processed results. The D-3 method may also be used for mobile
   communications.},

Title = {The Aichi Biodiversity Targets: achievements for marine conservation and

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {In 2010 the Conference of the Parties (COP) for the Convention on
   Biological Diversity revised and updated a Strategic Plan for
   Biodiversity 2011-2020, which included the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.
   Here a group of early career researchers mentored by senior scientists,
   convened as part of the 4th World Conference on Marine Biodiversity,
   reflects on the accomplishments and shortfalls under four of the Aichi
   Targets considered highly relevant to marine conservation: target 6
   (sustainable fisheries), 11 (protection measures), 15 (ecosystem
   restoration and resilience) and 19 (knowledge, science and technology).
   We conclude that although progress has been made towards the targets,
   these have not been fully achieved for the marine environment by the
   2020 deadline. The progress made, however, lays the foundations for
   further work beyond 2020 to work towards the 2050 Vision for
   Biodiversity. We identify key priorities that must be addressed to
   better enable marine biodiversity conservation efforts moving forward.},

Title = {Land loss implications of sea level rise along the coastline of Colombia
   under different climate change scenarios},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {39},
Abstract = {The sea level has risen notably in recent decades compared to the most
   recent millennia. This poses serious threats to infrastructure, local
   jobs, environment and human population over the next century, especially
   in coastal zones. In this paper, the most up-to-date understanding of
   the climate system and climate change was used to investigate impacts of
   sea level rise on potential land loss along the Caribbean and Pacific
   coastlines of Colombia. Sea level rise projections published in August
   2021 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the Sixth
   Assessment Report were used to identify the area at risk of land loss.
   Moreover, the potential socio-economic implications of these changes
   were discussed in regions affected by the projected sea level rises. We
   examined five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways for the 21st century
   (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5. SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5). Our results suggest
   a sea level rise of 1.04 m in the worst-case scenario (SSP5-8.5) which
   would threaten an area of 2840.64 km2. The land use in the affected
   zones was determined. The area at risk will impact 12 departments or 86
   municipalities with different social, environmental, economic, and
   cultural conditions along the coastline of Colombia, that need to be
   considered when devising and implementing mitigation policies.},

Abstract = {Climate issues have affected the sustainable development of global human
   settlements, and carbon, an essential factor affecting climate change,
   has become a hotspot of academic concern. This paper analyzes the
   research characteristics, stages and planning of carbon-oriented climate
   change response research in human settlements based on the literature
   related to research on carbon-oriented human settlements for climate
   change, hereinafter referred to as RCHSCC, included in the Web of
   Science core database since 1991, using CiteSpace and VOSviewer
   bibliometric software. Based on the analysis of the literature and
   discipline distribution, research hotspots and priorities, this paper
   classifies the RCHSCC into four stages: early exploration, relationship
   building, integrated development and deepening collaboration. Based on
   keyword clustering, annual overlap and keyword emergence analysis, this
   paper predicts that future research will have three major trends
   regarding climate risk management, carbon technology enhancement and
   urban safety and resilience research. The study aims to analyze the
   distribution characteristics and evolution of research on
   carbon-oriented human settlements for climate change from 1991 to 2022.
   The RCHSCC predicts three major trends in the future-climate risk
   management, carbon technology upgrading and urban security and
   resilience-and offers three recommendations for governments and planners
   in terms of climate change adaptation and low-carbon and efficient
   development in human settlements.},

Abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) processes at the leaf to landscape scales in
   multiple land uses have important controls and feedbacks for local,
   regional, and global climate and water resource systems. Innovative
   methods, tools, and technologies for improved understanding and
   quantification of ET and crop water use are critical for adapting more
   effective management strategies to cope with increasing demand for
   freshwater resources under global climate change. This article
   introduces an ASABE Special Collection of 12 articles on ET monitoring
   and modeling research for multiple land uses and scales. The collection
   focuses on recent advances in four critical topical areas: (1) reference
   ET (REF-ET) method development and applications, including crop
   management and irrigation scheduling, limitations due to sensor
   inaccuracies and variability, and sensitivity to climatic drivers (three
   articles); (2) ET process and pathway characterization, including canopy
   interception, transpiration, and soil evaporation measured using various
   state-of-the-art techniques on crop lands and plantation forests, and
   effects of soil moisture on grassland water balance (three articles);
   (3) ET simulation within hydrological models (SWAT, MIKE SHE, RZWQM,
   RZ-SHAW, RegCM-BATS, DRAINMOD-FOREST, and Thornthwaite water balance) as
   well as related processes, such as crop growth and ET/PET ratios, for
   grass, crop, and forest lands (four articles); and (4) geospatial
   technology applications, such as using remote sensing to estimate ET and
   its components (soil evaporation and transpiration) for various land
   uses (two articles). Study sites represent a range of spatial scales and
   ecohydrological settings, including grasslands in Inner Mongolia dry
   lands in northern China, semiarid high plains in Texas, corn production
   regions from Iowa to Colorado, forest plantations on the humid Atlantic
   Coastal Plain, developed coastal areas on the island of Taiwan, and the
   continental U.S. Results from these studies will help guide current
   development and assessment of REF-ET, ET, and monitoring and modeling of
   their components in multiple scales and ecosystems. The studies also
   establish a platform for addressing potential inaccuracies in data from
   weather sensors and algorithms used in remote sensing products for
   estimating ET and its parameters, including uncertainties in REF-ET
   estimates, for tall forest vegetation in particular. Furthermore, the
   studies offer insights into the interactions between climatic
   variability and change and vegetation through the ET process.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {317-324},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Portuguese coastline has a high diversity of coastal types, which
   will react differently to an accelerated sea-level rise. Estuaries and
   coastal lagoons will be most affected by a rising sea level. Amongst
   these, the Sado and Tagus estuaries and the Ria de Aveiro and the Ria
   Formosa coastal lagoons are probably the ones where socioeconomic
   impacts resulting from accelerated sea-level rise would be greatest.
   Sandy shores will face increased erosion. However, it is likely that at
   this type of coast other factors, such as sand deficiency caused by
   damming river basins, will continue to play a larger role in erosion
   than accelerated sea-level rise. Hard rocky coasts will be the least
   affected by accelerated sea-level rise. Specific adaptation policies for
   accelerated sea-level rise impacts do not presently exist in Portugal.
   However, existing laws can be used to prevent and/or reduce
   socioeconomic impacts if they are strictly applied. A strong commitment
   to coastal management by Portuguese authorities is therefore necessary
   in order to prevent and minimise future implications of accelerated
   sea-level rise.},

Title = {Emission inventory for harbour-related activities: comparison of two
   distinct bottom-up methodologies},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Emission inventories are an essential tool for harbour authorities to
   assess the impacts of harbour-related activities and to assess the
   effectiveness of mitigation measures. In this paper, two bottom-up
   methodologies (EMEP/EEA and US/SCG) are applied to the Port of Leixoes,
   Portugal, to develop an emission inventory for harbour-related
   activities, accounting for both the emissions from shipping and the
   cargo handling equipment. Emission estimates obtained from the two
   methodologies are compared and discussed. Regarding shipping emissions,
   the main disparities between the two methodologies arise from the
   differences in emission factors and application (or not) of fuel
   correction factors. Among the considered pollutants, EMEP/EEA
   methodology estimates higher total emissions (for all types of ship
   combined) of SOX, NOX, VOC, PM2.5, PM10, CH4, HC, CO and CO2 (up to
   46\%), and lower emission of only N2O (up to 7\%), comparing to US/SCG.
   Regarding CHE emissions, only EMEP/EEA methodology considers the
   deterioration factors adjustment, while the fuel correction factor is
   only considered for US/SCG methodology. Different emission factors also
   contribute to the observed differences in CHE emissions estimates,
   leading to higher total emissions (for all CHE combined) of NOX, CO,
   N2O, PM2.5, PM10, SOX and CO2 (up to 85\%), and lower emission of only
   CH4 (264\%), comparing to US/SCG. This paper provides a highly relevant
   approach to estimate CHE-related emissions in European ports and
   highlights the importance for a standardized methodology to estimate
   emissions from harbour activities, contributing not only to improve the
   scientific knowledge but also to provide support to harbour authorities,
   regarding the quantification of harbour's environmental performance and
   the definition of mitigation measures.},

Title = {Assessment of coastal risks to climate change related impacts at the
   regional scale: The case of the Mediterranean region},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {284-296},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents a Coastal Risk Index (CRI-MED) developed to assess
   coastal risks and vulnerabilities associated with the physical and
   socio-economic impacts of climate change in all Mediterranean coastal
   zones. CRIMED is a spatial risk index, which combines variables
   (multiple data layers) representing different aspects of risk in such a
   way that coastal areas of relatively higher risk emerge from the
   integration of the variables. It creates an interface between
   theoretical concepts of risk and the decision-making process relating to
   disaster risk reduction. Based on a GIS application, CRI-MED provides
   relative hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk maps of the
   Mediterranean region that allow researchers and policy-makers to
   identify coastal areas most at risk from coastal erosion and coastal
   flooding, the so-called ``hot-spots{''}. Through the application of
   CRI-MED on 21 Mediterranean countries, coastal hot-spots are found to be
   predominantly located in the south-eastern Mediterranean region.
   Countries with the highest percentage of extremely high risk values are
   Syria (30.5\%), Lebanon (22.1\%), Egypt (20.7\%), and Palestine
   (13.7\%). The CRI-MED method is intended as a scientific tool which
   produces easily understandable outcomes, to support international
   organizations and national governments to enhance and mainstream
   decision-making based on information that is accessible and useful. The
   definition of coastal hot-spots aims to support the prioritization of
   policies and resources for adaptation and Integrated Coastal Zone
   Management (ICZM). In particular, the resulting risk maps enable
   identification of suitable and less suitable areas for urban
   settlements, infrastructures and economic activities.},

Abstract = {Aim Marine forests of brown macroalgae create essential habitats for
   coastal species and support invaluable ecological services. Here, we
   provide the first global analysis of species richness and endemicity of
   both the kelp and fucoid biomes. Location Global. Time period
   Contemporary. Major taxa studied Marine forests of brown macroalgae,
   formed by kelp (here defined as orders Laminariales, Tilopteridales and
   Desmarestiales) and fucoid (order Fucales), inhabiting subtidal and
   intertidal environments. Methods We coupled a large dataset of
   macroalgal observations (420 species, 1.01 million records) with a
   high-resolution dataset of relevant environmental predictors (i.e.,
   light, temperature, salinity, nitrate, wave energy and ice coverage) to
   develop stacked species distribution models (stacked SDMs) and yield
   estimates of global species richness and endemicity. Results Temperature
   and light were the main predictors shaping the distribution of subtidal
   species, whereas wave energy, temperature and salinity were the main
   predictors of intertidal species. The highest regional species richness
   for kelp was found in the north-east Pacific (maximum 32 species) and
   for fucoids in south-east Australia (maximum 53 species), supporting the
   hypothesis that these regions were the evolutionary sources of global
   colonization by brown macroalgae. Locations with low species richness
   coincided between kelp and fucoid, occurring mainly at higher latitudes
   (e.g., Siberia) and the Baltic Sea, where extensive ice coverage and
   low-salinity regimes prevail. Regions of high endemism for both groups
   were identified in the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica, South Africa and
   East Russia. Main conclusions We estimated the main environmental
   drivers and limits shaping the distribution of marine forests of brown
   macroalgae and mapped biogeographical centres of species richness and
   endemicity, which largely coincided with the expectation from previous
   evolutionary hypotheses. The mapped biodiversity patterns can serve as
   new baselines for planning and prioritizing locations for conservation,
   management and climate change mitigation strategies, flagging threatened
   marine forest regions under different climate change scenarios.},

Title = {From small-scale habitat loopholes to decadal cycles: a habitat-based
   hypothesis explaining fluctuation in pelagic fish populations off Peru},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The Peru-Humboldt Current system (HCS) supports the world's largest
   pelagic fisheries. Among the world's eastern boundary current systems,
   it is the most exposed to high climatic stress and is directly affected
   by El Nino and La Nina events. In this volatile ecosystem, fish have
   been led to develop adaptive strategies in space and time. In this
   paper, we attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying such
   strategies, focusing on the El Nino 1997-98 in Peru from which an
   extensive set of hydrographic, capture and acoustic survey data are
   available. An integrated analysis of the data is crucial, as each has
   substantial shortcomings individually; for example, both catch data and
   acoustic surveys may easily lead to wrong conclusions. Existing
   hypotheses on anchovy and sardine alternations lead us to a
   `habitat-based' synthetic hypothesis. Using our data, an integrated
   approach evaluated how fish responded to habitat variation, and
   determined the consequences in terms of fish-population variability.
   Various factors occurring at a range of different spatio-temporal scales
   were considered: interdecadal regime (warm `El Viejo'/cool `La Vieja'
   decadal scale); strength and the duration of the El Nino Southern
   Oscillation event (interannual scale); population condition before the
   event (interannual scale); fishing pressure and other predation (annual
   scale); changes in reproductive behaviour (intra-annual scale); presence
   of local upwelling (local scale). During El Nino 1997-98, anchovy was
   able to exploit a small-scale temporal and spatial `loophole' inside the
   general unfavourable conditions. Moreover, sardine did not do better
   than anchovy during this El Nino and was not able to take advantage of
   the `loophole' opened by this short-term event. Our results question the
   traditional view that El Nino is bad for anchovy and good for sardine.},

Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to impact countries, regions and localities
   differently. However, common to the predicted impacts is a global trend
   toward increased levels of carbon dioxide and rising sea levels.
   Governments and communities need to take into account the likely impacts
   of climate on the landscape, both built and natural. There is a growing
   and significant body of climate change research. Much of this
   information produced by domain experts for a range of disciplines is
   complex and difficult for planners, decision makers and communities to
   act upon. The need to communicate often complex scientific information
   which can be used to assist in the planning cycle is a key challenge.
   This paper draws from a range of international examples of the use of
   visualisation in the context of landscape planning to communicate
   climate change impact and adaptation options within the context of the
   planning cycle. Missing from the literature, however, is a multi-scalar
   approach which allows decision makers, planners and communities to
   seamlessly explore scenarios at their special level of interest, as well
   as to collectively understand what is driving these at a larger scale,
   and what the implications are at ever more local levels. Visualisation
   tools such as digital globes provide one way to bring together
   multi-scaled spatial-temporal datasets. We present an initial
   development with this goal in mind. Future research is required to
   determine the best tools for communicating particular complex scientific
   data and also to better understand how visualisation can be used to
   improve the landscape planning process.},

Abstract = {Species that cannot adapt or keep pace with a changing climate are
   likely to need human intervention to shift to more suitable climates.
   While hundreds of articles mention using translocation as a
   climate-change adaptation tool, in practice, assisted migration as a
   conservation action remains rare, especially for animals. This is likely
   due to concern over introducing species to places where they may become
   invasive. However, there are other barriers to consider, such as
   time-frame mismatch, sociopolitical, knowledge and uncertainty barriers
   to conservationists adopting assisted migration as a go-to strategy. We
   recommend the following to advance assisted migration as a conservation
   tool: attempt assisted migrations at small scales, translocate species
   with little invasion risk, adopt robust monitoring protocols that
   trigger an active response, and promote political and public support.},

Abstract = {Geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) are the result of coronal mass ejections
   (CMEs) from the sun. CMEs, such as solar flares, alter the magnetic and
   electric field of the earth. These changes induce DC voltage sources
   superimposed on transmission lines. The voltages result in the
   introduction of quasi-DC geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to the
   AC synchronous power grid. These currents can cause half cycle
   saturation of transformers, harmonics, reactive power losses, and in
   extreme situations, widespread power outages. In this work, a
   planning-based GMD mitigation strategy is developed for large power
   systems. GIC blocking devices and system topology are leveraged in the
   design of strategies and systems to maintain preferable system
   operations despite a GMD. Simulation cases based on GIC blocking device
   installation and islanding plans will be used to create a strategy to
   minimize the effects of GMDs on the power grid.},

Abstract = {The Regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment
   (ROPME) Sea Area (RSA) in the northern Indian Ocean, which comprises the
   Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the northern Arabian Sea, already experiences
   naturally extreme environmental conditions and incorporates one of the
   world's warmest seas. There is growing evidence that climate change is
   already affecting the environmental conditions of the RSA, in areas
   including sea temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and sea
   level, which are set to continue changing over time. The cumulative
   impacts of these changes on coastal and marine ecosystems and dependent
   societies are less well documented, but are likely to be significant,
   especially in the context of other human stressors. This review
   represents the first regional synthesis of observed and predicted
   climate change impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems across the ROPME
   Sea Area and their implications for dependent societies. Climate-driven
   ecological changes include loss of coral reefs due to bleaching and the
   decline of fish populations, while socio-economic impacts include
   physical impacts from sea-level rise and cyclones, risk to commercial
   wild capture fisheries, disruption to desalination systems and loss of
   tourism. The compilation of this review is aimed to support the
   development of targeted adaptation actions and to direct future research
   within the RSA.},

Title = {Snake River sockeye and Chinook salmon in a changing climate:
   Implications for upstream migration survival during recent extreme and
   future climates},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {In 2015, the Pacific marine heat wave, low river flows, and record high
   water temperatures in the Columbia River Basin contributed to a
   near-complete failure of the adult migration of endangered Snake River
   sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka, NOAA Fisheries 2016). These extreme
   weather events may become the new normal due to anthropogenic climate
   change, with catastrophic consequences for endangered species. Existing
   anthropogenic pressures may amplify vulnerability to climate change, but
   these potential synergies have rarely been quantified. We examined
   factors affecting survival of endangered sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka)
   and threatened Chinook salmon (O.tshawytscha) as they migrated upstream
   through eight dams and reservoirs to spawning areas in the Snake River
   Basin. Our extensive database included histories of 17,279 individual
   fish that migrated since 2004. A comparison between conditions in 2015
   and daily temperatures and flows in a regulated basin forced by output
   from global climate models showed that 2015 did have many
   characteristics of projected future mean conditions. To evaluate
   potential salmon responses, we modeled migration timing and apparent
   survival under historical and future climate scenarios (2040s). For
   Chinook salmon, adult survival from the first dam encountered to
   spawning grounds dropped by 4-15\%, depending on the climate scenario.
   For sockeye, survival dropped by similar to 80\% from their already low
   levels. Through sensitivity analyses, we observed that the adult sockeye
   migration would need to shift more than 2 weeks earlier than predicted
   to maintain survival rates typical of those seen during 2008-2017.
   Overall, the greater impacts of climate change on adult sockeye compared
   with adult Chinook salmon reflected differences in life history and
   environmental sensitivities, which were compounded for sockeye by larger
   effect sizes from other anthropogenic factors. Compared with Chinook,
   sockeye was more negatively affected by a history of juvenile
   transportation and by similar temperatures and flows. The largest
   changes in temperature and flow were projected to be upstream from the
   hydrosystem, where direct mitigation through hydrosystem management is
   not an option. Unfortunately, Snake River sockeye have likely lost much
   of their adaptive capacity with the loss of the wild population. Further
   work exploring habitat restoration or additional mitigation actions is
   urgently needed.},

Abstract = {Climate change-related risks are place-specific and path-dependent.
   Accordingly, location is an important determinant of hazardous exposure,
   and certain places will bear more risk than others. This article reviews
   the major environmental exposures associated with risky places in the
   U.S., including coastal regions, islands, the desert Southwest,
   vectorborne and zoonotic disease border regions, cities, and the U.S.
   Arctic (Alaska), with emphasis on exposures and vulnerable populations
   of concern. In addition to these hotspots, this study considers the ways
   in which the concept of place-the sense of human relationship with
   particular environments-Arill play a key role in motivating, developing,
   and deploying an effective public health response. In considering the
   importance of place, we highlight the concepts of community resilience
   and risk management, key aspects of a robust response to climate change
   in public health and other sectors.},

   Towards a conceptual framework},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {635},
Pages = {1191-1204},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the impact that changes in natural ecosystems can
   have on health and wellbeing focusing on the potential co-benefits that
   green spaces could provide when introduced as climate change adaptation
   measures. Ignoring such benefits could lead to suboptimal planning and
   decision-making. A conceptual framework, building on the
   ecosystem-enriched Driver, Pressure, State, Exposure, Effect, Action
   model (eDPSEEA), is presented to aid in clarifying the relational
   structure between green spaces and human health, taking climate change
   as the key driver. The study has the double intention of (i) summarising
   the literature with a special emphasis on the ecosystem and health
   perspectives, as well as the main theories behind these impacts, and
   (ii) modelling these findings into a framework that allows for
   multidisciplinary approaches to the underlying relations between human
   health and green spaces. The paper shows that while the literature based
   on the ecosystem perspective presents a well-documented association
   between climate, health and green spaces, the literature using a
   health-based perspective presents mixed evidence in some cases. The role
   of contextual factors and the exposure mechanism are rarely addressed.
   The proposed framework could serve as a multidisciplinary knowledge
   platform for multi-perspecitve analysis and discussion among experts and
   stakeholders, as well as to support the operationalization of
   quantitative assessment and modelling exercises. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {In many developing countries where agricultural groundwater use led to
   aquifer overexploitation, direct control over farmers' groundwater use
   is difficult to implement. This calls for the setting up, at least in
   the short term, of indirect policies, the efficiency of which will
   depend on farmers' strategies. The different strategies adopted by
   farmers to cope with the groundwater crisis are analysed in the Chaouia
   region in Morocco, where intensive agricultural groundwater use for the
   past 50 years has led to seawater intrusion in the seashore part and
   falling groundwater levels further inland. First, strategies may be
   based on chasing groundwater, by deepening boreholes, bringing fresh
   water in sufficient quantity to the farms or renting fields in areas
   with sufficient fresh groundwater, so as to maintain a water-intensive
   farming system. Second, strategies that may be designated as adaptive,
   entail adapting the farming system to the water available on-farm given
   existing hydraulic infrastructures. These strategies may be considered
   as more sustainable with regard to water resources. Most of analysed
   strategies were not at the same time economically and environmentally
   sustainable. Possible policies to achieve economically and
   environmentally sustainable activities differ not only in the difficulty
   of implementing them, but also in the types of farms likely to benefit
   from them. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Flexible adaptation planning for water sensitive cities},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {87-95},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cities have started adapting to uncertain climate drivers such as
   temperature and sea level rise, and some cities are also transitioning
   towards concepts such as Water Sensitivity. In adaptation planning,
   flexibility is considered as an important characteristic to respond to
   changing circumstances. This paper develops a novel approach to identify
   where flexibility can best be embedded in urban flood risk management
   systems. The identification of a flexible water sensitive adaptation
   response is based on change propagation; i.e. the response's ability to
   minimise negative or maximise positive impacts in urban systems. The
   Flexible adaptation planning process (WSCapp), comprising change
   propagation - especially how positive and negative impacts propagate in
   an urban environment, can be used by those concerned with urban planning
   and urban adaptation to identify ``where{''} the flexible adaptation
   responses can be implemented. WSCapp can be used to decide the type of
   adaptation response such as changes to streetscape, place making or
   architectural forms that can best contribute towards the objectives of a
   water sensitive city.},

   shipbuilding unnecessarily expensive and might give a false presumption
   of low risk for EMC. Some investigated aspects of the effects of a
   military naval environment on civil COTS equipment show that a careful

   alternative for the hardening and compliance requiring for all

Title = {Spatial Compatibility of Implementing Nature-Based Solutions for
   Reducing Urban Heat Islands and Stormwater Pollution},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cities worldwide are facing several challenges connected to urbanization
   and climate change. Several cities have identified the implementation of
   nature-based solutions (NBS) as an option to mitigate several challenges
   at once. However, can two different aims be reached with NBS in the same
   location? This question has not yet been addressed. This paper discusses
   the spatial compatibility of NBS implementation strategies to tackle (1)
   urban heat island (UHI) effects and (2) water pollution at the same
   location. The evaluation is based on a spatial analysis of Berlin. We
   found a positive correlation of high UHI and median high stormwater
   pollution loads for zinc, total suspended solids, Polycyclic Aromatic
   Hydrocarbons and Terbutryn. Out of more than 14,000 building/street
   sections analyzed, 2270 showed spatial matching of high UHI and high
   stormwater pollution loads. In the majority of building/street sections,
   stormwater pollution was high for three out of the four parameters. We
   conclude that the compatibility of NBS implementation for both
   challenges depends both on the implementation strategies for NBS and on
   the specific NBS measures. Our spatial analysis can be used for further
   planning processes for NBS implementation.},

Abstract = {Inland precipitation and sea level rise (SLR) are stressors that may
   affect coastal regions worldwide. Flooding is the main consequence of
   inland precipitation and SLR, and therefore, local and regional
   governments seek solutions for adaptation through effective storm and
   tidal water management. Challenges in coastal environments include
   topography, extreme hydrologic events, tides, subsurface geology, and
   surface-ground water interactions. The goal of this study was to support
   a larger research goal that pursues a fundamental understanding,
   including coupled-groundwater-surface mathematical models, of the
   potential of dike-like subsurface barrier systems as adaptation
   strategies in coastal urban areas of different subsurface
   characteristics. This paper presents preliminary results from
   experiments using a laboratory-scale physical model and their analysis
   and verification with the numerical flow-net model SEEP/W (from
   GeoStudio) that simulates seepage flow under subsurface barriers;
   results were then used to forecast flow conditions at realistic
   prototype scale conditions. Experiments and computational simulations,
   herein reported, focused on the subsurface of the barrier island sandy
   formation of the city of Miami Beach, FL. The specific objective of the
   study was to assess the effect of the depth of subsurface barriers on
   the Darcy's velocity and seepage flow. At pseudo-state state seepage
   conditions, various hydraulic head drops across the barrier headwater
   were tested to represent selected ponded conditions at the city of Miami
   Beach, including sea level rise. Seepage and Darcy's velocity were
   determined in the area of flow between the toe of the barrier and the
   bottom of the tank, along an averaged pathline of the seepage flow, and
   used to observe the effect of deeper depths of the barrier.},

Abstract = {Germany is a densely populated country, and most areas have been
   developed for economic andsocial utilization. Intact natural
   environments have become extremely rare. To preserve the
   remainingvaluable resources, engineering activities associated with the
   management of rivers and coastal waters haveto be ecologically oriented
   in order to minimize, or even prevent, negative impacts upon this
   environments. For this purpose, a variety of guidelines have been
   developed at the Federal Institute of Hydrology and have been
   successfully implemented and applied. This paper gives an overview about
   several ecologically oriented engineering approaches covering
   alternative groin types, compensation and mitigation measures, fish pass
   constructions, bedload management, and dredged material disposal, which
   have been successfully used in German rivers and estuaries. In addition,
   the new European Water Framework Directive is introduced.},

Title = {An Analysis of Resilience Planning at the Nexus of Food, Energy, Water,
   and Transportation in Coastal US Cities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change poses increased risks to coastal communities and the
   interconnected infrastructure they rely on, including food, energy,
   water, and transportation (FEWT) systems. Most coastal communities in
   the US are ill-prepared to address these risks, and resilience planning
   is inconsistently prioritized and not federally mandated. This study
   examined the resilience plans of 11 coastal US cities to understand 1.
   How FEWT systems were considered within resilience plans and, 2. How
   nexus principles or elements critical to a nexus approach were
   incorporated within resilience plans. A ``Nexus Index{''} was created to
   examine the incorporation of nexus principles, which included
   partnerships and collaborations, reference to other plans or reports,
   discussion of co-benefits, cascading impacts, and inclusion of
   interdisciplinary or cross-silo principles. These principles were used
   to score each action within the resilience plans. Results showed that
   only eight actions (1\% of all actions across the 11 plans) focused on
   the connections among FEWT systems within the resilience plans. The
   transportation system was associated with the most actions, followed by
   the energy system, water system, and the food system. While FEWT systems
   were not consistently included, there was evidence from the Nexus Index
   that the plans included elements critical to a nexus approach, such as
   the inclusion of partnerships and reference to co-benefits with the
   actions they designed to build resilience. The heterogeneity among the
   systems that each plan emphasized reflects the heterogeneity among the
   challenges that each city faces. While context-specific differences in
   resilience plans across cities are expected, some consistency in
   addressing certain infrastructural needs and their nexus interactions
   may greatly benefit and improve the implementation of resilience
   planning.},

Abstract = {Climate change will likely change the species composition or abundance
   of plant communities, and it is important to anticipate these changes to
   develop climate change adaptation policies. We chose beech (Fagus
   crenata Blume) and its competitive tree species as target species to
   evaluate potential turnover in forest types under climate change using a
   multivariate classification tree model. To construct the model,
   geographical presence/absence data for nine target species were used as
   multivariate response variables, with five climatic factors were used as
   predictor variables. Current and future distribution probabilities for
   the target species were calculated, and the 15 dominant forest types
   were subjectively classified in approximately 1-km(2) grid cells within
   the area of the current beech forest distribution. All 16,398 grid cells
   of the beech-dominant forest type (FCR-QCR) were projected to be
   replaced in the future by five Quercus crispula-dominant types (59\% of
   FCR-QCR grid cells), four Q. serrata types (22\%), two Q. salicina types
   (8\%), or two Abies firma types (0.1\%). The FCR-QCR type remained
   unchanged (stable) in only 11.4\% of grid cells; these were mainly
   distributed at high elevations in snowy areas on the Sea of Japan side
   of the country. In contrast, vulnerable habitats (future probability of
   beech occurrence less than 1.0\%) were found at low elevations on both
   the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean sides. Northwards or upwards
   range expansions or increases of Quercus spp., in particular, need to be
   carefully monitored.},

Title = {Profiling resilience and adaptation in mega deltas: A comparative
   assessment of the Mekong, Yellow, Yangtze, and Rhine deltas},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {198},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {River deltas and estuaries are disproportionally-significant coastal
   landforms that are inhabited by nearly 600 M people globally. In recent
   history, rapid socio-economic development has dramatically changed many
   of the World's mega deltas, which have typically undergone agricultural
   intensification and expansion, land-use change, urbanization, water
   resources engineering and exploitation of natural resources. As a
   result, mega deltas have evolved into complex and potentially vulnerable
   socio-ecological systems with unique threats and coping capabilities.
   The goal of this research was to establish a holistic understanding of
   threats, resilience, and adaptation for four mega deltas of variable
   geography and levels of socio-economic development, namely the Mekong,
   Yellow River, Yangtze, and Rhine deltas. Compiling this kind of
   information is critical for managing and developing these complex
   coastal areas sustainably but is typically hindered by a lack of
   consistent quantitative data across the ecological, social and economic
   sectors. To overcome this limitation, we adopted a qualitative approach,
   where delta characteristics across all sectors were assessed through
   systematic expert surveys. This approach enabled us to generate a
   comparative assessment of threats, resilience, and
   resilience-strengthening adaptation across the four deltas. Our
   assessment provides novel insights into the various components that
   dominate the overall risk situation in each delta and, for the first
   time, illustrates how each of these components differ across the four
   mega deltas. As such, our findings can guide a more detailed, sector
   specific, risk assessment or assist in better targeting the
   implementation of risk mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

   (Sebastes schlegelii) under changing climate},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {128},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Changes in the marine environment, particularly climate change, can have
   large effects on the distribution patterns of various marine species,
   and alter the biodiversity, structure and functions of the affected
   ecosystems. Species distribution models (SDM) are tools often used to
   link species' ecological niches with their environment. We applied SDM
   to investigate the effects of five biologically relevant climatic
   variables from multiple databases, including bottom temperature, bottom
   salinity, current velocity, depth and primary productivity, on habitat
   suitability of Sebastes schlegelii in the marine waters of China, Korea
   and Japan. Nine individual SDM and an ensemble model were used to
   predict the current and future distribution of S. schlegelii under
   alternative climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration
   Pathways, RCP). Results indicated that the ensemble model produced more
   accurate projections than any individual model. Among the environmental
   variables investigated, bottom temperature was the most important in
   determining the range of S. schlegelii. Its current distribution
   demonstrated that suitable habitat for S. schlegelii was mostly
   concentrated in the Bohai Sea, coastal areas of the central and northern
   Yellow Sea, and in the Sea of Japan. Negative effects from climate
   change on the distribution patterns of S. schlegelii were predicted to
   lead to varying degrees of habitat reduction, with highest estimate of
   45\% occurring under RCP8.5 at the end of 2100. Our results illustrate
   the potential effects of climate change on the future distribution of S.
   schlegelii populations and can assist with implementing adaptive
   management measures of this species.},

   regulating, and cultural ecosystem services globally. Reported economic
   costs of individual MHW events exceed US\$800 million in direct losses
   or >US\$3.1 billion in indirect losses of ecosystem services for
   multiple years. However, biological responses to MHWs can also increase
   human-ocean interactions, providing opportunities for coastal societies.
   Our study provides a global perspective on the far-reaching impacts of
   MHWs on human societies and highlights the urgent need to develop robust
   approaches to mitigation and adaptation.},

Title = {The architecture of resilience in rural towns},
Journal = {ARCHNET-IJAR INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-202},
Abstract = {Purpose - Whilst resilience has been a critical academic topic and
   worldwide issue for many decades, not all territories have been equally
   investigated. In addition, the role of architecture in contributing to
   community resilience against climate change has been overlooked.
   Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to shed light on what is the
   current state of the art of community resilience in rural towns and what
   type of architectural strategies has been recognised for facilitating
   resilience.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study has combined literature review
   and architectural project review.
   Findings - There are four major findings to this research that could
   impact policy making and decision making if implemented at different
   institutional levels. First, there is an evident increased academic
   interest on this topic. Second, there is a need for a greater
   consultation among the different stakeholders that participate in the
   planning and implementation of the future-focused adaptation strategies.
   Third, the potential for the architectural discipline to play an active
   role in facilitating and ameliorating community resilience has been
   identified. Fourth, there is a need to integrate placed-based and
   identity-related factors/components into a community's framework for
   resilience amelioration.
   Research limitations/implications - One limitation is the fact that the
   literature review investigated only English literature. Also, the review
   relied mostly on online findings and, for the good-practice review, did
   not take into consideration direct local knowledge, which would have
   required travelling the globe and all of Australia in order to collect
   feedback. Thus, some projects and literature might have been missed.
   Originality/value - The value of this research is to compare findings
   from literature review (scholar activities) and best practices
   (architectural activities). In combining the two aspects, it merges a
   gap in research.},

Title = {Coastal Lawscape: A framework for understanding the complexities of
   climate change adaptation},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastlines around the world face complex, multi-sectoral challenges as
   these volatile areas adapt to a changing climate. Despite claims that
   law can play a central role in overcoming these challenges and advancing
   adaptation trajectories, there is relatively little research that
   connects law, adaptation, and coastal landscapes through the lens of
   legal geography. This paper systematically makes these connections to
   empirically explore the role of law in climate change adaptation. In
   doing so, the paper posits a `Coastal Lawscape' as a useful frame
   through which to both theorise and to empirically explore coastal
   climate change adaptation. After detailing the concept of Coastal
   Lawscape, the paper explores how Coastal Lawscape manifests and
   influences climate change adaptation trajectories via a case study of
   four sites within one state jurisdiction. The empirical evidence shows
   that Coastal Lawscape comprises legal, political and cultural normative
   systems, and argues that un-derstanding the interconnectedness of these
   systems is critical for advancing coastal climate change adaptation

Title = {Analyzing the impact of changing landscape pattern and dynamics on land
   surface temperature in Lucknow city, India},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increasing urbanization has hampered the overall livelihood of urban
   dwellers. Urban heat island (UHI) is a significant consequence of
   urbanization on the earth's environment. Its geographical pattern,
   impact, and mitigation strategies remain poorly understood over large
   areas. The study aims at determining and analyzing how changing
   landscape patterns (at macro-level) and dynamics (at micro-level) affect
   the land surface temperature (LST). The macro pattern analysis is
   performed by examining the spatial variation of LST with the
   distribution of green space (GS) and impervious surface (IS). Whereas,
   micro dynamics analysis is carried out by critical examination of the
   city's environmental health condition. To this end, an environmental
   health index (EHI) is derived based on the relation of land surface
   temperature variation index (LSTVI) with (i) UHI intensity, (ii) green
   space density (GSD), and (iii) impervious surface density (ISD).
   Moreover, we determined the impact of various types of sprawl expansion
   and drivers in developing UHI phenomenon in Lucknow city, India, from
   2005-2016. The results show an increased impervious density and
   decreased greenness density over the study years. The mean LST of IS is
   found to be 4 degrees C higher than that of GS in 2005, which further
   increased to 6 degrees C in the year 2016. The results from macro
   pattern analysis depict a significantly strong correlation between mean
   LST, ISD (positive) and GSD (negative) along the rural-urban gradients.
   The results from the micro dynamics analysis are interpreted as an EHI
   rating for specific zones going through the UHI phenomenon. Overall the
   study reveals an adverse effect of decreasing greenness density and
   advocates the vital role of GS in mitigating UHI effects. Our study also
   highlights UHI spatial pattern and its driving factors, suggesting
   various effective mitigation strategies for suppressing the UHI effect
   and providing a scientific basis for sustainable development.},

Title = {The evolving sedentary lifestyle among nomadic pastoralists in the humid
   zone of Nigeria: implications for land-use policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The humid zone of Nigeria has traditionally been considered unsuitable
   for extensive cattle production because of the prevalence of tsetse fly.
   Over the years, nomadic pastoralists, mainly Fulani, from the northern
   part of the country paid seasonal visits to this zone in search of
   pasture and water for their cattle during the dry season when the threat
   of the tsetse menace is less. The recent increase in the number of
   settled pastoralists has been associated with changing trends in the
   ecology and economy of the zone.
   Relying on recent survey data, this paper attempts a systematic analysis
   of the adaptive strategies of the Fulani in pursuit of a sedentary
   lifestyle in the humid frontier of southwest Nigeria. Some of the
   adaptive strategies identified include: establishment of grazing orbits
   within a 20 km radius of their settlements, adjustment of herd size and
   structure, adoption of a multiple livelihood system, production of
   arable crops and appropriation of traditional social structures and
   kinship networks for herd management.
   Long-term insecure land-holding arrangements, incessant seasonal bush
   burning for regeneration of pasture by the Fulani and the gradual
   destruction of the native forest cover are some of the problems arising
   from the sedentarisation of livestock production in the area. It was
   observed that the present land-use arrangement, even though it appears
   to guarantee the pastoralists security of tenure in the shore term, is
   not sustainable in the long run, given the increasing commercialisation
   of land in the: area and rapid population growth, It was, therefore,
   concluded that government should put in place a land redistribution
   arrangement that will ensure secure land ownership by the Fulani.
   Development initiatives in the area should also focus on reinforcing
   those traditional practices of the Fulani that would guarantee a
   sustainable land-use system in the area.},

Abstract = {The rivers flowing into the Western Indian Ocean have steep headwater
   gradients and carry high sediment loads. In combination with strong
   tides and seasonal rainfall, these rivers create dynamic deltas with
   biodiversity-rich and productive ecosystems that, through flooding, have
   sustained indigenous use systems for centuries. However, river
   catchments are rapidly changing due to deforestation. Hydropower dams
   also increasingly alter flood characteristics, reduce sediment supply
   and contribute to coastal erosion. These impacts are compounded by
   climate change. Altogether, these changes affect the livelihoods of the
   delta users. Here, based on prior works that we and others have
   conducted in the region, we analyse the drivers of these
   hydro-ecological changes. We then provide recommendations for improved
   dam design and operations to sustain the underlying delta-building
   processes, the ecosystem values and the needs of the users. (C) 2017

Journal = {APPLIED ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-71},
Abstract = {We estimated the economic costs and impacts of future sea-level rise
   (SLR) and storm surge due to climate change in Canada's coastal
   provinces using regional, dynamic computable general equilibrium models
   that track provincial welfare, GDP, trade, prices and inputs over the
   2009-2054 period. We also assessed the economic costs of coastal
   adaptation investments, to determine whether such investments can be
   justified on economic grounds. Results indicated that SLR and storm
   surge could cost Canada in the range of \$4.6-\$25.5 billion in present
   value welfare, and between \$53.7 and \$108.7 billion in present value
   GDP. We found significant variation in costs and impacts across coastal
   provinces, with some provinces such as Newfoundland and Labrador
   experiencing only marginal costs/impacts, and others such as British
   Columbia experiencing costs as high as \$21 billion in welfare over the
   period. Coastal adaptation investments were supported on economics
   grounds. Overall, this study provides the first (and preliminary)
   provincial economic impact estimates of climate-induced SLR and storm
   surge, as well as adaptation investments, in Canada. Additional research
   is needed to refine the analysis in order to produce reliable estimates
   that can be used to guide coastal adaptation policies in Canada.},

Abstract = {Climate change can promote disease emergence if shifting conditions
   favour infection of native fauna by introduced parasites and pathogens.
   In Hawai'i, climate warming is predicted to reduce net precipitation and
   surface flow in streams, which in turn could increase parasitism of
   native stream fishes by non-native parasites. In this study, we utilised
   a natural precipitation gradient across the Hamakua coast on the island
   of Hawai'i to assess the relationship between precipitation and
   infection of Awaous stamineus, a native amphidromous goby, by the
   introduced nematode Camallanus cotti. We found that the abundance,
   intensity and prevalence of C.cotti in A.stamineus increased with
   declining rainfall. Our results also show that parasitism tracks
   precipitation patterns across the archipelago and that parasitism
   increases even with moderate decreases in rainfall. As the Hamakua coast
   precipitation gradient represents a proxy for predicted climate-driven
   reductions in precipitation, these findings suggest that infection of
   native Hawaiian fishes by introduced parasites will increase if climate
   conditions change as expected. Our findings also suggest that parasitism
   may be exacerbated by other factors that reduce surface flow, including
   water extraction for agricultural and urban uses. If so, then adaptive
   management of minimum flow standards in Hawai'i and elsewhere could
   improve the well-being of at-risk native fishes by alleviating
   parasitism under current and future climate conditions.},

Abstract = {The character, the motion and the proportion of environment-induced
   migration have radically changed in recent years. Environment-induced
   migration is an increasingly recognized fact and has become one of the
   main challenges of the 21st century, and needs to be focused on to
   ensure sustainable growth. This new stance is due to the changing
   character of environmental degradation. Global environmental issues,
   including climate change, loss of biodiversity, river and oceanic
   contamination, land degradation, drought, and the destruction of
   rainforests, are progressively stressing the earth's ecosystems. Among
   these issues, climate change is one of the most severe threats. Climate
   change alone does not directly induce people to move but it generates
   harmful environmental effects and worsens present vulnerabilities. The
   current study aims to provide cornerstone links between the effects of
   climate change, migration decisions, displacement risk and conflicts in
   the example of Afghanistan, as a country that is extremely affected by
   both climate change and conflicts, and outline priority policy focuses
   to mitigate the current situation in the country.},

Abstract = {Purpose of Review In this article, we examine the intersection of human
   migration and climate change. Growing evidence that changing
   environmental and climate conditions are triggers for displacement,
   whether voluntary or forced, adds a powerful argument for profound
   anticipatory engagement. Recent Findings Climate change is expected to
   displace vast populations from rural to urban areas, and when life in
   the urban centers becomes untenable, many will continue their onward
   migration elsewhere (Wennersten and Robbins2017; Rigaud et al.2018). It
   is now accepted that the changing climate will be a threat multiplier,
   will exacerbate the need or decision to migrate, and will
   disproportionately affect large already vulnerable sections of humanity.
   Worst-case scenario models that assume business-as-usual approaches to
   climate change predict that nearly one-third of the global population
   will live in extremely hot (uninhabitable) climates, currently found in
   less than 1\% of the earth's surface mainly in the Sahara. We find that
   the post-World War II regime designed to receive European migrants has
   failed to address population movement in the latter half of the
   twentieth century fueled by economic want, globalization, opening (and
   then closing) borders, civil strife, and war. Key stakeholders are in
   favor of using existing instruments to support a series of local,
   regional, and international arrangements to protect environmental
   migrants, most of whom will not cross international borders. The
   proposal for a dedicated UN agency and a new Convention has largely come
   from academia and NGOs. Migration is now recognized not only as a
   consequence of instability but as an adaptation strategy to the changing
   climate. Migration must be anticipated as a certainty, and thereby
   planned for and supported.},

Abstract = {Climate change will likely affect the effectiveness of future management
   of coastal ecosystems, impacting communities that reside within the
   coastal area. In order to formulate appropriate adaptation
   counter-measures it is important to understand the actual vulnerability
   of the communities that depend on these ecosystems. The present research
   proposes a tool for assessing the vulnerability of coastal communities
   to climate change by combining survey results with secondary and
   observed data available from national and local governments. The study
   focused on fisheries, given that they constitute the source of
   livelihood for many communities in developing countries such as Vietnam.
   The results showed that two coastal wards in Binh Thuan province,
   Vietnam, are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, mainly
   because of their dependence on fisheries and the topography of the area.
   The seasonality of their source of livelihood affects the adaptive
   capacity of residents, making it less likely that they will be able to
   successfully adapt to changes in fishery resources that could be brought
   about by climate change. The results also showed that the communities
   are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, given that they are both
   located in the immediate vicinity of the sea and are particularly low in
   elevation.},

Title = {Coastal Erosion Vulnerability in Mainland China Based on Fuzzy
   Evaluation of Cloud Models},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Global climate change-induced sea-level rise and storm wave
   intensification, along with the large population densities and
   high-intensity human development activities in coastal areas, have
   caused serious burden and damage to China's coasts, led to the rapid
   growth of artificial shorelines development, and formed a ``new Great
   Wall{''} of reinforced concrete against the laws of nature. After the
   last ice age, transgression formed the different features of China's
   coast. Depending on the types of geological and landform features,
   coasts are divided into 36 evaluation units, and 10 indicators are
   selected from natural aspects (including tectonics, geomorphology,
   sediment, and storms) and aspects of social economy (population, GDP,
   Gross Domestic Product), and cloud model theory is used to build a
   coastal erosion vulnerability evaluation index system in China. The
   results show that high grade (V), high-middle grade (IV), middle grade
   (III), low-middle grade (II), and low grade (I) coastal erosion
   vulnerability degrees account for 5.56, 13.89, 41.67, 33.33, and 5.56\%
   of the Chinese coastlines, respectively. The coastal erosion
   vulnerability of the subsidence zone is significantly higher than that
   of the uplift zone. Reverse cloud model and analytic hierarchy process
   calculation show that the main factors that control coastal erosion
   vulnerability since the transgression after the last ice age are
   geological structure, topography and lithological features, and in
   recent years, the decrease in sea sediment loads and increase in
   reclamation engineering. Mainland China must live with the basic
   situation of coastal erosion, and this study shows that the index system
   and method of cloud modeling are suitable for the evaluation of the
   coastal erosion vulnerability of the Chinese mainland. This study
   provides a scientific basis for the adaptive management of coastal
   erosion, coastal disaster assessment and the overall planning of land
   and sea.},

Title = {Climate Change Threatens Coexistence within Communities of Mediterranean
   Forested Wetlands},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean region is one of the hot spots of climate change. This
   study aims at understanding what are the conditions sustaining tree
   diversity in Mediterranean wet forests under future scenarios of altered
   hydrological regimes. The core of the work is a quantitative, dynamic
   model describing the coexistence of different Mediterranean tree
   species, typical of arid or semi-arid wetlands. Two kind of species,
   i.e. Hygrophilous (drought sensitive, flood resistant) and
   Non-hygrophilous (drought resistant, flood sensitive), are broadly
   defined according to the distinct adaptive strategies of trees against
   water stress of summer drought and winter flooding. We argue that at
   intermediate levels of water supply the dual role of water (resource and
   stress) results in the coexistence of the two kind of species. A
   bifurcation analysis allows us to assess the effects of climate change
   on the coexistence of the two species in order to highlight the impacts
   of predicted climate scenarios on tree diversity. Specifically, the
   model has been applied to Mediterranean coastal swamp forests of Central
   Italy located at Castelporziano Estate and Circeo National Park. Our
   results show that there are distinct rainfall thresholds beyond which
   stable coexistence becomes impossible. Regional climatic projections
   show that the lower rainfall threshold may be approached or crossed
   during the XXI century, calling for an urgent adaptation and mitigation
   response to prevent biodiversity losses.},

Title = {Predicting potential compliance of small-scale fishers in Brazil: The
   need to increase trust to achieve fisheries management goals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {288},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Many global management and conservation initiatives fail to prevent
   overfishing either because they do not plan for local engagement,
   surveillance, and enforcement, and/or because they fail to include
   alternatives for shortterm losses. Thus, these initiatives do not gain
   support among fishers. In this study, we interviewed fishers to
   investigate their stated behavior toward fisheries regulations. We
   assessed possible (non)compliant behavior under scenarios where fishers
   would face a moratorium on some of their target species. Additionally,
   we investigated the consequences of such a moratorium on the food web if
   it were to lead to fishing alternative species. Using data from two
   Brazilian coastal sites, we found that younger fishers and those who
   demonstrated a trustworthy relationship with stakeholders were inclined
   to comply with the rules. The level of potential compliance also varied
   between the studied places, probably due to unidentified local
   idiosyncrasies. Fishers tended to trust community actors (e.g., the
   leader or head of the fishing community) more than institutional actors
   (e.g., environmental agencies). When fishers were asked why they would
   choose specific replacement species in the event of a moratorium, they
   most often cited expected profitability and ease of capture as reasons.
   Fishers also tended to say that they would replace endangered species
   with species in the same and/or lower trophic categories. We suggest
   working toward stronger stakeholder engagement, given that an overall
   sense of trust in a community appears to be an important asset toward
   successful management. Higher levels of trust could promote more
   transparency in the decision-making process, which could facilitate
   information dissemination, awareness, and the need for compliance. The
   mixed methods approach used here could help predict responses to new and
   existing management policies and support adaptive fisheries management.},

Title = {Development of an adaptation toolbox to protect southeast Florida water
   supplies from climate change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {397-417},
Abstract = {Sea level rise and changes in precipitation patterns due to climate
   change present a challenge to water resources engineers and planners in
   southeast Florida with regard to sustainable water supplies and
   Everglades restoration. Because over half of the urban areas of
   Miami-Dade and Broward counties, as well as portions of Palm Beach
   County (home to 5 million people), are at an elevation below 5 ft
   national geodetic vertical datum (ngvd), protection against sea level
   rise and coastal migration presents a challenge. Current approaches to
   water supply will not protect the resilience and prolong the
   sustainability of the region's water resources. In this paper, the
   authors outline the potential effects of sea level rise scenarios for
   coastal southeast Florida and develop a toolbox of options for
   adaptation for water, wastewater, and stormwater utilities to apply. Any
   given option may not be appropriate for all utilities, and any given
   utility may deem there to be benefits to pursuing multiple strategies on
   a timeline in keeping with the latest estimates of sea level rise. The
   authors also developed milestones to trigger infrastructure investments,
   as climate changes may occur more rapidly or more slowly than currently
   projected. While applied to southeast Florida, many of these same
   toolbox items may be useful for other utilities located in coastal areas
   with low elevation, high water tables, and significant wet and dry
   seasons.},

Title = {Assessment of Climate Change Impacts in the North Adriatic Coastal Area.
   Part II: Consequences for Coastal Erosion Impacts at the Regional Scale},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion is an issue of major concern for coastal managers and is
   expected to increase in magnitude and severity due to global climate
   change. This paper analyzes the potential consequences of climate change
   on coastal erosion (e.g., impacts on beaches, wetlands and protected
   areas) by applying a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology to the
   North Adriatic (NA) coast of Italy. The approach employs hazard
   scenarios from a multi-model chain in order to project the spatial and
   temporal patterns of relevant coastal erosion stressors (i.e., increases
   in mean sea-level, changes in wave height and variations in the sediment
   mobility at the sea bottom) under the A1B climate change scenario.
   Site-specific environmental and socio-economic indicators (e.g.,
   vegetation cover, geomorphology, population) and hazard metrics are then
   aggregated by means of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) with the
   aim to provide an example of exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage
   maps for the NA region. Among seasonal exposure maps winter and autumn
   depict the worse situation in 2070-2100, and locally around the Po river
   delta. Risk maps highlight that the receptors at higher risk are
   beaches, wetlands and river mouths. The work presents the results of the
   RRA tested in the NA region, discussing how spatial risk mapping can be
   used to establish relative priorities for intervention, to identify
   hot-spot areas and to provide a basis for the definition of coastal
   adaptation and management strategies.},

Title = {Modeling of Daytime and Nighttime Surface Urban Heat Island Distribution
   Combined with LCZ in Beijing, China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Along with urbanization, surface urban heat island (SUHI) has attracted
   more attention. Due to the lack of perspective of spatial heterogeneity
   in relevant studies, it is difficult to propose specific strategies to
   alleviate the SUHI. This study discusses the impact of spatial
   heterogeneity on the day and night SUHI by taking one day and night in
   Beijing as an example, and uses it to improve the efficiency of SUHI
   simulation for related planning. This study, based on the local climate
   zone (LCZ), deeply discusses the relationship between urban morphology
   and the SUHI. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) model with the
   LCZ is developed to predict the distribution of the SUHI. The results
   show that: (1) In summer, the general SUHI intensity distribution
   patterns are compact zone > large low-rise zone > open zone and medium
   floor zone > low floor zone > high floor zone. (2) Building density and
   albedo in dense areas are higher correlated with the SUHI than open
   areas. The building height has a significant negative correlation with
   the SUHI in high-rise zone, but has a positive correlation in middle and
   low floors. (3) The LCZ improves the overall accuracy of the ANN model,
   especially the simulation accuracy in the daytime. In terms of regions,
   LCZ2, LCZ8, and LCZ10 are improved to a higher degree. This study is
   helpful to formulate the SUHI mitigation strategies of ``adapting to the
   conditions of the LCZ{''} and provide reference for improving the
   sustainable development of the urban thermal environment.},

Title = {Governance Challenges in Addressing Climatic Concerns in Coastal Asia

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Coastal people, especially those living within deltaic areas, encounter
   major climatic concerns which affect their livelihoods. To cope with
   this problem, different types of planned adaptation strategies have been
   implemented guided by laws, policies and programs. However, these
   guiding documents sometimes fall short of addressing the needs of
   climate-affected people, especially in natural resource-dependent
   societies in Asia and Africa. Based on this premise, this paper sought
   to evaluate the effectiveness of existing policy documents which affect
   the lives of people living in one large delta (Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
   in Bangladesh), two medium-sized deltas (Indian Bengal deltapart of the
   Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Mahanadi in India), and a small-sized
   delta (Volta in Ghana). The study followed a mixed methods research
   design, which included desktop analyses of policies, laws and programs,
   a questionnaire survey conducted among individuals who played various
   roles in the policy and legal development processes at national and
   local levels and focus group discussions at the community level in the
   three countries. National laws, policies and programs were assessed in
   the context of climate change adaptation through three lenses: human
   rights, natural resource management and disaster response. Findings of
   this paper reveal that the existing documents have some strengths to
   promote adaptation, although they have some major limitations that cause
   concerns among the delta communities.},

Title = {Addressing global environmental megatrends by decoupling the causal
   chain through floating infrastructure},
Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {113},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the coming decades humanity will be confronted with a number of
   complex challenges affecting the prosperity and livelihood of billions
   of people around the globe. The root of these challenges lies in the
   downright explosion in global population over the last decades combined
   with a staggering increase of urbanization rates leading to an
   unprecedented level of demand for food, water, materials and space.
   Consequently, growing scarcity of essential resources are an ever
   increasing threat towards global peace and stability. This conflict
   potential is exacerbated by global warming and the associated sea level
   rise, which can once again be traced back to the rapidly growing demand
   for energy and food of the world's economies.
   In this paper we develop a comprehensive chain of cause and effect
   surrounding these global developments. Furthermore, we discuss how
   floating infrastructure, through its application to renewable energy
   generation, food production, flood protection and even urban expansion,
   is capable of decoupling multiple linkages in the chain, thus presenting
   itself as a promising mid- to long-term strategy for addressing these
   global challenges.},

Abstract = {Currently in China there are growing concerns about environmental issues
   related to the growth of suburban towns. Rapid urbanization and lagged
   environmental infrastructures resulted in severe environment issues for
   suburban owns, consequently affecting the sustainable development of
   suburban areas. In Xiamen, a southeastern coastal city of China,
   suburban town environmental planning (EP) has been proposed since 2003
   as one of the important tools to control pollution and conserve
   ecosystem. However, adaptability of EP should be improved to integrate
   its results into the decision-making process. In this paper, the
   adaptive management was introduced, principles of adaptive suburban town
   EP were advanced, and the EP process integrating information from
   multi-source and different stakeholders was summarized according to the
   experience in Dongfu Town of Xiamen. Ecological functional zoning (EFZ)
   was identified as the focal element of EP; a method of effective EFZ
   without compromising scientific consideration was formulated. The
   experience indicates that the application of proposed EP methods can
   integrate science into decision-making process, avoiding both
   narrow-minded viewpoints of planners and natural resource use conflicts
   among variety of stakeholders. Subsequently, the EP approach enables its
   results acceptable for local communities and decision-makers. More
   importantly, sustainable development of targeted areas can be achieved
   through well-designed environmental planning.},

   CalCOFI for Understanding and Adapting to Marine Climate Change Impacts},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Multidisciplinary, integrated ocean observing programs provide critical
   data for monitoring the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems.
   California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI)
   samples along the US West Coast and is one of the world's
   longest-running and most comprehensive time series, with hydrographic
   and biological data collected since 1949. The pairing of ecological and
   physical measurements across this long time series informs our
   understanding of how the California Current marine ecosystem responds to
   climate variability. By providing a baseline to monitor change, the
   CalCOFI time series serves as a Keeling Curve for the California
   Current. However, challenges remain in connecting the data collected
   from long-term monitoring programs with the needs of stakeholders
   concerned with climate change adaptation (i.e., resource managers,
   policy makers, and the public), including for the fisheries and
   aquaculture sectors. We use the CalCOFI program as a case study to ask:
   how can long-term ocean observing programs inform ecosystem based
   management efforts and create data flows that meet the needs of
   stakeholders working on climate change adaptation? Addressing this
   question and identifying solutions requires working across sectors and
   recognizing stakeholder needs. Lessons learned from CalCOFI can inform
   other regional monitoring programs around the world, including those
   done at a smaller scale in developing countries.},

Title = {Predicting and Correcting Electrocution of Birds in Mediterranean Areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {74},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1852-1862},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Bird electrocution on power lines is an important conservation problem
   that affects many endangered species. We surveyed 3,869 pylons in the
   Barcelona Pre-littoral Mountains (Catalonia, NE Spain) and collected 141
   carcasses of electrocuted birds, mainly raptors and corvids. Univariate
   analysis indicated that metal pylons with pin-type insulators or exposed
   jumpers, with connector wires, located on ridges, overhanging other
   landscape elements, and in open habitats with low vegetation cover were
   the most dangerous. A logistic regression model indicated that the
   probability of a pylon electrocuting a bird was mainly related to pylon
   conductivity, distribution of the conductive elements on the cross-arms,
   cross-arm configuration, habitat, topography, whether the pylon was
   overhanging other landscape elements, and presence of rabbits
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We validated the predictive power of this model
   by using a random sample of 20\% of all pylons surveyed. We found that
   bird mortality was aggregated mainly on pylons assigned a high
   probability risk by the model. Pylons included in the very high
   electrocution risk category (9.2\%) accounted for 53.2\% of carcasses,
   whereas pylons classified in the low electrocution risk category
   (54.5\%) only accounted for 3.5\% of mortality. Power companies employed
   this classification to prioritize the correction of 222 pylons by
   installing alternate cross-arms and suspended jumpers and isolating
   wires and jumpers. We evaluated the effectiveness of this mitigation
   strategy. A significant fall in the mortality rate on corrected pylons
   combined with the lack of any reduction in the mortality rate in a
   sample of 350 noncorrected pylons indicated that the model selected
   adequately the most dangerous pylons and that the applied correction
   measures were effective. Consequently, our strategy may be a useful tool
   for optimizing efforts and resources invested in solving the problem of
   bird electrocution.},

Title = {Diverse cooling effects of green space on urban heat island in tropical
   megacities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Cities in tropical regions are experiencing high heat risks by
   overlaying the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Urban green space (UGS)
   can provide local cooling effect and reduce UHI. However, there still
   lack a comprehensive exploration of the characteristics of UHI and
   cooling effect of UGS due to high cloud coverage and limited number of
   available remote sensing observations. In this study, the enhanced
   spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance data fusion method was
   employed to develop an enhanced land surface temperature data in winter
   seasons in three tropical megacities, Dhaka, Kolkata, and Bangkok. The
   spatiotemporal variations of surface urban heat island (SUHI) were
   explored from 2000 to 2020 with a 5-years interval. The optimal size of
   UGS associated with its cooling effects was assessed by using the
   threshold value of efficiency (TVoE). The relationship between the
   intensity and range of urban cooling island (UCI) and four landscape
   metrics of green space patches, total area (P\_Area), shape index
   (P\_SI), normalized difference vegetation index (P\_NDVI), and land
   surface temperature (P\_LST), were analyzed. The results show that the
   average SUHI intensity increased by 0.98 degrees C, 1.42 degrees C, and
   0.73 degrees C in Dhaka, Kolkata, and Bangkok, respectively, from 2000
   to 2020. The maximum intensity of UCI ranges from 4.83 degrees C in
   Bangkok to 8.07 degrees C in Kolkata, and the maximum range of UCI
   varies from 300 m in Bangkok to 420 m in Kolkata. The optimal size of
   green space is 0.37 ha, 0.77 ha, and 0.42 ha in Dhaka, Kolkata, and
   Bangkok, respectively. The P\_NDVI and P\_Area had significant positive
   effects on UCI intensity and range, while the background temperature had
   significant negative effects. With higher background temperature, the
   optimal patch size of UGS is larger. This study provides useful
   information for developing effective heat mitigation and adaptation
   strategies to enhance climate resilience in tropical cities.},

Abstract = {The impacts of natural disasters are often disproportionally borne by
   poor or otherwise marginalized groups. However, while disaster risk
   modelling studies have made progress in quantifying the exposure of
   populations, limited advances have been made in determining the
   socioeconomic characteristics of these exposed populations. Here, we
   generate synthetic structural and socioeconomic microdata for around 9.5
   million persons for six districts in Bangladesh as vector points using a
   combination of spatial microsimulation techniques and dasymetric
   modelling. We overlay the dataset with satellite-derived flood extents
   of Cyclone Fani, affecting the region in 2019, quantifying the number of
   exposed households, their socioeconomic characteristics, and the
   exposure bias of certain household variables. We demonstrate how
   combining various modelling techniques could provide novel insights into
   the exposure of poor and vulnerable groups, which could help inform the
   emergency response after extreme events as well targeting adaptation
   options to those most in need of them.},

Abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key technology to potentially
   mitigate global warming by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from
   industrial facilities and power generation that escape into the
   atmosphere. To broaden the usage of geological storage as a viable
   climate mitigation option, it is vital to understand CO2 behaviour after
   its injection within a storage reservoir, including its potential
   migration through overlying sediments, as well as biogeochemical and
   ecological impacts in the event of leakage.
   The impacts of a CO2 release were investigated by a controlled release
   experiment that injected CO2 at a known flux into shallow,
   under-consolidated marine sediments for 37 days. Repeated
   high-resolution 2D seismic reflection surveying, both pre-release and
   syn-release, allows the detection of CO2-related anomalies, including:
   seismic chimneys; enhanced reflectors within the subsurface; and bubbles
   within the water column. In addition, reflection coefficient and seismic
   attenuation values calculated for each repeat survey, allow the impact
   of CO2 flux on sediment acoustic properties to be comparatively
   monitored throughout the gas release. CO2 migration is interpreted as
   being predominantly controlled by sediment stratigraphy in the early
   stages of the experiment. However, either the increasing flow rate, or
   the total injected volume become the dominant factors determining CO2
   migration later in the experiment. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Changes in population susceptibility to heat and cold over time:
   assessing adaptation to climate change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Background: In the context of a warming climate and increasing
   urbanisation (with the associated urban heat island effect), interest in
   understanding temperature related health effects is growing. Previous
   reviews have examined how the temperature-mortality relationship varies
   by geographical location. There have been no reviews examining the
   empirical evidence for changes in population susceptibility to the
   effects of heat and/or cold over time. The objective of this paper is to
   review studies which have specifically examined variations in
   temperature related mortality risks over the 20th and 21st centuries and
   determine whether population adaptation to heat and/or cold has
   occurred.
   Methods: We searched five electronic databases combining search terms
   for three main concepts: temperature, health outcomes and changes in
   vulnerability or adaptation. Studies included were those which
   quantified the risk of heat related mortality with changing ambient
   temperature in a specific location over time, or those which compared
   mortality outcomes between two different extreme temperature events
   (heatwaves) in one location.
   Results: The electronic searches returned 9183 titles and abstracts, of
   which eleven studies examining the effects of ambient temperature over
   time were included and six studies comparing the effect of different
   heatwaves at discrete time points were included. Of the eleven papers
   that quantified the risk of, or absolute heat related mortality over
   time, ten found a decrease in susceptibility over time of which five
   found the decrease to be significant. The magnitude of the decrease
   varied by location. Only two studies attempted to quantitatively
   attribute changes in susceptibility to specific adaptive measures and
   found no significant association between the risk of heat related
   mortality and air conditioning prevalence within or between cities over
   time. Four of the six papers examining effects of heatwaves found a
   decrease in expected mortality in later years. Five studies examined the
   risk of cold. In contrast to the changes in heat related mortality
   observed, only one found a significant decrease in cold related
   mortality in later time periods.
   Conclusions: There is evidence that across a number of different
   settings, population susceptibility to heat and heatwaves has been
   decreasing. These changes in heat related susceptibility have important
   implications for health impact assessments of future heat related risk.
   A similar decrease in cold related mortality was not shown. Adaptation
   to heat has implications for future planning, particularly in urban
   areas, with anticipated increases in temperature due to climate change.},

Abstract = {Solution and diffusion process of carbon dioxide (CO2) in seawater is
   important in the research and development of CO2 ocean sequestration
   technology to mitigate global warming. In the present study, solution
   processes of CO2 gas in seawater and synthetic seawater were
   experimentally and theoretically studied under various pressures and
   temperatures to evaluate the transport process of CO2 in seawater. It
   was obtained that the solubilities of CO2 increase with an increase in
   pressure, but decrease with an increase in temperature. The solubility
   of CO2 in synthetic seawater decreases with an increase in salt
   concentration. An empirical correlation for solubility of CO(2 i)n
   seawater at various temperatures and pressures was obtained based on the
   experimental data. It can express the experimental data within +/- 6\%,
   and express the data by Stewart and Munjal within +/- 15\%. In the
   theoretical analysis for the solution of single CO2 bubble in seawater,
   it was concluded that the rate of solution of bubble in liquid is
   affected strongly by various parameters, such as solubility, diffusion
   coefficient, bubble radius, and temperature. The bubble solution process
   is enhanced by lowering the temperature: the total solution time at 280
   K is 20\% shorter than that at 293 K under the pressure of 4 MPa.},

   Case Study in Orchid Island (Lanyu), Taiwan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Spatial management consists of land property and land use management,
   both on land and in the ocean. From the perspective of
   `social-ecological systems', local spatial management represented the
   resilience of adaptation that indigenous knowledge and environment
   change were interrelated. This study aims to extract critical components
   that contribute to the dynamic maintenance of the stability and
   sustainability of local spatial management. The indigenous knowledge of
   Yami people on Orchid Island was investigated as a case study to
   highlight how indigenous institutions functioned in a more suitable and
   adaptable way for local spatial management. Empirical data were
   collected by participatory mapping and an in-depth interview with
   indigenous experts. Differently from the official policy, the results
   show that the cultural-specific spatial regulations, including land
   ownership and land use, were strictly maintained with landscape
   structure and social organizations by the Yami indigenous institution.
   Local cultural spatial management with regulated and comprehensive
   institutions could cope with challenges immediately and dynamically, and
   enhance resilience more than official institutions that are simplified
   and controlled by the state. It is argued that spatial regulations,
   landscape structure, and social organizations from indigenous knowledge
   were recommended to be introduced into official spatial management
   institutions, to validate the values of indigenous knowledge and improve
   the resilience of local spatial management.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Reintroductions are conducted frequently throughout the world, and some
   source populations are harvested repeatedly to provide animals for
   translocation. The responses of these source populations to harvest
   should be monitored, and the resulting data used to refine population
   models will guide management After North Island Robins (Petroica
   longipes) were reintroduced to Tiritiri Matangi, New Zealand, in 1992,
   the population became a source for robins for additional reintroductions
   in the region. We constructed an initial model for the population on the
   basis of the data collected from 1992 to 1998 and used it to predict the
   population's response to the first translocation of robins from the
   island in the autumn (March) of 1999. We then analyzed postharvest data
   on survival (with mark-recapture analysis) and fecundity (with
   generalized linear-mixed modeling) to reassess and update the model. In
   the initial model, juvenile survival was assumed to be limited by the
   island's fixed carrying capacity, with excess juveniles dying over
   winter, hence, the autumn harvest was expected to cause an immediate
   increase in juvenile survival. In postharvest analysis, however most
   juvenile mortality occurred before autumn, and the best predictor of
   juvenile survival was the number of breeding pairs present the previous
   spring (start of the breeding season). Consequently, the updated
   population model predicted sustainable harvest levels about half those
   given by the initial model, and this model has been used to guide the
   number of individuals removed for two subsequent translocations. The
   ongoing development of the model has been invaluable for assuring
   conservation authorities that the population is not being unsustainably
   harvested, which has allowed surplus animals to be used to establish new
   populations. Our case study illustrates the value of an adaptive
   approach to harvesting source populations for reintroduction and
   illustrates the value of such studies for understanding the
   density-dependent mechanisms regulating populations.},

Abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is expected to be a disastrous challenge to
   human in the following decade as a result of continuous urbanization
   without appropriate planning and design. The impacts of UHI are even
   getting worse due to large population density with improper building
   design especially in dense metropolitan cities. A lot of research has
   been carried out for UHI phenomenon both in tropical and seasonal
   climates. There are many factors contributing to the formation of UHI
   phenomenon that includes increasing rate of urbanization and population
   density, uncontrollable factors and controllable factors. In a
   fundamental study, a prolonged exposure to heat impact will
   significantly contribute to human discomfort and health problems
   resulting in heat-related illness. The cases of heat related deaths,
   such as heat strokes, are due to the result of climate changes and
   further the problem of heat waves will increase year by year. Since the
   consequences of UHI are considered to be more significant, the severity
   of the problem should be critically examined and carefully reported.
   Many research efforts have been implemented for making conceptual design
   and also a wide range of literature is available for continuing the
   mitigation strategies. Therefore, this study is emphasized on the
   critical investigation of the features, factors and impacts of UHI
   towards evaluating human safety and thermal comfort. Future research
   direction should also be encompassed on the design and planning
   parameters as well as assessment of climate change risks and
   vulnerability for reducing the effects of urban heat island onto human
   health and safety.},

Title = {Towards local-parallel scenarios for climate change impacts, adaptation
   and vulnerability},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Abstract = {Scenarios are used in climate change research to explore potential
   impacts, assess vulnerability, and identify adaptation options. In
   developing scenarios, however, there is a challenge in moving between
   global, national, and local scales in a way that connects complex
   adaptive systems in meaningful ways for stakeholders. Some emulate the
   global parallel scenario framework of Representative Concentration
   Pathways, Shared Socio-economic Pathways, and Shared Policy Assumptions,
   collecting and refining expert data and projections into relatively
   complex scenarios for specific regions. However, such approaches can be
   expensive, time-consuming, and privilege expert biophysical knowledge.
   Others use participatory approaches, working with local people to
   co-create scenarios based on experiential knowledge, risk perception,
   and community aspirations. While useful, these highly localized
   scenarios are often unable to account for linkages and feedbacks between
   national and international processes. Here we seek to overcome some of
   these challenges through a combination of elements from the global
   scenario architecture, and locally specific data that bridge a range of
   social issues, including political debates, land use, and socioeconomic
   inequalities. We illustrate the approach through a case study of the
   West Coast, New Zealand, which shows that meaningful climate change
   scenarios that are credible, legitimate, and relevant can be used to
   open up material discussions. Our methodology provides a robust process
   that connects international best practice to local contexts and
   communicates climate change scenarios through accessible textual and
   visual boundary objects. The results provide a basis for further process
   refinement and application elsewhere, highlighting key methodological
   challenges and opportunities.},

   outdoor spaces in different urban densities in arid cities},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {219},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Over the last twenty years, Cairo experienced a great rise in
   temperature by 4-5 K due to the high urban density and lack of
   vegetation. These factors led to increased air conditioning and
   electricity usage. This study therefore seeks to evaluate the effect of
   green roofs on reducing outdoor air temperature and lowering buildings'
   cooling energy demand in different urban densities. Group A consisted of
   the same aspect ratio areas H/W = 1 and different building heights of 12
   m, 18 m, and 30 m. Group B contained areas of the same building heights
   (12 m) and different aspect ratios of H/W = 1, 2, and 3. ENVI-met
   v.4.4.4 was used to study each area by simulating the reference case and
   two scenarios: extensive and intensive green roofs. Then, a Design
   Builder model was used to calculate the buildings' energy demand. This
   study found that intensive green roofs achieve the maximum reduction in
   air temperature and buildings' cooling energy. However, the economic
   aspect favors using extensive green roofs as they were able to reduce
   air temperature and buildings' cooling energy in Group A by 0.1-0.5 K
   and 1.3-3.2\% and in Group B by 0.1-1.7 K and 3.2-13.3\%. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Both rural and urban areas are exposed to the influence of the natural
   powers. Extraordinary phenomena are difficult to predict as concerns the
   time and place disturbing operation of the economy, transport,
   communication and they may also pose a risk to human life. Rural areas,
   according to the general belief, are the areas characterised by the fact
   that agricultural production is conducted there. This approach to those
   areas focuses the attention mainly on the products produced in those
   areas and their high sensitivity to climate disorders. Global climate
   changes may lead to the higher risk of sudden floods, more frequent
   coastal floods, increased erosion of sea coast (more frequent storms and
   water level increase), extinction of species in mountain areas, melting
   of glaciers, higher temperature (southern Europe), drought as well as
   waves of heat and fires. The humanity has no influence on such phenomena
   although we are able to introduce adaptive actions. The concept of
   limiting disasters contains the fundamental assumption that the
   influence of the disaster may be limited if we expect such a situation
   during planning of investments, development of space and real property.
   The main aim of the research is an economic-spatial analysis of the
   losses caused by extraordinary weather phenomena within rural areas of
   Warminsko-Mazurskie voivodeship and correlation analysis. Studies have
   shown that attention should be focused on the area in a direct
   neighborhood of the Great Masurian Lakes because there is the most
   sensitive area and the losses on the examined territory are correlated
   with the area (looses and agricultural lands), soil quality and with the
   occurrence of the negative consequences of plant wintering. The
   information on the magnitude of the studied phenomenon complemented with
   the spatial data on the distribution of the phenomenon represents an
   excellent tool for taming management decisions in relation to the rural
   space.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, city trees are viewed as a best management practice to

   the community forest is the first step to altering forest structure in
   ways that will enhance future benefits. This article describes the
   structure, function, and value of street and park tree populations in

   Berkeley, California; and Glendale, Arizona. Although these cities spent
   \$13-65 annually per tree, benefits ranged from \$31 to \$89 per tree.
   For every dollar invested in management, benefits returned annually
   ranged from \$1.37 to \$3.09. Strategies each city can take to increase

   states},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {180},
Number = {2},
Pages = {120-129},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change is frequently touted as the biggest development challenge
   that faces humanity. Such rhetoric may be distracting from other
   development challenges which need to be addressed simultaneously with
   climate change. This paper uses the case study of small island
   developing states (SIDS) affected by climate change to explore how
   focusing on climate change can depoliticise the challenges that they
   face. Three linked points of depoliticisation through climate change are
   exemplified: emphasising the hazard, avoiding other long-term
   development challenges, and shifting focus away from opportunities for
   reducing vulnerability, including during community reconstruction.
   Examples cover scientific and policy discussions, from inside and
   external to SIDS. Links are made with migration narratives, especially
   learning from the past and the importance of not rebuilding communities
   with the same vulnerabilities as before. The fundamental challenge is
   not so much addressing the hazard of climate change per se, but why SIDS
   peoples often do not have the resources or options to address climate
   change and other development challenges themselves. In this regard,
   climate change brings little that is new to SIDS which continue to be
   marginalised.},

Title = {An alternative method of developing landscape strategies for urban
   cooling: A threshold-based perspective},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Increasing the amount of blue-green spaces has been recognized as an
   effective strategy to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect.
   Specific quantitative and actionable landscape mitigation strategies for
   different land use and land-cover (LULC) types to cool down cities, have
   been rarely addressed. In this paper, the absolute threshold of cooling
   (ToC(abs)) -the specific threshold of a certain influencing factor to
   ensure the effective cooling of a particular patch type, was proposed
   and defined for the first time to facilitate the research. The effects
   of size, shape and neighboring greenspace percentage (NGP) of different
   types of LULC patches on land surface temperature (LST) were examined
   and their corresponding ToC(abs) values were determined if existed, in
   the metropolitan areas of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin using satellite
   images. Results demonstrate that larger sized and complex-shaped water
   bodies and forested areas produce greater cooling effect. The size is
   irrelevant to the cooling intensity of grass-dominated patches. ToC(abs)
   of patch size exist and were identified for water bodies (Beijing, 5 ha;
   Shanghai, 10 ha; and Tianjin, 5 ha) and forested areas (Beijing, 20 ha;
   Shanghai, 50 ha; and Tianjin, 20 ha). Besides, NGP is negatively
   correlated with patch LST for all LULC types, indicating that increasing
   the amount of neighboring vegetation cover can effectively lower the
   nearby patch LST. ToC(abs) of NGP exist and were identified for water
   bodies (Beijing, 30.3\%; Shanghai, 61.6\%; and Tianjin, 20\%) and grass
   dominated areas (Beijing, 89.1\%; Shanghai, 76.9\%; and Tianjin,
   81.5\%). Among the three influencing factors, the size accounts for
   greatest variability in patch LST for forested areas and impervious
   surfaces, and neighboring greenspace proportion accounts for the most
   variability in LST for water bodies and grass-dominated areas. The
   methodology and results of this study could help to orientate specific
   and actionable landscape strategies of urban cooling.},

Abstract = {Urban populations benefit greatly from the ecosystem services provided
   by urban green and blue spaces. While the equity of provision of and
   access to urban green and blue spaces has been widely explored, research
   on equity of ecosystem service provision is relatively scant. Using
   household level data, our study aims to assess the supply equity of five
   regulatory ecosystem services in Singapore. We employed linear
   mixed-effects models and Hot Spot Analysis to analyze their
   distributional equity across individual households of various
   demographic characteristics (horizontal inequality), and calculated Gini
   coefficient for the distribution of PM10 removal service among
   households categorised into demographic subgroups (vertical inequality).
   Our results show little evidence of inequitable ecosystem service
   provision among Singapore's diverse socio-demographic groups. This can
   be attributed to the early integration of environmental management

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Population pressures have led to crop cultivation taking place on steep
   slopes and other marginal lands in the small island developing states of
   the Caribbean. This threatens regional food security and can result in
   environmental degradation if site-specific land management practices are
   not adopted. AgriMaps is a mobile application developed to support
   decision making in the agricultural sector of Trinidad and Tobago. This
   application uses an evidence-based approach to making crop and
   mitigative land management recommendations. The app is a platform for
   spatial data visualization and provides a greater range of geo-spatial
   information than is currently available to stakeholders in the farming
   community. It is envisioned that this application will improve land use
   planning decisions and the adoption of sustainable agricultural
   management techniques. We provide the theoretical and technical
   frameworks needed to develop similar ICT tools in other territories. (C)

Title = {Exploration of Climate Change Effects on Shifting Potato Seasons, Yields
   and Water Use Employing NASA and National Long-Term Weather Data},
Journal = {POTATO RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Climate change is a threat to agriculture but also presents
   opportunities and requires adaptation strategies. In many countries
   adequate meteorological data is lacking, so this is where NASA weather
   data are of assistance. We aimed to develop a generic and easily
   applicable approach to calculate the effect of climate change on potato
   yields and water need. We therefore used the NASA-Langley-Gaisma weather
   database which has data of thousands of sites worldwide. Comparing these
   with national data of a particular country, Turkey in this case showed
   that they compare well but diverge somewhat at the lower temperature
   range. The evapotranspiration (ETP) rate was not supplied by NASA, so we
   estimated this rate by multiplying the average daily radiation in
   MJ/m(2) by 5. There was a good correlation with actual ETP, and where
   there is a systematic deviation, it will not change conclusions when
   comparing sites and climate change scenarios. Next, it was assumed that
   potato crops are planted in spring when the average daily temperature is
   above 13 degrees C. When the average daily temperature reaches 22
   degrees C and above, it is assumed that the crop is harvested as it gets
   too hot. For the highland sites with summer crops, this gave planting
   and harvest dates that reflect reality, but for the coastal sites, the
   time window with this method was too short. Since there is no risk of
   frost, farmers plant at lower temperatures, in local niches not covered
   by the regional met stations. The effect of climate change, higher
   temperatures, shifting planting dates and a CO2 induced increased growth
   rate on yield and water need of the crops was well explored with the
   LINTUL crop growth model. At unchanged rates of incident solar radiation
   and unchanged planting dates, an average decrease in potential yield
   from 94 to 83 t/ha is calculated. Extention of summer by 20 days on
   average causes decrease in the frost-free period, which leads to an
   overall increase of potential yield of the highland summer crops by 3\%.
   The length of the growing season of the coastal spring crops is not
   extended; the season just moves closer to the winter with shorter day
   lengths and less radiation. So here yields are not affected by adverse
   high temperatures but are reduced by lower radiation levels. For both
   highland summer and coastal spring crops, an increase in the CO2
   concentration of the atmosphere from the current 415 to future level of
   around 550 ppm is expected to increase the radiation use efficiency, so
   also yields by 25\%.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Pages = {6354-6368},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coral reefs provide food and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of
   people as well as harbour some of the highest regions of biodiversity in
   the ocean. However, overexploitation, land-use change and other local
   anthropogenic threats to coral reefs have left many degraded.
   Additionally, coral reefs are faced with the dual emerging threats of
   ocean warming and acidification due to rising CO2 emissions, with dire
   predictions that they will not survive the century. This review
   evaluates the impacts of climate change on coral reef organisms,
   communities and ecosystems, focusing on the interactions between climate
   change factors and local anthropogenic stressors. It then explores the
   shortcomings of existing management and the move towards ecosystem-based
   management and resilience thinking, before highlighting the need for
   climate change-ready marine protected areas (MPAs), reduction in local
   anthropogenic stressors, novel approaches such as human-assisted
   evolution and the importance of sustainable socialecological systems. It
   concludes that designation of climate change-ready MPAs, integrated with
   other management strategies involving stakeholders and participation at
   multiple scales such as marine spatial planning, will be required to
   maximise coral reef resilience under climate change. However, efforts to
   reduce carbon emissions are critical if the long-term efficacy of local
   management actions is to be maintained and coral reefs are to survive.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Hydroclimatic information services are vital for sustainable
   agricultural practices in deltas. They advance adaptation practices of
   farmers that lead to better economic benefit through increased yields,
   reduced production costs, and minimized crop damage. This research
   explores the hydroclimatic information needs of farmers by addressing
   (1) what kind of information is needed by the periurban delta farmers,
   and (2) whether information needs have any temporal dimension that
   changes with time following capacity building during coproduction of
   information services. Results reveal that the attributes of weather and
   water-related forecasts most affecting the farmers are rainfall,
   temperature, water, and soil salinity, along with extreme events such as
   cyclone and storm surges. The majority of the male farmers prefer one-
   to two-week lead-time forecasts for strategic and tactical
   decision-making; while female farmers prefer short-time forecasts with
   one-day to a week lead time that suggests the difference of purpose of
   the forecasts between male and female farmers. Contrarily, there is
   little preference for monthly, seasonal, and real-time forecasts.
   Information communication through a smartphone app is preferred mostly
   because of its easy accessibility and visualization. Farmers foresee
   that capacity building on acquiring hydroclimatic information is vital
   for agricultural decision-making. We conclude that a demand-driven
   coproduction of a hydroclimatic information service created through
   iterative interaction with and for farmers will enable the farmers to
   understand their information needs more explicitly.},

Title = {The immobility-relocation continuum: Diverse responses to coastal change
   in a small island state},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {105-115},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rising sea levels and associated coastal hazards will lead to the
   relocation of some communities away from sites of high exposure. In
   Fiji, several communities have already initiated relocation, with
   hundreds more considered in need of future relocation by the Fijian
   government. Yet, often relocation is viewed as an inevitable response to
   coastal exposure, whereby an entire community is relocated from one
   location (of high exposure) to another (of lesser exposure) with the
   assistance of an external actor, namely the State and donors. Limited
   research has drawn attention to the heterogenous nature of relocation
   (and immobility responses), and the factors that shape these diverse
   processes. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken across seven low-lying
   communities in Fiji that are facing exposure to coastal erosion, tidal
   inundation, and storm surges, we highlight different immobility and
   relocation responses that are being implemented both within and across
   villages. These responses can be viewed along a continuum, referred to
   here as the immobility-relocation continuum, and include: voluntary
   immobility, immobility due to restricted relocation options, incremental
   relocation, partial relocation, and full community relocation. We
   identify factors -climatic and environmental, past and current
   adaptations and mobilities, socio-cultural, land rights and tenure, and
   institutional - that shape these varied responses. This research
   underscores the need to expand our thinking regarding how
   climate-related relocation is conceptualized and implemented in policy
   and practice toward a nuanced understanding of (im)mobility as a form of
   adaptation to coastal hazard risks, accounting for diversity in local
   conditions, preferences, and resources available to communities.},

Title = {Global wind power development: Economics and policies},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {642-652},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Existing literature indicates that theoretically, the earth's wind
   energy supply potential significantly exceeds global energy demand. Yet,
   only 2-3\% of global electricity demand is currently derived from wind
   power despite 27\% annual growth in wind generating capacity over the
   last 17 years. More than 95\% of total current wind power capacity is
   installed in the developed countries plus China and India. Our analysis
   shows that the economic competitiveness of wind power varies at wider
   range across countries or locations. A climate change damage cost of
   US\$20/tCO(2) imposed to fossil fuels would make onshore wind
   competitive to all fossil fuels for power generation; however, the same
   would not happen to offshore wind, with few exceptions, even if the
   damage cost is increased to US\$100/tCO(2). To overcome a large number
   of technical, financial, institutional, market and other barriers to
   wind power, many countries have employed various policy instruments,
   including capital subsidies, tax incentives, tradable energy
   certificates, feed-in tariffs, grid access guarantees and mandatory
   standards. Besides, climate change mitigation policies, such as the
   Clean Development Mechanism, have played a pivotal role in promoting
   wind power. Despite these policies, intermittency, the main technical
   constraint, could remain as the major challenge to the future growth of
   wind power. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Determination of Fishing Grounds Distribution of the Indian Mackerel in
   Malaysia's Exclusive Economic Zone Off South China Sea Using Boosted
   Regression Trees Model},
Journal = {THALASSAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the ongoing climate change affecting the ocean, there is a need to
   understand and predict the future distributions of marine species in
   order to assess the sustainability of marine ecosystem. In this study,
   remotely-sensed satellite oceanographic data together with Indian
   mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) fishery dataset were used to predict
   potential fishing grounds in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of
   Peninsular Malaysia using boosted regression trees (BRT) model. The
   model was developed using three years (2008-2010) fish catch data and
   environmental variables of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), sea surface
   temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH). Result indicated that
   potential fishing grounds were closely associated with SSH, followed by
   SST and chl-a. The performance of the BRT model indicated acceptable
   fishing grounds prediction accuracy (AUC value of 0.749). Seasonal
   variability in fishing grounds was related to favorable environmental
   conditions of SSH (1.1-1.3 m), SST (29-32 degrees C) and chl-a (0.3-0.6
   mg/m(3)). The projection of increases in SST due to climate change
   according to IPCC-AR5-RCPs was observed to influence the spatial and
   temporal distributions R. kanagurta. Increased temperature at 1.80
   degrees C resulted in high potential catch areas for R. kanagurta in the
   EEZ. Meanwhile, elevated temperature at 2.60 degrees C and 3.30 degrees
   C showed decreased in potential catch areas for R. kanagurta in the EEZ.
   Most of the future fishing grounds area were projected to decline, and
   it was observed to shift outside the EEZ off South China Sea. Hence, by
   understanding these relationships, this analysis identifies where
   strategies can be adapted to face the ecological impacts under changing
   environmental conditions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {59-77},
Abstract = {The potential for sea level rise inundation of critical transportation
   infrastructure rises as the threat of climate change continues.
   Inundation of public transportation including railroads and bus routes,
   specifically those located in low-lying coastal areas, are vulnerable to
   these impacts. Therefore, identifying vulnerable facilities in order to
   implement adaptation planning practices is essential to protecting these
   facilities and avoiding impacts on mobility. This research focuses on
   the application of the Transit Inundation Modeling Method (TIMM) to a
   transit network (railways and bus routes) in Philadelphia County,
   Pennsylvania. TIMM is developed based on the need to identify transit
   infrastructure systems that are vulnerable to sea level rise using
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Applying TIMM to a real-world
   transit network provides an example for how transit agencies throughout
   the nation can begin to identify at-risk links and nodes based on
   potential sea level rise inundation levels.},

Title = {Operational resilience of reservoirs to climate change, agricultural
   demand, and tourism: A case study from Sardinia},

Abstract = {Many (semi-) arid locations globally, and particularly islands, rely
   heavily on reservoirs for water supply. Some reservoirs are particularly
   vulnerable to climate and development changes (e.g. population change,
   tourist growth, hydropower demands). Irregularities and uncertainties in
   the fluvial regime associated with climate change and the continuous
   increase in water demand by different sectors will add new challenges to
   the management and to the resilience of these reservoirs. The resilience
   of vulnerable reservoirs must be studied in detail to prepare for and
   mitigate potential impacts of these changes. In this paper, a reservoir
   balance model is developed and presented for the Pedra e' Othoni
   reservoir in Sardinia, Italy, to assess resilience to climate and
   development changes. The model was first calibrated and validated, then
   forced with extensive ensemble climate data for representative
   concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, agricultural data, and with
   four socio-economic development scenarios. Future projections show a
   reduction in annual reservoir inflow and an increase in demand, mainly
   in the agricultural sector. Under no scenario is reservoir resilience
   significantly affected, the reservoir always achieves refill. However,
   this occurs at the partial expenses of hydropower production with
   implications for the production of renewable energy. There is also the
   possibility of conflict between the agricultural sector and hydropower
   sector for diminishing water supply. Pedra e' Othoni reservoir shows
   good resilience to future change mostly because of the
   disproportionately large basin feeding it. However this is not the case
   of other Sardinian reservoirs and hence a detailed resilience assessment
   of all reservoirs is needed, where development plans should carefully
   account for the trade-offs and potential conflicts among sectors. For
   Sardinia, the option of physical connection between reservoirs is
   available, as are alternative water supply measures. Those reservoirs at
   risk to future change should be identified, and mitigating measures
   investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Saltwater intrusion, a consequence of climate change and decreased water
   levels, has been increasingly severe in the Mekong Delta region. Thanh
   Phu District, Ben Tre Province, Vietnam, is a coastal region where
   agricultural production and local livelihood have been impaired by
   saltwater intrusion, resulting in the adoption of multiple coping
   strategies, including rotations and intercropping. This study aims to
   measure and evaluate soil and water quality indicators of multiple
   farming systems in Thanh Phu district and contributes to developing
   suitable cropping patterns. Soil indicators were pH, electrical
   conductivity, and exchangeable Na+. Water quality characteristics
   include pH, salinity, dissolved N and P, alkalinity, H2S, and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD). The results indicated that water pH and salinity
   were at suitable levels to support the growth of prawn but were below
   the critical level required to grow black tiger shrimp and white-legged
   shrimp. Water alkalinity, dissolved N, P, and COD were not constraining
   for the growth of shrimps. However, a significant concentration of H2S
   may cause disadvantages for shrimp growth.},

Abstract = {Given extensive and rapid urbanization globally, assessing regional
   urban thermal effects (UTE) in both canopy and boundary layers under
   extreme weather/climate conditions is of significant interest. Rapid
   population and economic growth in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) have
   made it one of the largest city clusters in China. Here, we explore the
   three-dimensional (3D) UTE in the YRD using multi-source observations
   from high-resolution automatic weather stations, radiosondes, and eddy
   covariance sensors during the record-setting heat wave (HW) of
   July-August 2013. It is found that the regional canopy layer UTE is up
   to 0.6-1.2 degrees C, and the nocturnal UTE (0.7-1.6 degrees C) is
   larger than daytime UTE (0.2-0.5 degrees C) during the HW. The regional
   canopy layer UTE is enhanced and expanded northwards, with some rural
   sites contaminated by the urban influences, especially at night. In the
   boundary layer, the strengthened regional UTE extends vertically to at
   least 925 hPa (similar to 750 m) during this HW. The strengthened 3D UTE
   in the YRD is associated with an enlarged Bowen ratio difference between
   urban and non-urban areas. These findings about the 3D UTE are
   beneficial for better understanding of the thermal environment of large
   city clusters under HW and for more appropriate adaption and mitigation
   strategies.},

Title = {Local perceptions of environmental changes in fishing communities of

Volume = {163},
Pages = {209-221},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Southwest Madagascar is a region that is significantly impacted upon by
   climate change. As in a lot of developing countries, the livelihoods of
   many communities in this region are dependent on fishing. This makes
   these communities particularly vulnerable to climate-related changes. We
   conducted a survey in two coastal fishing communities in the Toliara
   Province, Ambola and Ambotsibotsike. Using a free listing exercise,
   semi-structured interviews and focus group methods, we documented local
   perceptions of environmental changes and responses to changes. Results
   were compared, taking into account the differences in the degree of
   remoteness, market exposure and religiosity. Time periods that
   respondents reported as having had a high degree of change were compared
   to time periods of historical records of cyclones occurring in Toliara
   Province. Mostly, changes in the environment were said to have started
   21-40 years ago. An overlap was observed between time periods when
   respondents observed changes in their environment and time periods of
   high magnitude cyclones. Answers relating to the local environment show
   that both villages identify with a sea culture, but the local ecological
   knowledge is arguably more accurate in the remote village of Ambola. In
   Ambotsibotsike God's intervention was predominantly identified as the
   source/cause of changes in the natural environment. Ambola also
   displayed a higher proportion of household members who participate in
   fishing from pirogues (at least one person per household). In both
   villages, the most reported change was a reduction of sea resources
   (64,2\% of the answers in Ambola and 69.5\% in Ambotsibotsike).
   Villagers' adaptation responses reflected the presence of NGOs in both
   villages. This influence was particularly strong in Ambola, where the
   establishment of reserves was found to be a predominant strategy to cope
   with change (54.8\% of the answers). Our study provides additional
   insights that can be used in relation to the discussion of the role of
   the market, of religion, and the influence of NGOs on local knowledge.
   It seeks to contribute to the need to implement sustainable conservation
   strategies and successful community-based management plans.},

Title = {Optimizing coral reef recovery with context-specific management actions
   at prioritized reefs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Assisting the natural recovery of coral reefs through local management
   actions is needed in response to increasing ecosystem disturbances in
   the Anthropocene. There is growing evidence that commonly used
   resilience-based passive management approaches may not be sufficient to
   maintain coral reef key functions. We synthesize and discuss advances in
   coral reef recovery research, and its application to coral reef
   conservation and restoration practices. We then present a framework to
   guide the decision-making of reef managers, scientists and other
   stakeholders, to best support reef recovery after a disturbance. The
   overall aim of this management framework is to catalyse reef recovery,
   to minimize recovery times, and to limit the need for ongoing management
   interventions into the future. Our framework includes two main stages:
   first, a prioritization method for assessment following a large-scale
   disturbance, which is based on a reef's social-ecological values, and on
   a classification of the likelihood of recovery or succession resulting
   in degraded, novel, hybrid or historical states. Second, a flow chart to
   assist with determining management actions for highly valued reefs.
   Potential actions are chosen based on the ecological attributes of the
   disturbed reef, defined during ecological assessments. Depending on the
   context, management actions may include (1) substrata rehabilitation
   actions to facilitate natural coral recruitment, (2) repopulating
   actions using active restoration techniques, (3) resilience-based
   management actions and (4) monitoring coral recruitment and growth to
   assess the effectiveness of management interventions. We illustrate the
   proposed decision framework with a case study of typhoon-damaged eastern
   outer reefs in Palau, Micronesia. The decisions made following this
   framework lead to the conclusion that some reefs may not return to their
   historical state for many decades. However, if motivation and funds are
   available, new management approaches can be explored to assist coral
   reefs at valued locations to return to a functional state providing key
   ecosystem services.},

   fishery},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {118-125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {When assessing future changes in fishing, research has focused on
   changes in the availability of the resource. Fishers' behaviour,
   however, also defines fishing activity, and is susceptible not only to
   changes in weather but also to changes in the economy, which can be
   faster and more ubiquitous. Using a novel modelling approach and
   spatially explicit predictors we identified the current drivers of
   artisanal fishing activity and predicted how it is likely to change in
   2025 and 2035 under two climate and two economic scenarios. The model is
   effective at explaining the activity of fishers (AUC = 0.84) and
   suggests that economic variables overwhelm the importance of climate
   variables in influencing the decisions of fishers in our case study area
   (Utila, Honduras). Although future changes in the overall incidence of
   fishing activity are modest, decreases in the number of accessible
   fishing grounds with projected increases in fuel prices will increase
   localised fishing effort depleting fish resources near the port.
   Compelling adaptation strategies in the area require the intervention of
   the market chain to make the sale price of fish more responsive to fuel
   price fluctuations and changes in fishing behaviour to improve fuel
   efficiency, including the revival of traditional ways of fishing. (C)

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The study aims to assess the urban heat island (UHI) effects in the city
   under the present land use conditions as well as those conditions
   proposed by the Hanoi Master Plan 2030 through numerical simulation,
   using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). Furthermore, this paper
   assesses additional land use scenarios with different spatial and green
   space configurations. The results show that the implementation of the
   master plan does not significantly affect the peak air temperature in
   the built-up areas (approximately 1 degrees C higher at the maximum).
   However, high temperature areas, with temperature of 40-41 degrees C,
   would expand widely over the new built-up areas. On the other hand, the
   nocturnal air temperature would increase by up to 2-3 degrees C over the
   newly expanded built-up areas. The number of hotspots increased further
   when the strategic green spaces in the master plan were not taken into
   account. However, the cooling effect of the strategic green spaces did
   not reach the existing city center sufficiently because the green spaces
   are located far from the city center. The large and centralized green
   spaces proposed in the master plan were seen to be insufficient to
   mitigate UHIs compared to the equally distributed green spaces.
   Moreover, the greater reduction of hotspot areas by up to 56.5\% was
   seen when the mixed forest is employed as the land cover in the green
   spaces.},

Title = {Local Effects of Global Climate Change: Differential Experiences of
   Sheep Farmers and Reindeer Herders in Unjarga/Nesseby, a Coastal Sami
   Community in Northern Norway},
Booktitle = {COMMUNITY ADAPTATION AND VULNERABILITY IN ARCTIC REGIONS},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {313-333},
Abstract = {Unjarga/Nesseby municipality is located in the inner part of the
   Varanger fjord in eastern Finnmark. Combining reindeer herding,
   agriculture, coastal fisheries, hunting and gathering has been of
   fundamental importance to the population in this coastal Sami community
   for centuries. Although today this combination of activities no longer
   provides the same level of livelihood sustenance in the municipality,
   natural resource based activities and different kinds of harvesting
   remain of great significance for the residents, as economic activities,
   for recreation and in people's sense of belonging. This chapter looks at
   the interlinkages between maintaining and developing the important
   nature based industries of sheep farming and reindeer herding in
   Unjarga/Nesseby, and the locally experienced outcomes of global climate
   change. Consistent with the CAVIAR framework, we assess
   exposure-sensitivities and local adaptation strategies to changing
   conditions influencing these livelihoods. We present a preliminary
   analysis of the linkages between future climate trends and the adaptive
   capacity of the local animal husbandries. Our main focus is on the four
   recent years of extensive moth larvae outbreaks {[}larvae from autumnal
   moth (Epirrita autumnata) and winter moth (Operophtera brumata)] that
   have resulted in widespread birch forest mortality in Unjarga/Nesseby
   municipality. The persistent moth larvae attacks are likely to be a
   result of a milder climate. As these alterations have radically changed
   the landscape, sheep farmers and reindeer herders in the community are
   introduced to new livelihood challenges, as well as opportunities.},

Abstract = {The Arctic has rapidly urbanized in recent decades with 2 million people
   currently living in more than a hundred cities north of 65 degrees N.
   These cities have a harsh but sensitive climate and warming here is the
   principle driver of destructive thawing, water leakages, air pollution
   and other detrimental environmental impacts. This study reports on the
   urban temperature anomaly in a typical Arctic city. This persistent warm
   anomaly reaches up to 11K in winter with the wintertime mean urban
   temperature being 1.9K higher on average in the city center than in the
   surrounding natural landscape. An urban temperature anomaly, also known
   as an urban heat island (UHI), was found using remote sensing and in
   situ temperature data. High-resolution (1 km) model experiments run with
   and without an urban surface parameterization helped to identify the
   leading physical and geographical factors supporting a strong
   temperature anomaly in a cold climate. The statistical analysis and
   modeling suggest that at least 50\% of this warm anomaly is caused by
   the UHI effect, driven mostly by direct anthropogenic heating, while the
   rest is created by natural microclimatic variability over the undulating
   relief of the area. The current UHI effect can be as large as the
   projected, and already amplified, warming for the region in the 21st
   century. In contrast to earlier reports, this study found that the
   wintertime UHI in the Arctic should be largely attributed to direct
   anthropogenic heating. This is a strong argument in support of energy
   effi-ciency measures, urban climate change mitigation policy and against
   high-density urban development in polar settlements. The complex pattern
   of thermal conditions, as revealed in this study, challenges urban
   planners to account for the observed microclimatic diversity in
   perspective sustainable development solutions.},

Abstract = {The continuously growing global water scarcity and the evidences for
   climatic changes require a refocus on reliable and sustainable water
   supplies, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, being the most
   water-deprived regions in the world. Population growth, urbanization and
   increasing water demand add pressure on many water resources, causing a
   rapid depletion and quality degradation to a degree that part of the
   resources may not be safe to use and cause health and environmental
   risks. Such adverse development is strongly apparent in the Middle East
   and elsewhere where global warming impacts are already apparent leading
   to a situation in which available water resources are depleted and
   deteriorated, unable to satisfy the basic needs. To provide an
   integrated picture of water challenges and possible solutions at global
   and regional scale a Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR)
   framework is applied to elaborate the water scarcity issue and
   mitigation measures with examples from the Middle East, California,
   India and other regions of the world facing water scarcity challenges.
   Reversing the trend of growing water shortages while securing basic
   water needs for all are a challenging and an ambitious task, but
   achievable provided that comprehensive and consolidated water management
   strategies are implemented. A comprehensive and integrated water
   management policy combing advanced management and conservation as well
   as the harnessing of nonconventional water resources (water reuse and
   desalination), together with trans-boundary cooperation on shared water
   resources can provide a sound solution to the challenges posed by water
   scarcity as discussed in this chapter.},

Title = {Using a social learning configuration to increase Vietnamese smallholder

Abstract = {Social learning is crucial for local smallholder farmers in developing
   countries to improve their adaptive capacity and to adapt to the current
   and projected impacts of climate change. While it is widely acknowledged
   that social learning is a necessary condition for adaptation, few
   studies have systematically investigated under which conditions
   particular forms of social learning are most successful in improving
   adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable groups. This study aims to
   design, implement and evaluate a social learning configuration in a
   coastal community in Vietnam. We make use of various methods during four
   workshop-based interventions with local smallholder farmers: interviews
   with key farmers and commune leaders, farmer-to-farmer learning,
   participatory observations and focus group discussions. The methods for
   evaluation of social learning configuration include in-depth interviews,
   focus group discussions and structured survey interviews. Our findings
   show that the social learning configuration used in this study leads to
   an increased problem ownership, an enhanced knowledge-base with regard
   to climate change impacts and production adaptation options, improved
   ability to see connections and interdependencies and finally,
   strengthened relationships and social cohesion. The results suggest that
   increased social learning in the community leads to increase in adaptive
   capacity of smallholder farmers and improves both their economic and
   environmental sustainability. We discuss the key lessons for designing
   learning configurations that can successfully enhance adaptive capacity
   and smallholder farmers' agency and responsiveness to the challenges
   posed by climate change impacts.},

Abstract = {Human activities have doubled global cycles of Nitrogen (N) and
   Phosphorus (P) and elevated N and P have compromised ecosystem services
   through the degradation of natural resources of soils, freshwaters and
   marine waters with a subsequent loss of biodiversity. Elevated Carbon
   (C) levels in the atmosphere have been linked to global warming, with
   positive feedback mechanisms accelerating the warming process. In order
   to initiate nutrient control, both national and international mitigation
   measures have been implemented. However, many of these initiatives focus
   upon a single nutrient without considering cycle interactions. A sound
   understanding of processes and transformations involved in the
   interactions of macronutrient cycles is required to avoid inadvertently
   enhancing effects of one nutrient, during mitigation for impacts of
   another. Emerging research initiatives are addressing these research
   gaps, with programmes in the US (USGCRP) and the UK (Macronutrient
   Cycles) advocating integration between scientists and stakeholders, in
   order to deliver results directly to policy makers. Through these
   programmes the scales of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes will be
   quantified, and a determination made of the nature of nutrient
   transformations in catchments under a changing climate and perturbed
   carbon cycle. The consideration of connectivity between multiple
   macronutrient cycles will help to minimise the threats to biodiversity,
   ecosystem dynamics, public water supplies and human health by improved
   management and better focused policy. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Association for Public Participation framework for public participation,
   we analyse three local government led public participation initiatives
   in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, Australia. Our analysis
   suggests there are three critical factors that can influence the level
   of public participation in the context of climate change adaptation: the
   technocratic approach to decision making; absent high order government
   support; and the lack of evaluation mechanisms for public participation.},

Title = {Reconstruction of sea-land interactions between terrestrial vegetation

Abstract = {Hurricane Bob passed over the New England region in August 1991, causing
   significant damage to life, property, and the `environment, making it
   one of the costliest hurricanes in New England history. The
   environmental impact of a hurricane of this magnitude warrants careful
   assessment to devise preventive measures and mitigation strategies to
   bolster water resources management programs against future events. In
   this paper, we show the reconstructed simultaneous impacts of Hurricane
   Bob on the vegetative cover of the Mattapoisett river watershed and the
   water quality of the Mattapoisett Harbor with the aid of remote sensing
   for earth observations. The water quality impacts, especially in terms
   of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), can be
   identified from variations of SSS and TOC near coastal estuaries due to
   the influx of freshwater from the coastal Mattapoisett River to the
   continent-ocean transition between natural tides and bay waves. Using
   the Landsat satellite images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) and water quality constitutes (TOC and SSS) were reconstructed
   and retrieved for the assessment of the sea-land interactions during the
   Hurricane Bob event in 1991. Results indicate phenomenal interactive
   patterns between the harbor and the coastal watershed, as well as the
   riverine system. TOC and NDVI, especially in the upper watershed region,
   can be strongly correlated with hurricane impacts according to the
   singular value decomposition analysis.},

Abstract = {Weather and climate extremes cause significant economic damages and

   and their economic damages have significantly increased in the USA. The
   prediction of the future evolution of these damages and their relation
   to global warming and US economic growth is essential for deciding on
   cost-efficient mitigation pathways. Here we show using a probabilistic
   extreme value statistics framework that both the increase in US Gross
   Domestic Product per capita and global warming are significant
   covariates in probabilistically modeling the increase in economic
   damages. We also provide evidence that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
   affects the number of fatalities. Using the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change scenarios, we estimate the potential future economic
   risks. We find that by 2060, the extreme risks (as measured by 200-year
   effective return level) will have increased by 3-5.4 times. The damage
   costs due to extreme risks are projected to be between 0.1 and 0.7\% of
   US Gross Domestic Product by 2060 and could reach 5-16\% by 2100.},

Abstract = {The relationship between climate change and health outcomes is complex.
   In this Review, Rajagopalan and colleagues describe the environmental
   exposures associated with climate change and provide an overview of the
   consequences of climate change, including air pollution and extreme
   temperatures, on cardiovascular health and disease.
   Climate change is the greatest existential challenge to planetary and
   human health and is dictated by a shift in the Earth's weather and air
   conditions owing to anthropogenic activity. Climate change has resulted
   not only in extreme temperatures, but also in an increase in the
   frequency of droughts, wildfires, dust storms, coastal flooding, storm
   surges and hurricanes, as well as multiple compound and cascading
   events. The interactions between climate change and health outcomes are
   diverse and complex and include several exposure pathways that might
   promote the development of non-communicable diseases such as
   cardiovascular disease. A collaborative approach is needed to solve this
   climate crisis, whereby medical professionals, scientific researchers,
   public health officials and policymakers should work together to
   mitigate and limit the consequences of global warming. In this Review,
   we aim to provide an overview of the consequences of climate change on
   cardiovascular health, which result from direct exposure pathways, such
   as shifts in ambient temperature, air pollution, forest fires, desert
   (dust and sand) storms and extreme weather events. We also describe the
   populations that are most susceptible to the health effects caused by
   climate change and propose potential mitigation strategies, with an
   emphasis on collaboration at the scientific, governmental and policy
   levels.},

Title = {Urban Renewal Can Mitigate Urban Heat Islands},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {How can urban renewal effectively contribute to urban climate? Shanghai,
   one of the world's first metropolises to utilize effective urban heat
   island (UHI) mitigation strategies, is investigated by analyzing
   meteorological and land use observations over the past 144 years. The
   UHI decreased by similar to 0.58 degrees C between 2005 and 2016 due to
   urban renewal characterized by an increase in vegetation cover and the
   closure of the high-energy consumption industries in urban areas.
   Simulation results also indicate that future mitigation strategies
   should strive to increase vegetation cover, as a 10-20\% increase in
   vegetation cover is anticipated to reduce the UHI by 0.38-0.78 degrees
   C, resulting in potential electricity savings of 3.05-5.79 x 10(8)
   kWh/year, which correspond to a carbon emissions reduction of 2.47-4.68
   x 10(5) tCO(2)/year. The results will contribute to improve urban
   climate associated with large-scale urbanization and will provide
   guidance for urban renewal in other metropolises worldwide.
   Plain Language Summary China has experienced substantial urbanization
   since 1960, which has led to a significant increase in urban heat
   islands (UHIs); therefore, considerable urban renewal has been
   undertaken to mitigate UHI, particularly in the economically developed
   eastern coastal regions. The impacts of urbanization, including both
   urban expansion and urban renewal, on the UHI are investigated by
   analyzing meteorological and land use observations in Shanghai over the
   past 144 years. Observations indicate that the UHI decrease by similar
   to 0.58 degrees C between 2005 and 2016 due to urban renewal, and a
   simulated reduction in the UHI of 0.38-0.78 degrees C is obtained via a
   10-20\% increase in vegetation cover, resulting in potential electricity
   savings of 3.05-5.79 x 10(8) kWh/year, which correspond to a carbon
   emissions reduction of 2.47-4.68 x 10(5) tCO(2)/year. The results will
   contribute to improve urban climate associated with large-scale
   urbanization and will provide guidance for urban renewal in other

Abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for enhancing power systems resiliency
   by proactively splitting an interconnected grid into small
   self-sustaining islands in preparation for extreme events. The idea is
   to posture the system so that cascading outages can be bound within
   affected areas, preventing the propagation of disturbances to the rest
   of the system. This mitigation strategy will prove especially useful
   when advance notification of a threat is available but its nature not
   well understood. In our method, islands are determined using a
   constrained hierarchical spectral clustering technique. We further check
   viability of the resultant islands using steady state AC power flow.
   Performance of the approach is illustrated using a detailed PSS/E model
   of the heavily meshed transmission network operated by PJM
   Interconnection in eastern USA. Representative cases from different
   seasons show that variations in power flow patterns influence island
   configuration.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Coastal development is often at odds with coral reef conservation. In
   Aqaba, Jordan, authorities proposed a plan to relocate the existing port
   services to a new area on Al-Dirreh Bay towards the southern end of the
   Gulf of Aqaba. As a mitigation measure, 7000 endangered coral colonies
   were moved from Al-Dirreh and transplanted into degraded reef sites in
   Aqaba Marine Park. Sample survival and linear growth rates were
   determined biannually for 2 years and compared to growth rates at a
   control site. The overall survival rate for the transplanted colonies
   was estimated to exceed 87 \% and the linear growth rates of the 16
   species studied showed very similar values to colonies of the same
   species at the control site. Three species, Goniastrea edwardsi,
   Acropora arabensis and Stylophora pistillata, demonstrated more than 1
   cm of linear growth per year. In addition, a nursery of coral nubbins
   from three species, Acropora hemprichii, S. pistillata and Pocillopora
   damicornis, was established to be a sustainable source of fully grown
   colonies. Their survival and linear growth rates were also measured over
   the 2-year period. The overall survival rate of the nubbins was 88 \%,
   and the annual linear growth rate ranged from 0.32 cm for A. hemprichii

   that endangered coral colonies can be translocated to other reef areas
   and that coral nurseries can be set up to produce multiple fully grown

Title = {Crowd management COVID-19},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {465-478},
Abstract = {Crowds are a source of transmission in the COVID-19 spread. Contention
   and mitigation measures have focused on reducing people's mass
   gathering. Such efforts have led to a drop in the economy. The
   application of a vaccine at a world level represents a grand challenge
   for humanity, and it is not likely to accomplish even within months. In
   the meantime, we still need tools to allow the people integration into
   their regular routines reducing the risk of infection. In this context,
   this paper presents a solution for crowd management. The aim is to
   monitor and manage crowd levels in interior places or point-of-interests
   (POI), particularly shopping centers or stores. The solution is based on
   a POI recommendation system that suggests the nearest safe options upon
   request of a particular POI to visit by the user. In this sense, it
   recommends places near the user location with the least estimated crowd.
   The recommendation algorithm uses a top-K approach and behavioral game
   theory to predict the user's choice and estimate the crowd level for the
   requested POI. To evaluate the efficiency of this technological
   intervention in terms of the potential number of contacts of possible
   COVID-19 infections and the recommendation quality, we have developed an
   agent-based model (ABM). The adoption level of new technologies can be
   related to the end-user experience and trust in such technologies. As
   the end-user follows a recommendation that leads to uncrowded places,
   both the end-user experience and trust increased. We study and model
   this process using the OCEAN model of personality. The results from the
   studied scenarios showed that the proposed solution is widely adopted by
   the agents, as the trust factor increased from 0.5 (initial set value)
   to 0.76. In terms of crowd level, these are effectively managed and
   reduced on average by 40\%. The mobility contacts were reduced by 40\%,
   decreasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. An APP has been designed to
   support the described crowd management and contact tracing
   functionality. This APP is available on GitHub.},

Title = {Conservation of the coral community and local stakeholders' perceptions
   of climate change impacts: Examples and gap analysis in three Japanese
   national parks},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {218},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems consisting of coral communities have high ecosystem
   services and are important for tourism, fisheries, and the maintenance
   of biodiversity. Corals are often considered a major tourist resource in
   national parks located in the southern part of Japan. However, due to
   global-scale stresses such as climate change and local-scale stresses
   such as mass outbreaks of coral predators, there is a need to consider
   appropriate management and countermeasures. Two national parks in the
   subtropical zone (Keramashoto and Amamigunto national parks) and one
   national park in the temperate zone (Ashizuri-Uwakai National Park) in
   Japan were selected as a case study. The objectives of this study were
   to determine the status of coral conservation/management from websites
   and reports, and to clarify perceptions/concerns about climate change
   impacts through interviews with local stakeholders. The overall aim was
   to identify challenges in achieving sustainable use of coral ecosystems
   in national parks under climate change. In all of the national parks,
   the use of the sea area for tourism, such as diving, was very active. At
   the same time, coral monitoring and culling of predators were being
   carried out. However, the results of the interviews revealed that each
   park had different issues in implementing conservation activities, and
   Ashizuri-Uwakai showed a lack of manpower compared to the other two
   parks due to the scattered distribution of diving operators. From the
   interviews on the impacts of climate change, the increases in air and
   water temperatures were recognized in all parks and were consistent with
   the actual observed data. In terms of future concerns, increased coral
   bleaching frequency was common. Text mining showed that perceptions of
   coastal resources differed among parks and between occupations (tourism,
   fisheries, and government). Since concerns about climate change varied
   among regions and conservation activity systems also differed, it is
   important to consider and implement adaptation measures based on an
   appropriate understanding of local conditions.},

Abstract = {Many global optimization problems arising naturally in science and
   engineering exhibit some form of intrinsic ill-posedness, such as
   multimodality and insensitivity. Severe ill-posedness precludes the use
   of standard regularization techniques and necessitates more specialized
   approaches, usually comprised of two separate stages-global phase, that
   determines the problem's modality and provides rough approximations of
   the solutions, and a local phase, which refines these approximations.
   In this work, we attempt to improve one of the most efficient currently
   known approaches-Hierarchic Memetic Strategy (HMS)-by incorporating the
   Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) into its
   local phase. CMA-ES is a stochastic optimization algorithm that in some
   sense mimics the behavior of population-based evolutionary algorithms
   without explicitly evolving the population. This way, it avoids, to an
   extent, the associated cost of multiple evaluations of the objective
   function.
   We compare the performance of the HMS on relatively simple multimodal
   benchmark problems and on an engineering problem. To do so, we consider
   two configurations: the CMA-ES and the standard SEA (Simple Evolutionary
   Algorithm). The results demonstrate that the HMS with CMA-ES in the
   local phase requires less objective function evaluations to provide the
   same accuracy, making this approach more efficient than the standard
   SEA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Measuring short-term post-fire forest recovery across a burn severity
   gradient in a mixed pine-oak forest using multi-sensor remote sensing
   techniques},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {210},
Pages = {282-296},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Understanding post-fire forest recovery is pivotal to the study of
   forest dynamics and global carbon cycle. Field based studies indicated a
   convex response of forest recovery rate to burn severity at the
   individual tree level, related with fire-induced tree mortality;
   however, these findings were constrained in spatial/temporal extents,
   while not detectable by traditional optical remote sensing studies,
   largely attributing to the contaminated effect from understory recovery.
   Here, we examined whether the combined use of multi-sensor remote
   sensing techniques (i.e., 1 m simultaneous airborne imaging spectroscopy
   and LiDAR and 2 m satellite multi-spectral imagery) to separate canopy
   recovery from understory recovery would enable to quantify post-fire
   forest recovery rate spanning a large gradient in burn severity over
   large-scales. Our study was conducted in a mixed pine-oak forest in Long
   Island, NY, three years after a top-killing fire. Our studies remotely
   detected an initial increase and then decline of forest recovery rate to
   burn severity across the burned area, with a maximum canopy area-based
   recovery rate of 10\% per year at moderate forest burn severity class.
   More intriguingly, such remotely detected convex relationships also held
   at species level, with pine trees being more resilient to high burn
   severity and having a higher maximum recovery rate (12\% per year) than
   oak trees (4\% per year). These results are one of the first
   quantitative evidences showing the effects of fire adaptive strategies
   on post-fire forest recovery, derived from relatively large
   spatial-temporal scales. Our study thus provides the methodological
   advance to link multi sensor remote sensing techniques to monitor forest
   dynamics in a spatially explicit manner over large-scales, with
   important implications for fire-related forest management and
   constraining/benchmarking fire effect schemes in ecological process
   models.},

Title = {SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF TEMPERATURE HUMIDITY INDEX (THI) FOR

Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Nowadays, global warming hence global climate change is one of the most
   important key issues for livestock production. Because of its negative
   effects on animal health and production costs, climate change induced
   heat stress in livestock has become more critical than ever. Laying hens
   are more sensitive to heat stress. Therefore adverse effect of heat
   stress on laying hens is more severe than other livestock. Out of
   several methods the temperature humidity index is the most commonly used
   tool to determine the effects of heat stress on livestock. In this paper
   temperature humidity index variations between 1974 and 2013 for laying
   hens throughout the Marmara in the western Turkey was examined. The
   temperature humidity index in collaboration with a Geographical
   Information System and indicator kriging were used to determine risky
   sites for laying hens production in the region.
   It is determined that increases in the calculated seasonal mean and mean
   maximum THI values are significant (P<0.001). Furthermore, mean and mean
   maximum THI values are generally tended to increase for investigated
   period.
   In terms of THI, Shore of Black Sea and southeastern Marmara were found
   to be more convenient locations for laying hens production in the study
   area.
   Based on the study findings, put into effect some mitigation strategies
   such as cooling, shading and feed arrangement is needed for successful
   laying hens production in the entire studied area except for shore of
   the Black Sea, and southeastern Marmara.},

Title = {Do Climate Change Interventions Impact the Determinants of Health for
   Pacific Island Peoples? A Literature Review},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {466-496},
Abstract = {Climate-change impacts, especially those on health, are widely unequal
   and inequitable. For Pacific Island peoples, climate change has been
   suggested as perpetuating and exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and
   poor health outcomes related to the conditions in which people are born,
   grow, live, work, and age and the surrounding social and political
   organization of society-the social and structural determinants of
   health. In this analytical literature review, we evaluate the diverse
   impacts of common climate-change interventions-including migration,
   ecosystem-based management, community-based adaptation, and adaptation
   of the tourism industry and health sector-through the lens of these
   determinants of health, highlighting both opportunities and challenges.
   We show that climate change interventions around the Pacific present
   possibilities not only to address the direct impacts of climate change

Title = {Association between salinity and hospital admission for hypertension: an
   ecological case-control study in the Mekong Delta Region in Vietnam},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Background Drinking water in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) is highly
   vulnerable to salinity intrusion and this problem is expected to
   increase with the projected climate change and sea level rise. Despite
   this, research on health effects of saline contaminated water is scarce
   in this region. This study examines the risk of hospital admission for
   hypertension in salinity-affected areas of the MDR.
   Methods Cases and controls were obtained from national/provincial
   hospital admission records for 2013. The cases were adult patients whom
   hypertension (ICD10-code: I10-I15) was primary diagnosis for admission.
   Of the 13 provinces in the MDR, we identified seven as `salinity
   exposed' and the remaining as `non-exposed' areas. A multi-level
   logistic regression model was used to examine the association between
   salinity exposure and hypertension outcome.
   Results Of the total 573 650 hospital admissions, 22 382 (similar to
   3.9\%) were hypertensive cases. The multi-level logistic model combining
   both individual and ecological factors showed a 9\% increase in risk
   (95\% CI: 3-14\%) of hypertension admission among individuals in exposed
   areas compared to those in non-exposed areas.
   Conclusion In order to develop and promote appropriate adaptation
   strategies, further research is recommended to identify the salt
   exposure pathways and consumption behaviours in the salinity exposed
   areas.},

Volume = {134},

Pages = {48-61},

Abstract = {Emergency management and long-term planning in coastal areas depend on
   detailed assessments (meter scale) of flood and erosion risks.
   Typically, models of the risk chain are fragmented into smaller parts,
   because the physical processes involved are very complex and
   consequences can be diverse. We developed a Bayesian network (BN)
   approach to integrate the separate models. An important contribution is
   the learning algorithm for the BN. As input data, we used hindcast and
   synthetic extreme event scenarios, information on land use and
   vulnerability relationships (e.g., depth-damage curves). As part of the
   RISC-KIT (Resilience-Increasing Strategies for Coasts toolKIT) project,
   we successfully tested the approach and algorithm in a range of
   morphological settings. We also showed that it is possible to include
   hazards from different origins, such as marine and riverine sources. In
   this article, we describe the application to the town of
   Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, UK, which is vulnerable to storm surges.
   For any storm input scenario, the BN estimated the percentage of
   affected receptors in different zones of the site by predicting their
   hazards and damages. As receptor types, we considered people,
   residential and commercial properties, and a saltmarsh ecosystem.
   Additionally, the BN displays the outcome of different disaster risk
   reduction (DRR) measures. Because the model integrates the entire risk
   chain with DRR measures and predicts in real-time, it is useful for
   decision support in risk management of coastal areas.},

Abstract = {Two of the most notable littoral barriers are impermeable inlet jetties
   at navigation channels and breakwaters for harbors. Due to their
   protruding lengths, these structures often obstruct the natural flow of
   sediment alongshore, thus causing downdrift beach erosion. This study
   uses the parabolic bay shape equation derived for bay beaches in static
   equilibrium to examine the geomorphic effect of jetties and breakwaters
   on downdrift beaches, in which many were originally straight, but now in
   curved planform. Software MEPBAY is employed to visually assess the
   optimum positioning for the tips of these structures which are vital for
   the stability of downdrift beach. This geomorphic approach can be
   applied readily to strategically locate the tip of a harbor breakwater
   or inlet jetty in order to mitigate potential beach erosion. The same
   approach is also applicable to any bayed beaches for environmental
   impact assessment and coastal management, for design of a recreational
   beach and shore protection.},

Abstract = {El Hamra mooring pier was constructed on the northwestern Mediterranean
   coast of Egypt to provide shipping services for offshore oil terminals.
   Although the pier was built on cylindrical piles to avoid the
   interruption of sediment transport towards the south, unexpected
   sedimentation has affected navigation and the attached fire-fighting
   system. To provide a basis for evaluating the sedimentation problem and
   to provide possible mitigation strategies, a 23-month measurement
   program was conducted, including measurements of hydrographic surveying,
   nearshore waves, longshore currents, longshore littoral transport,
   currents seawards of the breaker zone, and offshore currents. The
   results confirm that carbonate sediments are transported southwards to
   the pier embayment from adjacent up-coast ridges by wave-induced
   currents. These sediments result from extensive civil engineering works
   (recreational development) up-coast of the El Hamra region, involving
   leveling of subaerial carbonate ridges and onshore sediment disposal.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In many parts of the world, both wild and cultured populations of
   bivalves have been struck by mass mortality episodes because of climatic
   and anthropogenic stressors whose causes and consequences are not always
   clearly understood. Such outbreaks have resulted in a range of responses
   from the social (fishers or farmers) and governing systems. We analyzed
   six commercial bivalve industries affected by mass mortalities using
   I-ADApT, a decision support framework to assess the impacts and
   consequences of these perturbations on the natural, social, and
   governing systems, and the consequent responses of stakeholders to these
   events. We propose a multidimensional resilience framework to assess
   resilience along the natural, social, and governing axes and to compare
   adaptive responses and their likelihood of success. The social capital
   and governability of the local communities were key factors affecting
   the communities' resilience and adaptation to environmental changes, but
   the rapid degradation of natural ecosystems puts the bivalve industry
   under a growing threat. Bivalve mariculture and fishing industries are
   likely to experience increased frequency, severity, and prevalence of
   such mass mortality events if the resilience of the natural systems is
   not improved. An understanding of previous adaptation processes can
   inform strategies for building adaptive capacity to future events.},

Title = {Harvest disruption projections for the Australian sugar industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-57},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to investigate the effects of climate change
   on harvestability for sugarcane-growing regions situated between
   mountain ranges and the narrow east Australian coastline.
   Design/methodology/approach - Daily rainfall simulations from 11 general
   circulation models (GCMs) were downscaled for seven Australian sugarcane
   regions (1961: 2000). Unharvestable days were calculated from these 11
   GCMs and compared to interpolated observed data. The historical
   downscaled GCM simulations were then compared to simulations under low
   (B1) and high (A2) emissions scenarios for the period of 2046-2065. The
   25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of paired model differences were
   assessed using 95 per cent bootstrapped confidence intervals.
   Findings - A decrease in the number of unharvestable days for the
   Burdekin (winter/spring) and Bundaberg (winter) regions and an increase
   for the Herbert region (spring) were plausible under the A2 scenario.
   Spatial plots identified variability within regions. Northern and
   southern regions were more variable than central regions.
   Practical implications - Changes to the frequency of unharvestable days
   may require a range of management adaptations such as modifying the
   harvest period and upgrading harvesting technologies.
   Originality/value - The application of a targeted industry rainfall
   parameter (unharvestable days) obtained from downscaled climate models
   provided a novel approach to investigate the impacts of climate change.
   This research forms a baseline for industry discussion and adaptation
   planning towards an environmentally and economically sustainable future.
   The methodology outlined can easily be extended to other primary
   industries impacted by wet weather.},

Abstract = {Coastal zones are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects.
   Over the last century, sea level rose on average by 10-12 cm per decade
   and did so at much higher rates in some coastal areas due to land
   subsidence. The 4th IPCC report highlights the increased vulnerability
   of the coastal zones around the world due to sea level rises in 21st
   Century. Key concerns due to sea level rise include flooding and
   salinisation and its implications for water resources. Rising sea level
   increases the salinity of both surface water and ground water through
   salt water intrusion.
   It is important to determine the impacts of sea level rise on salinity
   to devise suitable adaptation and mitigation measures and reduce impacts
   of salinity intrusion in coastal cities. The paper presents the outcomes
   of a study conducted in the coastal area of Gorai river network in the
   South West region of Bangladesh for developing a comprehensive
   understanding of the possible effects of sea level rise with the aid of
   a hydrodynamic model. A newly developed salinity flux model has been
   integrated with an existing hydrodynamic model in order to simulate
   flood and salinity in the complex waterways in the coastal zone of Gorai
   river basin. The integrated model has been calibrated and validated by
   numerous comparisons with measurements (tide, salinity). The model has
   been applied for future scenarios with sea level rise and the results
   obtained indicate the risk and changes in salinity. Due to sea level
   rise, the salinity has increased in the river and salinity intrusion
   length has also increased. Sea level rise of 59 cm produced a change of
   0.9 ppt at a distance of 80 km upstream of river mouth, corresponding to
   a climatic effect of 1.5 ppt per meter sea level rise. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study uses the socio-ecological resilience concept to compare two
   categories of fisheries co-management in Brazil: Extractive and
   Sustainable Development Reserves. Ecological resilience was estimated by
   the indicators: reserve areas, human density and the existence of buffer
   zones around the reserves. Indicators for social-resilience were grouped
   in two categories: flexibility (assessed by livelihood diversification
   and resources exploited) and capacity to organize (assessed by
   local/governrnenta1 demand for reserve creation, existence of fishing
   management rules or management plans, participation in the
   decision-making process and existence of self-monitoring). Amazonian
   reserves are larger, have buffer zones and people depend on a broader
   range of natural resources compared to those on the coast. However, the
   inhabitants of coastal reserves can rely on ecotourism and jobs outside
   the reserves, which may reduce local fishing pressure. Both regions have
   reserves created using top-down initiatives as well as those created
   from local demands. Yet, participation in decision making is not
   necessarily related to the origin of demand and the level of local
   involvement can be limited in either case. Unless co-management is
   followed by adaptive management, increased local participation of people
   in management and the diversification of economic sources. its benefit
   to resilience is limited.},

   tool which works at different scale and with several sources of hazard
   is here proposed. We drew maps of monothematic and synthetic indices to
   describe the hazard status of metropolitan areas. A hazard hotspot map
   was also elaborated to identify both the areas with high hazard for the
   single dangerous event and the areas characterized by the concomitance
   of several hazards. We computed hazard indices for Napoli and Pozzuoli,
   a densely populated area, located in the Somma-Vesuvio and Campi Flegrei
   multi-source volcanic zone and also exposed to landslide, flood and

Journal = {HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {3},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Salinity is a major problem affecting crop production all over the
   world: 20\% of cultivated land in the world, and 33\% of irrigated land,
   are salt-affected and degraded. This process can be accentuated by
   climate change, excessive use of groundwater (mainly if close to the
   sea), increasing use of low-quality water in irrigation, and massive
   introduction of irrigation associated with intensive farming. Excessive
   soil salinity reduces the productivity of many agricultural crops,
   including most vegetables, which are particularly sensitive throughout
   the ontogeny of the plant. The salinity threshold (ECt) of the majority
   of vegetable crops is low (ranging from 1 to 2.5 dS m(-1) in saturated
   soil extracts) and vegetable salt tolerance decreases when saline water
   is used for irrigation. The objective of this review is to discuss the
   effects of salinity on vegetable growth and how management practices
   (irrigation, drainage, and fertilization) can prevent soil and water
   salinization and mitigate the adverse effects of salinity.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to analyze the links between climate change and
   the way modern cities are structured and responded to climate change.
   How do these changes affect building materials and technologies, or does
   climate change affect the type of technology and materials used? The
   most important results are the effects of analysing selected examples of
   a modern European building, the use of materials and technology, the
   adaptation of buildings to the changing climate. Selected examples of
   contemporary architecture from Germany, Italy and Denmark, Norway and
   Sweden. There are also examples in photographic documentation. The most
   important criteria affecting the objects are elements that shape the
   changing climate, as well as existing legal and technical requirements.
   The main conclusion was that modern urban space is adapted to the
   changing climate. Unprecedented climatic phenomena in this area: intense
   and sudden rain, snow, floods, strong winds, abundant sunshine, high
   temperature changes, greenhouse effect of the city - ``island heat{''},
   atmospheric pollution. Building materials and technologies contribute to
   the optimal conservation of natural resources, buildings are shaped in
   such a way as to ensure safety, resilience and environmental protection.
   However, there is still a need for continuous monitoring of climate
   change, criteria affecting the design and construction of urban and
   central facilities. Key words: energy efficiency, renewable energy,
   climate change, contemporary architecture.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Marine classification schemes based on abiotic surrogates often inform
   regional marine conservation planning in lieu of detailed biological
   data. However, these schemes may poorly represent ecologically relevant
   biological patterns required for effective design and management
   strategies. We used a community-level modeling approach to characterize
   and delineate representative mesoscale (tens to thousands of kilometers)
   assemblages of demersal fish and benthic invertebrates in the Northwest
   Atlantic. Hierarchical clustering of species occurrence data from four
   regional annual multispecies trawl surveys revealed three to six
   groupings (predominant assemblage types) in each survey region, broadly
   associated with geomorphic and oceanographic features. Indicator
   analyses identified 3-34 emblematic taxa of each assemblage type. Random
   forest classifications accurately predicted assemblage distributions
   from environmental covariates (AUC > 0.95) and identified thermal limits
   (annual minimum and maximum bottom temperatures) as important predictors
   of distribution in each region. Using forecasted oceanographic
   conditions for the year 2075 and a regional classification model, we
   projected assemblage distributions in the southernmost bioregion
   (Scotian Shelf-Bay of Fundy) under a high emissions climate scenario
   (RCP 8.5). Range expansions to the northeast are projected for
   assemblages associated with warmer and shallower waters of the Western
   Scotian Shelf over the 21st century as thermal habitat on the relatively
   cooler Eastern Scotian Shelf becomes more favorable. Community-level
   modeling provides a biotic-informed approach for identifying broadscale
   ecological structure required for the design and management of
   ecologically coherent, representative, well-connected networks of Marine
   Protected Areas. When combined with oceanographic forecasts, this
   modeling approach provides a spatial tool for assessing sensitivity and
   resilience to climate change, which can improve conservation planning,
   monitoring, and adaptive management.},

   and challenges for integration},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Climate change is strongly impacting Arctic marine ecosystems, and the
   Arctic coastal communities whose identities, traditions and livelihoods
   are closely interconnected with the marine environment. The Ecosystem
   Approach (EA) is a promising approach for understanding and managing the
   occurring shifts in the Arctic marine ecosystems. Based on our analysis,
   we find that assessments conducted by international and regional
   instruments and institutions, most notably the Arctic Council, as well
   as the wealth of Indigenous knowledge present in the region, provide
   valuable starting points for the implementation of EA in the Arctic.
   Yet, mechanisms for translating knowledge into joint coordinated and
   integrated action in accordance with EA are currently lacking. Our
   analysis suggests that incremental steps can be taken now to promote the
   implementation of EA, while working to establish a more comprehensive
   governance framework. In our view, bottom-up initiatives may provide the
   most promising avenue for promoting the application of EA in the region
   under the current geopolitical circumstances. Support by civil society,
   Indigenous and conservation organizations, as well as global momentum
   will be necessary to coordinate, finance and elevate community-driven
   initiatives. Other opportunities we identify for advancing EA is to
   engage with sectoral management bodies and to advance EA through climate
   change adaptation measures.},

   results of many studies suggest that populated areas protected by
   coastal marshes were less likely to experience damage when exposed to
   the full force of storm surge, it was absolutely critical to place the
   role of coastal wetlands into perspective by noting that while tidal
   marshes can reduce wave energy from low-to-moderate-energy storms, their
   capacity to substantially reduce storm surge remains poorly quantified.
   Moreover, although tidal marshes can reduce storm surge from fast moving
   storms, very large expanses of habitat are needed to be most effective,
   and for most urban settings, there is insufficient space to rely on
   nature based risk reduction strategies alone. The success of a given NBI
   method is also context dependent on local conditions, with,potentially
   confounding influences from substrate characteristics, topography, near
   shore bathymetry, distance from the shore and other physical factors and
   human drivers such as development patterns. Furthermore, it is important
   to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of newly developed NBI
   projects through rigorous evaluations and characterize the local
   specificities of the particular built and natural environments
   surrounding these coastal areas. In order for the relevant science to
   better inform policy, and assist in land-use challenges, scientists must
   clearly state the likelihood of success in a particular circumstance and
   set of conditions. We conclude that ``caution is advised{''} before
   selecting a particular NBI method as there is no ``one size fits all{''}
   solution to address site specific conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Communities across the globe are grappling with identifying pathways to
   increase resilience to natural hazards due to increased frequency and
   intensity of hazards caused by climatic change. Regional collaboration
   among communities can be challenging but when successful, can leverage
   limited resources to achieve maximum benefit. The coastal area of the
   state of Connecticut, USA, encompasses 24 towns (approx. 45\% of state's
   population) and was hard-hit during both Tropical Storm Irene (approx.
   \$200M damages) and Sandy (approx. \$360M damages). To envision and
   advance a resilient path forward, The Nature Conservancy engaged with
   core regional partners to develop regional frameworks for resilience. An
   essential component of these frameworks included a geospatial database
   populated with resilience-building projects, hosted on a public-facing
   website. This resource allows communities and individuals to visualize a
   suite of resilience-based projects across the entire region and promotes
   multi-jurisdictional and cross-organization collaboration and
   partnership, with implications for regional planning, environmental
   efforts, and funding opportunities. The geospatial database development
   identified numerous natural infrastructure projects that reduced risk to
   infrastructure, strengthened ecosystems, and enhanced a public amenity
   (i.e. ``resilient triple bottom line{''}); however, many of these
   projects employed approaches that are still unfamiliar to the public,
   municipal officials, regulators, and practitioners. Conceptual designs
   were developed to both provide visualization of nonconventional
   alternatives and assist with obtaining funding for full design and
   construction of high-priority projects. This regional resilience
   framework approach has been implemented across the Connecticut coast,
   and the process can be readily adapted in other communities and scaled
   to the resources available to advance resilience both locally and
   regionally, in the USA, and internationally.},

Title = {Deterministic and probabilistic flood modeling for contemporary and
   future coastal and inland precipitation inundation},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While hazard mitigation lowers hazard impacts, communities cannot
   mitigate all possible risks. Targeting mitigation allows agencies with
   limited resources to mitigate areas within a community where hazard
   impacts are highest. To target these areas effectively, better hazard
   modeling is needed to provide more accurate hazard extents to pinpoint
   mitigation and conduct more complete vulnerability assessments.
   Deterministic models are useful for developing mitigation policies based
   on their hazard identification and exposure outputs in vulnerability
   analyses, but are limited because they do not calculate risk.
   Probabilistic models provide more information about the range of risk
   allowing decision makers to target mitigation and land-use management
   focuses toward areas of higher risk. Deterministic models used in
   conjunction with probabilistic models can also be used to perform all
   three levels of vulnerability assessment and produce more complete
   hazard modeling extents, which is something not traditionally done. To
   explore the need for the use of probabilistic models in conjunction with
   deterministic modeling, research presented here creates a theoretical
   framework for a stochastic storm surge model using deterministic hazard
   extents that depict coastal hazard inundation, using Sarasota County,
   Florida as a case study. The deterministic hazard extents are created
   for use in multiscalar vulnerability assessments that simulate storm
   surge, inland precipitation and sea-level rise (SLR) to depict holistic
   coastal hazard inundation. The deterministic extents also provide
   higher-resolution hazard identification that can aid local decision
   makers targeting high-risk areas, not all exposed areas. (C) 2014

Title = {Stratification constrains future heat and carbon uptake in the Southern
   Ocean between 30 degrees S and 55 degrees S},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {The heat and carbon uptakes in the Southern Ocean between 30 degrees S
   and 55 degrees S are critical for mitigating climate change. Here the
   authors find that projection uncertainties of both uptakes are reduced
   drastically when using the water column stability as an emergent
   constraint.
   The Southern Ocean between 30 degrees S and 55 degrees S is a major sink
   of excess heat and anthropogenic carbon, but model projections of these
   sinks remain highly uncertain. Reducing such uncertainties is required
   to effectively guide the development of climate mitigation policies for
   meeting the ambitious climate targets of the Paris Agreement. Here, we
   show that the large spread in the projections of future excess heat
   uptake efficiency and cumulative anthropogenic carbon uptake in this
   region are strongly linked to the models' contemporary stratification.
   This relationship is robust across two generations of Earth system
   models and is used to reduce the uncertainty of future estimates of the
   cumulative anthropogenic carbon uptake by up to 53\% and the excess heat
   uptake efficiency by 28\%. Our results highlight that, for this region,
   an improved representation of stratification in Earth system models is
   key to constrain future carbon budgets and climate change projections.},

Title = {The SMHI Large Ensemble (SMHI-LENS) with EC-Earth3.3.1},
Journal = {GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Pages = {5781-5796},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used the global
   climate model EC-Earth3 to perform a large ensemble of simulations
   (SMHI-LENS). It consists of 50 members, covers the period 1970 to 2100,
   and comprises the SSP1-1.9, SSP3-3.4, SSP5-3.4-OS, and SSP5-8.5
   scenarios. Thus, it is currently the only large ensemble that allows for
   analyzing the effect of delayed mitigation actions versus no mitigation
   efforts and versus earlier efforts leading to similar radiative forcing
   at the year 2100. We describe the set-up of the SMHI-LENS in detail and
   provide first examples of its application. The ensemble mean future
   changes in key variables in the atmosphere and ocean are analyzed and
   compared against the variability across the ensemble members. In
   agreement with other large-ensemble simulations, we find that the future
   changes in the near-surface temperature are more robust than those for
   precipitation or sea level pressure. As an example of a possible
   application of the SMHI-LENS, we analyze the probability of exceeding
   specific global surface warming levels in the different scenarios. None
   of the scenarios is able to keep global warming in the 21st century
   below 1.5 degrees C. In SSP1-1.9 there is a probability of approximately
   70\% to stay below 2 degrees C warming, while all other SSPs exceed this
   target in every single member of SMHI-LENS during the course of the
   century. We also investigate the point in time when the SSP5-8.5 and
   SSP5-3.4 ensembles separate, i.e., when their differences become
   significant, and likewise when the SSP5-3.4-OS and SSP4-3.4 ensembles
   become similar. Last, we show that the time of emergence of a separation
   between different scenarios can vary by several decades when reducing
   the ensemble size to 10 members.},

Title = {The Importance of Marine Bivalves in Invasive Host-Parasite
   Introductions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {Although research into the ecology and impacts of invasive species is
   prevalent, there are knowledge gaps relating to the role of invasive
   species in parasite transmission. This work synthesises invasive
   host-parasite interactions and impacts, using marine bivalves as a model
   group, to consider how global movement of shellfish consignments for
   aquaculture purposes facilitates the unintentional transfer of
   invasives. We discuss how invasive species can act as both hosts or
   parasitic organisms themselves, and introductions may lead to diseases
   within the bivalve aquaculture sector. This review highlights the
   importance of interdisciplinary research, with particular regard to the
   fields of parasitology and invasion ecology. We suggest that further
   integrating these fields will enhance critical knowledge of marine
   diseases, parasite-invasive-bivalve interplay dynamics, and potential
   mitigation strategies, including temperature-based disease surveillance
   models. We also address how climate change might impact invasive
   species, again with a focus on marine bivalves, and the potential
   outcomes for parasite transmission, including changes in host/parasite
   distribution, life-history and virulence. We acknowledge the importance
   of horizon scanning for future invasive host-parasite introductions and
   note that increased screening of invasive species, both in their native
   and invaded ranges, will provide clarity on invasion dynamics and
   potential impacts.},

Title = {Effects and resilience to climate crisis among adolescents: a narrative
   review on South Asian countries},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {This narrative review aims to assess the effects of the climate crisis
   on various aspects of adolescent wellbeing, and community level coping
   mechanisms being used to build resilience. This study summarizes
   research findings from eight South Asian countries based on a scoping
   review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature (critically evaluated)
   published between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2021. We have
   included multiple dimensions of climate change such as drought, floods,
   cyclones, tsunamis, storms, raised temperature/heatwaves, heavy
   rainfall, rising sea level, and glacier melt-related extreme weather
   events. Findings suggest Extreme Weather Events (EWE) affect adolescents
   and their wellbeing in various ways, with adolescent girls
   disproportionately harmed, as EWE are linked to early marriage,
   trafficking, gender based sexual and physical violence. Regional
   variation suggested, with Bangladeshi adolescents most vulnerable to
   EWE, followed by India and Pakistan. Floods, droughts and cyclones are
   the most commonly reported EWE affecting adolescents in the South Asian
   region. As the climate crisis is expected to increase the frequency and
   intensity of EWE, it will be critical to understand the gender sensitive
   impacts in more in-depth and find more sustainable solutions for the
   global problem that is adversely impacting the adolescent's life,
   wellbeing, and development.},

Title = {Understanding the Knowledge and Data Landscape of Climate Change Impacts
   and Adaptation in the Chesapeake Bay Region: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {CLIMATE},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly threatening coastal communities around
   the world. This article reviews the literature on climate change impacts
   and adaptation in the Chesapeake Bay region (USA). We reviewed both
   climate impacts and adaptation literature (n = 283) published in the
   period 2007-2018 to answer the questions: (i) how are indicators of
   climate impacts measured and reported by different types of authors
   (e.g., scientists, government, and NGOs), document types (e.g., academic
   articles or reports), and geographic focus (e.g., State, region, county,
   or municipal level)? (ii) what are the current approaches for measuring
   the most pressing climate impacts in the Chesapeake Bay? We found that
   scientists produce the most amount of data but are increasingly shifting
   towards engaging with practitioners through reports and online
   resources. Most indicators focus on the Chesapeake Bay scale, but data
   is most needed at the local level where adaptive policies are
   implemented. Our analysis shows emerging approaches to monitoring
   climate hazards and areas where synergies between types of authors are
   likely to increase resilience in the 21st century. This review expands
   the understanding of the information network in the Chesapeake Bay and
   explores the institutional landscape of stakeholders involved in the
   production and consumption of environmental and social change data. The
   analysis and insights of this review may be extended to similar regions
   around the planet experiencing or anticipating similar climate hazards
   to the Chesapeake Bay.},

Title = {Short-term effect of simulated salt marsh restoration by sand-amendment
   on sediment bacterial communities},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Coastal climate adaptation strategies are needed to build salt marsh
   resiliency and maintain critical ecosystem services in response to
   impacts caused by climate change. Although resident microbial
   communities perform crucial biogeochemical cycles for salt marsh
   functioning, their response to restoration practices is still
   understudied. One promising restoration strategy is the placement of
   sand or sediment onto the marsh platform to increase marsh resiliency. A
   previous study examined the above- and below-ground structure, soil
   carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in Spartina
   alterniflora-vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended
   sediments at varying inundation regimes. Here, we analyzed samples from
   the same experiment to test the effect of sand-amendments on the
   microbial communities after 5 months. Along with the previously observed
   changes in biogeochemistry, sand amendments drastically modified the
   bacterial communities, decreasing richness and diversity. The dominant
   sulfur-cycling bacterial community found in natural sediments was
   replaced by one dominated by iron oxidizers and aerobic heterotrophs,
   the abundance of which correlated with higher CO2-flux. In particular,
   the relative abundance of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria increased in
   the sand-amended sediments, possibly contributing to acidification by
   the formation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our data suggest that the bacterial
   community structure can equilibrate if the inundation regime is
   maintained within the optimal range for S. alterniflora. While long-term
   effects of changes in bacterial community on the growth of S.
   alterniflora are not clear, our results suggest that analyzing the
   microbial community composition could be a useful tool to monitor
   climate adaptation and restoration efforts.},

Title = {Adaptation in Collaborative Governance Regimes},

Volume = {54},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adaptation and the adaptive capacity of human and environmental systems
   have been of central concern to natural and social science scholars,
   many of whom characterize and promote the need for collaborative
   cross-boundary systems that are seen as flexible and adaptive by
   definition. Researchers who study collaborative governance systems in
   the public administration, planning and policy literature have paid less
   attention to adaptive capacity specifically and institutional adaptation
   in general. This paper bridges the two literatures and finds four common
   dimensions of capacity, including structural arrangements, leadership,
   knowledge and learning, and resources. In this paper, we focus on
   institutional adaptation in the context of collaborative governance
   regimes and try to clarify and distinguish collaborative capacity from
   adaptive capacity and their contributions to adaptive action. We posit
   further that collaborative capacities generate associated adaptive
   capacities thereby enabling institutional adaptation within
   collaborative governance regimes. We develop these distinctions and
   linkages between collaborative and adaptive capacities with the help of
   an illustrative case study in watershed management within the National
   Estuary Program.},

Title = {Community perceptions of long-term mangrove cover changes and its
   drivers from a typhoon-prone province in the Philippines},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {972-989},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests are among the most productive ecosystems with important
   services such as food and livelihood provisions, recreations, and
   regulations (e.g., coastal protection) in local scales. At global scale,
   they are gaining salience for their carbon sequestration capacities,
   currently conceptualized as ``blue carbon.{''} However, their essential
   benefits are reduced or lost when degraded. There is, therefore, a need
   to explore long-term mangrove cover change (MCC) and its underpinning
   drivers to develop sustainable management strategies. MCC has been
   analyzed extensively, including satellite images and field surveys, with
   drivers of changes frequently embedded in local contexts. Thus, in this
   study, MCC and the causal factors are evaluated at the local scale by
   gathering community perceptions in Eastern Samar, a typhoon-prone
   province in the Philippines, with a timeframe since the 1970s until the
   present. Results show that mangrove cover loss was observed following
   the occurrence of Typhoon Agnes in 1984 and Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 while
   conversion of mangrove areas to residential spaces was identified as a
   recurring driver of mangrove depletion from the early 1970s to 1990s.
   Study participants perceived that natural threats and lack of law
   enforcement were the leading proximate and underlying drivers of
   degradation, respectively. Respondents perceived that mangrove cover is
   increasing mainly due to successive reforestation programs coupled with
   stricter implementation of local ordinances in the sites. The results
   indicate the increased role of mangrove forests in disaster risk
   reduction and climate change mitigation strategies, while the
   perceptions of drivers change in long terms.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Bycatch in fisheries can have profound effects on the abundance of
   species with relatively low resilience to increased mortality, can alter
   the evolutionary characteristics and concomitant fitness of affected
   populations through heritable trait-based selective removals, and can
   alter ecosystem functions, structure and services through food web
   trophic links. We challenge current piecemeal bycatch management
   paradigms, which reduce the mortality of one taxon of conservation
   concern at the unintended expense of others. Bycatch mitigation measures
   may also reduce intraspecific genetic diversity. We drew examples of
   broadly prescribed best practice' methods to mitigate bycatch that
   result in unintended cross-taxa conflicts from pelagic longline, tuna
   purse seine, gillnet and trawl fisheries. We identified priority
   improvements in data quality and in understanding ecological effects of
   bycatch fishing mortality to support holistic ecological risk
   assessments of the effects of bycatch removals conducted through
   semi-quantitative and model-based approaches. A transition to integrated
   bycatch assessment and management that comprehensively consider
   biodiversity across its hierarchical manifestations is needed, where
   relative risks and conflicts from alternative bycatch management
   measures are evaluated and accounted for in fisheries decision-making
   processes. This would enable managers to select measures with
   intentional and acceptable tradeoffs to best meet objectives, when
   conflicts are unavoidable.},

Title = {Drinking water vulnerability to climate change and alternatives for

Abstract = {Drinking water in much of Asia, particularly in coastal and rural
   settings, is provided by a variety of sources, which are widely
   distributed and frequently managed at an individual or local community
   level. Coastal and near-inland drinking water sources in South and South
   East (SSE) Asia are vulnerable to contamination by seawater, most
   dramatically from tropical cyclone induced storm surges. This paper
   assesses spatial vulnerabilities to salinisation of drinking water
   sources due to meteorological variability and climate change along the
   (ca. 6000 km) coastline of SSE Asia. The risks of increasing climatic
   stresses are first considered, and then maps of relative vulnerability
   along the entire coastline are developed, using data from global scale
   land surface models, along with an overall vulnerability index. The
   results show that surface and near-surface drinking water in the coastal
   areas of the mega-deltas in Vietnam and Bangladesh-India are most
   vulnerable, putting more than 25 million people at risk of drinking
   `saline' water. Climate change is likely to exacerbate this problem,
   with adverse consequences for health, such as prevalence of hypertension
   and cardiovascular diseases. There is a need for identifying locations
   that are most at risk of salinisation in order for policy makers and
   local officials to implement strategies for reducing these health
   impacts. To counter the risks associated with these vulnerabilities,
   possible adaptation measures are also outlined. We conclude that
   detailed and fine scale vulnerability assessments may become crucial for
   planning targeted adaptation programmes along these coasts.},

Abstract = {While islands have been identified in numerous discourses as being
   highly vulnerable, food security was a cornerstone of many traditional
   Pacific Island societies from inland and coastal communities in large
   islands with considerable natural assets to those that occupied
   extremely small, low-lying atolls with little or no soil and limited
   water resources. This was sustained through agro-ecological
   biodiversity, the production of surpluses which enabled food
   preservation and storage to be practiced and underpinned networks of
   exchange and mutual support that were particularly important during
   times of hardship such as disruptive extreme natural events, the use of
   resilient crops and using `famine' foods. Colonisation, the introduction
   of new religions, the spread of capitalism, most recently in the context
   of globalisation, has seen many of these practices decline (some have
   disappeared altogether) as crop diversity has been reduced (making way
   for export products such as copra), food storage and preservation are
   now rarely practised, resilient crops have been replaced, famine foods
   have lost their importance in the face of disaster relief, and many
   traditional networks have declined. Food imports have become critical,
   not only in the growing urban areas, but also in rural communities. The
   paper concludes by addressing key challenges facing Pacific Island
   countries in order to revitalise those traditional elements of food
   security in ways that are likely to find acceptance in contemporary
   society and enable them to adapt to the effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {Jakarta is a capital city of Indonesia located in the delta of Ciliwung
   river. This city suffers annual flooding with some serious damage for
   certain extreme rainfall events, especially occurring at the upper parts
   of the Ciliwung watershed. In 1992 rainy season, flooding in Jakarta was
   scattered in 61 sites. In 1996, the flooding increased to 90 sites, and
   further increased in the rainy season of 2002 to be 159 sites. Jakarta
   experienced a major flooding on 9-10 February 2015 after having seen two
   occurrences of major flooding in the two preceding years 2013 and 2014
   (Siswanto et al., 2017). Such extreme flooding events might become more
   frequent in the future due to the impacts of land use and climate change
   (Kure et al., 2014). To reduce the magnitude and frequency of further
   flooding, on-site as well as off-site program actions need to be taken
   comprehensively. This paper is specifically aimed at, firstly
   understanding the main problems causing flooding in the coastal area of
   Jakarta, and secondly proposing medium and long-term solutions from the
   perspective of an integrated watershed management approach. The proposed
   solution will also include institutional and financial arrangements in a
   cross-administrative boundary situation.},

Title = {Morphological and ecological responses of a managed coastal sand dune to
   experimental notches},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {782},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {In northern Europe, coastal dune remobilization by restoring natural
   processes is considered by some to maintain the coastal dune in
   chronically eroding sectors by migrating landward and to restore dune
   ecology. In wet climatic contexts, this nature-based solution has been
   shown to induce an increase in both sand bare areas and vegetation
   diversity. However, it has never been tested in the coastal dunes of
   southern Europe with a drier climate and, thus, more stressful
   conditions, where disturbance may inversely decrease vegetation
   diversity. An original experiment was set up in 2018 on a 4-km stretch
   of coastal dune in southwest France where Experimental Notches (EN) were
   excavated in the incipient foredune, referred to as West Experimental
   Notch (WEN), and in the established foredune, referred as to East
   Experimental Notch (EEN). Morphological and ecological responses were
   monitored using UAV photogrammetry and vegetation sampling along
   transects during two years with contrasted winter storm conditions.
   During the first winter characterized by calm wind conditions, a rapid
   filling of the WENs and the initiation of deposition lobes landward of
   the EENs were observed. Stronger winds during the second winter led to
   the development of deposition lobes of the EENs, increasing both their
   volume, up to 6 times, and their cross-shore elongation. The increase in
   disturbance induced by the notches had a significant impact on
   vegetation. New sandy bares were colonized by pioneer species leading to
   an increase in species richness and rejuvenation, in particular landward
   of the EENs. Although longer-term monitoring is required to draw
   conclusions, these results suggest that the excavation of foredune
   notches are able to re-establish an ecomorphological dynamic in the
   dunes of southwest France on the time scales of years, promoting
   landward sand transport and, thus, the foredune landward translation,
   while not threatening diversity. Such approach may become a relevant
   adaptation strategy to sea level rise and increased erosion in this
   region of the world.

Title = {An experimental assessment of the potential impacts of longline mussel
   farming on the infauna in an open coastal embayment},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {1. The existence of perceived ecological impacts and development of
   adaptive management solutions to mitigate these problems are important
   issues in sustainable aquaculture. This paper examines the general
   impacts of two newly established trial longline installations on the
   infauna in Twofold Bay, a large, coastal embayment in south-east
   Australia.
   2. We hypothesized that the physical presence of these longline
   installations and the biological activities of the mussels they
   supported would result in temporal changes in densities of infaunal taxa
   below installations differing from those at undisturbed control sites.
   We also predicted different patterns of variability in infauna between
   longline and control sites from before to after the longlines were
   stocked. These hypotheses were tested by using a beyond-BACI sampling
   design and asymmetrical analyses of variance to compare changes in
   densities of taxa at several different spatial scales below the proposed
   longline sites with those at two adjacent control sites, before and
   after the longlines were stocked.
   3. After 18 months of longline operations, there was no evidence of any
   impact on total number of taxa, nor densities of individual taxa.
   Short-term temporal trends in densities in plots at control sites from
   April to May 2001 were often as different from each other as from those
   at the longline site. This indicates that densities of taxa at the farm
   site were within the range typically found at undisturbed sites, so
   there were no ecological impacts from the farm.
   4. These results do not concur with previous studies on impact of mussel
   farming in semi-enclosed coastal waters. Differences in location, scale
   of production, duration of operation and assimilative capacity of the
   environment probably contributed to this discrepancy. The infauna in
   Twofold Bay either do not respond to this form of disturbance or have
   not yet been exposed to disturbance of a sufficient magnitude, or for a
   sufficient period of time, to elicit a detectable response. Better
   definition of the potential ecological impacts associated with
   aquaculture, plus their scale and magnitude in different environments is
   needed to design experiments and monitoring programmes to detect
   specific impacts. This activity can only be considered sustainable once
   we know that these impacts are localized, reversible and short-term.

Abstract = {Environmental change requires individuals and institutions to facilitate
   adaptive governance. However, facilitating adaptive governance may be
   difficult because resource users' perceptions of desirable ways of life
   vary. These perceptions influence preferences related to environmental
   governance and may stem from the ways individuals subjectively value
   their work and their connections to their environment. This paper uses a
   value-based approach to examine individual and institutional preferences
   for adaptive governance in Carelmapu, Chile. We show that two groups had
   different value frames rooted in divergent ontologies which influenced
   their actions related to adaptive governance, creating conflict.},

Title = {Fisheries science and marine education catalyze the renaissance of

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Abstract = {Coral reef fisheries provide important ecosystem services to coastal
   communities, yet in the Pacific Islands, many of these contemporary
   fisheries are threatened by overexploitation. Historically, Pacific
   Island societies successfully utilized community-based management and
   spatial temporal closures to regulate the harvest of marine resources.
   In recognition of their past success these actions are currently being
   reemployed throughout the region. However, in many communities,
   innovative approaches may be needed to revitalize such practices and
   adapt traditional management to contemporary societal needs and
   expectations. This study presents the case of Anaa Atoll, a remote
   Pacific Island in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia, and the
   community's efforts to conserve a culturally important but overexploited
   bonefish (Albula glossodonta) fishery. Ultimately, fisheries research,
   education, and the creation of Aire Marine Educative (a marine area that
   is managed by a local primary school) were successful in building social
   cohesion and supporting the renaissance of rahui (a traditional form of
   restricting access to resources and or territories) to manage this
   fishery. On March 1st, 2019, the community of Anaa reinitiated this
   tradition for the first time in centuries. Based on these experiences,
   and an ensuing increase in the Spawning Potential Ratio of the bonefish
   stock, it is proposed that nationally recognized local management
   systems that incorporate fisheries research, youth education, and the
   cultural practices of communities should be supported in the marine
   policies of the Pacific Islands and beyond.},

Title = {Examining the scalar knowledge politics of risk within coastal sea level
   rise adaptation planning knowledge systems},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {105-114},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As cities around the world experience rapid sea level rise (SLR),
   institutions and actors classify and measure SLR ``risks{''} through
   discourse and specifying practices for adaptation. These risk,
   discourses, and practices occur at multiple scales that are embedded
   within one another and draw their significance from cross-scalar
   connections; from global estimates of ocean density and emission
   scenarios, local design criteria for flood management, networks of tidal
   gauges, and individual and collective experiences of loss and change.
   Thus social actors responding to the complex physical challenges posed
   by climate change across space and time must deal with an inherent
   politics of building shared understanding and agreeing on (or not)
   desirable courses of action. These dynamics produce `scalar politics,'
   i.e. strategies for defining and managing perceived risks at specific
   scales, resulting in more or less equitable and effective responses to
   the uneven consequences of SLR. To highlight the scalar politics of
   knowledge systems in adaptation planning, we present findings from two
   case studies of the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Florida, USA.
   Drawing on our findings, we propose the concept `scalar knowledge
   politics of risk.' As knowledge claims flow between global, regional,
   and local decision-making spaces, we identify five scales at which
   knowledge systems experience friction: 1) construction of the global
   climate; 2) regional downscaling of climate impacts; 3) local definition
   of risks; 4) transformation of on-the-ground social-ecological-technical
   systems and infrastructures; and, 5) evaluation of interventions.
   Through our case study investigation of the scalar politics of SLR
   adaptation, we hope to help illuminate and inform strategies to overcome
   long-standing barriers to effective and inclusive urban adaptation.},

Abstract = {Coastal regions become unprecedentedly vulnerable to coastal hazards
   that are associated with sea level rise. The purpose of this paper is
   therefore to simulate prospective urban exposure to changing sea levels.
   This article first applied the cellular-automaton-based SLEUTH model
   (Project Gigalopolis, 2016) to calibrate historical urban dynamics in
   Bay County, Florida (USA) - a region that is greatly threatened by
   rising sea levels. This paper estimated five urban growth parameters by
   multiple-calibration procedures that used different Monte Carlo
   iterations to account for modeling uncertainties. It then employed the
   calibrated model to predict three scenarios of urban growth up to
   2080-historical trend, urban sprawl, and compact development. We also
   assessed land use impacts of four policies: no regulations; flood
   mitigation plans based on the whole study region and on those areas that
   are prone to experience growth; and the protection of conservational
   lands. This study lastly overlaid projected urban areas in 2030 and 2080
   with 500-year flooding maps that were developed under 0, 0.2, and 0.9m
   sea level rise. The calibration results that a substantial number of
   built-up regions extend from established coastal settlements. The
   predictions suggest that total flooded area of new urbanized regions in
   2080 would be more than 25 times that under the flood mitigation policy,
   if the urbanization progresses with few policy interventions. The joint
   model generates new knowledge in the domain between land use modeling
   and sea level rise. It contributes to coastal spatial planning by
   helping develop hazard mitigation schemes and can be employed in other
   international communities that face combined pressure of urban growth
   and climate change.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Pacific Island countries are among the list of countries that face the
   highest disaster risk globally-in per capita terms. In recent years,
   governments in the region have been confronted by a rise in damages from
   extreme catastrophic events, many increasingly linked to climate change.
   These events pose significant challenges to Pacific governments in terms
   of maintaining fiscal stability and the operation of their limited and
   under-diversified economies and shallow financial sectors. Governments
   in the region generally play a leading role in domestic economies and
   are responsible for leading disaster prevention, mitigation, and
   recovery efforts. Accordingly, measures to improve financial
   sustainability and the public sector's ability to provide public
   services in the aftermath of major disasters must be prioritized. This
   paper examines the literature on fiscal resilience to disasters, the
   estimated impacts of major events in the Pacific, and analyses the
   applicability of available financial instruments to facilitate both ex
   ante and ex post disaster fiscal risk management in the region. The
   paper also discusses policies that can improve resilience against fiscal
   risks.},

   events: a global spectrally nudged storyline},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 18},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events are generally associated with unusual dynamical
   conditions, yet the signal-to-noise ratio of the dynamical aspects of
   climate change that are relevant to extremes appears to be small, and
   the nature of the change can be highly uncertain. On the other hand, the
   thermodynamic aspects of climate change are already largely apparent
   from observations and are far more certain since they are anchored in
   agreed-upon physical understanding. The storyline method of
   extreme-event attribution, which has been gaining traction in recent
   years, quantitatively estimates the magnitude of thermodynamic aspects
   of climate change, given the dynamical conditions. There are different
   ways of imposing the dynamical conditions. Here we present and evaluate
   a method where the dynamical conditions are enforced through global
   spectral nudging towards reanalysis data of the large-scale vorticity
   and divergence in the free atmosphere, leaving the lower atmosphere free
   to respond. We simulate the historical extreme weather event twice:
   first in the world as we know it, with the events occurring on a
   background of a changing climate, and second in a ``counterfactual{''}
   world, where the background is held fixed over the past century. We
   describe the methodology in detail and present results for the European
   2003 heatwave and the Russian 2010 heatwave as a proof of concept. These
   show that the conditional attribution can be performed with a high
   signal-to-noise ratio on daily timescales and at local spatial scales.
   Our methodology is thus potentially highly useful for realistic stress
   testing of resilience strategies for climate impacts when coupled to an
   impact model.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Some algae possess a multi-morphic life cycle, either in the form of
   free-living solitary cells or colonies which constantly occur in algal
   blooms. Though colony formation seems to consume extra energy and
   materials, many algae tend to outbreak in form of colonies. Here, we
   hypothesized that colony formation is a selected evolu-tionary strategy
   to improve population competitiveness and environmental adaptation. To
   test the hypothesis, different sizes of colonies and solitary cells in a
   natural bloom of Phaeocystis globosa were investigated. The large colony
   showed a relatively low oxidant stress level, a nutrient trap effect,
   and high nutrient use efficiency. The colonial nitrogen and phosphorus
   concentrations were about 5-10 times higher than solitary cell
   phycosphere and cellular nutrient allocation decreased with the
   enlargement of the colonial diameter following the economies of scale
   law. These features provide the colony with monopolistic competence and
   could function as an evolu-tionary strategy for competitive adaptation.},

Abstract = {A natural hazard is a naturally occurring extreme event that has a
   negative effect on people and society or the environment. Natural
   hazards may have severe implications for human life and can potentially
   generate economic losses and damage ecosystems. A better understanding
   of their major causes, probability of occurrence, and consequences
   enables society to be better prepared to save human lives as well as to
   invest in adaptation options. Natural hazards related to climate change
   are identified as one of the Grand Challenges in the Baltic Sea region.
   Here, we summarize existing knowledge about extreme events in the Baltic
   Sea region with a focus on the past 200 years as well as on future
   climate scenarios. The events considered here are the major
   hydro-meteorological events in the region and include wind storms,
   extreme waves, high and low sea levels, ice ridging, heavy
   precipitation, sea-effect snowfall, river floods, heat waves, ice
   seasons, and drought. We also address some ecological extremes and the
   implications of extreme events for society (phytoplankton blooms, forest
   fires, coastal flooding, offshore infrastructure, and shipping).
   Significant knowledge gaps are identified, including the response of
   large-scale atmospheric circulation to climate change and also
   concerning specific events, for example, the occurrence of marine heat
   waves and small-scale variability in precipitation. Suggestions for
   future research include the further development of high-resolution Earth
   system models and the potential use of methodologies for data analysis
   (statistical methods and machine learning). With respect to the expected
   impacts of climate change, changes are expected for sea level, extreme
   precipitation, heat waves and phytoplankton blooms (increase), and cold
   spells and severe ice winters (decrease). For some extremes (drying,
   river flooding, and extreme waves), the change depends on the area and
   time period studied.},

Title = {Conversion of Abandoned Property to Green Space as a Strategy to

Abstract = {Impervious surfaces and buildings in the urban environment alter the
   radiative balance and surface energy exchange and can lead to warmer
   temperatures known as the urban heat island (UHI), which can increase
   heat-related illness and mortality. Continued urbanization and
   anthropogenic warming will enhance city temperatures worldwide, raising
   the need for viable mitigation strategies. Increasing green space
   throughout a city is a viable option to lessen the impacts of the UHI
   but can be difficult to implement. The potential impact of converting
   existing vacant lots in Kansas City, Missouri, to green spaces is
   explored with numerical simulations for three heat-wave events. Using
   data on vacant property and identifying places with a high fraction of
   impervious surfaces, the most suitable areas for converting vacant lots
   to green spaces is determined. Land-use/land-cover datasets are modified
   to simulate varying degrees of feasible conversion of urban to green
   spaces in these areas, and the local cooling effect using each strategy
   is compared with the unmodified simulation. Under more aggressive
   greening strategies, a mean local cooling impact of 0.5 degrees-1.0
   degrees C is present within the focus area itself during the nighttime
   hours. Some additional cooling via the ``park cool island{''} is
   possible downwind of the converted green spaces under the more
   aggressive scenarios. Although moderate and conservative strategies of
   conversion could still lead to other benefits, those strategies have
   little impact on cooling. Only an aggressive approach yields significant
   cooling.},

Title = {Coping with coastal risk and vulnerabilities in Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {112-118},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Livelihoods in the coastal zone are vulnerable to a variety of shocks
   (e.g. cyclone), trends (e.g. climate change) and seasonality (e.g.
   salinity). This is probably due to economic and social susceptibility.
   In a developing economy, vulnerability is also studied in terms of the
   power aspects of gender (the inequality in power relations between men
   and women), and manifested in the marginalization of (mostly) women in
   social, economic, political and cultural spheres of life. However,
   gender related vulnerability to disasters is a socially created form of
   vulnerability. This paper focuses on understanding gender-differentiated
   impacts on different livelihoods and how they affect the formulation of
   policies, programs or projects. It also examines how this input into
   program formulation reduces the level of risk faced by poor people and
   enhances their resilience and ability to cope with stresses. The results
   show that some coping mechanisms are directly enacted at the individual
   or household level (limits on food consumption, sale of assets, and so
   forth) and some are enacted at the livelihood group level, where people
   devise their coping strategies on a more occupational and
   livelihood-based domain. People enact these strategies in a group manner
   and react according to their basic needs and the requirements of their
   livelihoods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved},

Abstract = {Sustainable and resilient development refers to sustained competent
   functioning despite severely challenging circumstances. Resilience also
   implies effective coping, which includes thought and action as the
   person puts effort to restore or maintain equilibrium under certain
   threat. This paper attempts to test empirically the model of resiliency
   and the importance of religiosity in developing resilient youth by using
   structural equation modeling (SEM). The adolescents' conception of
   resiliency measures dimensions such as active skills, future
   orientation, risk taking and independence while religiosity is examined
   through one's ability to cope and involve in religious activities. This
   study was done on a total sample of 608 youths from the east-coast of
   peninsular Malaysia. Cross-validation was done using two sub-samples of
   160 and 148 youths respectively. The Resiliency Belief Scales' and
   Religiosity Scale(2) were employed in this study. The instruments
   consisted of 53 items and the items were hypothesized to have non-zero
   loadings on all dimensions in the model. Analysis of the items resulted
   in a well-fitting model (x(2)/df = 1.318; GFI = 0.967; CFI = 0.991;
   RMSEA = 0.02). The direction and magnitude of the factor loadings were
   substantial and statistically significant. This shows that the model
   fits with the sample of data in this study. Religiosity explains 65\% of
   variance in resiliency.},

Abstract = {Although there has been considerable research on the impacts of
   individual changes in water temperature, carbonate chemistry, and other
   variables on species, cumulative impacts of these effects have rarely
   been studied. Here, we simulate changes in (i) primary productivity,
   (ii) species range shifts, (iii) zooplankton community size structure,
   (iv) ocean acidification, and (v) ocean deoxygenation both individually
   and together using five Ecopath with Ecosim models of the northeast
   Pacific Ocean. We used a standardized method to represent climate
   effects that relied on time-series forcing functions: annual multipliers
   of species productivity. We focused on changes in fisheries landings,
   biomass, and ecosystem characteristics (diversity and trophic indices).
   Fisheries landings generally declined in response to cumulative effects
   and often to a greater degree than would have been predicted based on
   individual climate effects, indicating possible synergies. Total biomass
   of fished and unfished functional groups displayed a decline, though
   unfished groups were affected less negatively. Some functional groups
   (e.g. pelagic and demersal invertebrates) were predicted to respond
   favourably under cumulative effects in some regions. The challenge of
   predicting climate change impacts must be met if we are to adapt and
   manage rapidly changing marine ecosystems in the 21st century.},

Title = {Is adaptation a local responsibility?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {89-98},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Adaptation is now firmly embedded in the societal discourse regarding
   the management of climate risk. In this discourse, adaptation planning
   and implementation at the local level are seen as particularly important
   for developing robust responses to climate change. However, it is not
   clear whether the mantra that adaptation is local holds true given the
   multi-level nature of climate risk governance. Using a multi-method
   approach, this paper examines the extent to which adaptation should be
   framed as a local issue and, specifically, the role of local government
   in adaptation relative to other actors. In so doing, the paper first
   explores the extent to which the local framing of adaptation is embedded
   in the international adaptation literature. This is followed by a
   specific case study from Southeast Queensland, Australia, which focuses
   on the critical examination of the processes of responsibility shifting
   and taking among actors involved in coastal adaptation planning. Results
   indicate the assumption that adaptation is local remains widely held in
   adaptation science, although counter arguments can be readily
   identified. Interviews with adaptation actors revealed unclear divisions
   of responsibility for climate change adaptation as a significant
   constraint on actors' willingness to implement adaptation. Furthermore,
   attributing responsibility for adaptation to local actors might not
   necessarily be a robust strategy, due to the existence of particularly
   strong constraints and value conflicts at local levels of governance.
   Greater appreciation by researchers and practitioners for the
   interactions between local actors and those at higher levels of
   governance in shaping response capacity may contribute to more equitable
   and effective allocations of responsibilities for adaptation action. (C)

Title = {Technologically mediated practices in sustainability transitions:
   Environmental monitoring and the ocean data buoy},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {182},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The discourses of sustainability are inextricably linked to the
   influence of technology in shaping the future. Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) in particular plays a crucial role in our
   understanding of the environment and human impacts as well as our search
   for future solutions to mitigate climate change. However advances in
   technology need to be accompanied by social innovation in order to
   meaningfully address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
   Sustainability transitions research extends the well-established field
   of socio-technical systems analysis by paying closer attention to
   environmental, economical, social, political and technical factors that
   can stimulate change. Yet in order to offer guidance towards future
   socio-technical solu-tions, a deeper understanding of the relations
   between humanity and technology is necessary. To fulfill this
   requirement we explore the the concept of technological mediation and
   identify four ICT mediated practices in sustainability transitions:
   information gathering, communicating, decision-making, and
   self-reflection. These practices are described in the context of
   Sustainable Development Goal 14 Life Below Water, then elaborated
   through a specific example: the development and use of remote sensing
   ocean data buoys. In discussion we demonstrate the utility of
   technological mediation perspective to shed light on the interdependence
   of society, technology and the environment, and open critical discourses
   on sustainability transitions that can help shape equitable future
   alternatives.},

Title = {Responding to the challenges of climate change in the Pacific Islands:
   management and technological imperatives},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {211-231},
Abstract = {Pacific Island nations face similar challenges from climate change to
   those faced by other developing nations, yet these are exacerbated by
   the comparative smallness, remoteness, and archipelagic character of
   many of the islands. Proposed solutions to the effects of climate change
   in the Pacific Islands have often been uncritically imposed from
   elsewhere and have often proved unsuited to both their environmental and
   cultural contexts. Effective solutions to challenges of climate change
   in the Pacific Islands should acknowledge their unique environmental
   characteristics, particularly their high insularity (coastal length to
   land area) ratios, their topographic and geological diversity, and the
   raw materials available to support adaptation. It is important for
   policy makers to understand the cultural influences that have helped
   shape current environmental decision making, and the ways in which
   adaptations to climate change can be sustained. The efficacy of donor
   preferences for aid funding of policy development (top-down) rather than
   empowering community-level decision-makers (bottom-up) is questionable.
   Pacific Island governments are focused on economic growth, with little
   tangible investment in non-profit environmental sustainability. In the
   future they should take on ownership of the climate-change adaptation
   process to a greater degree than they do at present, with external
   assistance brought in only for special cases and for the trialling of
   novel solutions, rather than for routine adaptation. Globally, there
   should be less emphasis on sea-level rise as the principal challenge
   posed by climate change to Pacific Island nations and a better
   appreciation of the other challenges, particularly inundation and
   salinization of economically critical lowland, as well as coral-reef
   degradation.},

Title = {Wicked Social-Ecological Problems Forcing Unprecedented Change on the
   Latitudinal Margins of Coral Reefs: the Case of Southwest Madagascar},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {High-latitude coral reefs may be a refuge and area of reef expansion
   under climate change. As these locations are expected to become dryer
   and as livestock and agricultural yields decline, coastal populations
   may become increasingly dependent on marine resources. To evaluate this
   social-ecological conundrum, we examined the Grand Recif of Toliara
   (GRT), southwest Madagascar, which was intensively studied in the 1960s
   and has been highly degraded since the 1980s. We analyzed the social and
   ecological published and unpublished literature on this region and
   provide new data to assess the magnitude of the changes and evaluate the
   causes of reef degradation. Top-down controls were identified as the
   major drivers: human population growth and migrations, overfishing, and
   climate change, specifically decreased rainfall and rising temperature.
   Water quality has not changed since originally studied, and bottom-up
   control was ruled out. The identified network of social-ecological
   processes acting at different scales implies that decision makers will
   face complex problems that are linked to broader social, economic, and
   policy issues. This characterizes wicked problems, which are often dealt
   with by partial solutions that are exploratory and include inputs from
   various stakeholders along with information sharing, knowledge
   synthesis, and trust building. A hybrid approach based on classical
   fishery management options and preferences, along with monitoring,
   feedback and forums for searching solutions, could move the process of
   adaptation forward once an adaptive and appropriately scaled governance
   system is functioning. This approach has broad implications for
   resources management given the emerging climate change and multiple
   social and environmental stresses.},

Title = {Effects of a bio-invasion of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas

Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {543-552},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Management of invasive species is addressed in both national and
   international regulations regarding the protection of marine habitats
   and biodiversity and in regulations of aquaculture. The geographical
   range of the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is expanding,
   both through human mediated vectors and by natural dispersal. The
   species is now spreading in Scandinavia. In order to optimize the
   management of the oyster, including targeted monitoring and mitigation
   activities, knowledge on the present and future distribution and impact
   on the ecosystem is important. The development of the population and the
   potential impacts on native ecosystems were analyzed, based on the
   present scientific knowledge on the distribution in Scandinavia, data on
   new settlements and existing literature. Data was first evaluated by 14
   experts (including the authors) during a workshop, relating the current
   status of habitats where Pacific oysters are found in Scandinavia (Low
   energy rock, Littoral sand and mudflats, Littoral biogenic reefs,
   Sublittoral sand and Sublittoral biogenic reefs) to a predicted
   development, thereafter assessed in relation to impact on the habitats.
   The assessment was done as a function of climate change in a longterm
   IPCC climate scenario (A1B). We conclude that Littoral biogenic reefs
   are at risk to obtain the highest expected increase, while all other
   habitats are at risk of low to moderate development of the oyster
   populations. Accordingly, Littoral Biogenic reefs was assessed as the
   habitat type at risk of the largest ecosystem effects as high densities
   of oysters already exist in these areas, and the densities are expected
   to increase rapidly until reaching a threshold density. Low energy rock
   and Littoral sand and mud were assessed as being subjected to moderate
   to high ecosystem effects. Sub-littoral sand and Sub-littoral biogenic
   reefs were assessed as currently being at risk of moderate ecosystem
   effects as there are low densities of oysters in these habitats,
   although densities in sublittoral biogenic reefs has the potential to
   increase. We discuss management and mitigation strategies based on the
   forecasted development and effects of the Pacific oyster populations.},

Abstract = {Development activities threaten the long-term sustainability of tropical
   floodplain systems. The construction of dams, weirs, irrigation
   infrastructure and regulators affect connectivity among habitats and can
   facilitate rapid declines in riverine biota, especially fish. Indonesia
   is a tropical island country with an abundance of monsoonal rivers.
   Massive expansions in hydropower and irrigation infrastructure are
   planned over the next two decades and mitigation measures will be needed
   to protect migratory fish. Most Indonesian freshwater fish need to
   migrate among habitats to complete essential life-history stages. So,
   strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the barrier effects of river
   infrastructure to ensure the long-term sustainability of river fishes. A
   common tool used worldwide is the construction of upstream and
   downstream fish passes. Only two fish passes exist in Indonesia. One at
   Perjaya Irrigation Dam on the Komering River (Sumatra island) and
   another on Poso Dam on the Poso River (Sulawesi island). Neither of
   these structures has been assessed and many other projects are
   proceeding without considering potential impacts on fisheries. The
   proposed infrastructure upgrades over the next two decades provide a
   once-in-a-generation opportunity to ensure that migratory fish are
   adequately protected into the future.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean basin is amongst the world's main tourist destination,
   and its islands are a major attraction, being sites of historical,
   cultural and naturalistic importance. This is beneficial for the local
   economies, but it may also represent a great burden on the coastal
   environment, where other human pressures are concentrated. The awareness
   of detrimental side effects of tourism together with the importance to
   take into account social and economic facets has led to the concept of
   sustainable tourism, which, however, represents a goal far from being
   attained. A good opportunity to promote sustainable tourism was provided
   by the Interreg MED BLUEISLANDS project, whose main aim was to identify,
   address and mitigate the effects of the seasonal variation of waste
   generated by tourism on Mediterranean islands. Here, we present the
   methodological framework of the project aimed at biomonitoring coastal
   seawater in highly touristic sites using macroalgae as valuable
   bioindicators of seawater quality and improving its status through the
   implementation and assessment of mitigation measures that included also
   the involvement of stakeholders. Outcomes of the project highlighted the
   effectiveness of such an integrated approach, confirming the importance
   of choosing proper indicators and tools that can support the development
   of management plans aiming to mitigate environmental impact and foster
   sustainable tourism.},

Title = {Consistent Pattern of Local Adaptation during an Experimental Heat Wave
   in a Pipefish-Trematode Host-Parasite System},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Extreme climate events such as heat waves are expected to increase in
   frequency under global change. As one indirect effect, they can alter
   magnitude and direction of species interactions, for example those
   between hosts and parasites. We simulated a summer heat wave to
   investigate how a changing environment affects the interaction between
   the broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle) as a host and its digenean
   trematode parasite (Cryptocotyle lingua). In a fully reciprocal
   laboratory infection experiment, pipefish from three different coastal
   locations were exposed to sympatric and allopatric trematode cercariae.
   In order to examine whether an extreme climatic event disrupts patterns
   of locally adapted host-parasite combinations we measured the parasite's
   transmission success as well as the host's adaptive and innate immune
   defence under control and heat wave conditions. Independent of
   temperature, sympatric cercariae were always more successful than
   allopatric ones, indicating that parasites are locally adapted to their
   hosts. Hosts suffered from heat stress as suggested by fewer cells of
   the adaptive immune system (lymphocytes) compared to the same groups
   that were kept at 18 degrees C. However, the proportion of the innate
   immune cells (monocytes) was higher in the 18 degrees C water. Contrary
   to our expectations, no interaction between host immune defence,
   parasite infectivity and temperature stress were found, nor did the
   pattern of local adaptation change due to increased water temperature.
   Thus, in this host-parasite interaction, the sympatric parasite keeps
   ahead of the coevolutionary dynamics across sites, even under increasing
   temperatures as expected under marine global warming.},

Abstract = {The magnitude and frequency of coastal storms are expected to increase
   with rising global sea levels, which necessitates evaluating coastal
   flood adaptation measures. This study examines an important issue in the
   context of coastal flood protection, namely, the decision when to adopt
   protection measures. For any given coastal region, our benefit-cost
   framework allows us to determine the optimal timing of initiating
   protection that maximizes expected net benefits. We present an
   application of this framework to a coastal area in Connecticut. Our
   results suggest that the optimal timing of adopting protection may vary
   across different census blocks within the study area. We find that using
   a relatively low discount rate in the benefit-cost analysis implies
   greater heterogeneity in the timing decisions and earlier overall
   adoption, whereas, with higher discount rates, the timing decisions are
   reduced to a choice between early protection and no protection at all.
   If possible negative environmental and aesthetic impacts of sea barriers
   are taken into account, delaying protection would become more desirable,
   with the extent of delay being sensitive to the relative magnitude of
   one-time costs (e.g., loss of ocean view and recreational opportunities)
   vs. continuous costs (e.g., shoreline erosion and loss of wetlands).},

Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-59},

Abstract = {Pacific Island countries are particularly vulnerable to future
   manifestations of climate change due to high coastline-to-land-area
   ratios, and high dependence of inhabitants on natural ecosystems. While
   everyone in the Pacific Islands should participate in climate change
   adaptation activities, it is the young people, given they are the
   generation likely to not only bear the burden of climate change, but to
   lead and live effective climate change adaptation activities and
   strategies specific to their region, the involvement of youth is
   critical. Pacific Island youths are often marginalised within
   traditional decision-making hierarchies, therefore they are typically
   excluded from participating in meaningful discussions at community and
   government levels. Discussions were held with 30 adolescents aged
   14-18years in Fiji to explore knowledge and experiences regarding
   climate change. Participants revealed their dismay at their inability to
   talk to family - who they consider are not doing enough - about what
   they consider as appropriate responses to climate change, recommending
   the help of an authoritative outsider who could speak to their community
   leaders and family. Discussions also revealed that Fijian youth could
   not distinguish between changes in the climate and normal weather
   events, attesting to the importance of climate-change education and
   awareness-raising efforts within the Pacific Islands more generally.},

Title = {Incorporating natural habitats into coastal risk assessment frameworks},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {99-110},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The coastal risk assessment (CRA) has important implications for policy
   development, resilience enhancement, and risk reduction to reduce the
   magnitude and likelihood of future losses to coastal hazards. However,
   few if any existing in-practice CRA approaches account for the effects
   of coastal natural habitats (CNHs), which shield communities from
   natural hazards and support resilience enhancement in coastal regions.
   Here, we use a coupled human-nature system-based CRA framework to
   provide evidence on the influence of CNHs on coastal storm-risk levels
   and spatial distributions. We calculate a risk index for each coastal
   county along the U.S. Atlantic coast and employ different spatial
   assessment approaches to systematically analyse the risk. This index
   incorporates several bio-geo-physical variables (e.g., geomorphology,
   natural habitats, coastal relief, and historical data on sea level
   trends, wind, and wave) and data on socio-ecological systems. The index
   is calculated under two CNH scenarios (i.e., without- and with-habitat)
   and is further used for mapping the at-risk population. We find that the
   without-habitat scenario overestimates the population in the highest
   risk category by 10 \% and the number of counties by as much as 40 \% as
   compared to the with-habitat scenario mostly in the Gulf region. Also,
   the without-habitat scenario miscalculates the spatial distribution of
   the risk (e.g., over/under-estimate the relative risk for Florida/New
   York). These findings highlight the role of CNHs to provide defensive
   services and the importance of incorporating CNHs into the risk
   assessment process. While the CNHs inclusive risk results are important
   for coastal risk-reduction through prioritization and smart resource
   allocation, the well evident influence of CNHs on risk level and its
   distribution is also supportive for conservationists to stress the
   policies relevant to the protection and restoration of coastal natural
   systems owing to their multiple services.},

Title = {TERRITORIAL IMPACTS OF SEA-LEVEL RISE IN MARSH ENVIRONMENTS. THE CASE OF
   THE BAY OF CADIZ, SPAIN},
Journal = {CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {523-543},
Abstract = {How can sea-level rise affect territory? Has territorial planning
   adjusted to this new situation? This paper analyses the possible
   ramifications of changes in tidal recurrence over the course of this
   century in a potentially vulnerable marsh environment, such as the Bay
   of Cadiz, in southern Spain, where sea-level rise is already a fact. For
   that purpose, the regionalisation criterion is used as a basis for
   adjusting the magnitude of global problems to subregional scale.
   Geographic information systems are applied to portray the forecasted
   territorial changes according to the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios
   presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for
   the years 2050 and 2100. Projections of sea-level rise show that the
   tide is travelling farther inland, not just invading unoccupied areas of
   marshes and beaches but also reaching urban and productive areas.
   Estimates indicate that the floodable area could expand by more than
   20\% in 2050, with a further 2,000 ha of flooded areas added in 2100 for
   either of the two scenarios used. The occurrence of these changes,
   regardless of the model used, would therefore entail an alteration of
   the environmental, social, cultural and economic values and elements of
   the Bay of Cadiz, with the Natural Park being the most affected area. In
   response to these consequences, the need to apply the resulting
   projections to other variables is insisted on, with a view to
   introducing territorial management tailored to this new and already
   present reality. Application of the regionalisation criterion to study
   repercussions of the climate crisis in the Bay of Cadiz could serve as a
   precedent for the development of adaptation strategies in other marsh
   environments at subregional or local level.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {185-197},

Abstract = {Internationally marine ecosystem-based management has been embraced as
   an approach to design holistic marine management regimes. In this
   article a comparative research strategy is applied in the analysis of
   the holistic marine management regimes in Norway, Australia, US, Canada
   and the European Union. How can holistic marine management regimes based
   on an ecosystem approach contribute to sustainable ocean development?
   Important in this context is how the origin and theory of an ecosystem
   based management is implemented and interpreted, and to what extent this
   is manifested through policies, strategies and legal frameworks. The
   results of this research indicate that the implementation of
   marine-ecosystem based management is heterogeneous. This article
   discusses the concrete Mechanisms that are used to reach the aim of
   sustainable ocean management. Implementation challenges are related to
   lack of functional metrics, weak spatial measures, weak integration and
   lack of adaptive management. Still marine ecosystem-based management is
   an important step forward for sustainable ocean governance. (C) 2016

Abstract = {A decision support and information delivery framework, CoastAdapt, has
   been built to support the coastal adaptation community in Australia to
   take action to address climate change and sea-level rise. For such
   frameworks to be useful, used and long-lived, their development requires
   collaboration between creators and potential users. Therefore, we
   undertook extensive consultation throughout the design, build and
   evaluation. In this paper, we explore those aspects of the consultation
   that focused on understanding and addressing user needs and how
   CoastAdapt could best provide support to effectively carry out
   adaptation planning and action. The first step was to identify, through
   an online survey and workshops, the knowledge gaps and barriers that
   could be addressed by CoastAdapt. The responses fed into the design and
   build, together with additional feedback from users on the layout and
   content. Following release of the beta version, further comments from
   users were collected and scrutinised to identify modifications that
   could increase relevance and utility. Finally, test cases were carried
   out to understand whether CoastAdapt is truly fit for purpose in
   addressing real-world' adaptation situations. The end result is a
   supportive framework for coastal adaptation that will require constant
   monitoring and updating to ensure it remains fit for purpose given
   Australia's rapidly evolving adaptation landscape.},

Title = {Impacts of large-scale teleconnection indices on chill accumulation for
   specialty crops in California},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {791},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Although the impacts of teleconnection indices on climate metrics such
   as precipitation and temperature in California have been widely studied,
   less attention has been given to the impact on integrated climate
   indices such as chill accumulation. This study investigates the linkages
   between large-scale teleconnections and winter chill accumulation for
   specialty crops in California, which may enable more effective and
   dynamic adaptation to in-season climate variability. Three large-scale
   teleconnection indices were selected: Oceanic Nino Index (ONI),
   Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern (PNA), and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO) index to assess their effects on chill accumulation.
   The Chill Hours Model and Dynamic Model are adopted to calculate chill
   accumulation in Chill Hours (CH) and Chill Portions (CP) from November
   to January. Three major crop-producing regions, including the Central
   Coast, Sacramento Valley, and San Joaquin Valley, are used as the
   focused regions. Our results suggest CP generally has a stronger
   response to teleconnection patterns than CH in California. The
   correlations between chill accumulation and teleconnections are
   generally weaker during the summer than other seasons, and significant
   correlation can be observed 2-10 months before the start of the chill
   accumulation period. Among the three teleconnection indices, ONI is most
   weakly correlated to chill accumulation in focused regions, while PDO
   shows the strongest positive correlation and explains up to 39\%
   variability of CP. PNA presents the most widespread negative correlation
   with chill accumulation. When aggregated to different teleconnection
   modes, +3.6 above-average CP is expected during ONI positive mode; +2.3
   above-average CP is expected during PDO positive mode, while +2.1
   above-average CP is expected during PNA negative mode. This study
   provides insights on early-season chill prediction and feasible

Title = {Present and future projections of heatwave hazard-risk over India: A
   regional earth system model assessment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {201},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The heatwave is a disastrous hazard having significant impacts on health
   and society. This study analyses the heatwave hazards and risk for
   India's current and future scenarios using socioeconomic vulnerability
   and temperature datasets during the summer (April-June) season. The
   Census of India (CoI) 2011 datasets were considered to assess current
   vulnerability and projected from the SocioEconomic Data And Application
   Center (SEDAC) population at Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 4 for
   future vulnerability. Whereas IMD temperature data used for hazard
   assessment for the present scenario (1958-2005) while projected
   temperature data from regional earth system model REMO-OASIS-MPIOM (ROM)
   were used for the future (2006-2099) scenario. The study exhibited the
   most hazardous, vulnerable, and risk-prone regions identified as the
   south-eastern coast and Indo-Gangetic plains and some populous districts
   with metropolitan regions (Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata) under the current
   scenario. The coupled model ROM has efficiently captured the critical
   districts with higher and lower risk, showing its future projection
   capability. The study highlighted that the heatwave hazard-risk would
   significantly worsen in future scenarios in all districts under enhanced
   global warming and largely affecting the districts in the eastern and
   middle Indo-Gangetic plains and Malabar region. The present study will
   provide sufficient insights into designing mitigation strategies and
   future adaptive planning for the heatwave risk, which is one of the
   targets under Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Goal 13: Climate Action).},

Title = {Contrasting responses of urban and rural surface energy budgets to heat
   waves explain synergies between urban heat islands and heat waves},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Heat waves (HWs) are projected to become more frequent and last longer
   over most land areas in the late 21st century, which raises serious
   public health concerns. Urban residents face higher health risks due to
   synergies betweenHWsand urban heat islands (UHIs) (i.e., UHIs are higher
   under HW conditions). However, the responses of urban and rural surface
   energy budgets to HW sare still largely unknown. This study analyzes
   observations from two flux towers in Beijing, China and reveals
   significant differences between the responses of urban and rural
   (cropland) ecosystems to HWs. It is found that UHIs increase
   significantly during HWs, especially during the nighttime, implying
   synergies betweenHWsand UHIs. Results indicate that the urban site
   receives more incoming shortwave radiation and longwave radiation due to
   HWs as compared to the rural site, resulting in a larger radiative
   energy input into the urban surface energy budget. Changes in turbulent
   heat fluxes also diverge strongly for the urban site and the rural site:
   latent heat fluxes increase more significantly at the rural site due to
   abundant available water, while sensible heat fluxes and possibly heat
   storage increase more at the urban site. These comparisons suggest that
   the contrasting responses of urban and rural surface energy budgets to
   HWs are responsible for the synergies betweenHWsand UHIs. As a result,
   urban mitigation and adaption strategies such as the use of green roofs
   and white roofs are needed in order to mitigate the impact of these
   synergies.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews more than 19 691 French historical documents from 14
   French archive centres. To assess data from historical documents, a
   method has been applied that leads to a record of 101 extreme storms
   with damage, including 38 coastal floods. Thus, the results show periods
   of increasing and decreasing storm frequency. These periods are examined
   Furthermore, coastal hazards have forced societies to adapt and develop
   specific skills, lifestyles and coping strategies. This paper analyses
   some responses of past societies to these hazards. By doing so, useful
   ideas may be (re)discovered by today's communities in order to enable us
   to adapt and develop resilience Similarly, a thorough knowledge of past
   meteorological hazards may allow our societies to recreate a link with
   territory, particularly through the (re)construction of an effective
   memory of these phenomena.},

Journal = {HEREDITY},

Volume = {120},

Pages = {138-153},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Invasive species exert a serious impact on native fauna and flora and
   have been the target of many eradication and management efforts
   worldwide. However, a lack of data on population structure and history,
   exacerbated by the recency of many species introductions, limits the
   efficiency with which such species can be kept at bay. In this study we
   generated a novel genome of high assembly quality and genotyped 4735
   genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers from 78
   individuals of an invasive population of the Javan Myna Acridotheres
   javanicus across the island of Singapore. We inferred limited population
   subdivision at a micro-geographic level, a genetic patch size (similar
   to 13-14 km) indicative of a pronounced dispersal ability, and barely an
   increase in effective population size since introduction despite an
   increase of four to five orders of magnitude in actual population size,
   suggesting that low population-genetic diversity following a bottleneck
   has not impeded establishment success. Landscape genomic analyses
   identified urban features, such as low-rise neighborhoods, that
   constitute pronounced barriers to gene flow. Based on our data, we
   consider an approach targeting the complete eradication of Javan Mynas
   across Singapore to be unfeasible. Instead, a mixed approach of
   localized mitigation measures taking into account urban geographic
   features and planning policy may be the most promising avenue to
   reducing the adverse impacts of this urban pest. Our study demonstrates
   how genomic methods can directly inform the management and control of
   invasive species, even in geographically limited datasets with high gene
   flow rates.},

Title = {Pulse disturbances in age-structured populations: Life history predicts
   initial impact and recovery time},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {91},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2370-2383},

Abstract = {Understanding population responses to discrete `pulsed' environmental
   disturbances is essential to conservation and adaptive management.
   Populations of concern can be driven to low levels by disturbance, and
   understanding interspecific differences in recovery trajectories is
   necessary for evaluating management options. We analysed single-species
   models to investigate the demographic and management factors determining
   the two components of population `resilience': the magnitude of initial
   impact on population abundance, and duration of the recovery time. We
   simulated age-structured populations with density-dependent recruitment,
   subjected to a pulse disturbance consisting of a period of increased
   mortality of either the juvenile age class or all age classes, and
   calculated both impact and return time. For illustration, we used
   demographic parameters from a suite of 16 fish species. We formulated
   the model as a renewal equation, allowing us to describe disturbance
   impacts mathematically as a convolution. We also included nonlinear
   dynamics, representing populations that recover to a steady state; this
   is more realistic (in most cases) than prior analyses of resilience in
   linear models without density-dependence. When the disturbance affected
   only one or a few young age-classes, longevity was the major
   life-history determinant of impact and recovery time. Shorter-lived
   species endured greater impacts when disturbed because each age class is
   a greater proportion of the population. However, shorter-lived species
   also had faster recovery times, for the same reason. When disturbance
   affected adult age-classes, the impact was more immediate and no longer
   affected by species' longevity, though the effect of longevity on
   recovery time remained. These results improve our understanding of
   interspecific differences in resilience and increase our ability to make
   predictions for adaptive management. Additionally, formulating the
   problem as a renewal equation and using mathematical convolutions allows
   us to quantify how disturbances with different time courses (not just an
   immediate, constant level of disturbance but gradually increasing or
   decreasing levels of disturbance) would have different effects on
   population resilience: delayed responses for species in which biomass is
   concentrated in older age classes, and for disturbances that become
   progressively more severe.},

Abstract = {This assessment of nine river catchments in Norway covers 20 years
   (1990-2009) of water quality data on total phosphorus (TP),
   orthophosphate, total nitrogen (TN), ammonium, nitrate, copper, zinc,
   cadmium, lead and nickel. The nine catchments are located from the south
   to the north of the country and are included in the Riverine Inputs and
   Direct Discharges (RID) programme of the OSPAR Commission for Protection
   of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic. The partial Mann
   Kendall test was used to evaluate long-term monotonic trends. For both
   TP and TN, decreasing trends (p < 5\%) were found in three out of nine
   rivers under study. Downward trends in riverine metal loads were found
   in 23 of 45 tests. Only one significant increasing trend in nutrient
   loads was found, and there were no upwards trends in metal loads. To
   some extent, the trends in riverine loads could be explained by trends
   in discharges from point sources. Even after taking potential sources of
   error into consideration, these results indicate that mitigation
   measures implemented since 1990 to reduce pressures from point sources
   have had an impact on water quality in Norwegian rivers.},

Title = {Drivers of flood-induced relocation among coastal urban residents:
   Insight from the US east coast},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {325},
Number = {A},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Many coastal urban areas are experiencing impacts of accelerated chronic
   and episodic flooding on the built environment and people's livelihoods
   and quality of life. These impacts sometimes exceed the households'
   adaptive and coping capacities to deal with flooding, prompting
   residents to consider relocation. It is unclear how urban dwellers
   living in flood-prone locations perceive this adaptation strategy and
   under what flood-driven circumstances they would consider permanently
   moving. This paper provides empirical evidence on relocation preferences
   among urban residents along the U.S. East Coast. It further explores how
   this decision is influenced by socioeconomic determinants, experiences
   with flood exposure, comprehensive concerns with flooding, and
   preferences for relocation destinations. We administered an online
   survey to 1450 residents living in flood-prone urban areas across
   multiple states, from New York to Florida, and analyzed the results
   using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show that almost
   half of respondents would consider relocating due to coastal flooding,
   with only 13 percent declining this option. The results show that age
   and race, several determinants of place attachment, problem-solving
   capacity, and flood-related household- and community-level concerns play
   a significant role in willingness to relocate.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out to examine the sanitary quality of overlying
   waters in an earthen pond containing African catfish (Clarias
   gariepinus) in both wet and dry seasons. Water samples were collected
   twice weekly at different times of the day (i.e., morning and afternoon)
   from the earthen pond in Akure, Nigeria in August, September 2016, and
   February, March 2017 (n = 48). Levels of faecal indicator bacteria were
   determined using membrane filtration method and physicochemical
   properties (such as temperature, pH, salinity etc.) of the overlying
   water samples were determined using standard methods. The results
   revealed that the concentration of E. coli in the overlying waters
   ranged from 0.78 to 1.40 Log(10) CFU 100 ml(-1) in morning samples and
   0.85 to 1.38 Log(10) CFU 100 ml(-1) in afternoon samples while the
   concentration of faecal coliforms in the overlying waters ranged from
   1.30 to 1.86 Log(10) CFU 100 ml(-1) in morning samples and 1.26 to 1.88
   Log(10) CFU 100 ml(-1) in afternoon samples. Faecal coliforms showed the
   highest prevalence in both seasons compared to E. coli and intestinal
   enterococci and their levels were greater in the wet periods than the
   dry periods. The findings from this study suggest that the sources of
   faecal contamination of the overlying waters in the earthen pond
   originate mainly from non-human sources and the adoption of microbial
   source tracking techniques would further elucidate the appropriate
   management and mitigation strategies to control faecal contamination of
   the overlying waters in the earthen pond especially for human health
   protection.},

Title = {Probabilistic cooperative mobile robot area coverage and its application
   to autonomous seabed mapping},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There are many applications that require mobile robots to autonomously
   cover an entire area with a sensor or end effector. The vast majority of
   the literature on this subject is focused on addressing path planning
   for area coverage under the assumption that the robot's pose is known or
   that error is bounded. In this work, we remove this assumption and
   develop a completely probabilistic representation of coverage. We show
   that coverage is guaranteed as long as the robot pose estimates are
   consistent, a much milder assumption than zero or bounded error. After
   formally connecting robot sensor uncertainty with area coverage, we
   propose an adaptive sliding window filter pose estimator that provides a
   close approximation to the full maximum a posteriori estimate with a
   computation cost that is bounded over time. Subsequently, an adaptive
   planning strategy is presented that automatically exploits conditions of
   low vehicle uncertainty to more efficiently cover an area. We further
   extend this approach to the multi-robot case where robots can
   communicate through a (possibly faulty and low-bandwidth) channel and
   make relative measurements of one another. In this case, area coverage
   is achieved more quickly since the uncertainty over the robots'
   trajectories is reduced. We apply the framework to the scenario of
   mapping an area of seabed with an autonomous underwater vehicle.
   Experimental results support the claim that our method achieves
   guaranteed complete coverage notwithstanding poor navigational sensors
   and that resulting path lengths required to cover the entire area are
   shortest using the proposed cooperative and adaptive approach.},

Title = {Effects of environmental variables on seedling distribution of rare and

Journal = {OPEN LIFE SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Because growth environment is affected by climate change, Dacrydium
   pierrei resources are becoming less and less. Therefore, understanding
   the effects of environmental variables on seedling-sapling distributions
   can help gain insight into changes in population recruitment in the
   context of climate change. The seedling-saplings distribution and
   variability of Dacrydium pierrei in environmental variables at
   Bawangling, Hainan, China, was surveyed over a 3-year period. In
   addition, laboratory experiments measuring the effects of soil moisture
   on seedling emergence were conducted to identify seedling development
   characteristics; principal component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian mixture
   model (GMM) were used to assess how different factors influenced
   Dacrydium pierrei seedlings-saplings distribution. The results
   demonstrated that the influence degree of seedling-sapling distribution
   is soil temperature>litter thickness>available phosphorus>canopy
   density>available potassium>nitrate nitrogen; a large number of
   seedling-saplings occurring at altitudes 1140-1300 m; a GMM trained with
   a C-2-L-3-H-4-A(5)-I-6 combination yielded an accuracy of 72.23\% in
   simulating seedling-saplings distribution; temperature and precipitation
   have strong impact on seedling-sapling distribution, with increasing
   soil moisture, seedling emergence shows a positive relationship. This
   study focuses more on developing a new method for research on the
   seedling-sapling distribution of Dacrydium pierrei to get reference for
   its adaptive management with the intense extreme climate change.},

Title = {Priority coral conservation areas under global warming in the Amami
   Islands, Southern Japan},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change. The Amami
   Islands in Southern Japan were selected as the study area. It is
   important to select areas that should be given priority for conservation
   and subsequently direct resources there. The objective of this study was
   to identify locations with low bleaching potential against future
   increases in water temperature, as well as high larval recruitment from
   other areas and high larval supply capacity to other areas based on
   connectivity. We simulated the coral bleaching rate and larval
   connectivity under historical (2000s) and future (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in
   the 2090s) climate conditions using a high-resolution (1/30 degrees x
   1/50 degrees) future ocean regional projection dataset. From the model
   simulation, coral bleaching did not occur in most areas in the 2000s.
   However, the bleaching frequency would increase significantly under
   RCP8.5 in the 2090s, and it is projected that mass coral bleaching
   events will occur in more than half of the years of that decade. Larval
   dispersion simulation shows that some particles released from the Amami
   Islands remain in the same area. However, fluctuations in both the sink
   strength and the source strength among the islands were larger than
   those within each island, and differences in connectivity between
   scenarios were not apparent. Grid cells that have a low bleaching rate
   and high potential for a larval sink and source under each scenario were
   selected. Since our results can identify priority conservation areas, it
   is important to conduct conservation and/or adaptation strategies
   according to the specific characteristics of each island.},

Abstract = {The increasing number of large-scale power outages caused by extreme
   weather events or other natural hazards raises the need for higher power
   system resilience. The impacts of cascading faults, one of the main
   mechanisms leading to disruptive events affecting hundreds of thousands
   of people, can be mitigated by intentionally sectionalizing the network
   into stable and self-adequate islands. However, there is only little
   research on the benefit of such preventive actions on power grid
   resilience. This paper presents a model for investigating the
   performance of a power network exposed to extreme weather events, and
   compares preventive islanding with different numbers of islands to a
   business-as-usual scenario. A suitable set of metrics is used in order
   to quantify resilience while taking into account preventive actions
   undertaken ahead of the event. The implementation of the model is tested
   and demonstrated in detail on a modified IEEE 30-bus network. The

   Philippines},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This research examines flood risk and adaption to it, including the
   possibility of out-migration, in two flood-prone coastal locations in
   the Philippines through the lens of Protection Motivation Theory. Much
   of the country is at risk of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise and
   from severe weather-related events. The data analyzed were obtained in
   2016 and 2018 from focus group discussions with local residents,
   individual interviews with local government officials, and field
   observations. Residents' and officials' reports reveal a number of
   consistent themes in both places and over time, with some important
   differences. Both locations were grappling with regular minor to
   moderate flooding in 2016, as well as with occasional severe flooding.
   Respondents reported serious economic, health, and safety threats
   associated with flooding events. Recent infrastructure improvements
   appear to have reduced routine flood risk in one location, but
   considerable risk from major storms remains in both places. While some
   housing has been abandoned because of flood damage, and while some
   better-off residents have moved away, most are not currently considering
   retreat as a near-term solution. Instead, most people are adapting in
   place and attempting to devise strategies to mitigate flood risk in
   their communities.},

Abstract = {Fishers operating on smaller scales are vulnerable to stressors at
   multiple temporal and spatial scales that drive change in marine
   social-ecological systems (SES). Apart from natural variability, the
   effects of anthropogenic change and developmental challenges add to
   complexity and uncertainty. Fishers need to proactively implement
   response strategies to achieve sustainable livelihoods and well-being.
   To do so, the impact and interplay of drivers of change within SES need
   to be better understood. Participant-led research was conducted with the
   crew who operate in the small-scale linefishery of the Southern Cape
   (South Africa) between 2014 and 2015. Fishers' perspectives were
   recorded using asurvey with 59 households. Specifically, the research
   seeks to establish what knowledge the crew of the linefishery hold of
   the drivers of change in their area of operation. The results offer an
   analysis focusing on the stressors in the natural system, social and
   economic (sub-)systems, policy and regulatory issues and insights into
   the fishers' attitude towards change and adaptation options. The
   research, complimenting previous research, contributes to the
   understanding of this SES by providing insights into this linefishery
   which needs to be accounted for when considering future responses to
   change.},

Title = {How adaptive capacity shapes the Adapt, React, Cope response to climate
   impacts: insights from small-scale fisheries},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {164},
Number = {1-2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As the impacts of climate change on human society accelerate, coastal
   communities are vulnerable to changing environmental conditions. The
   capacity of communities and households to respond to these changes
   (i.e., their adaptive capacity) will determine the impacts of climate
   and co-occurring stressors. To date, empirical evidence linking
   theoretical measures of adaptive capacity to community and household
   responses remains limited. Here, we conduct a global meta-analysis
   examining how metrics of adaptive capacity translate to human responses
   to change (Adapt, React, Cope response) in 22 small-scale fishing case
   studies from 20 countries (n=191 responses). Using both thematic and
   qualitative comparative analysis, we evaluate how responses to climate,
   environmental, and social change were influenced by domains of adaptive
   capacity. Our findings show that adaptive responses at the community
   level only occurred in situations where the community had Access to
   Assets, in combination with other domains including Diversity and
   Flexibility, Learning and Knowledge, and Natural Capital. In contrast,
   Access to Assets was nonessential for adaptive responses at the
   household level. Adaptive households demonstrated Diversity and
   Flexibility when supported by strong Governance or Institutions and were
   often able to substitute Learning and Knowledge and Natural Capital with
   one another. Standardized metrics of adaptive capacity are essential to
   designing effective policies promoting resilience in natural
   resource-dependent communities and understanding how social and
   ecological aspects of communities interact to influence responses. Our
   framework describes how small-scale fishing communities and households
   respond to environmental changes and can inform policies that support
   vulnerable populations.},

Abstract = {Tree allometric equations are critical tool for understanding carbon
   storage potential and develop strategic policies to mitigate climate
   change. This common testing may be applicable to the world mangroves
   particularly, the wild forests. The present study highlights the
   progress on mangrove allometry in solving the problems of site-specific
   and species-specific relationships. This included parameters like
   measuring diameter at breast height which is 1.3 m from base, tree
   height which is the ultimate height from base to tip of the tree and
   first-forking height which is the height of the tree from base to the
   first forking-to be included as independent variables with above-ground
   biomass and above-ground carbon as dependent variables in developing
   simple and multiple linear models. The inclusion of first-forking height
   in mangrove allometry is the first of its kind. In this study, the
   mangroves of Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary have shown a greater
   biomass than the Mahanadi estuary proving the fact that the conserved
   forests are in much better health conditions than those
   anthropogenically stressed area in the western Bay of Bengal. The 20
   best fit equations have been chosen as model equations with R-2 values
   greater than 0.90 both for Bhitarkanika and Mahanadi mangrove ecosystem.
   The above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon values have drawn
   attention towards forest bioenergy quantification and its importance of
   conservation in the growing demand for energy resources worldwide.},

Abstract = {Climate changes are predicted to drive changes in plant species
   composition and vegetation cover around the world. Preserved specimens
   and other botanical information that we gather today-a period future
   practitioners may look back on as an early stage of modern anthropogenic
   climate change-will be of value to conservation managers and
   conservation biologists in the decades and centuries ahead. Here, we
   present suggestions for the systematic collection, long-term curation
   (in museums, herbaria, and other research institutions), and maintenance
   of plant specimens, along with associated data and analyses on the
   plants and vegetation present today and in the past. The primary aim of
   this systematic survey is to provide information of high value to
   conservation researchers and managers both in the near term (the next
   several years) and through the century to come. Such a systematic survey
   would build on a strong foundation of research and adaptive management
   on the island. it would fill gaps in less well-studial groups of
   organisms and identify environmental, ecological, and cultural factors
   related to current patterns of distribution. it would also archive
   previously collected data, photographs, and other materials which would
   otherwise gradually degrade and become inaccessible. As a case study, we
   use Santa Cruz Island, California, which is managed for conservation. We
   are confident that the same approach may be applied to other lands and
   waters around the world. We argue that there is a particular need to
   collect and archive herbarium specimens and seeds from today's
   populations, activities largely overlooked in recent decades. We
   encourage conservation researchers and managers to consider what
   information will be most important for future managers and to help
   launch studies, monitoring programs, and collections to prepare their
   successors for success.},

Abstract = {Seasonal forecasting systems, and related systems for decadal
   prediction, are crucial in the development of adaptation strategies to
   climate change. However, despite important achievements in this area in
   the last 10 years, significant levels of skill are only generally found
   over regions strongly connected with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
   With the aim of improving the skill of regional climate predictions in
   tropical and extratropical regions from intraseasonal to interannual
   time scales, a new Met Office global seasonal forecasting system
   (GloSea4) has been developed. This new system has been designed to be
   flexible and easy to upgrade so it can be fully integrated within the
   Met Office model development infrastructure. Overall, the analysis here
   shows an improvement of GloSea4 when compared to its predecessor.
   However, there are exceptions, such as the increased model biases that
   contribute to degrade the skill of Nino-3.4 SST forecasts starting in
   November. Global ENSO teleconnections and Madden-Julian oscillation
   anomalies are well represented in GloSea4. Remote forcings of the North
   Atlantic Oscillation by ENSO and the quasi-biennial oscillation are
   captured albeit the anomalies are weaker than those found in
   observations. Hindcast length issues and their implications for seasonal
   forecasting are also discussed.},

Title = {Perceived Barriers to the Use of Assisted Colonization for Climate
   Sensitive Species in the Hawaiian Islands},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Conservation actions to safeguard climate change vulnerable species may
   not be utilized due to a variety of perceived barriers. Assisted
   colonization, the intentional movement and release of an organism
   outside its historical range, is one tool available for species
   predicted to lose habitat under future climate change scenarios,
   particularly for single island or single mountain range endemic species.
   Despite the existence of policies that allow for this action, to date,
   assisted colonization has rarely been utilized for species of
   conservation concern in the Hawaiian Islands. Given the potential for
   climate driven biodiversity loss, the Hawaiian Islands are a prime
   location for the consideration of adaptation strategies. We used
   first-person interviews with conservation decision makers, managers, and
   scientists who work with endangered species in the Hawaiian Islands to
   identify perceived barriers to the use of assisted colonization. We
   found that assisted colonization was often not considered or utilized
   due to a lack of expertize with translocations; ecological risk and
   uncertainty, economic constraints, concerns regarding policies and
   permitting, concerns with public perception, and institutional
   resistance. Therefore, conservation planners may benefit from decision
   tools that integrate risk and uncertainty into decision models, and
   compare potential outcomes among conservation actions under
   consideration, including assisted colonization. Within a decision
   framework that addresses concerns, all conservation actions for climate
   sensitive species, including assisted colonization, may be considered in
   a timely manner.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Climate change especially rising temperature in the urban areas has
   become a major focus of attention worldwide because of the impacts
   having on human beings, biodiversity, and urban ecosystem. Time series
   Landsat (TM and ETM+) satellite data products have been employed in this
   study to quantify the spatiotemporal Land Surface Temperature (LST) and
   Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity for the year of 2000, 2005, 2010 and
   2015, respectively. Biophysical characteristics of the city have been
   assessed through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
   Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference
   Bareness Index (NDBaI). The thermal behavior of the city varied
   distinctly. Seasonal LST and biophysical composition of the city has
   been analyzed to explore the temperature and greenness sensitivity
   across the city region. The per capita electricity consumption of the
   city was positively correlated with the surface LST for both summer and
   autumn/spring season. A relative brightness temperature approach was
   employed to examine the nature of UHI across the city. It is evident
   from the observation that the temperature is very high within the city
   core as well as certain surrounding areas of the city, especially on the
   southern side. The temperature is comparatively lower on the western
   side of the city than the eastern region. Certain peripheral regions,
   however, show a higher temperature. This can be due to the development
   taking place in the outer areas of the city and destruction of
   vegetation in the outlying parts of the city. Studied NDVI indicates
   that vegetation in the city is not balanced. It is high in the western
   part which maybe because of the locations of different academic
   institutions, botanical gardens, seminary hills, agricultural land, etc.
   Whereas, the eastern part is devoid of vegetation. Also, the areas in
   the periphery, especially near the airport and Ambajhari Lake, has very
   low vegetation. The bareness is also high in the peripheral regions.
   Result also shows that street-based heat intensity mitigation helps for
   urban planning.},

Title = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba: spatial distribution, abundance, and
   management of fisheries in a changing climate},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {668},
Pages = {185-214},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, a keystone species in the Southern
   Ocean, is highly relevant for studying effects of climate-related shifts
   on management systems. Krill provides a key link between primary
   producers and higher trophic levels and supports the largest regional
   fishery. Any major perturbation in the krill population would have
   severe ecological and economic ramifications. We review the literature
   to determine how climate change, in concert with other environmental
   changes, alters krill habitat, affects spatial distribution/abundance,
   and impacts fisheries management. Findings recently reported on the
   effects of climate change on krill distribution and abundance are
   inconsistent, however, raising questions regarding methods used to
   detect changes in density and biomass. One recent study reported a sharp
   decline in krill densities near their northern limit, accompanied by a
   poleward contraction in distribution in the Southwest Atlantic sector.
   Another recent study found no evidence of long-term decline in krill
   density or biomass and reported no evidence of a poleward shift in
   distribution. Moreover, with predicted decreases in phytoplankton
   production, vertical foraging migrations to the seabed may become more
   frequent, also impacting krill production and harvesting. Potentially
   cumulative impacts of climate change further compound the management
   challenge faced by CCAMLR, the organization responsible for conservation
   of Antarctic marine living resources: to detect changes in the
   abundance, distribution, and reproductive performance of krill and
   krill-dependent predator stocks and to respond to such change by
   adjusting its conservation measures. Based on CCAMLR reports and
   documents, we review the institutional framework, outline how climate
   change has been addressed within this organization, and examine the
   prospects for further advances toward ecosystem risk assessment and an
   adaptive management system.},

Abstract = {Many impacts projected for a global warming level of 2 degrees C
   relative to pre-industrial levels may exceed the coping capacities of
   particularly vulnerable countries. Therefore, many countries advocate
   limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees C. Here we analyse integrated
   energy-economy-environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5
   degrees C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios, energy-system
   transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 degrees C-consistent
   scenarios, but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most
   sectors, leading to observable differences in emission reductions in
   2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 degrees C-to a 1.5 degrees C-consistent
   world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO2. This
   implies an earlier transition to net zero carbon emissions worldwide, to
   be achieved between 2045 and 2060. Energy efficiency and stringent early
   reductions are key to retain a possibility for limiting warming to below
   1.5 degrees C by 2100. The window for achieving this goal is small and
   rapidly closing.},

Title = {Sandy coastlines under threat of erosion},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {260+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sandy beaches occupy more than one-third of the global coastline(1) and
   have high socioeconomic value related to recreation, tourism and
   ecosystem services(2). Beaches are the interface between land and ocean,
   providing coastal protection from marine storms and cyclones(3). However
   the presence of sandy beaches cannot be taken for granted, as they are
   under constant change, driven by meteorological(4,5), geological(6) and
   anthropogenic factors(1,7). A substantial proportion of the world's
   sandy coastline is already eroding(1,7), a situation that could be
   exacerbated by climate change(8,9). Here, we show that ambient trends in
   shoreline dynamics, combined with coastal recession driven by sea level
   rise, could result in the near extinction of almost half of the world's
   sandy beaches by the end of the century. Moderate GHG emission
   mitigation could prevent 40\% of shoreline retreat. Projected shoreline
   dynamics are dominated by sea level rise for the majority of sandy
   beaches, but in certain regions the erosive trend is counteracted by
   accretive ambient shoreline changes; for example, in the Amazon, East
   and Southeast Asia and the north tropical Pacific. A substantial
   proportion of the threatened sandy shorelines are in densely populated
   areas, underlining the need for the design and implementation of
   effective adaptive measures.
   Erosion is a major problem facing sandy beaches that will probably
   worsen with climate change and sea-level rise. Half the world's beaches,
   many of which are in densely populated areas, could disappear by the end
   of the century under current trends; mitigation could lessen retreat by
   40\%.},

Abstract = {Accuracy and mesh generation are key issues for the high-resolution
   hydrodynamic modelling of the whole Great Barrier Reef. Our objective is
   to generate suitable unstructured grids that can resolve topological and
   dynamical features like tidal jets and recirculation eddies in the wake
   of islands. A new strategy is suggested to refine the mesh in areas of
   interest taking into account the bathymetric field and an approximated
   distance to islands and reefs. Such a distance is obtained by solving an
   elliptic differential operator, with specific boundary conditions.
   Meshes produced illustrate both the validity and the efficiency of the
   adaptive strategy. Selection of refinement and geometrical parameters is

Abstract = {The eastward shift of semi-arid climate across South Africa is studied
   using satellite assimilated cloud cover, vegetation temperature and
   potential evaporation 1981-2019, and 21st century coupled model
   projections. Semi-arid thresholds over the plateau have shifted hundreds
   of kilometers eastward in the Vaal River catchment for potential
   evaporation, cloud fraction, and vegetation temperature. Coastal
   cloudiness has also changed due to sea breezes modified by shelf zone
   sea temperatures. Processes underlying the spread of semi-arid
   conditions across South Africa are quantified. Desiccation is related to
   greater westerly airflow, as the atmospheric boundary layer over the
   Kalahari preferentially links with the upper-level circulation. Warm dry
   spells and climate change enhance the meridional temperature gradient
   and accelerate the sub-tropical jet at both short- and long timescales.
   According to observations and reanalysis, dry westerlies prevail during
   the afternoon and induce +0.2 degrees C/year trends in vegetation
   temperature over the Highveld during the study period. Coupled model
   projections show that semi-arid conditions expand eastward from Bloemhof
   (25.5 degrees E) by 50,000 km(2), altering future adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {Climate-driven adaptive genetic variation is one of the most important
   ways for organisms to tolerate environmental change and succeed in
   altered environments. To understand rapid climate-driven evolution, and
   how this evolution might shift biogeographic distributions in response
   to global change, we measured the adaptive genetic variation to the
   local environment of a marine invasive species Mytilus
   galloprovincialis. The genetic structure of eight populations from the
   Mediterranean Sea, northeastern Atlantic, northeastern Pacific, and
   northwestern Pacific were determined using genome-wide screens for
   single nucleotide polymorphisms. The relationships of genetic variation
   to environmental (seawater and air) temperature were analyzed using
   redundancy analysis and BayeScEnv analysis to evaluate the impacts of
   temperature on the genetic divergences among these eight populations. We
   found that the genetic compositions were significantly different among
   populations and the adaptive genetic variation was associated with
   temperature variables. Further, we identified some genetic markers
   exhibiting signatures of divergent selection in association with
   environmental features that can be used in the future to closely monitor
   adaptive variation in this species. Our results suggest that divergent
   climatic factors have driven adaptive genetic variation in M.
   galloprovincialis over the past century. The rapid evolutionary
   adaptation has played a pivotal role in enabling this species to invade
   a wide range of thermal habitats successfully. Species like M.
   galloprovincialis that possess high levels of genetic variation may not
   only be especially capable of invading new habitats with different
   environmental conditions, but also poised to cope rapidly and
   successfully with rising global temperatures.},

Abstract = {Here we briefly review the major characteristics of the emerging
   pathogen Vibrio harveyi and discuss survival strategies and adaptation
   mechanisms underlying the capacity of this marine bacterium to thrive in
   natural and artificial aquatic settings. Recent studies suggest that
   some adaptation mechanisms can easily be acquired by V. harveyi and
   other members of the Vibrionaceae family owing to efficient horizontal
   gene transfer and elevated mutation rate. While discussing the main
   factors in charge of the expansion of Vibrio spp. habitats and
   concomitant spread of Vibrio-associated diseases under climate change,
   this review highlights the need for future studies able to address the
   joint impact of environmental and anthropogenic factors on the long-term
   dynamics and virulence of V. harveyi populations at the global scale.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article investigates the pathways linking environmental and
   economic drivers of rural-to-urban migration in Mozambique. Using
   examples from two rural-to-urban migrant communities located in the
   coastal city of Beira, we build on a generalizable migration framework
   (Black et al., 2011) in order to explore how perception and lived
   experience influence migration decision-making in contexts of
   environmental stress. We combine content analysis and descriptive
   statistics of semi-structured interview and household survey data. Using
   a decision-tree diagram to trace pathways linking experiences of adverse
   weather to migration, we evaluate the relative strength with which
   respondents attribute migration to weather-related factors. Qualitative
   findings reveal that (1) the weather's influence on migration falls on a
   spectrum of attribution, (2) while few migrants directly link their
   migration to weather-related factors, the overwhelming majority link
   weather to worsening economic conditions in origin areas, and (3)
   migrants reject the label of climate migrant, and maintain that
   migrating from rural areas is primarily an economic decision. Results
   indicate that people would stay in rural areas, regardless of extreme
   weather, if resilient economic livelihoods existed.},

Title = {Guidelines for cross-cultural Participatory Action Research
   partnerships: a case study of a customary seabird harvest in New Zealand},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Adaptive co-management and Participatory Action Research (PAR) promotes
   social ecological resilience by simultaneously protecting wildlife and
   its habitat and promoting capacity and motivation for sustainable
   harvest management by communities. We report here on a case study of
   learning through a partnership (1994-2009) between science and
   Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to determine the sustainability
   of titi (sooty shearwater, Puffinus griseus) harvests by Rakiura Maori
   in southern New Zealand. Testimony of Maori elders and titi harvesters
   (birders), members of the Rakiura Titi Islands Administering Body,
   researchers and participants in workshops and meetings were recorded
   throughout the 14-year research project to identify critical
   determinants of success of the partnership. A large majority of
   participants supported the research, mainly because it expanded their
   knowledge by investigating the reasons for declining bird numbers and
   the means of ensuring the continuation of their muttonbirding heritage.
   Initial concerns about the research included fear that prohibition or
   quota would be imposed through political pressure from external groups;
   the intrusion of strangers on the islands; the misconception that the
   research was being promulgated by government regulatory agencies; and
   scepticism about research findings. Research also precipitated conflict
   and division within the Rakiura community, and some birders feared that
   science might displace matauranga Maori (TEK) of the Rakiura people for
   guiding harvest management. Core conditions for community engagement
   included trust between parties, effective communication of the science,
   equitable decision-making responsibility, and building scientific
   capability and monetary support to enable meaningful participation. The
   most fundamental requirement is mutual respect for each party's
   knowledge. Attention to this inclusive, equitable, slow and prolonged
   process makes it more likely that the community will uptake results to
   improve sustainability of harvesting. The research has heightened
   awareness within the harvesting community of conservation issues facing
   the titi and of potential options to mitigate them. Eradication or
   control of weka (Gallirallus australis), and reducing titi harvest
   levels from around a quarter of the manu (family birding territories),
   are the main practical ways of increasing sustainability, but the
   magnitude and direction of climate change impacts on the shearwater
   population remains uncertain.},

Funding-Text = {We would especially like to thank the interviewees and wider Rakiura
   Maori community who so generously gave their time and knowledge to help
   and engage in this research effort in so many different ways (e.g.,
   sharing matauranga, peer review, hosting researchers, providing
   historical data, contributing to Titi Times). There were also many other
   researchers and especially students that forged and furthered the Kia
   Mau Te Titi Mau Ake Tonu Atu research project and who thereby
   contributed to learning the lessons we have summarised here, including:
   Josh Adams, Kristin Charleton, Tina De Cruz, Alex Gilks, Sheryl
   Hamilton, Grant Harper, Christine Hunter, Chris Jones, Hannah Nevins,
   Detta Russell, Paul Scofield, Ilka Sohle, Sebastian Uhlmann, Malcolm
   Rutherford, Grant Blackwell and Suzanne Bassett. The families of the
   principal researchers in the Titi Project have supported the project
   enormously throughout by putting up with the prolonged absences, travel
   to hui and exhaustion of their partners. Scores of volunteers in the
   science team and hours of practical field assistance by the birders
   themselves got the field work done. Throughout we have been guided and
   inspired by science mentorship provided by Christopher Robertson and
   cultural mentorship by Rau Kirikiri (Te Whanau o Apanui) and by Graham
   Metzger and Jane Davis (both of Kai Tahu). Mere Roberts also made a
   special and unique contribution by guiding us both on science and
   cultural matters. The current members of the RTIC and RTIAB that have
   co-directed this research and now co-authored this overview include:
   Margaret Bragg, Ron Bull, Stuart Bull, Jane Davis, Tane Davis, Arnold
   Kelland, Paul Lee, Lesley Rewi, Michael Skerrett, and Morrison Trow.
   Past members of RTIC and RTIAB that assisted in research direction were
   Mhari Batty, Gypsy Fyfe, Paddy Gilroy, Julian McKay and Shane McManus.
   Apart from the current and past members of the RTIAB, there were
   particular individuals within the Rakiura Community who played a crucial
   role in establishing and guiding the research project, including Jim
   Bull, Graham Metzger, George Te Au and Johnny Wixon. Initial guidance
   and facilitation of the research teams' process in establishing the
   project by Matapura Ellison (Kaupapa Atawhai Manager with the Department
   of Conservation) was crucial. The surveys and interviews were authorised
   by the University of Otago Ethics Committee. Jeremy Carrol, Greg Lind,
   Pete McClelland and Andy Norris from the Department of Conservation's
   ``Southern Islands{''} team offered considerable ecological advice and
   administrative and permitting support throughout. Apama Lai made several
   useful criticisms of an earlier draft of this manuscript and helped
   format it and the references. The manuscript benefited greatly from
   refereeing by Hemi Whaanga and Priscilla Wehi. The Kia Mau Te Titi Mo
   Ake Tonu Atu project was funded mainly by a Public Good Science Fund
   grant from the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science \&
   Technology to Rakiura Maori for 12 of its 14 years. FRST's trust,
   long-term support, and flexible administrative arrangements to reflect
   the mana of the participating community have been pivotal to allow the
   completion of a research project that was inherently difficult because
   of the long-lived nature of seabirds, their inter-annual variation and
   the expense and logistical challenges of study on remote offshore
   islands. Generous additional financial and logistic support for the
   overall project has been given by the University of Otago-this
   partnership was a learning curve for the university just as for Rakiura
   Maori.; Many officials and managers within the university coped well and
   were flexible when the requirements of this study stretched their
   systems and previous ways of managing science. New Zealand Aluminium
   Smelters Ltd, Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu and South West Helicopters provided
   additional financial and practical help. The Rakiura Titi Islands
   Administering Body and contributing scientists are especially grateful
   to the New Zealand Journal of Zoology and its editor, Carolyn (Kim) King
   for featuring our project, and for superb editorial support and
   patience.},

   since the efficiency and effectiveness of energy conservation measures
   over time can be highly affected by climate change. In this vein, the
   paper applies a multi-stage, multi-objective approach to find robust
   cost-optimal energy retrofit solutions and to assess their resilience to
   global warming. The approach combines the software EnergyPlus and MATLAB
   (R) to implement an optimization genetic algorithm and a smart research
   strategy. This framework allows to explore a huge solution domain by
   investigating sundry performance indicators, such as energy needs,
   polluting emissions and global costs, thereby ensuring a robust
   assessment of cost-optimality. Different cost-optimal retrofit solutions
   are found for different global warming and economic scenarios. Finally,
   a careful decision-making is performed to identify a recommended
   solution that provides the highest resilience to the cited scenarios,
   yielding the best trade-off among energy, environmental and economic
   performances. The approach is applied to a typical Mediterranean
   building, located in South Italy. The recommended solution includes the
   energy retrofit of the whole building envelope and the replacement of
   energy systems. It requires an investment around 100(sic)/m(2) and, in
   most scenarios, produces high potential benefits in terms of primary
   energy savings (42 44 kWh/m(2)a), polluting emission reductions
   (11.5/12.0 kgCO(2)-eq/m(2)a) and global cost savings (5/78 (sic)/m(2)).

   Climate Change in Lisbon},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The increase and optimization of urban vegetation has been considered an
   effective mitigation measure of an urban heat island (UHI), with
   positive effects on human thermal comfort. In this study, the cooling
   potential of all green spaces in Lisbon was estimated. For that, several
   mobile measurements of air temperature data were made in a single park
   (Gulbenkian's Garden). These measurements were used for the
   interpolation of air temperature. Furthermore, urban biomass was
   estimated using remote sensing products, namely Landsat satellite
   images. Ultimately, a linear regression model was built from the
   relation between vegetation density and air temperature. Results
   regarding the estimation of biomass (AGB) in the city of Lisbon were
   higher in winter than in summer. The urban green spaces cooling
   potential model showed that for every decrease of 1 degrees C in air
   temperature between a measuring point and a reference station we need to
   increase the area covered by vegetation by 50 m(2) (planar measure).
   This methodology can be applied in other urban areas for the
   quantification of the cooling effect provided by vegetation in order to
   improve urban climate thermal conditions and human well-being and,
   consequently, to mitigate some consequences of future climate change.},

Title = {Understanding risks in the light of uncertainty: low-probability,
   high-impact coastal events in cities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A quantification of present and future mean annual losses due to extreme
   coastal events can be crucial for adequate decision making on adaptation
   to climate change in coastal areas around the globe. However, this
   approach is limited when uncertainty needs to be accounted for. In this
   paper, we assess coastal flood risk from sea-level rise and extreme
   events in 120 major cities around the world using an alternative
   stochastic approach that accounts for uncertainty. Probability
   distributions of future relative (local) sea-level rise have been used
   for each city, under three IPPC emission scenarios, RCP 2.6, 4.5 and
   8.5. The approach allows a continuous stochastic function to be built to
   assess yearly evolution of damages from 2030 to 2100. Additionally, we
   present two risk measures that put low-probability, high-damage events
   in the spotlight: the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall
   (ES), which enable the damages to be estimated when a certain risk level
   is exceeded. This level of acceptable risk can be defined involving
   different stakeholders to guide progressive adaptation strategies. The
   method presented here is new in the field of economics of adaptation and
   offers a much broader picture of the challenges related to dealing with
   climate impacts. Furthermore, it can be applied to assess not only
   adaptation needs but also to put adaptation into a timeframe in each
   city.},

Abstract = {We examine how residents of Nawairuku, an interior village in Ra, Fiji,
   are experiencing and responding to recent social and ecological changes.
   An analysis of data collected using semi-structured interviews with 27
   households reveals that household adaptability - the ability or capacity
   to adapt to the impacts of climatic variations - depends on access to
   livelihood assets. All households have access to social capital through
   familial networks, which lessens the burden of extreme weather events,
   namely cyclones and flooding. Households with access to tangible assets
   such as land and the equipment and resources to utilize it, together
   with intangible assets like motivation and knowledge are better
   positioned to adapt their agricultural practices to changing climatic
   conditions. Households headed by a capable individual were also better
   positioned to adapt. We conclude that remoteness promotes
   self-sufficiency and initiative, and access to livelihood assets
   influences household capacity to adapt.},

Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is a climate effect that magnifies air
   temperature in cities. In the US it affects over 80\% of the population
   and in general is considered an adverse phenomenon with externalities
   ranging from increased air pollution to higher energy demand and
   deteriorated human comfort. Therefore, UHI and its mitigation strategies
   have been studied extensively to focus on hot summer months and demand
   for cooling energy. However, current approaches fail to recognize that
   for regions in cold climates UHI may be a positive phenomenon with
   benefits from decreased heating energy demand exceeding downsides of
   higher cooling energy demand. Here, for the period of 12 years we
   analyze for 48 US states the cost that UHI imposes on the \$120B
   residential market with CO2 emissions that exceed 550 M tons each year.
   While for states situated in warm climates UHI significantly increases
   the energy bill, due to varying heating and cooling costs and emissions
   associated with generation of energy, for some regions located in cold
   climates, UHI significantly reduces energy demand and carbon emissions.
   This information will help legislators and policy makers understand
   better energy demand of buildings and subsequently reduce their carbon
   footprint at city and state levels.},

Abstract = {The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of the
   Pacific food system to externalities and has had far-reaching impacts,
   despite the small number of COVID-19 cases recorded thus far. Measures
   adopted to mitigate risk from the pandemic have had severe impacts on
   tourism, remittances, and international trade, among other aspects of
   the political economy of the region, and are thus impacting on food
   systems, food security and livelihoods. Of particular concern will be
   the interplay between loss of incomes and the availability and
   affordability of local and imported foods. In this paper, we examine
   some of the key pathways of impact on food systems, and identify
   opportunities to strengthen Pacific food systems during these
   challenging times. The great diversity among Pacific Island Countries
   and Territories in their economies, societies, and agricultural
   potential will be an important guide to planning interventions and
   developing scenarios of alternative futures. Bolstering regional
   production and intraregional trade in a currently import-dependent
   region could strengthen the regional economy, and provide the health
   benefits of consuming locally produced and harvested fresh foods - as
   well as decreasing reliance on global supply chains. However,
   significant production, processing, and storage challenges remain and
   would need to be consistently overcome to influence a move away from
   shelf-stable foods, particularly during periods when human movement is
   restricted and during post-disaster recovery.},

Abstract = {This paper describes coastal resilience as a measure of the extent to
   which a coast is able to respond to external pressures without losing
   actual or potential functions. Such usage of the term gives coastal
   scientists, planners and managers a new opportunity to express complex
   coastal dynamics in a simple aggregated form. Coastal resilience has
   morphological, ecological and socio-economic components, each of which
   represents another aspect of the coastal system's adaptive capacity to
   perturbations. Enhancing coastal resilience is increasingly viewed as a
   cost-effective way to prepare for uncertain future changes while
   maintaining opportunities for coastal development. The Netherlands has
   known a long tradition of controlling natural coastal processes by
   stringent dune management and building hard sea-defence structures.
   However, both socio-economic and natural adaptive processes have become
   constrained owing to the limited availability of land and the diminished
   coastal resilience that has resulted from technological solutions and
   legal provisions. The recent study Growing with the Sea proposes to
   restore natural coastal processes along the Dutch coast and let natural
   and socio-economic systems interact more dynamically. It explores
   possibilities of enhancing coastal resilience in The Netherlands by
   allowing managed retreat in areas where it is environmentally acceptable
   and reclaiming land in other areas.},

Abstract = {Changes in environmental conditions influence vulnerability due to
   interacting stresses and pressures across the nations and regions.
   Coastal resources are under severe stress due to climate change, growing
   trade and commerce, and the human population depends on them. The
   coastal vulnerability to changing climatic variables has created a major
   concern at regional, national and global scales. The present model study
   assessed the coastal vulnerability of the densely populated districts in
   South India, which are prone to extreme climatic events at a higher
   frequency. The seven crucial influencing variables that have been
   selected for the study were sea-level rise, coastal elevation, coastal
   slope, extreme rainy days, historical shoreline change, tidal range, and
   geomorphology. The identified variables were ranked by relative
   importance and linked by weightage using analytical hierarchy
   process-based uncertainty analysis. Mapped and reclassified variables
   have been integrated to derive the overall vulnerability using
   geospatial techniques. The study shows that the coast has experienced
   high vulnerability to SLR impact, extreme rainfall, geomorphology, and
   elevation; medium vulnerability to the shoreline change and least
   vulnerable to coastal slope and tidal range. Of the coastal regions
   studied, 29\% and 14.3\% had high vulnerability; 70.5\% and 85.7\% had
   medium vulnerability in the two selected densely populated districts
   (Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur District). Applying geospatial techniques
   to assess the environmental vulnerability resulted in reliable and
   informative maps which will serve as a model to determine the critical
   coastal regions to plan for the conservation and adaptation measures.},

Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper demonstrates pathways for building on the resources,
   networks, and latent capacities of urban informality to enhance the
   climate resilience of urban systems, using post-disaster case study
   research from two Pacific Small Island Developing States to illustrate
   conceptual and practical opportunities for urban planning to engage
   constructively with endogenous resilience. Semi-structured qualitative
   interviews with informal settlement households (n = 57) and
   institutional representatives (n = 26) were used to identify informal
   modes of resilience, with secondary analysis of institutional projects
   and spatially-differentiated socio-economic data being integrated with
   these primary datasets. Findings demonstrate important distinctions in
   sub-city scales of resilience relating to values and equity within
   socio-ecological resilience research that have not been extensively
   studied to date. These case study observations have implications for
   understandings of `core' systems functions, which are critical for
   planning communities when conceptualising resilience at a metropolitan
   level. Sub-city analysis also highlights aspects of urban resilience not
   previously identified in practice elsewhere, with informal maintenance
   of ecosystem services, use of kinship and familial networks, and
   translocation of traditional knowledge providing opportunities for
   enhancing urban climate change adaptation and climate resilient
   development initiatives.},

Abstract = {As confirmed by the extreme tsunami events over the last decade (the
   2004 Indian Ocean, 2010 Chile and 2011 Japan tsunami events), mitigation
   measures and effective evacuation planning are needed to reduce disaster
   risks. Modeling tsunami evacuations is an alternative means to analyze
   evacuation plans and possible scenarios of evacuees' behaviors. In this
   paper, practical applications of an agent-based tsunami evacuation model
   are presented to demonstrate the contributions that agent-based modeling
   has added to tsunami evacuation simulations and tsunami mitigation
   efforts. A brief review of previous agent-based evacuation models in the
   literature is given to highlight recent progress in agent-based methods.
   Finally, challenges are noted for bridging gaps between geoscience and
   social science within the agent-based approach for modeling tsunami
   evacuations.},

Title = {Local environment prevails over population variations in growth-climate
   relationships of Pinus pinaster provenances},
Journal = {DENDROCHRONOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In view of the projected decrease in precipitation and increase in
   temperature, a better understanding on growthclimate responses in
   different populations of tree species is needed to improve and enhance
   the conservation and management strategies for major forest tree
   species. In this study, we assessed differences in growth traits (i.e.,
   stem diameter, tree height, and stem radial growth) and analysed
   climate-growth relationships in five provenances of maritime pine (Pinus
   pinaster Ait.) grown in four replicated common gardens in Sardinia
   (Italy). Stem radial growth increased under a positive water balance in
   late winter and early spring. Conversely, high temperature and low
   precipitation in summer had a negative impact on stem radial growth. At
   age 40, none of the considered provenances (Portugal, Corsica, Tuscany,
   Sardinia-Telti, Sardinia-Limbara) showed a substantial advantage in more
   than one common garden site for tree height and stem diameter.
   Nevertheless, differences were found among common garden sites in terms
   of dendrometric parameters, stem radial growth, and growthclimate
   responses (including sensitivity to summer drought), suggesting a
   greater site dependent over tree growth. Although in juvenile stages the
   Portuguese provenance (in particular) showed greater growth than the
   Sardinian ones, this study showed that, with tree age, the differences
   among the five provenances tends to narrow. Therefore, irrespective of
   the seed source, tree growth patterns and growth-climate responses were
   similar at age 40. This result can be important for implementing forest
   management strategies to balance adaptation and mitigation potential of
   maritime pine plantations in harsh environmental conditions.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirement of date palms
   under future salinity trend in coastal aquifer of Tunisian oasis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {228},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {In coastal saline areas, many studies ignore salinity problems when
   quantifying the impacts of climate change on irrigation water
   requirement. Based on 11 years (2008-2018) of field investigations in a
   Tunisian coastal oasis, this study simulated the changes in salinity in
   a coastal aquifer and quantified changes in net irrigation requirement
   (NIR) of date palm under climate change, considering required changes in
   leaching requirement. The future salinity in the aquifer was simulated
   based on sea level rise and changes in aquifer recharge. The study
   applied a statistical downscaling model (SDSM) to project future climate
   variables from 2019 to 2050, the SUTRA model to evaluate the change in
   aquifer salinity, and applied CROPWAT software to calculate NIR. Three
   climate change scenarios were considered: RCP8.5 (very high emission
   scenario), RCP6.0 (medium emission scenario) and RCP4.5 (lowest emission
   scenario). Several useful finding were revealed in this study. First,
   these three climate change scenarios showed significant trend of
   increasing annual maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity,
   wind speed, and solar radiation, and a significant decreasing trend of
   future rainfall. Second, the average aquifer salinity is expected to
   increase from an average of 4.2 dS m(-1) in 2018 to about 5.3 dS m(-1)
   in 2050. Seawater intrusion was identified as the main cause for this
   remarkable increase. Finally, NIR is expected to increase from an
   average value of 1459 mm year(-1) during 2008-2018 to 1473-1950 mm
   year(-1) during 2019-2050, depending on climate change scenario applied.
   Increase in aquifer salinity significantly contributed to this rapid
   increase of NIR. We believe that our results should be considered in
   developing adaptation strategies to manage future water resources in
   coastal areas.},

Abstract = {Human impacts on marine fisheries go back many centuries or even
   thousands of years in some coastal areas. Full global exploitation of
   the most productive fish stocks probably occurred around 1990. Many
   stocks have been overexploited and the assessment and management
   required to rein this in and to combat other human pressures, such as
   pollution, has been slow to mature, but is showing positive trends. The
   need to protect marine ecosystems for their intrinsic value and for the
   services they provide has also been recognised and is being embodied in
   legislation and turned into operational tools. As with terrestrial
   systems, it will not be easy to find acceptable balances between food
   production and conservation objectives. Climate change imposes a new set
   of pressures on marine ecosystems; increasing temperature, reduced
   salinity in some enclosed seas and coastal areas, changing windfields
   and seasonality, acidification, deoxygenation and rising sea level will
   all affect the productivity and distribution of marine life. We can
   detect some of the consequences already but prediction is very difficult
   for a variety of reasons. In spite of these difficulties it is possible
   to map out robust guidance on the kind of research that will help us to
   adapt and on the development of practices and management that will
   insure against future change.},

Abstract = {Purpose Urban built-up has been increasing exponentially in the world.
   Urban population growth and migration are depleting the land resources
   and creating thermal discomfort. Cities all around the world are facing
   urban heat island effects and increased temperatures. This study aims to
   map land cover and formulate local climate zones for enhancing urban
   resilience against disaster and climate risks.
   Design/methodology/approach This study uses exploratory research to
   identify local climate zones for Lahore, Pakistan. Landsat 8 imagery was
   used to develop a land use land cover map. For mapping local climate
   zones, the standard World Urban and Access Portal Tool procedure was
   used. Findings Results have revealed that Lahore has grown
   exponentially. Compact low rise and open low rise were the two most
   common local climate zones prevalent in the city. In contrast, the outer
   regions of the city consisted of LCZ D (low plants) and LCZ F (bare
   soil). Practical implications This study highlights the need to consider
   local climate zones in future development plans and policies for
   ensuring sustainable, resilient and climate-friendly cities.
   Originality/value Local climate zone studies are missing in Pakistan.
   This study has empirically analyzed the ground situation of local
   climate zones for Lahore metropolitan city. This study will provide
   baseline support for future studies on urban heat island and climate
   change adaptation planning.},

Title = {Physiological responses and adaptive strategies to acute low-salinity
   environmental stress of the euryhaline marine fish black seabream
   (Acanthopagrus schlegelii)},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {554},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {The physiological metabolism of marine animals farmed in coastal areas
   is influenced greatly by extreme weather and frequent aqueous layer
   exchange, with short or long periods of heavy rain reducing seawater
   salinity. Black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) is a euryhaline
   fish, that are farmed in China under both normal/ambient salinity in
   seawater cages and low salinity conditions in pond culture. To explore
   the effects of an acute change in salinity on physiological metabolism,
   juvenile black seabream (weight 19.80 +/- 0.37 g) was subjected to low
   salinity (4-5 psu) over five time points including 1 h (H1), 6 h (H6),
   12 h (H12), 24 h (H24) and one week (W), with 0 h (initial, natural
   salinity of 22 psu) as control group. Results indicated that acute
   exposure to low-salinity resulted in various responses related to
   oxidative stress (OS) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). The key
   markers of OS including reactive oxygen species and malonaldehyde were
   significantly increased with acute salinity stress up to 6 h, then
   decreased to return to normal levels. A similar pattern was recorded for
   total antioxidant capacity, which showed significantly higher activity
   in the H6 group. All parameters related to ERS increased with duration
   of the low-salinity stress, which stimulated expression of key genes
   including nuclear factor kappa B (nf-(K)b) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase
   (jnk), triggering inflammation and apoptosis. However, total apoptotic
   cell rate decreased markedly as the duration of salinity stress
   increased up to one week. Gill expression of genes of long-chain
   polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis was up-regulated by
   low salinity stress with levels of docosahexaenoic (DHA),
   eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and arachidonic acids (ARA) being highest in the
   H12 group, which positively contributed to enhanced ability of
   osmoregulation. In conclusion, acute low-salinity stress stimulated
   various stress responses but, as the duration of salinity stress
   increased, the fish showed signs of physiological adaptation to the
   environmental change. During the adaptive process to maintain hemolymph
   osmotic pressure regulation, LC-PUFA were rapidly enriched in gill,
   which might be a crucial strategy allowing A. schlegelii to adapt to
   low-salinity stress. These findings provided further insight and
   understanding of the physiological responses and underlying adaptive
   strategy of euryhaline fish to salinity stress, and confirmed time
   dependent effects.},

Title = {Rethinking marine infrastructure policy and practice: Insights from
   three large-scale marina developments in Seattle},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {67-82},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The global transformation of the marine nearshore is generating profound
   losses of ecological and geomorphological functions and ecosystem
   services, as natural environments are replaced with built. With
   conservation a diminishing option and restoration often unrealistic,
   there is a need to rethink development and the potential for marine
   infrastructure to contribute to net environmental gain. Through analysis
   of 150 years of change associated with the development of three
   large-scale marinas in the Seattle area, this research identifies the
   ways in which evolving policy frameworks and ecological understanding
   determine the nature, efficiency and environmental outcomes of coastal
   marine developments. Decisions on infrastructure design, mitigation
   strategies and policy interpretations directly determined the ecological
   fate of marine biota inhabiting these structures as well as surrounding
   ecosystems. In spite of increasing evidence of environmental legislation
   driving mitigation and innovative engineering, the net ecological
   trajectories remained negative. There were no tested demonstrations of
   marine mitigation to confirm which measures would succeed. Where
   scientific understanding existed, the uptake into planning and
   legislation was slow. More broadly, this research highlights a need and
   opportunity to consider marine infrastructure as living laboratories to
   inform a policy shift from a no-net-loss paradigm to
   net-environmental-gain. This evolution is timely, with sea level rise
   requiring new approaches to coastal defenses and with marine energy
   infrastructure increasingly being located offshore, where there is
   little knowledge of the ecological changes occurring in both time and
   space. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {It is important to understand the effects of higher levels of market
   participation on the resilience of mixed-subsistence communities to
   climate change. Climate models predict that the Pacific Islands and
   other regions with mixed-subsistence communities will experience
   increased climate variability, including more frequent cyclones and
   prolonged droughts. Authors suggest that development agencies should
   help to increase levels of household market participation, or the
   proportion of household output that is marketable, in rural communities
   because those households with more financial assets are better equipped
   to respond to climatic disturbances {[}Pettengell, C., \& Oxfram, P. G.
   (2010). Climate change adaptation: Enabling people living in poverty to
   adapt. Oxfram International Research Report.]. Other authors suggest
   that, because all socio-ecological systems are inherently vulnerable,
   increasing financial assets may not reduce the vulnerabilities of rural
   communities to natural hazards {[}Lauer, M., Albert, S., Aswani, S.,
   Halpern, B. S., Campanella, L., \& Rose, D. L. (2013). Globalization,
   Pacific Islands, and the paradox of resilience. Global Environmental
   Change, 23, 40-0]. Likewise, authors claim that food-sharing and other
   forms of social capital are more important to the resilience of
   mixed-subsistence communities to climate change than are financial
   assets {[}Smit, B., \& Wandel, J. (2006). Adaptation, adaptive capacity
   and vulnerability. Global Environmental Change, 16, 282-292]. This
   article demonstrates that higher levels of household market
   participation are not associated with smaller social networks in Samoa,
   which shows that households in mixed- subsistence communities that are
   more engaged in the market do not necessarily have less social capital
   than others. The article also demonstrates that social institutions
   shape the relationships among variables of community-perceived adaptive
   capacity. Future policy changes and other adaptations that satisfy an
   increased demand for cash may ultimately reduce local-level resilience.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {194},

Abstract = {Proper understanding of patterns, distribution and changes in rainfall
   onset dates (ROD), rainfall cessation dates (RCD) and lengths of growing
   seasons (LGS) is crucial for agricultural planning, adaptation
   strategies and food security in Nigeria. This study determines the
   spatial and temporal changes and examines the relationships among these
   rainfall attributes in addition to possible synoptic connectivity
   amongst measurement stations. The data used consist of time series of
   daily rainfall between 1971 and 2005. ROD and RCD were determined using
   rainfall-based methods proposed and commonly used in Nigeria. The
   results show that the mean ROD, RCD and LGS have zonal distributions
   over Nigeria. Onset dates are delayed from the coast northward leading
   to shorter LGS in those stations. Variability is generally high below 8
   degrees N with coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 13 to 36\% for
   ROD; 3-12\% for RCD and 8-17\% for LGS. In the middle belt (8-11 degrees
   N), spatially CV showed values ranging from 10 to 20\% for ROD; 3-8\%
   for RCD and 8-21\% for LGS. In the Sahel (above 11 degrees N), rains
   come later in the year and CV showed values ranging from 2 to 9\% for
   ROD; 2-3\% for RCD and 12-30\% for LGS. Similarly, of the entire
   Nigeria, 34.8\% and 50.0\% exhibit earlier RODs and shorter LGS. Whereas
   in 40.6\% and 68.8\% of the stations, delayed RCDs and higher SPI
   (standardized precipitation index) were observed. The observed
   association between LGS and ROD was very strong, which may be explored
   to predict potential LGS. Results from the principal component analysis
   showed that about ten components contain information on possible
   geo-environmental processes behind variability in onset and cessation
   across all the synoptic stations of Nigeria. The signatures of SST, ITD
   and other features of monsoon systems including large scale forcings of
   SOI and NAO are discussed together with the implications of the changes
   in the rainfall attributes examined. This information could provide
   baseline data for development of appropriate local to zonal adaptation
   measures as well as future studies related to climate change impacts on
   rainfall attributes considered in this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Global climate change may detrimentally affect future generations of
   numerous forest tree species, hampering their long-term sustainability
   if appropriate evolutionary responses remain lacking. To face these
   novel threats, conservation biologists are in need of a thorough
   understanding and identification of adaptive variation in key fitness
   traits. We here provide an elaborate synthesis of pre-existing and novel
   analyses of an association mapping, genecological and landscape genomic
   study integrating genotypic, environmental and phenotypic data to gain
   insights into the genetic basis of cold-hardiness adaptation in coastal
   Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii). Data were collected
   across part of the natural range for a total of 643 individuals. A
   landscape genomic approach revealed 28 putative non-neutral genes,
   although a variance partitioning analysis indicated only moderate power
   of this gene set in explaining cold-hardiness-related phenotypic
   variation, and suggests many important genes await discovery.
   Integrating these results within the entire
   phenotypegenotype-environment spectrum allowed us to delineate the six
   most promising candidate genes under selection. By combining genomic,
   phenotypic and environmental data, this study attempts to gain insights
   in the genetic basis of key adaptations, which may ultimately aid
   forestry managers to establish resilient ecosystems in face of future
   climate change.},

Title = {Are private defensive expenditures against storm damages affected by

Abstract = {This paper introduces a household model of private investment in storm
   protection under an endogenous risk framework to determine how defensive
   self-protection and self-insurance expenditures by coastal households to
   mitigate storm-inflicted damages are affected by the availability of
   public programs and the presence of a mangrove forest. The theoretical
   results show that publicly constructed physical barriers and mangroves
   encourage self-protection but discourage self-insurance expenditures.
   However, public disaster relief and rehabilitation programs lead to the
   crowding-out of self-protection but the crowding-in of self-insurance.
   Our empirical analysis of coastal households in Bangladesh impacted by
   Cyclone Sidr reveals partial support for the crowding-out and
   crowding-in effects of public investments and programs. Households
   located in a mangrove-protected area invest more in self-protection and
   less in self-insurance. Other controls, such as household socio-economic
   characteristics, also influence and add a degree of complexity to the
   relationship.},

   Adriatic Sea (Croatia)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Adriatic Sea and its coastal region have experienced significant
   environmental changes in recent decades, aggravated by climate change.
   The most prominent effects of climate change (namely, an increase in sea
   surface and air temperature together with changes in the precipitation
   regime) could have an adverse effect on social and environmental
   processes. In this study, we analyzed the time series of sea surface
   temperature and air temperature measured at three meteorological
   stations in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea. To assess the trends
   and variations in the time series of sea surface and air temperature,
   different statistical methods were employed, i.e., linear and quadratic
   regressions, Mann-Kendall test, Rescaled Adjusted Partial Sums method,
   and autocorrelation. The results evidenced increasing trends in the mean
   annual sea surface temperature and air temperature; furthermore, sudden
   variations in values were observed in 1998 and 1992, respectively.
   Increasing trends in the mean monthly sea surface temperature and air
   temperature occurred in the warmer parts of the year (from March to
   August). The results of this study could provide a foundation for
   stakeholders, decision-makers, and other scientists for developing
   effective measures to mitigate the negative effects of climate change in
   the scattered environment of the Adriatic islands and coastal region.},

   problems facing the oceans from an ecological economics perspective, the
   links between science and policy, the rationale for sustainable ocean
   governance, and examples of sustainable institutions and governance
   structures. We developed the `Lisbon principles' of sustainable
   governance (responsibility, scale-matching, precaution, adaptive
   management, full cost allocation, and participation) as a core set of
   guidelines for sustainable ocean governance. We then describe the major
   problems facing the oceans in terms of how the principles are violated,
   and evaluate some suggested institutions in terms of how the principles
   are incorporated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Renewable generation and power electronic convertors increasingly
   displace the inertia conventionally provided by synchronous generation
   in the transition to a low carbon electricity network. Changes in
   generation profiles influence regions of the grid disproportionately,
   and areas of low inertia are susceptible to frequency diverging from
   neighboring areas, creating new risks of Rate Of Change Of Frequency
   (ROCOF)-based generation trips, underfrequency load shedding and
   islanding. A novel method of measuring area inertia is presented, with
   results of simulation and trials on the SP Energy Networks
   (Scottishpower) transmission system in south Scotland. The fundamentally
   new understanding of frequency and inertial effects is essential for
   designing mitigation measures for frequency and network stability, and
   enables new, flexible services for the transition to low inertia power

Title = {Coastal adaptation through urban land reclamation: Exploring the
   distributional effects},
Journal = {ERDE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {150},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {131-144},
Abstract = {Land reclamation and urban redevelopment is currently underway in
   coastal regions around the world, as urbanization continues rapidly, and
   high-value coastal urban land becomes more scarce. Yet coastal hazards
   will also continue to increase due to sea-level rise, and building flood
   risk reduction measures into such land reclamation projects appears to
   be low cost compared to the potential benefits generated. Moreover, land
   reclamation in high-value urban areas that incorporates such adaptation
   can generate substantial revenue attractive to governments, particularly
   in developing countries, which struggle to finance coastal adaptation
   measures. Yet revenue generation in these projects depends on including
   some degree of high-value and high-priced developments, giving rise to
   potential distributional effects. This paper surveys three current
   coastal urban redevelopment projects incorporating flood risk reduction
   in the Maldives, Germany and Nigeria, illustrating different modes of
   urban development projects and the distributional effects that can arise
   for each of these. The paper explores the equity implications of such
   projects that arise in planning processes and in implementation. The
   examples illustrate that inequalities can arise through incentives for
   corruption, budget imperatives leading to developments that result in
   gentrification, and shifting of physical risks on to neighboring
   communities. Finally, I reflect on policy and project design instruments
   that can address these inequalities, and draw out implications for
   future research to ensure sustainable and inclusive development of
   coastal cities in the context of sea-level rise.},

Abstract = {Predicted increases in disease with climate warming highlight the need
   for effective management strategies to mitigate disease effects in coral
   communities. We examined the role of marine protected areas (MPAs) in
   reducing disease in corals and the hypothesis that the composition of
   fish communities can influence coral health, by comparing disease
   prevalence between MPA and non-protected (control) reefs in Palau.
   Overall, the prevalence of diseases pooled, as well as the prevalence of
   skeletal eroding band (SEB), brown band disease (BrB) and growth
   anomalies (GAs) individually in major disease hosts (families
   Acroporidae and Poritidae), were not significantly reduced within MPAs.
   In fact, the prevalence of SEB was 2-fold higher within MPAs overall;
   however, the 4 studied MPAs were ineffective in enhancing coral
   assemblage or fish stock health. A negative association between the
   prevalence of SEB and richness of a fish species targeted by fishers in
   Palau highlights the potential role that well-managed MPAs could play in
   reducing SEB. The composition of coral communities and their
   susceptibility to bleaching also influenced the prevalence of disease on
   the studied reefs. The prevalence of diseases pooled and SEB were
   positively associated with the cover of major disease hosts (families
   Acroporidae and Poritidae), and the prevalence of BrB and bleaching were
   also positively associated. Although our study did not show positive
   effects of MPAs on coral heath, we did identify the potential for
   increased fish diversity within MPAs to reduce coral disease. Our study
   also highlights the complexity of relationships between fish
   assemblages, coral community composition and coral health on
   Indo-Pacific reefs.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of community resilience aids the development of strategies to
   mitigate the impacts of a disturbance. An extreme low-seawater
   temperature event in late January and February 2008 resulted in high
   fish mortality in the coastal waters of the Penghu Islands, Taiwan. In
   this study, we used underwater diving visual censuses to analyze fish
   communities at eight sampling stations along the coast of the Penghu
   Islands for seven years after the 2008 event. We evaluated community
   metrics, including species richness, abundance-weighted diversity,
   average thermal affinity, and average trophic level, and described the
   temporal variation in select dominant species abundances. Species
   richness and diversity of the communities required 53 months to reach a
   steady-state at the sampling stations following the cold water
   intrusion. The cold event initially reduced community thermal affinity,
   which then increased throughout the study period, reflecting the
   recovery of the community to baseline thermal conditions. The increased
   average trophic level after the cold event implied that the temperature
   shock decreased the proportion of lower trophic-level fishes. Average
   trophic level declined as the communities recovered from the
   disturbance, reflecting the recovery of the community to baseline
   species composition in terms of feeding habit. Our results suggest that
   functional diversity may require longer to recover than taxonomic
   diversity for communities in the Penghu Islands.},

Title = {Protection by hard defence structures or relocation of assets exposed to
   coastal risks: Contributions and drawbacks of cost-benefit analysis for
   long-term adaptation choices to climate change},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {173-182},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Adapting to sea-level rise due to climate change involves new public
   policies that aim to relocate those assets most at risk from coastline
   erosion or flooding. It is no longer solely a question of studying the
   merits of a defence infrastructure project designed to prevent risks but
   of looking instead into a broader and longer-term project implying a
   whole new logic of land-use management for the areas concerned. In this
   context, the aim of the present article is to compare different
   adaptation scenarios and to show the need for evolving economic
   assessment and decision-making tools to include multidimensional and
   long-term aspects of adaptation policies. It is important to show the
   limitations of traditional Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) by integrating
   economic impact and non-market factors which are currently only assessed
   in multi-criteria approaches. Such assessments enable comparison of the
   Net Present Value (NPV) of a protection scenario using hard defence
   structures with various relocation scenarios, depending on whether the
   CBA includes only the direct damages avoided (classic CBA) or integrates
   the long-term tourist economy and environmental impacts (enhanced CBA).
   As costs of property purchasing are high, CBA may initially favour the
   protection scenario over relocations despite unfavourable tourist and
   environmental consequences. However, if one takes into consideration
   innovative land-purchase mechanisms which enable reduced investment
   costs in relocation scenarios, the latter measures may have a positive
   NPV. We therefore conclude that, in the long term, taking into account
   the local tourist economy and environmental benefits, the likely fall in
   prices of real estate at risk and the implementation of anticipatory
   schemes could enable relocation policies to become economically viable.

Title = {Assessing summertime urban warming and the cooling efficacy of

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {610},
Pages = {1092-1102},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Western China has experienced rapid urbanization since the Chinese
   reform process began in the late 1970s. It is essential to study the
   spatiotemporal patterns of warming induced by historical and future
   urban expansion and to evaluate adaptation strategies for the
   Chengdu-Chongqing metropolitan region (CCMR) in western China. The
   observed urban heat island intensity was similar to 1.5 K in July
   2009-2011. We employed the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model
   using real and projected urban land-use data to simulate near-surface
   air temperatures for a crop, urban in 2010 and urban in 2030 scenarios
   in summer over the CCMR. The difference between urban 2010 and cropland
   scenarios is 0.93 K. Warming induced by urban development in 2010-2030
   is in the range of 1-1.5 K, but warming induced by future urban
   development will be less intense than historical warming over eastern
   China. We increased roof albedo to 0.8 to assess the difference in
   near-surface air temperature between cool roofs (CR) and urban 2030
   scenarios, which represents the maximum potential impact of CR; we also
   assessed the cooling caused by green roofs (GR) (i.e., the difference
   between the GR and urban 2030 scenarios). Greater cooling occurs during
   the day due to reflection of solar radiation by CR and additional water
   evaporation by GR. We provided an evaluation criterion, cooling
   efficiency (CE), to measure the local performances of CR and GR. CE
   represents the local cooling capability based on urban warming rather
   than absolute cooling over a larger spatial scale. CE reveals a lower
   nocturnal cooling capability, which poses a significant challenge to the
   applications of CR and GR at night. CR has a better cooling capability
   across CCMR than GR, only when roof albedo of CR exceeds 0.68. Measures
   enacted should be appropriately adjusted to optimize for cost,
   technology and energy savings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {When Does Legal Flexibility Work in Environmental Law?},
Journal = {ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {787-840},
Abstract = {Environmental law scholars, practitioners, and policymakers have
   wrestled for some time with the implications of climate change for
   environmental law. There is widespread, although not universal,
   agreement that climate change requires greater flexibility in
   environmental legal systems. Flexibility reduced procedural requirements
   for administrative agency decision making and less rigid substantive
   standards would allow the agencies that implement environmental law to
   adapt to a future world characterized by dynamic, uncertain changes in
   natural resource systems. According to its proponents, flexibility would
   make it easier for agencies to more frequently update their management
   or regulatory decisions to respond to changed conditions, and also to
   facilitate adaptive management. However, there has been little
   exploration of the conditions under which flexibility improves or
   undermines the effectiveness of environmental law.
   This Article examines two areas of environmental law that have
   historically had a great deal of flexibility: hunting law and marine
   fisheries law. In both areas, management and regulatory decisions are
   updated on a regular basis by the relevant agencies, often annually.
   Procedural requirements for making decisions are often streamlined. And
   the substantive standards that apply to agency decisions are often quite
   broad and flexible, leaving substantial discretion to the agency. Yet
   these two areas of environmental law have experienced very different
   outcomes in terms of implementation: fisheries management in the United
   States is often perceived as failing, while hunting law is seen as quite
   successful in achieving its goals.
   This Article concludes that these different outcomes are the result of
   the interaction of legal flexibility with two other factors: the level
   of uncertainty about the condition or status of the natural resource
   being managed and the political context for regulatory or management
   decisions. Fisheries management is characterized by much greater levels
   of uncertainty about population levels than hunting management.
   Moreover, fisheries are the one area in the U.S. economy where there is
   still a substantial commercial industry based on the capture of wildlife
   for human use. The combination of scientific uncertainty and flexible
   law creates a substantial discretionary space in which decision makers
   can operate. In other words, decision makers have a wide range of
   legally defensible management choices. The fishing industry is able to
   exploit this fact to argue for weaker, but still legally defensible,
   regulation. The industry has every incentive to organize in pursuit of
   this goal. In contrast, commercial hunting was eliminated in the United
   States in the nineteenth century. Thus, there are no major interest
   groups with a stake in increasing hunting quotas, and therefore there is
   no substantial effort to manipulate a flexible legal system to weaken
   regulatory standards. Whether flexibility will be successful in a
   regulatory or management system will depend in part on the scientific
   and political context for the resource being protected or managed
   Flexibility is not a panacea that can be applied uniformly throughout
   environmental law.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy is an important piece of the puzzle in meeting growing
   energy demands and mitigating climate change, but the potentially
   adverse effects of such technologies are often overlooked. Given that
   climate and ecology are inextricably linked, assessing the effects of
   energy technologies requires one to consider their full suite of global
   environmental concerns. We review here the ecological impacts of three
   major types of renewable energy - hydro, solar, and wind energy - and
   highlight some strategies for mitigating their negative effects. All
   three types can have significant environmental consequences in certain
   contexts. Wind power has the fewest and most easily mitigated impacts;
   solar energy is comparably benign if designed and managed carefully.
   Hydropower clearly has the greatest risks, particularly in certain
   ecological and geographical settings. More research is needed to assess
   the environmental impacts of these `green energy technologies, given
   that all are rapidly expanding globally.},

Abstract = {1. On a global scale, most of the coastal zones in the world are
   undergoing rapid and accelerating changes. This coastal syndrome
   combines two major trends: one linked to the growth of coastal
   populations, habitat, transport and industrial infrastructures (assets);
   the other linked to the influence of climate change and its effects in
   terms of sea-level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events,
   acidification and increase in ocean surface temperature, both affecting
   the health of coastal ecosystems. This situation is also reflected in
   the increase in coastal engineering solutions, which have significant
   impacts on coastal hydrodynamics and natural ecosystems. This extremely
   dynamic context calls for an evolution in conservation and spatial
   planning strategies in order to better anticipate changes that may
   affect not only the sustainability of both the distribution and health
   of natural ecosystems, but also the relevance of conservation efforts.
   Marine and coastal protected areas help preserve ecological services,
   and reduce the risks faced by coastal communities. Therefore, it can be
   argued that the effectiveness of these conservation units will depend on
   the ability, (i) to take into account their territorial context, and
   also (ii) to base the management decisions on a prospective and
   sufficiently anticipated (future-oriented) approach. MPA management must
   be proactive to cope with such rapid changes. The Nexus approach,
   promoted by the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management - coastal
   ecosystem group (CEM/CEG), places marine and coastal spatial planning as
   a key integrative element linking conservation, adaptation to climate
   change and coastal risk reduction, and as a part of no-regret adaptation
   strategies. This paper highlights the main factors that characterize
   current coastal dynamics, and then briefly presents three
   future-oriented pilot operations, implemented in Western Africa at
   different scales. These operations illustrate how MPAs must become
   structuring elements for the organization and development of coastal
   territories if they are to contribute to the resilience of coastal
   systems and to ensure their own long-term sustainability.},

Title = {Physiological Response of the Hard Coral Pocillopora verrucosa from
   Lombok, Indonesia, to Two Common Pollutants in Combination with High
   Temperature},

Abstract = {Knowledge on interactive effects of global (e.g. ocean warming) and
   local stressors (e.g. pollution) is needed to develop appropriate
   management strategies for coral reefs. Surfactants and diesel are common
   coastal pollutants, but knowledge of their effects on hard corals as key
   reef ecosystem engineers is scarce. This study thus investigated the
   physiological reaction of Pocillopora verrucosa from Lombok, Indonesia,
   to exposure with a) the water-soluble fraction of diesel (determined by
   total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); 0.69 +/- 0.14 mg L-1), b)
   the surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS; 0.95 +/- 0.02 mg L-1)
   and c) combinations of each pollutant with high temperature (+3 degrees
   C). To determine effects on metabolism, respiration, photosynthetic
   efficiency and coral tissue health were measured. Findings revealed no
   significant effects of diesel, while LAS resulted in severe coral tissue
   losses (16-95\% after 84 h). High temperature led to an increase in
   photosynthetic yield of corals after 48 h compared to the control
   treatment, but no difference was detected thereafter. In combination,
   diesel and high temperature significantly increased coral dark
   respiration, whereas LAS and high temperature caused higher tissue
   losses (81-100\% after 84 h) and indicated a severe decline in maximum
   quantum yield. These results confirm the hypothesized combined effects
   of high temperature with either of the two investigated pollutants. Our
   study demonstrates the importance of reducing import of these pollutants
   in coastal areas in future adaptive reef management, particularly in the
   context of ocean warming.},

Title = {Bangladesh's vulnerability to cyclonic coastal flooding},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {In the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, covering most of Bangladesh,
   more than 165 million people live in low-lying coasts facing major
   extreme climatic events, such as cyclones. This article reviews the
   current scientific literature publications (2007-2020) in order to
   define vulnerability in the context of coastal Bangladesh facing
   cyclonic flooding. Based on this review, a new metric, called the
   socio-spatial vulnerability index (SSVI), is defined as function of both
   the probability of the cyclonic flood hazard and the sensitivity of
   delta inhabitants. The main result shows that the districts of
   Shariatpur, Chandpur and Barisal situated in the tidal floodplain of the
   Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta are in the fourth quartile, i.e.,
   highest category, the most vulnerable areas. These districts are very
   densely populated (from 870 up to 1400 inhabitants per square kilometer)
   and exposed to inundation hazards with a large number of vulnerability
   factors. Finally, the delta's mouth was identified as a very vulnerable
   area to cyclonic flooding as well.},

Title = {River flood risk in Jakarta under scenarios of future change},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {757-774},
Abstract = {Given the increasing impacts of flooding in Jakarta, methods for
   assessing current and future flood risk are required. In this paper, we
   use the Damagescanner-Jakarta risk model to project changes in future
   river flood risk under scenarios of climate change, land subsidence, and
   land use change. Damagescanner-Jakarta is a simple flood risk model that
   estimates flood risk in terms of annual expected damage, based on input
   maps of flood hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. We estimate baseline
   flood risk at USD 186 million p.a. Combining all future scenarios, we
   simulate a median increase in risk of +180\% by 2030. The single driver
   with the largest contribution to that increase is land subsidence (+126
   \%). We simulated the impacts of climate change by combining two
   scenarios of sea level rise with simulations of changes in 1-day extreme
   precipitation totals from five global climate models (GCMs) forced by
   the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The results are
   highly uncertain; the median change in risk due to climate change alone
   by 2030 is a decrease by -46 \%, but we simulate an increase in risk
   under 12 of the 40 GCM-RCPsea level rise combinations. Hence, we
   developed probabilistic risk scenarios to account for this uncertainty.
   If land use change by 2030 takes places according to the official
   Jakarta Spatial Plan 2030, risk could be reduced by 12 \%. However, if
   land use change in the future continues at the same rate as the last 30
   years, large increases in flood risk will take place. Finally, we
   discuss the relevance of the results for flood risk management in
   Jakarta.},

Abstract = {The so-called urban heat islands (UHI) is a thermal phenomenon
   characterized by higher air temperatures in the urban area than in rural
   surroundings. Vernacular passive strategies such as courtyards are
   proved to be useful to generate specific microclimates, especially in
   the warmer regions of the Earth. Courtyards increase the porosity of the
   cities, understanding porosity as building voids. Accordingly, their
   study will be fundamental in reducing the UHI effect by generating urban
   cooling microislands. This paper aims to analyze two passive strategies
   capable of modifying the thermal effect of radiation inside the
   courtyard of two school buildings: albedo and vegetation. In this
   regard, two case studies were assessed, both of them located in the city
   of Seville. Results show that the temperature in these spaces can vary
   up to 7 degrees C depending on the albedo, which confirms the importance
   of detecting an optimal albedo factor. In addition, data showed a
   significant increase in the thermal delta (TD), courtyard versus outdoor
   temperature, after the installation of a vegetal facade. Accordingly,
   both strategies will be fundamental in locations affected by climate
   change, especially considering that they are not only effective cooling
   strategies but also relatively easy to implement in the building's
   refurbishment process.},

Abstract = {In the nearly fifteen years after Hurricane Katrina, hurricane victims'
   efforts to recover for the Army Corps of Engineers' construction and
   maintenance of New Orleans's faulty levee systems have slowly wended
   their way through the courts. After the Federal Circuit held in St.
   Bernard Parish Government v. United States that the Army Corps of
   Engineers' construction and maintenance did not constitute a taking,
   hurricane victims' efforts to recover in the courts hit a dead end.
   Using Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath as a lens to examine
   mechanisms to compensate victims and deter future losses, this Note
   ultimately concludes that the existing methods of recovery after natural
   disasters, primarily tort and the National Flood Insurance Program, fall
   short. As climate change increases the threat of catastrophic flooding
   caused by hurricanes and rising seas, a new mechanism to compensate
   victims and deter future flood losses is needed. This Note uses takings,
   a theory rejected by the Federal Circuit in St. Bernard Parish, as a
   potential mechanism to facilitate retreat from vulnerable areas by
   buying back flood-prone properties. However, any federal buyback program
   must grapple with the problematic history of using eminent domain to
   forcibly displace poor and minority communities. This Note proposes a
   program to incorporate community input at an early stage in order to
   keep valuable community ties intact.},

Title = {Growing season water and salt migration between abandoned lands and

   water table environments},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},

Abstract = {In arid and semi-arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables and
   fragmented arrangement of croplands and abandoned lands, dry drainage
   could be an optional management practice mitigating soil salinization. A
   dry drainage system lets non-irrigated abandoned lands serve as
   evaporative salt sinks receiving water and salt fluxes from adjacent
   irrigated croplands. Therefore, this research takes a typical dry
   drainage unit in the Hetao Irrigation District-one abandoned land and
   its adjacent croplands-as an example to directly reveal the field scale
   water and salt migration between abandoned lands and adjacent croplands.
   It was found that during the growing season, the water input, i.e. field
   irrigation and precipitation, raised the water table of the croplands
   and drove water and salt migration from croplands to the abandoned
   lands. However, the evapotranspiration in the croplands was also larger
   than that in the abandoned lands. Thus, during the intervals of
   irrigation (the ``phreatic evaporation periods{''}), in some
   circumstances, evapotranspiration could drive water and salt flux from
   the abandoned lands to the croplands, which would influence the
   groundwater salinity of the croplands. Therefore, it is recommended to
   plant halophytes on the abandoned lands to enhance its
   evapotranspiration and hinder the water and salt flux from the abandoned
   lands to the croplands during intervals of irrigation. This management
   practice could help form more effective dry drainage systems between
   abandoned lands and adjacent croplands, and help better control the root
   zone salinity of the croplands.},

Abstract = {As a promising climate change mitigation technology, radiative cooling
   presents an economical and environmental-friendly approach to alleviate
   cities from overheating and urban heat island. Based on the fundamental
   theory, this study comprehensively reviews the materials composition and
   nano/microstructures underlying the radiative cooling technology. The
   study summarizes the primary six properties of the selective emitting
   material, reflecting material, back-mirror material, matrix material,
   insulation material and dynamic switching material, in terms of their
   morphologies, substrates, properties, and performances. The
   configuration of radiative cooling systems mostly follows the two
   essential designs, namely ``multi-layered structures{''} composed of
   multiple continuous nano/micro-layers or ``nano/micro-particle
   structures{''} consisting of discrete nano/microparticles or a
   combination of both. Cooling potential and end-applications on buildings
   were reviewed, including cool roofs, PV cooling and water cooling. At
   the end of this review, we present our recommendations on the combining
   ``multilayer{''} and ``nanostructure{''} designs for better design
   radiative cooling composites from a materialistic perspective. Unlike
   previous studies, our review provides a unique overview of nanomaterials
   and composite structures, leading to better design configuration and
   optimisation of radiative cooling end-applications.},

Title = {Avoided Heat-Related Mortality through Climate Adaptation Strategies in
   Three US Cities},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Heat-related mortality in US cities is expected to more than double by
   the mid-to-late 21st century. Rising heat exposure in cities is
   projected to result from: 1) climate forcings from changing global
   atmospheric composition; and 2) local land surface characteristics
   responsible for the urban heat island effect. The extent to which heat
   management strategies designed to lessen the urban heat island effect
   could offset future heat-related mortality remains unexplored in the
   literature. Using coupled global and regional climate models with a
   human health effects model, we estimate changes in the number of
   heat-related deaths in 2050 resulting from modifications to vegetative
   cover and surface albedo across three climatically and demographically
   diverse US metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Georgia, Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. Employing separate health impact
   functions for average warm season and heat wave conditions in 2050, we
   find combinations of vegetation and albedo enhancement to offset
   projected increases in heat-related mortality by 40 to 99\% across the
   three metropolitan regions. These results demonstrate the potential for
   extensive land surface changes in cities to provide adaptive benefits to
   urban populations at risk for rising heat exposure with climate change.},

Title = {Why Does Planning Matter in Microclimate Management and Urban Heat
   Mitigation?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH},
Abstract = {In this paper, we examine two mixed-use redevelopment projects in the
   United States, including both regulatory and procedural contexts, to
   assess how decision-making processes affected microclimate outcomes. We
   investigate Belmar in Lakewood, CO and 29th Street Mall in Boulder, CO.
   Measurements and simulations of microclimate show that Belmar mitigates
   urban heat more effectively. Policies including building height, street
   patterns, and landscaping standards were key variables in this outcome.
   Through interviews and content analysis, we found five main factors
   shaping those policy choices: (1) urban vision, (2) land use and form
   controls, (3) design guidelines, (4) public financing, and (5)
   ownership/condemnation factors.},

Abstract = {The Marine Planning Framework for South Australia is a new large-scale,
   ecosystem-based zoning policy for management of development and use in
   the marine environment. Utilising the Geographic Information System
   (GIS), the model establishes four ecologically rated zones, derived from
   known ecological criteria. A series of goals, objectives and strategies
   represent the desired outcomes for each of the ecologically rated zones.
   A Performance Assessment System (PAS) will subsequently evaluate the
   success of the marine plans. Implementation will be supported by a
   collaborative whole-of-government approach. Marine plans will facilitate
   the delivery of long-term protection to the marine environment as a
   whole ecosystem, whilst enabling a broad range of activities to occur in
   a sustainable manner. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Empirical approaches for assessing impacts of climate change on
   agriculture: The EcoCrop model and a case study with grain sorghum},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {170},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {67-78},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Climate has been changing in the last three decades and will continue
   changing regardless of any mitigation strategy. Agriculture is a
   climate-dependent activity and hence is highly sensitive to climatic
   changes and climate variability. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap
   when agricultural researchers intend to assess the production of minor
   crops for which data or models are not available. Therefore, we
   integrated the current expert knowledge reported in the FAO-EcoCrop
   database, with the basic mechanistic model (also named EcoCrop),
   originally developed by Hijmans et al. (2001). We further developed the
   model, providing calibration and evaluation procedures. To that aim, we
   used sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench) as a case study and both
   calibrated EcoCrop for the sorghum crop and analyzed the impacts of the
   SRES-A1B 2030s climate on sorghum climatic suitability. The model
   performed well, with a high true positive rate (TPR) and a low false
   negative rate (FNR) under present conditions when assessed against
   national and subnational agricultural statistics (min TPR = 0.967, max
   FNR = 0.026). The model predicted high sorghum climatic suitability in
   areas where it grows optimally and matched the sorghum geographic
   distribution fairly well. Negative impacts were predicted by 2030s.
   Vulnerabilities in countries where sorghum cultivation is already
   marginal are likely (with a high degree of certainty): the western Sahel
   region, southern Africa, northern India, and the western coast of India
   are particularly vulnerable. We highlight the considerable opportunity
   of using EcoCrop to assess global food security issues, broad climatic
   constraints and regional crop-suitability shifts in the context of
   climate change and the possibility of coupling it with other large-area
   approaches. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of Responses of Land Surface Temperature to
   Long-Term Land Use/Cover Changes between a Coastal and Inland City: A
   Case of Freetown and Bo Town in Sierra Leone},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Urban growth and its associated expansion of built-up areas are expected
   to continue through to the twenty second century and at a faster pace in
   developing countries. This has the potential to increase thermal
   discomfort and heat-related distress. There is thus a need to monitor
   growth patterns, especially in resource constrained countries such as
   Africa, where few studies have so far been conducted. In view of this,
   this study compares urban growth and temperature response patterns in
   Freetown and Bo town in Sierra Leone. Multispectral Landsat images
   obtained in 1998, 2000, 2007, and 2015 are used to quantify growth and
   land surface temperature responses. The contribution index (CI) is used
   to explain how changes per land use and land cover class (LULC)
   contributed to average city surface temperatures. The population size of
   Freetown was about eight times greater than in Bo town. Landsat data
   mapped urban growth patterns with a high accuracy (Overall Accuracy >
   80\%) for both cities. Significant changes in LULC were noted in
   Freetown, characterized by a 114 km(2) decrease in agriculture area, 23
   km(2) increase in dense vegetation, and 77 km(2) increase in built-up
   area. Between 1998 and 2015, built-up area increased by 16 km(2), while
   dense vegetation area decreased by 14 km(2) in Bo town. Average surface
   temperature increased from 23.7 to 25.5 degrees C in Freetown and from
   24.9 to 28.2 degrees C in Bo town during the same period. Despite the
   larger population size and greater built-up extent, as well as expansion
   rate, Freetown was 2 degrees C cooler than Bo town in all periods. The
   low temperatures are attributed to proximity to sea and the very large
   proportion of vegetation surrounding the city. Even close to the sea and
   abundant vegetation, the built-up area had an elevated temperature
   compared to the surroundings. The findings are important for formulating
   heat mitigation strategies for both inland and coastal cities in
   developing countries.},

Title = {Coastal Flood Assessment due to Sea Level Rise and Extreme Storm Events:
   A Case Study of the Atlantic Coast of Portugal's Mainland},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Portugal's mainland has hundreds of thousands of people living in the
   Atlantic coastal zone, with numerous high economic value activities and
   a high number of infrastructures that must be adapted and protected from
   natural coastal hazards, namely, extreme storms and sea level rise
   (SLR). In the context of climate change adaptation strategies, a
   reliable and accurate assessment of the physical vulnerability to SLR is
   crucial. This study is a contribution to the implementation of flooding
   standards imposed by the European Directive 2007/60/EC, which requires
   each member state to assess the risk associated to SLR and floods caused
   by extreme events. Therefore, coastal hazard on the Atlantic Coast of
   Portugal's mainland was evaluated for 2025, 2050, and 2100 over the
   whole extension due to SLR, with different sea level scenarios for
   different extreme event return periods. A coastal probabilistic flooding
   map was produced based on the developed probabilistic cartography
   methodology using geographic information system (GIS) technology. The
   Extreme Flood Hazard Index (EFHI) was determined on probabilistic flood
   bases using five probability intervals of 20\% amplitude. For a given
   SLR scenario, the EFHI is expressed, on the probabilistic flooding maps
   for an extreme tidal maximum level, by five hazard classes ranging from
   1 (Very Low) to 5 (Extreme).},

Abstract = {Groundwater in coastal aquifers of the Maharlu Lake, southern Iran, has
   suffered from quality degradation and salinity increases in recent
   decades. These aquifers are important sources for drinking and
   agricultural uses in area around the lake. Hydrogeochemical analyses
   were carried out to identify the geochemical processes controlling
   groundwater chemistry and heavy metal concentrations in the coastal
   aquifer of the Maharlu Salt Lake. A total number of 54 water samples (45
   samples from three coastal aquifers and 9 water samples from lake water)
   were collected for laboratory analysis of major ions and heavy metals
   three times from November-2014 to July-2015. In addition, physiochemical
   parameters of temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and redox
   potential were measured in the field. The findings indicate three major
   controls of groundwater chemistry in the coastal aquifers of the Maharlu
   Lake including (1) lake water intrusions, (2) evaporites and carbonate
   dissolution-precipitation, and (3) input of organic matter probably
   linked to the seepage of domestic sewage with resulting sulfate
   reduction. In contrast, dissolution of minerals in surface sediments and
   direct evaporation of groundwater in the coastal aquifers seem to be
   insignificant based on geochemical ratios and water table depth.
   Concentrations of B, Li, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, and U increase, but Zn
   concentrations decrease in groundwater due to the lake water intrusions
   into the costal aquifers. Gypsum dissolution and consequent carbonate
   reactions cause B, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and U enrichment in the
   groundwater samples. These findings can provide water managers and local
   authorities with a comprehensive framework of the coastal groundwater
   geochemistry, allowing a better understanding of the effects of current
   management practices and the implementation of mitigation approaches
   such as reduction of groundwater extraction to limit further lake
   saltwater intrusion and water resources deterioration.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Land Deformation as a Factor Contributing
   to Relative Sea Level Rise in Coastal Urban and Natural Protected Areas
   Using Multi-Source Earth Observation Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The rise in sea level is expected to considerably aggravate the impact
   of coastal hazards in the coming years. Low-lying coastal urban centers,
   populated deltas, and coastal protected areas are key societal hotspots
   of coastal vulnerability in terms of relative sea level change. Land
   deformation on a local scale can significantly affect estimations, so it
   is necessary to understand the rhythm and spatial distribution of
   potential land subsidence/uplift in coastal areas. The present study
   deals with the determination of the relative vertical rates of the land
   deformation and the sea-surface height by using multi-source Earth
   observation-synthetic aperture radar (SAR), global navigation satellite
   system (GNSS), tide gauge, and altimetry data. To this end, the
   multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MT-InSAR) technique was used in order
   to exploit the most recent Copernicus Sentinel-1 data. The products were
   set to a reference frame by using GNSS measurements and were combined
   with a re-analysis model assimilating satellite altimetry data, obtained
   by the Copernicus Marine Service. Additional GNSS and tide gauge
   observations have been used for validation purposes. The proposed
   methodological approach has been implemented in three pilot cases: the
   city of Alexandroupolis in the Evros Delta region, the coastal zone of
   Thermaic Gulf, and the coastal area of Killini, Araxos (Patras Gulf) in
   the northwestern Peloponnese, which are Greek coastal areas with special
   characteristics. The present research provides localized relative
   sea-level estimations for the three case studies. Their variation is
   high, ranging from values close to zero, i.e., from 5-10 cm and 30 cm in
   50 years for urban areas to values of 50-60 cm in 50 years for rural
   areas, close to the coast. The results of this research work can
   contribute to the effective management of coastal areas in the framework
   of adaptation and mitigation strategies attributed to climate change.
   Scaling up the proposed methodology to a continental level is required
   in order to overcome the existing lack of proper assessment of the
   relevant hazard in Europe.},

Abstract = {The issue of climate change impact on agriculture and developing
   resiliency is of prime importance to ensure food and livelihood
   security. A study was conducted in Odisha, a climatically vulnerable
   state of India, to assess the resilience of agriculture on the basis of
   district-wise agricultural scenario worked out through a composite
   agricultural scenario index (ASI) for the period 2001-2002 to 2013-2014
   and to study adaptation mechanisms developing resilience. As irrigation,
   socio-economic and climatic variability scenario influence resilience of
   agriculture, these were also studied through relevant indexes and mapped
   with help of Arc GIS software. The maximum and minimum ASI value among
   all 30 districts of Odisha during the study period have ranged from
   86.30 to 65.80 and 24.60 to 12.80, respectively, showing the
   fluctuations that may be attributed to the climatic aberrations. The
   coastal districts Balasore and Bhadrak have showed a relatively better
   resilience of agriculture in the years of climatic disasters maintaining
   the ASI value at a higher level as compared to other districts due to
   better groundwater irrigation and socio-economic scenario in those
   districts. However, other coastal districts have shown less resilience
   with decrease of ASI value to a greater extent in the years of climatic
   hazards. Therefore, the adaptation mechanisms in case of natural
   resource management, crop farming, livestock farming and institutional
   innovations were delineated in a resilient coastal district of Balasore
   and non-coastal district of Khurda. Adoption of climate resilient
   technologies by farm households has helped in bringing resilience of
   agriculture to climate change.},

Abstract = {Climate-driven changes in the marine environment can impact the
   distribution and abundance of marine species. Here, we combined
   available commercial fishery data of the neon flying squid Ommastrephes
   bartramii in the traditional fishing grounds in the northwest Pacific
   Ocean collected by Chinese squid jigging vessels between 1996 and 2005
   with the dominant environmental climate factors affecting its
   distribution. Fishery and dominant environmental climate factors were
   incorporated into a species distribution model (maximum entropy model,
   MaxEnt) to describe the suitable habitats for neon flying squid. Two
   climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) from the Community Earth
   System Model Version 1 were used with MaxEnt to project the future
   distribution of environmental suitability for neon flying squid. Results
   indicated that suitable neon flying squid habitat moved northward under
   climate change, and the projected area of suitable habitat decreased by
   the end of the century. Projections revealed that suitable habitats for
   neon flying squid will almost disappear between July and September by
   2095 in RCP4.5, and between July and November (except in October, which
   increased by about 34\%) in RCP8.5. These findings suggest that the
   fishing season for neon flying squid might be delayed and the total
   fishing time might be shortened. We suggest that adaptive fisheries
   management strategies, such as controlling fishing effort and setting a
   closed season, should be established as soon as possible in response to
   climate changes in the North Pacific Ocean.},

Abstract = {Hydrogeological research in coastal areas has gained considerable
   attention over the last decades due to increasing stresses on fresh
   groundwater resources. Fundamental groundwater flow and solute transport
   analyses remain essential for a concise understanding of the governing
   processes that lead to salinisation of fresh groundwater resources.
   However, the challenge of modern research is the application and
   quantification of these processes in real world cases. In this context,
   deltaic areas are amongst the most difficult study areas as they often
   have a complex groundwater salinity distribution. The Wadden Sea area in
   the northern part of the Netherlands is an example of such an area.
   We quantified salt water intrusion and salinisation of groundwater flow
   systems in two representative case studies in the Wadden Sea area, using
   the density dependent groundwater flow and transport code MOCDENS3D. The
   results indicate that sea-level rise and autonomous processes will cause
   severe salinisation in the future, especially in the low polder areas
   close to the sea. In addition, we show that enhanced land subsidence due
   to salt exploitation accelerates this process. Salinisation can be
   mitigated to some extent by raising surface water levels in polders and
   by creating saline groundwater collection areas that maintain a low
   controlled water level.},

Abstract = {The negative effects of slow onset events (SOEs) related to climate
   change are already affecting developing countries, with the resulting
   impacts likely to increase significantly. With an increasing urgency to
   act on SOEs, this paper systematically reviewed and synthesized
   literature on SOEs in Southeast Asia (SEA), which is a region of several
   highly climate vulnerable countries. With a focus on scenarios and
   emerging response options by affected sectors such as agriculture,
   fisheries, and forestry, we found that the drivers of SOEs in SEA are
   both indirect and direct and have confounding impacts. Only a few
   researches used scenarios and models for assessing SOEs in SEA, a
   majority of which use Representative Concentration Pathways and Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathways. The impacts of SOEs range from environmental,
   ecological, economic, and social factors and require integrated response
   options including mitigation or adaptation that pay attention to the
   complexity of the intersection between human and natural systems.},

Title = {Unpacking the Pacific Urban Agenda: Resilience Challenges and
   Opportunities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are often cited as being the most
   vulnerable to the future impacts of a changing climate. Furthermore,
   being located in the `Pacific Rim of Fire', PICs have long been exposed
   to the impacts of a range of natural and climate-related extreme
   events-such as earthquakes and cyclones-and are considered to be amongst
   the most vulnerable countries to natural disasters. The physical
   vulnerability of Pacific towns and cities is further exaggerated by
   development deficits, geographical isolation, weak governance, and
   complex issues of land tenure. This paper, based on substantive project
   experience in the Pacific region by each of the authors, reviews the
   resilience challenges facing Melanesian cities in the context of rapid
   urbanization and global environmental change. It then sets this in the
   context of the global `New Urban Agenda' which was launched at Habitat
   III in Quito at the end of 2016, setting out the critical implementation
   challenges and opportunities for enhancing urban resilience in the
   Pacific.},

Title = {Predicting the effect of invertebrate regime shifts on wading birds:
   Insights from Poole Harbour, UK},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {186},
Pages = {60-68},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Regime shifts in benthic invertebrates within coastal ecosystems
   threaten the survival of wading birds (Charadrii). Predicting how
   invertebrate regime shifts will affect wading birds allows conservation
   management and mitigation measures to be implemented, including
   protection of terrestrial feeding areas. An individual-based model was
   used to investigate the impact of regime shifts on wading birds through
   their prey (marine worms and bivalves) in the estuarine system Poole
   Harbour, (UK). The model predicted the number of curlew (Numenius
   arquata), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), black-tailed godwit
   (Limosa limosa), redshank (Tringa totanus) and dunlin (Calidris alpina)
   supported in the Harbour during the non-breeding season (autumn and
   winter months). The most dramatic declines in bird numbers were for
   regime shifts that reduced the abundance of the largest invertebrates,
   particularly marine worms. The least adaptable bird species (those with
   the most restrictive diets) were unable to compensate by consuming other
   prey. Generally, as birds adapt to changes by switching to alternative
   prey species and size classes, changes in invertebrate size and species
   distribution do not necessarily affect the number of birds that the
   Harbour can support. Our predictions reveal a weakness in using birds as
   indicators of site health and invertebrate regime shifts. Differences in
   bird populations would not necessarily be detected by standard survey
   methods until extreme changes in invertebrate communities had occurred,
   potentially beyond the point at which these changes could be reversed.
   Therefore, population size of wading birds should not be used in
   isolation when assessing the conservation status of coastal sites. (C)

Title = {Renewable Energy and Energy Reductions or Solar Geoengineering for
   Climate Change Mitigation?},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This review explores the question: should the world rely wholly or
   partially on solar geoengineering (SG) to mitigate climate change (CC),
   or on renewable energy, together with deep energy reductions? Recent
   thinking is for SG to only supplement more conventional climate change
   mitigation methods. However, we first show that conventional mitigation
   methods are not working., given that global annual CO2 emissions are
   still rising, so it is far more likely that SG will be called upon to
   counter most anthropogenic CC, as early research proposed. The paper
   next examines the various SG proposals that have been considered and
   their objectives. Future choices could be between an increasingly
   unpredictable climate, and SG, with its own risks and unknowns, or deep
   energy reductions and RE. The claim is that SG has far lower costs for a
   given climate forcing reduction compared with more conventional methods,
   and equally important, could be quickly implemented, producing
   temperature reductions in a year or so, compared with decades needed for
   more conventional mitigation approaches. SG implementation would affect
   not only the technical potential for key RE sources but also the actual
   uptake of RE and energy reductions. However, a fair comparison of RE and
   SG must recognise that the SG option also requires a solution to rising
   ocean acidification (OA). Because the material quantities needed
   annually to counter OA are orders of magnitude larger than for SG, its
   costs and energetic requirements will also be far higher, as will the
   time for implementation.},

Abstract = {As temperatures and sea levels rise, among other issues, environmental
   change is becoming an increasingly important driver of both internal and
   external migration across the globe. The loss of livelihood that these
   changes engender, and will increasingly cause in the coming decades, is
   forcing larger and larger numbers of individuals and groups to seek
   opportunities in other areas. As this phenomenon becomes more prevalent,
   it is imperative that communities, governments, NGOs, and other
   interested parties put in place policies to mitigate and adapt. This
   paper looks at the intersection of environmental change and migration.
   More specifically, it discusses the changing climate and environment and
   then looks at how this will, and already is, affecting migration
   patterns around the world. It then will provide a number of guiding
   principles for policymakers, academics, and others to think about when
   dealing with this issue.},

Title = {Voltage Impact of a Wave Energy Converter on an Unbalanced Distribution
   Grid and Corrective Actions},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Renewable energy is steadily increasing its penetration level in
   electric power systems. Wind and solar energy have reached a high degree
   of maturity, and their impacts on the grid are well known. However, this
   is not the case for emerging sources like wave energy. This work
   explores the impact of the fluctuating power injected by a wave energy
   converter on the distribution grid voltage and proposes a strategy for
   mitigating the induced voltage fluctuations. The paper describes the
   mechanics of how a fluctuating active power injection leads to grid
   voltage fluctuations and presents an unbalanced three-phase power flow
   tool that allows one to quantitatively analyze the voltage evolution at
   every phase and bus of a distribution grid driven by this power
   injection. The paper also proposes a corrective action for mitigating
   the voltage fluctuations that makes use of the hardware resources
   already available in the wave energy converter, by means of a control
   strategy on the reactive capability of the grid-side inverter. The use
   of a STATCOM as additional reactive compensation equipment is also
   explored. The effectiveness of the proposal is assessed in the IEEE
   13-bus test feeder showing that, in some cases, the wave energy
   converter by itself is able to mitigate the voltage fluctuations that it
   causes. If not, a STATCOM can provide the extra reactive capability
   needed.},

Abstract = {Larval fish are small and vulnerable, but can they improve their

   models linking larval success to environmental conditions use
   oceanography, the physical environment and prey supply as the sole

   developments, which are based on the assumption that larval fish are
   like most other animals, hungry for food, afraid of predators, and
   equipped with cognitive abilities to respond to and make use of
   gradients and fluctuations in their environment. We explain and discuss
   differences between individual-based models and optimality models, and
   summarize some key predictions. We also point at the need for
   experimental studies to reveal the behavioral capacities of larval fish,

Title = {A functional seasonal thermal hot-spot classification: Focus on
   industrial sites},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {806},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {This study was focused on the metropolitan area of Florence in Tuscany
   (Italy) with the aim to provide a functional spatial thermal anomaly
   indicator obtained throughout a thermal summer and winter hot-spot
   detection. The hot-spot analysis was performed by applying Getis-Ord
   Gi{*} spatial statistics to Land Surface Temperature (LST) layers,
   obtained from Landsat 8 remote sensing data during the 2015-2019 daytime
   summer and winter period, to delimitate summer hot- and cool-spots, and
   winter warm- and cold-spots. Further, these ones were spatially combined
   thus obtaining a comprehensive summer-winter Thermal Hot-Spot (THSSW)
   spatial indicator. Winter and summer mean daily thermal comfort profiles
   were provided for the study area assessing the Universal Thermal Climate
   Index (UTCI) by using meteorological data available from seven local
   weather stations, located at a maximum distance of 350 m from industrial
   sites. A specific focus on industrial sites was carried out by analyzing
   the industrial buildings characteristics and their surrounding areas (50
   m buffer), through the following layers: industrial building area (BA),
   surface albedo of buildings (ALB), impervious area (IA), tree cover
   (TC), and grassland area (GA). The novel THSSW classification applied to
   industrial buildings has shown that about 50\% of the buildings were
   located in areas characterized by summer hot-spots. Increases in BA and
   IA revealed warming effects on industrial buildings, whereas increases
   in ALB, TC, and GA disclosed cooling effects. A decrease of about 10\%
   of IA replaced by TC and GA was associated with about 2 degrees C
   decrease of LST. Very strong outdoor heat stress conditions were
   observed during summer daytime, whereas moderate winter outdoor cold
   stress conditions were recorded during nighttime until the early
   morning. The thermal spatial hot-spot classification in industrial areas
   provides a very useful source of information for thermal mitigation
   strategies aimed to reduce the heat-related health risk for workers. (C)

Title = {Towards the next generation of green building for urban heat island
   mitigation: Zero UHI impact building},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {At present, cities are under the threats of global warming and urban
   heat island (UHI) phenomenon, where buildings are an important cause and
   also the sufferer of urban overheating. Therefore, building, especially
   the green building (GB), is predominantly provisioned to address the
   increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions in response to
   climate change, while to our best knowledge, it has been scarcely
   requested for UHI mitigation (UHIM). Therefore, this paper proposes the
   concept of GB-based UHIM system, or `zero UHI impact building', or
   `zero-heat building' or `microclimate neutral building', aiming to
   achieve the zero-heat impact on surrounding environments through
   reasonably designing and operating buildings, or depending on innovative
   techniques to eliminate the excessive heats, on the basis of GB's goals.
   In specific, this paper defines the boundary of the GB-based UHIM
   system, analyzes the interactions between building and urban heat
   fluxes, and the factors that may affect the use of UHIM techniques on
   building components. The potentials to establish the GB-based UHIM
   system are further analyzed in aspects of the UHI impacts on the GB
   benefits and the principle for heat mitigation. Moreover, the pathway to
   GB-based UHIM system implementation is further elaborated and
   suggestions for future direction and work are given. Overall, this paper
   presents the theoretical and practical foundation for the establishment
   of GB-based UHIM system and it is a significant move of building sector
   in response to the temperature increase.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {575-583},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has been widely accepted as the new
   paradigm to manage marine ecosystems. Although various efforts have been
   made to define key components, guidelines, and principles, in support of
   its implementation, there is still a gap between theory and practice. To
   implement EBM, managers require a decision-making framework in which the
   values of constituents, objectives and performance measures are
   consistent and used to evaluate and choose between alternatives.
   Structured decision-making (SDM) is a systematic approach that can
   contribute to develop this framework for EBM. SDM was used for the
   on-going EBM process on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British
   Columbia, Canada. This case study provides insights into how SDM can be
   implemented for EBM, as well as some challenges and opportunities
   encountered during the process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {156-172},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Considering structural break autoregressive (SEAR) processes and
   following recent literature, the problem of estimating the unknown
   number of change-points is cast as a model selection problem. The
   adaptive group Lasso is used to select the number of change-points for
   which parameter estimation consistency, model selection consistency, and
   asymptotic normality are proven. It is shown in simulation experiments
   that adaptive group Lasso performs comparably to a state-of-the-art
   two-step group Lasso procedure with backward elimination and other
   leading-edge approaches. Moreover, comparing the forecasting performance
   of both group Lasso procedures in an empirical application to realized
   variance dynamics, adaptive group Lasso is found to date change-points
   with equal accuracy. Thus, in practice, adaptive group Lasso can provide
   an alternative way to consistently select change-points in related
   applications. (C) 2020 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics. Published by

Abstract = {Lately, due to overutilization of scarce natural resources such as
   water, tourist islands have been severely threatened. This is also the
   case in Santa Cruz Island, the main inhabited island of the Galapagos
   Archipelago. Therefore, a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was
   carried out with the aim of mitigating the future water crisis. The
   proposed solutions were evaluated in terms of environmental, technical,
   economic and social criteria. The results indicate that the `best'
   alternative for municipality representatives is the option including
   desalination. However, for the other two groups of stakeholders, the
   chosen option was the one that combined all the proposed alternatives
   (greywater recycling, specific demand reduction and rainwater
   harvesting), except desalination. Conclusions show that for most
   stakeholders the environment is the most important criteria.},

Title = {Surface urban heat islands in Italian metropolitan cities: Tree cover
   and impervious surface influences},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {751},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) predictors, such as impervious and
   vegetated surfaces, strongly influence the urban landscape mosaic, also
   changing microclimate conditions and exacerbating the surface urban heat
   island (SUHI) phenomenon. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   summer daytime SUHI phenomenon and the role played by impervious and
   tree cover surfaces in the 10 Italian peninsular metropolitan cities.
   Summer daytime LST values were assessed by using MODIS data referred to
   the months of June, July and August from 2016 to 2018. High spatial
   resolution (10 m) of impervious surface and tree cover layers was
   calculated based on open-data developed by the Italian National
   Institute for Environmental Protection and Research. A novel informative
   urban surface landscape layer was developed combining impervious
   surfaces and tree cover densities and its mapping for metropolitan
   cities was performed. Summer daytime SUHI rose significantly, increased
   especially in inland cities, by increasing the size of areas with low
   tree cover densities in the metropolitan core (or decreasing areas with
   low tree cover densities outside the metropolitan core), further
   increasing its intensity when the impervious density grew. A mitigating
   effect of the sea on daytime LST and SUHI was observed on coastal
   cities. The most intense SUHI phenomenon was observed in Turin (the
   largest Italian metropolitan city): for every 10\% increase in areas
   with highly impervious surfaces and low tree cover densities in the
   metropolitan core, the SUHI significantly (p < 0.001) increased by 4.0
   degrees C. Increased impervious surfaces combined with low tree cover
   densities represented the main driving process to increase the summer
   daytime SUHI intensity in most studied cities. These findings are useful
   to identify summer daytime LST critical areas and to implement the most
   efficient urban-heat-island mitigation strategies in order to safeguard
   the vulnerable urban environment and enhance quality of life for the
   population. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Social capital reduces vulnerability in rural coastal communities of
   Solomon Islands},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {191},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Rural island communities are generally regarded as the most vulnerable
   groups affected by climate change. This perception arises due to them
   often being in less developed areas with high levels of exposure to
   stressors, while reportedly lacking the means to cope with these
   stressors. Studies which use developed-country yardsticks, such as those
   used in past IPCC-based assessments, when measuring vulnerability in
   less developed states will however inevitably over-pronounce its effects
   in such areas. The sustainable livelihoods approach provides an
   alternate means of determining vulnerability using capital assets such
   as social capital. The presence of these assets enables communities to
   pursue diverse livelihood strategies which ultimately serve to reduce
   their vulnerability. This study seeks to measure attributes of social
   capital in five marine dependent communities of Solomon Islands. This
   was done through a questionnaire survey of 110 respondents, which
   comprised of 15 questions related to social capital. Question scores
   were equally balanced and also contributed equally to each of the five
   indicators of social capital identified in the literature-namely
   community cohesion, gender equity, leadership, decision making, and
   equal access to services and resources. The results indicated an overall
   social capital vulnerability score of 0.379, where 0 indicates the
   lowest possible vulnerability score and 1 the most vulnerable. Community
   cohesion decreased vulnerability the most within these communities,
   followed by gender equity, leadership, equal access to services and
   resources and decision making. Our results indicate a high degree of
   social capital in Solomon Islands communities, and therefore its
   importance as an inherent measure for households to cope with both
   climate and non-climate related stressors. Climate change directed
   policy should therefore be developed with the aim of preserving social
   capital as it provides a culturally embedded means of deterring
   vulnerability, at the risk of more expensive and possibly less pragmatic
   alternative measures.},

Title = {Evaluating the Impact of Climate Change on Water Quality and Quantity in

Abstract = {Considerable efforts are underway to restore watersheds and estuaries
   downstream impacted by urban development; however, climate change (CC)
   may be undermining them. Current methods are limited in their ability to
   predict hydrology and water quality with CC and assess its effect on the
   efficiency of stormwater control measures (SCMs). We developed a method
   using downscaled global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to project precipitation and
   temperatures; these were used to force a Storm Water Management Model
   (SWMM). Three scenarios, a historical and two Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with five GCMs, were used to
   produce ensemble results. All GCMs in both RCP scenarios projected
   increases in precipitation and temperature compared to historical
   conditions. Both RCPs exhibited their largest increases in
   precipitation, streamflow, total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen
   (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) loads in the winter, summer exhibited
   the largest increase in temperature. Median loads of TSS, TN, and TP
   increased 3.1\%, 2.5\%, and 9.9\%, respectively, for RCP 4.5, and
   increased 3.8\%, 3.1\%, and 10.4\%, respectively, for RCP 8.5. Median
   reductions in TSS, TN, and TP SCM efficiency for RCP 4.5 were projected
   to be 6\%, 7\%, and 11\%, respectively; and 11\%, 12\%, and 17\% for RCP
   8.5, respectively. Thus, it is likely that additional efforts will be
   needed to meet water quality goals in the future. Methods such as these
   can help create climate resilient watershed improvement strategies and
   guide urban stormwater planning against likely future changes as a
   result of CC.},

Abstract = {Coastal archaeological sites in Newfoundland and Labrador are currently
   under considerable threat, with important knowledge of the province's
   history and prehistory potentially lost to erosion. Climate change will
   exacerbate existing coastal hazards, thus causing even greater loss of
   archaeological resources in the future. Action is needed now to protect
   or retrieve the information from significant sites under threat in
   coastal areas before they are completely eroded. In responding, cultural
   resource managers face potentially tough questions about which sites are
   at risk, how to prioritize at-risk sites for action, and what management
   option is most appropriate. A 2011 study by Westley et al. estimated
   that one-fifth of the coastal archaeological sites in three study
   regions of Newfoundland were highly vulnerable to the impacts of
   relative sea-level rise (SLR), storm surges or coastal erosion over the
   next 15-50 years. The Coastal Archaeological Resources Risk Assessment
   (CARRA) project aims refine the site vulnerability assessment approach
   and inform management decisions about at-risk sites. This includes
   employing high resolution coastal topography (e.g. LiDAR), revised SLR
   projections, updated coastal erosion estimates and resurveyed site
   positions in our improved vulnerability classification. Once at-risk
   sites have been identified, prioritizing action at these sites is
   especially difficult. A review of the published literature revealed few
   examples of applied processes and those identified rely heavily on the
   quantification and ranking of risk factors with less emphasis on the
   nature and rarity of the archaeological resource. The CARRA project is
   reviewing current practices in at-risk site prioritization with the goal
   to create best practice scenarios for one of our Newfoundland study
   areas. This process will involve detailed hazard assessment of two
   at-risk sites, including coastal erosion and shoreline retreat studies,
   as well as an impact assessment of known archaeology resources at each
   site under future hazard scenarios. The final step in the management of
   at-risk archaeological sites is the design and implementation of an
   action plan. The CARRA project aims to inform this step through a review
   of current case studies and management actions at threatened sites
   across Canada. Two case studies from Newfoundland are briefly introduced
   to illustrate the types of local actions taken to mitigate erosion at
   archaeological sites. These case studies will be reviewed in detail with
   the intention to share adaptation strategies as part of a new community
   of practice for heritage managers responsible for coastal archaeology
   resources in Canada.},

Abstract = {Understanding the ability of animals to cope with a changing environment
   is critical in a world affected by anthropogenic disturbance.(1)
   Individual foraging strategies may influence the coping ability of
   entire populations, as these strategies can be adapted to contrasting
   conditions, allowing populations with foraging polymorphisms to be more
   resilient toward environmental change.(2,3) However, environmentally
   dependent fitness consequences of individual foraging strategies and
   their effects on population dynamics have not been conclusively
   documented.(4,5) Here, we use biologging data from endangered Galapagos
   sea lion females (Zalophus wollebaeki) to show that benthically foraging
   individuals dig after sand-dwelling prey species while pelagic foragers
   hunt in more open waters. These specialized foraging behaviors result in
   distinct and temporally stable patterns of vibrissae abrasion. Using
   vibrissae length as a visual marker for the benthic versus pelagic
   foraging strategies, we furthermore uncovered an environment-dependent
   fitness trade-off between benthic and pelagic foragers, suggesting that
   the foraging polymorphism could help to buffer the population against
   the negative effects of climate change. However, demographic projections
   suggest that this buffering effect is unlikely to be sufficient to
   reverse the ongoing population decline of the past four decades.(6) Our
   study shows how crucial a deeper understanding of behavioral
   polymorphisms can be for predicting how populations cope within a
   rapidly changing world.},

Abstract = {The village-fringe mangroves throughout the Indian Sunderbans have
   become ecologically fragile due to decades of unsustainable utilization
   practices and changes in hydro-geomorphic conditions. These mangroves
   are generally managed by the state-run Forest Department, community
   institutions and non-governmental organizations either separately or in
   collaboration. This paper attempts to assess the forest health of three
   such mangrove sites managed by these different institutions using
   quantitative vegetation surveys. Transformations of land use and land
   cover patterns of these sites from 2003 to 2013 have also been analyzed
   by geospatial techniques. Moreover, a qualitative estimation of the
   products and services provided by these mangroves was performed through
   participatory appraisals among the local forest dependents to comprehend
   the level of economic sustenance achieved. Results indicate that the
   overall performance of the site managed by a non-governmental
   organization in collaboration with local forest dependents was better
   than the other two sites managed by Forest Department and joint
   state-community institution respectively. Proper recognition of the
   causes of forest degradation and subsequent creation of zonal
   plantations with respect to species associations and utilization
   patterns were identified as the prime determinants of comparative
   success of the former site. Restructuring of community institutions by
   strengthening participation of actual forest dependents in decision
   making was suggested to be beneficial for mangrove restoration of sites
   performing poorly. In general, adaptation of collaborative approaches
   towards addressing the issues of tenure rights, legitimate sharing of
   mangrove produces and services, conflict resolutions among and within
   these institutions were found to be imperative for resilient management
   of these mangroves.},

Title = {Urban Heat Island Mitigation through Planned Simulation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is caused by the anthropic
   alteration of the natural environment by urban expansion, its
   impermeable surfaces, and anthropic activities. In addition, urban
   morphology can also contribute to the increase in temperature in cities.
   The UHI effect can be described as an urban climate that is generally
   characterized by higher temperatures in densely built-up areas compared
   to surrounding areas. This effect impacts the environmental stress of
   the city and directly affects the health and quality of life of its
   inhabitants. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate resources to
   understand the UHI mechanism in cities in order to propose appropriate
   mitigation measures that will reduce energy consumption and improve
   living conditions. In this context, this research was aimed at analyzing
   the behavior of urban heat islands by replacing asphalt with cool paving
   materials (concrete) in roadways. Through computer simulations, using
   the ENVI-met software, the thermal variations of urban heat islands were
   examined. The city of Cuenca (Ecuador) was selected as the study area.
   The day of the analysis was 22 January 2020, which was recorded as the
   warmest day of the year, registering an average temperature of 16
   degrees C. The findings of this research evidenced that, by replacing
   asphalt pavements with concrete pavements in the analyzed zones, land
   surface temperature (LST) could be reduced by 8 degrees C and the global
   LST of the studied areas could be reduced by approximately 3 degrees C.
   Consequently, the mean air temperature of the study areas reflected a
   decrease of up to 0.83 degrees C.},

Abstract = {The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is a phenomenon whereby urban areas
   become warmer than their surrounding rural areas, due to the replacement
   of vegetation and soil with built surfaces. The increase in urban
   temperatures can increase energy demand for cooling buildings, elevate
   emissions of air pollutants, compromise health (overheating) and cause
   thermal discomfort. Road Pavement Solar Collector (RPSC) system is one
   of the UHI mitigation strategies that absorbs heat from the road surface
   and converting the heat into passive thermal energy. This work aims to
   determine the impact of the RPSC system on the urban air temperature
   using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) ANSYS Fluent 19.2 program.
   The modelling method was initially validated with a laboratory-scale
   RPSC system. The model was set using the weather and surface temperature
   data of the hot and humid city of Kuala Lumpur. The influence of the
   RPSC system embedment; within urban street canyons and outside of the
   street canyons was investigated. The study also assessed the influence
   of changing the urban street canyon configuration based on the length
   and the height of the building rows on the RPSC performance. Based on
   the conditions modelled and simulation results, the best performance was
   obtained by embedding the RPSC system within the long and deep street
   canyon. The results presented here also showed the potential of the RPSC
   system in mitigating the UHI effect during hot and calm nocturnal
   period. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Bahrain, as a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), is facing multiple
   environmental challenges intensified by natural and anthropogenic
   stressors. The unique environmental extremes accompanied by climate
   change vulnerability and anthropogenic impacts pose interlinked risks to
   the environment, society, and economy in Bahrain. This paper
   characterizes the main environmental challenges in Bahrain, including
   climate change, air quality, coastal urbanization, land -based
   discharges, oil pollution, and solid waste management. It is argued that
   technology can provide opportunities for effective environmental
   management. Studies utilized technology to detect and monitor changes in
   ecosystems, forecast and model expected impacts associated with climate
   change and pollution, and mitigate impacts on the environment are
   highlighted. Adopting such technologies can contribute to the resilience
   and sustainability in SIDS.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of vulnerability provides the foundation for developing
   actions that minimize impacts and supports system views that are
   particularly desirable. We modified a well-established model to assess
   and describe the vulnerability of the two major industries dependent on
   the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to extreme weather events. The modification
   entailed distinguishing between the properties that determine exposure,
   sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for both the ecological and the
   social components of a natural resource system. We surveyed 145
   commercial fishers and 62 tourism operators following a severe tropical
   cyclone and a major flooding event that extensively affected the region
   in 2011. Exposure of these industries included direct risk to life and
   infrastructure and indirect risk from loss of important ecosystem
   services. Our study found that many commercial fishers and marine-based
   tourism operators were sensitive to changes in the GBR's condition and
   limited in their adaptive capacity. However, those with smaller
   businesses, higher levels of occupational identity, place attachment,
   formal networks, and strategic approaches also had higher levels of
   adaptive capacity. These results suggest that resource users with higher
   sensitivity to change are not necessarily the most vulnerable;
   sensitivity may be offset by adaptive capacity. That is, while exposure
   and sensitivity determine the potential impact of a climate-induced
   change, adaptive capacity may be a major influence on the impacts that
   eventuate. We empirically show that adaptive capacity is an obvious
   focus for climate adaptation planning.},

Abstract = {The shoreline of Venezuela has, in general, been affected with very
   little concern for coastal hazards; human influence has been very
   important in terms of modifications and actions. This study contents the
   analysis of Venezuela's Central Coastline conditions and their
   evaluation since 1930's in terms of the perception of coastal hazards,
   susceptibility, and cost evaluation using California's Master Plan
   method. For this purpose, we have analysed a series of aerial pictures
   taken between late 1930's and 1995, site evaluations and historical
   events compilation. The total cost evaluation is then compared with the
   results given by the study of the anthropogenic caused losses. We have
   specially studied human influence on coastal hazards conditions. Our
   conclusions will provide information of the human influence on coastal
   hazards in Venezuela's Central Coastline; where mitigation measures
   could be undertaken through regulation and territorial ordination.},

Title = {Evaluating indicators of marsh vulnerability to sea level rise along a
   historical marsh loss gradient},
Journal = {EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2107-2117},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) is threatening coastal marshes, leading to
   large-scale marsh loss in several micro-tidal systems. Early recognition
   of marsh vulnerability to SLR is critical in these systems to aid
   managers to take appropriate restoration or mitigation measures.
   However, it is not clear if current marsh vulnerability indicators
   correctly assess long-term stability of the marsh system. In this study,
   two indicators of marsh stress were studied: (i) the skewness of the
   marsh elevation distribution, and (ii) the abundance of codominant
   species in mixtures. We combined high-precision elevation measurements
   (GPS), LiDAR imagery, vegetation surveys and water level measurements to
   study these indicators in an organogenic micro-tidal system (Blackwater
   River, Maryland, USA), where large-scale historical conversion from
   marshes to shallow ponds resulted in a gradient of increasing marsh
   loss. The two indicators reveal increasingly stressed marshes along the
   marsh loss gradient, but suggest that the field site with the most marsh
   loss seems to experience less stress. For the latter site, previous
   research indicates that wind waves generated on interior marsh ponds
   contribute to lateral erosion of surrounding marsh edges and hence marsh
   loss. The eroded marsh sediment might temporarily provide the remaining
   marshes with the necessary sediment to keep up with relative SLR.
   However, this is only a short-term alleviation, as lateral marsh edge
   erosion and sediment export lead to severe marsh loss in the long term.
   Our findings indicate that marsh elevation skewness and the abundance of
   codominant species in mixtures can be used to supplement existing marsh
   stress indicators, but that additional indices such as fetch length and
   the sediment budget should be included to account for lateral marsh
   erosion and sediment export and to correctly assess long-term stability
   of micro-tidal marshes. (c) 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Achieving food security in its totality continues to be a challenge not
   only for the developing nations, but also for the developed world. The
   difference lies in the magnitude of the problem in terms of its severity
   and proportion of the population affected. In developed nations the
   problem is alleviated by providing targeted food security interventions,
   including food aid in the form of direct food relief, food stamps, or
   indirectly through subsidized food production. Similar approaches are
   employed in developing countries but with less success. The discrepancy
   in the results may be due to insufficient resource base, shorter
   duration of intervention, or different systems most of which are
   inherently heterogeneous among other factors.
   In this study; results of regression model on production entitlement
   suggest that climate variability has relatively minor effects on food
   production. It shows moderate positive relationship but not significant;
   where temperature has more effects than that of rainfall on production.
   However the difference is statistically insignificant. The relatively
   minor impact of weather variations on food production, combined with the
   analysis of other qualitative analysis such as household survey,
   observation, discussions, participatory techniques and thematic
   interviews in Western Bagamoyo district, Coast region in Tanzania reveal
   how extreme climatic events affect rural food security entitlements of
   production, labor, exchange and trade. It also reveals households
   adaptation strategies implemented by the communities during
   droughts/floods which serve as a foundation for planning responses to
   future climate variability and change. Results of this study suggest
   that food security in Tanzania where droughts and floods are expected to
   become more severe due to climate change could be enhanced by adoption
   of Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practises to increase productivity,
   adaptation and mitigation of Green House gases (GHGs). It was revealed
   that agriculture as their main source of income contributes 69.7 \% of
   income to household's food security.},

Abstract = {Integrated coastal management (ICM) has been introduced and promoted
   globally for nearly half a century. About 12\% of China's coastline has
   now come under the ICM governance framework to address the environmental
   and management challenges. To test the effectiveness of ICM in China,
   three coastal cities that adopted the ICM framework were selected as
   case studies. The ICM indicators in terms of governance, environment and
   socioeconomic aspects were designed for quantitatively evaluating the
   ICM performance over a 9-year period from 2004 to 2012.The results
   showed that ICM performance based on governance, coastal environment and
   socioeconomic aspects in the three improved, indicating that the ICM
   approach can be effective in promoting the overall sustainability of
   China's coastal cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {AQUACULTURE REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {crab production, the term fattening is used when underweight
   soft-shelled crablets are stocked and reared for a few weeks until their
   gonad develops. Mud crab fattening has become a popular adaptation
   strategy in response climate change in coastal Bangladesh. This study
   aimed to estimate the profitability and resource use efficiency of mud
   crab fattening in coastal areas. Primary data were collected from 150
   randomly selected crab farmers. Descriptive statistics and the
   Cobb-Douglas production function were used to estimate mud crab
   fattening profitability and efficiency. Results of the study revealed
   that the variable and total costs of mud crab production were USD 4293
   and USD 6104, respectively. The net return amounted to USD 4418 per
   hectare, while the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was 1.72. Crablets, feed,
   and bamboo fencing (locally known as bana) positively affected the
   productivity. The optimal use of these resources could enhance resource
   use efficiency. Crab fattening was affected by some constraints,
   including disease infestation, poor quality of crablet, shortage of
   capital, and insufficient technical knowledge of production. Providing
   training on crab fattening and establishing sufficient numbers of
   crablet hatcheries could enhance the profitability and resource use
   efficiency of this farming.},

Abstract = {The frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as floods,

   adequately developed or understood. This article addresses this gap in
   knowledge with a model that identifies the organizational barriers to
   adapting infrastructure to climate change. Managers can use the model to
   also assess the vulnerability of their infrastructure to climate change.},

Title = {Quantifying Drivers of Coastal Forest Carbon Decline Highlights
   Opportunities for Targeted Human Interventions},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As coastal land use intensifies and sea levels rise, the fate of coastal
   forests becomes increasingly uncertain. Synergistic anthropogenic and
   natural pressures affect the extent and function of coastal forests,
   threatening valuable ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and
   storage. Quantifying the drivers of coastal forest degradation is
   requisite to effective and targeted adaptation and management. However,
   disentangling the drivers and their relative contributions at a
   landscape scale is difficult, due to spatial dependencies and
   nonstationarity in the socio-spatial processes causing degradation. We
   used nonspatial and spatial regression approaches to quantify the
   relative contributions of sea level rise, natural disturbances, and land
   use activities on coastal forest degradation, as measured by decadal
   aboveground carbon declines. We measured aboveground carbon declines
   using time-series analysis of satellite and light detection and ranging
   (LiDAR) imagery between 2001 and 2014 in a low-lying coastal region
   experiencing synergistic natural and anthropogenic pressures. We used
   nonspatial (ordinary least squares regression-OLS) and spatial
   (geographically weighted regression-GWR) models to quantify
   relationships between drivers and aboveground carbon declines. Using
   locally specific parameter estimates from GWR, we predicted potential
   future carbon declines under sea level rise inundation scenarios. From
   both the spatial and nonspatial regression models, we found that land
   use activities and natural disturbances had the highest measures of
   relative importance (together representing 94\% of the model's
   explanatory power), explaining more variation in carbon declines than
   sea level rise metrics such as salinity and distance to the estuarine
   shoreline. However, through the spatial regression approach, we found
   spatial heterogeneity in the relative contributions to carbon declines,
   with sea level rise metrics contributing more to carbon declines closer
   to the shore. Overlaying our aboveground carbon maps with sea level rise
   inundation models we found associated losses in total aboveground
   carbon, measured in teragrams of carbon (TgC), ranged from 2.9 +/- 0.1
   TgC (for a 0.3 m rise in sea level) to 8.6 +/- 0.3 TgC (1.8 m rise). Our
   predictions indicated that on the remaining non-inundated landscape,
   potential carbon declines increased from 29\% to 32\% between a 0.3 and
   1.8 m rise in sea level. By accounting for spatial nonstationarity in
   our drivers, we provide information on site-specific relationships at a
   regional scale, allowing for more targeted management planning and
   intervention. Accordingly, our regional-scale assessment can inform
   policy, planning, and adaptation solutions for more effective and
   targeted management of valuable coastal forests.},

Title = {Flat oyster fishery management during a time with fluctuating population
   size},
Journal = {AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Wild populations of the native European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) are
   nowadays rare. Worldwide, flat oyster populations have declined due to
   overexploitation, diseases and pollution. Yet, in the Limfjorden,
   Denmark, a small but persistent population of wild flat oyster have
   endured for more than 165 years, which has sustained a unique fishery on
   wild oyster beds. Over time, fluctuations in the wild population size
   has had implications for the fishery, alternating between a large
   population with high yields, and too small to withstand a fishery. The
   flat oyster fishery has been alleged to cause these unpredictable
   fluctuations in the population. However, the combined effect of natural
   variation (e.g. water temperature) and the fishery has not been
   investigated. Here we indicate that summer water temperature is an
   important factor causing fluctuations in the flat oyster population,
   thought to be due to its influence on recruitment success. Whereas the
   fishery often constitutes a minor part of the net oyster mortality. We
   found a positive correlation between summer water temperature and
   increased oyster landings >= 5 years later. Our results demonstrate the
   importance of adaptive management for the oyster fishery in the
   Limfjorden, which has ensured the survival of the flat oyster
   population, even when the oyster population has been low. These results
   highlight that management based on annual stock assessments, closed
   areas with brood stock, and dynamic annual total allowable catch, can
   ensure the persistence of an endangered oyster species and support a
   sustainable fishery.},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Dunwich-Walberswick gravel-dominated barrier system is one of many
   such systems in England and Wales which have been managed over the last
   40 years for the purposes of flood risk management and habitat
   conservation. Since the early 1990s it has become increasing difficult
   to repair the barrier after storms and to maintain an effective flood
   defence. The central part of the barrier has progressively lost
   sediment, leading to increased risk of wave overtopping and breaching. A
   significant, although not extreme, storm on 31 October-1 November 2006
   flattened a 2-km section of the barrier. During the summer of 2007
   insufficient sediment returned to the beach and it was not possible to
   rebuild the bank to its original standard. Further washover and
   breaching occurred during 2007. Artificial maintenance of the barrier as
   an effective flood defence is now considered to be unsustainable,
   especially when the effects of climate change are considered.
   Consequently there is a need to develop adaptive strategies which take
   account of the fact that existing habitat of high conservation value
   will be lost, resulting in a need to create compensatory habitat
   elsewhere.},

Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {188-199},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Fishing communities are increasingly required to adapt to
   environmentally driven changes in the availability of fish stocks. Here,
   we examined trends in the distribution and biomass of five commercial
   target species (dover sole, thornyheads, sablefish, lingcod, and petrale
   sole) on the US west coast to determine how their availability to
   fishing ports changed over 40years. We show that the timing and
   magnitude of stock declines and recoveries are not experienced uniformly
   along the coast when they coincide with shifts in species distributions.
   For example, overall stock availability of sablefish was more stable in
   southern latitudes where a 40\% regional decline in biomass was
   counterbalanced by a southward shift in distribution of >200km since
   2003. Greater vessel mobility and larger areal extent of fish habitat
   along the continental shelf buffered northerly ports from latitudinal
   changes in stock availability. Landings were not consistently related to
   stock availability, suggesting that social, economic, and regulatory
   factors likely constrain or facilitate the capacity for fishers to adapt
   to changes in fish availability. Coupled social-ecological analyses such
   as the one presented here are important for defining community
   vulnerability to current and future changes in the availability of
   important marine species.},

Title = {Glass eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) behaviour after artificial intake by
   adjusted tidal barrage management},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {249},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Tidal barrages on water ways constitute a major threat for diadromous
   fish species such as the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla
   anguilla L.). An unobstructed migration route between the spawning area
   in the Sargasso Sea and the freshwater growth habitats in Europe is
   crucial for the European eels' long-term survival. Every spring however,
   millions of glass eels arrive at the European coast to find their inland
   migration route blocked. Adjusted tidal barrage management (ATBM), i.e.
   setting the tidal sluice doors ajar during tidal rise, is one of the
   mitigation measures to enhance glass eel colonisation. Although this
   management substantially improves the number of incoming glass eels, the
   fate of these migrants, confronted with abruptly shifting conditions
   upon sluice passage, remains un-investigated. Glass eel upstream
   dispersion after sluice passage by means of ATBM was investigated in a
   drainage canal connecting a small estuary with an adjacent polder area
   in Belgium. Large numbers of glass eel caught with eel ladders installed
   at a pumping station about 800 m upstream the tidal barrage indicate
   that glass eels were well able to switch to an active counter current
   swimming behaviour to continue upstream dispersion. On the other hand,
   some glass eels did not initiate active migration but settled in
   artificial substrates placed in the canal instead. These residents
   however appeared very successful in using the canal as feeding ground
   and in time substantially increased their overall fitness. The
   appearance of both migration strategies (switch to active migration or
   successful settlement) in this canal shows the potential of ATBM as a
   valuable tool for the management and restoration of the European eel
   population and calls for a wide application of this cost-efficient
   mitigation measure.},

Abstract = {Global marine fisheries production has reached a maximum and may even be
   declining. Underlying this trend is a well-understood sequence of
   development, overexploitation, depletion and in some instances collapse
   of individual fish stocks, a pattern that can sequentially link
   geographically distant populations. Ineffective governance, economic
   considerations and climate impacts are often responsible for this
   sequence, although the relative contribution of each factor is
   contentious. In this paper we use a global bioeconomic model to explore
   the synergistic effects of climate variability, economic pressures and
   management measures in causing or avoiding this sequence. The model
   shows how a combination of climate-induced variability in the underlying
   fish population production, particular patterns of demand for fish
   products and inadequate management is capable of driving the world's
   fisheries into development, overexploitation, collapse and recovery
   phases consistent with observations. Furthermore, it demonstrates how a
   sequential pattern of overexploitation can emerge as an endogenous
   property of the interaction between regional environmental fluctuations
   and a globalized trade system. This situation is avoidable through
   adaptive management measures that ensure the sustainability of regional
   production systems in the face of increasing global environmental change
   and markets. It is concluded that global management measures are needed
   to ensure that global food supply from marine products is optimized
   while protecting long-term ecosystem services across the world's oceans.},

Abstract = {Climate is a critical driver of many fish populations, assemblages, and
   aquatic communities. However, direct observational studies of climate
   change impacts on North American inland fishes are rare. In this

   peer-reviewed studies of documented climate change effects on North
   American inland fish populations and assemblages, and (3) highlight four
   case studies representing a variety of observed responses ranging from
   warmwater systems in the southwestern and southeastern United States to
   coldwater systems along the Pacific Coast and Canadian Shield. We
   conclude by identifying key data gaps and research needs to inform
   adaptive, ecosystem-based approaches to managing North American inland

Abstract = {When considering cities such as Lisbon, which due to their Koppen Geiger
   classification of `Csa', witness hot and dry summers, the translation of
   local bottom-up knowhow upon climatic guidelines has been a topic of
   considerable dissemination over recent years.
   Depicting upon a concrete case study located in Lisbon's historical
   quarter, the results from a previous bio-climatic study undertaken by
   the authors were taken further in order to consider how
   worst-case-scenarios of climate change (A1FI/RCP8.5) could potentially
   impact the existing human thermal environment within the square. In
   addition to considering its existing layout, public space design
   interventions were also examined within different thermal/temporal
   scenarios through the use the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature
   (PET) and PET(Load) indices.
   The results of the study revealed that within a climatic
   worse-case-scenario, and without any adaptive measures to address
   Physiological Stress (PS) levels, the majority of the square presented
   potential PS thresholds ranging between `Extreme Heat Stress Lv.3/4',
   with PET values exceeding that of 51 degrees C and 56 degrees C. On the
   other hand, and particularly in regions prone to high levels of solar
   radiation, the thermal amelioration effects of the proposed public space
   design interventions presented reductions of PET values up to 16.6
   degrees C.},

Abstract = {Climate change and sea-level rise are increasingly leading to higher and
   prolonged high tides, which, in combination with the growing intensity
   of rainfall and storm surges, and insufficient drainage infrastructure,
   result in frequent recurrent flooding in coastal cities. There is a
   pressing need to understand the occurrence of roadway flooding incidents
   in order to enact appropriate mitigation measures. Agency data for
   roadway flooding events are scarce and resource-intensive to collect.
   Crowdsourced data can provide a low-cost alternative for mapping roadway
   flood incidents in real time; however, the reliability is questionable.
   This research demonstrates a framework for asserting trustworthiness on
   crowdsourced flood incident data in a case study of Norfolk, Virginia.
   Publicly available (but spatially limited) flood incident data from the
   city in combination with different environmental and topographical
   factors are used to create a logistic regression model to predict the
   probability of roadway flooding at any location on the roadway network.
   The prediction accuracy of the model was found to be 90.5\%. When
   applying this model to crowdsourced Waze flood incident data, 71.7\% of
   the reports were predicted to be trustworthy. This study demonstrates
   the potential for using Waze incident report data for roadway flooding
   detection, providing a framework for cities to identify trustworthy
   reports in real time to enable rapid situation assessment and mitigation
   to reduce incident impact.},

Abstract = {The UK has been one of the early actors in developing adaptation to
   climate change, and today has a comprehensive legislative and regulative
   framework for including climate change effects in planning This chapter
   reviews the development of the UK approach, drawing on a literature
   study and semi-structured interviews conducted with several actors, the
   majority of whom are from public administration at the national,
   regional and local levels The study focuses on England and the
   South-East England region in particular, one of the areas most at risk
   of flooding and sea level rise in the UK In addition to discussing the
   national and regional levels, the chapter describes how adaptation has
   been integrated in a number of counties, cities and boroughs in the area
   All in all, the study reveals a relatively developed approach to
   adaptation, made possible in part as a result of both the recognised
   sensitivity of selected areas to climate change and the centralised
   nature of the political system Centralised as well as network capacities
   of the central government have made it possible for the national level
   to both include adaptation criteria in the performance assessment
   framework for local authorities, and for these to be broadly accepted

Title = {Using in situ management to conserve biodiversity under climate change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {885-894},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Successful conservation will increasingly depend on our ability to
   help species cope with climate change. While there has been much
   attention on accommodating or assisting range shifts, less has been
   given to the alternative strategy of helping species survive climate
   change through in situ management.
   2. Here we provide a synthesis of published evidence examining whether
   habitat management can be used to offset the adverse impacts on
   biodiversity of changes in temperature, water availability and sea-level
   rise. Our focus is on practical methods whereby the local environmental
   conditions experienced by organisms can be made more suitable.
   3. Many studies suggest that manipulating vegetation structure can alter
   the temperature and moisture conditions experienced by organisms, and
   several demonstrate that these altered conditions benefit species as
   regional climatic conditions become unsuitable. The effects of
   topography on local climatic conditions are even better understood, but
   the alteration of topography as a climate adaptation tool is not
   ingrained in conservation practice. Trials of topographic alteration in
   the field should therefore be a priority for future research.
   4. Coastal systems have the natural capacity to keep pace with climate
   change, but require sufficient sediment supplies and space for landward
   migration to do so. There is an extensive literature on managed
   realignment. While the underlying rationale is simple, successful
   implementation requires careful consideration of elevation and past land
   use. Even with careful management, restored habitats may not attain the
   physical and biological attributes of natural habitats.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The recent literature provides a
   compelling case that some of the adverse effects of climate change can
   be offset by appropriate management. However, much of the evidence for
   this is indirect and too few studies provide empirical tests of the
   long-term effectiveness of these management interventions. It is clear
   from the existing evidence that some techniques have a higher risk of
   failure or unexpected outcomes than others and managers will need to
   make careful choices about which to implement. We have assessed the
   strength of evidence of these approaches in order to demonstrate to
   conservation professionals the risks involved.},

Title = {Ciguatera Fish Poisoning: The Risk from an Aotearoa/New Zealand
   Perspective},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa species have been identified in Aotearoa/New
   Zealand's coastal waters and G. polynesiensis, a known producer of
   ciguatoxins, has been isolated from Rangitahua/Kermadec Islands (a New
   Zealand territory). The warming of the Tasman Sea and the waters around
   New Zealand's northern subtropical coastline heighten the risk of
   Gambierdiscus proliferating in New Zealand. If this occurs, the risk of
   ciguatera fish poisoning due to consumption of locally caught fish will
   increase. Research, including the development and testing of sampling
   methods, molecular assays, and chemical and toxicity tests, will
   continue. Reliable monitoring strategies are important to manage and
   mitigate the risk posed by this emerging threat. The research approaches
   that have been made, many of which will continue, are summarised in this
   review.},

Pages = {175-183},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {An analysis of climate change impacts on the level of agricultural
   production is presented based on long-term experimental data on yields
   of crops grown in different soils and climatic zones. Mathematical
   models combining available data on the biology of agricultural crops and
   their response to climatic conditions have been used. The principle of
   maximum plant productivity is the basis of this modelling effort. The
   potential and meteorologically possible yields under existing
   environmental conditions were calculated using the potato dynamic model
   POMOD. The analyses were completed under different climate change
   scenarios. According to the climate change scenarios HADCM2 and
   ECHAM3TR, mean potato yields will increase by about 6 to 8\%. The yield
   increase is larger (10 to 16\%) on coastal islands and in North Estonia.
   A new approach and classification of micro-climate geo-complexes was
   developed. Agricultural production was found to be highly sensitive to
   micro-climatic variations. The proposed approach permits more objective
   use of meteorological data in changing climatic conditions. Shifts in
   agroclimate were established using this modelling approach. The sums of
   degree-days, particularly above 0 and 5 degreesC, have significantly
   risen during the period 1807-1995. The development of potato varieties
   adapted to a changing climate is possible. A strategy for adaptation of
   agriculture to climate change is presented.},

Abstract = {The Denny Way/Lake Union CSO Control Project includes three short
   tunnels constructed under active railroad tracks and the Mercer Street
   Tunnel constructed in a densely populated urban setting. Tunneling was
   conducted in recent glacial and modern fill deposits
   During planning and design, tunneling risks were evaluated. These
   included groundwater inflow, ground settlement, running sands, boulders,
   methane, highly plastic silt, railroad ballast, and buried obstructions
   such as wooden piles, railroad trestles, shoreline sea walls, concrete,
   and other construction debris. Risk registers were prepared to evaluate
   the potential severities, ramifications, frequencies, mitigation
   measures, and expected costs. A Monte Carlo simulation addressed the
   probabilistic aspects of these risks. These studies led to key decisions
   incorporated into the project contract documents. During construction of
   the tunnels, some of the predicted risks were realized and managed. A
   comparison between the predicted and actual risks has been assembled and
   is the subject of this paper.},

Title = {A numerical modeling approach to support decision-making on design of
   integrated multitrophic aquaculture for efficiently mitigating aquatic
   waste},
Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1247-1261},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a bio-mitigation strategy of aquafarming pollutants, the integrated
   multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) system has been proposed and developed
   to mitigate the waste produced during co-cultivation. Although there
   have been considerable implementations of IMTA worldwide, its optimal
   design needs a further study. Through a numerical modeling approach,
   this study aims to facilitate decision-making when designing IMTA to
   more efficiently mitigate the negative change caused by aquaculture. An
   improved three-dimensional numerical model is adopted to simulate the
   dynamics of water current and organic waste in Gokasho Bay, Japan.
   Results show that (1) the maximum main surface water current velocity in
   Hazama-ura area is less than 10 cm s(-1), where nutrient absorbers
   and/or suspended feeders can easily attach to a substratum; (2)
   southern-eastern direction water flow is dominant through the year
   suggesting that seaweeds (e.g., Laminaria japonica, Ulva ohnoi) or
   mussels (e.g., Mytilus edulis) are better arranged in the same
   direction; (3) horizontal distribution of organic waste on sea bottom
   indicates that when releasing sea cucumbers (e.g., Apostichopus
   japonicus), priority is given to the areas where the accumulated amount
   of particulate organic waste is high. Our case study provides a general
   idea on the optimal design of IMTA and can be scaled to the globe,
   especially regarding decision-making on locations for the extractive
   organisms. In conclusion, to improve the bio-mitigation efficiency of
   IMTA, location for nutrient absorbers and/or suspended feeders can be
   selected based on local water flow, and sea cucumbers need to be placed
   with a careful consideration of the waste distribution in local area.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {132},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-222},

Abstract = {The Mekong Delta, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change,
   is the focus of international action for adaptation. Improved
   understanding of the exposures and perceptions at the local level will
   help residents to cope with natural disasters and future climate
   disruptions. In this study, we assess the exposure to floods that rural
   communities across the Mekong Delta are facing. Among the various
   natural disasters threatening the delta, extreme flooding is by far the
   most prevailing concern. By carrying out a field survey on 1350
   residents, we characterize the flooding patterns and vulnerabilities of
   households in three geographically diverse provinces. The aim of this
   study is to assess the effectiveness of current flood adaptation in
   these households in conditions of regular flooding, as well as to
   extreme flooding events, which become more intense and frequent due to
   climate change. While the findings suggest varying degrees of coping
   with seasonal flooding by raising the ground floors of their homes,
   their capacity to prepare for extreme floods is limited in spite of the
   residents' awareness of the changing dynamics of natural disasters in
   their locality. We also examine their perception to the effects of
   climate change and identify factors that influence their awareness.},

Title = {Influence of patch size on hydrodynamic flow in submerged aquatic
   vegetation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Blue carbon, or carbon dioxide captured and stored by submerged aquatic
   vegetation (SAV) in ecosystems, has been attracting attention as a
   measure to mitigate climate change. Since the scale of SAV meadows is
   smaller than that of topography length scale, with the former often
   occurring in patches, the flexibilities of SAV motion induce complicated
   interactions with water flows and make it difficult to estimate carbon
   sequestration rates. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the
   influences of SAV patches on water flows and mass transport using
   laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. An SAV model was
   successfully applied to analyze the results of laboratory experiments,
   revealing good agreement and showing that the size of an SAV patch
   significantly affects the water flows. The extent to which the patch
   occupies the channel width was revealed to be the most substantial
   factor in controlling carbon absorption by SAV, and deflection was found
   to be another significant factor. Implementing global warming
   countermeasures is a critical goal of climate change mitigation, so our
   study outcome is expected to be helpful for improving and promoting blue
   carbon as a negative emission strategy.},

Title = {The Rising Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War:

   Disruption},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {This perspective paper explores the rising impacts of the COVID-19 and
   the Russia-Ukraine war from different perspectives, with an emphasis on
   the role of climate financing in achieving equitable and just transition
   mechanisms and that of peace in expediting this pursuit and sustaining
   this drive. It is motivated by the realization that there is an urgent
   need for accelerating the decarbonisation agenda, as highlighted in
   pre-COP26 debates and in the resulting Glasgow Climate Pact, through the
   mitigation measures that can be unpacked at both cost and scale. This is
   further reiterated in the third instalment of Assessment Report 6 (AR6)
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, dwelling on
   Mitigation of Climate Change, underlining the required policy shifts and
   technology developmental needs. Green technology, however, comes at a
   green premium, being more expensive to implement in geographies that
   cannot absorb its cost in the immediate short term. This engenders an
   inequitable and unjust landscape, as those that require green technology
   are unable to have access to it but are most often on the frontlines of
   the impacts of climate change. While it is urgent to review this issue
   and to encourage more cooperation for technology development and
   transfer, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war are posing
   mounting challenges for achieving these objectives. These two crises are
   causing an unprecedented rise in commodities and labour pricing, with
   further knock-on impacts on global supply chains for technology. This is
   in turn rendering green technology unattainable for developing and less
   developed countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).},

Volume = {509},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {260-262},

Abstract = {Important scientific advances have been made over the last decade in
   identifying the environmental fate of mercury and the processes that
   control its cycling in the Canadian Arctic. This special issue includes
   a series of six detailed reviews that summarize the main findings of a
   scientific assessment undertaken by the Government of Canada's Northern
   Contaminants Program. It was the first assessment to focus exclusively
   on mercury pollution in the Canadian Arctic. Key findings, as detailed
   in the reviews, relate to sources and long-range transport of mercury to
   the Canadian Arctic, its cycling within marine, freshwater, and
   terrestrial environments, and its bioaccumulation in, and effects on,
   the biota that live there. While these accomplishments are significant,
   the complex nature of the mercury cycle continues to provide challenges
   in characterizing and quantifying the relationships of mercury sources
   and transport processes with mercury levels in biota and biological
   effects of mercury exposure. Of particular concern are large
   uncertainties in our understanding of the processes that are
   contributing to increasing mercury concentrations in some Arctic fish
   and wildlife. Specific recommendations are provided for future research
   and monitoring of the environmental impacts of anthropogenic mercury
   emissions, influences of climate change, and the effectiveness of
   mitigation strategies for mercury in the Canadian Arctic. Crown

Title = {Complex interactions in a rapidly changing world: responses of rocky

Abstract = {Warming of the planet has accelerated in recent years and is predicted
   to continue over the next 50 to 100 yr. Evidence of responses to present
   warming in marine ecosystems include Shifts in the geographic range of
   species as well as in the composition of pelagic and demersal fish,
   benthic and intertidal assemblages, Here we provide a review of the
   changes, in geographic distributions and population abundance of species
   detected on rocky shores of the NE Atlantic over the last 60 yr. This
   period encompassed the warm 1950s, a colder period between 1963 and the
   late 1980s and the recent period of accelerating warming to levels above
   those of the 1950s. The likely consequences of these responses are then
   explored. To do this, a summary of the dynamic balance between grazers,
   macroalgae and barnacles in structuring mid-shore communities is given
   before outlining experimental work on interactions between key
   components of rocky shore communities. Modelling and quantitative
   forecasting were used to predict changes in community composition and
   dynamics in a warmer world and their consequences for ecosystem
   functioning discussed. We then identify areas that need further work
   before making a case for the use of rocky shore species not just as
   inexpensive indicators of change offshore, but as tractable models to
   explore the direct and indirect effects of climate change in marine and
   coastal ecosystems, We also provide a societal perspective emphasising
   the value of long-term Studies in informing adaptation to climate
   change.},

Title = {Non-optimum temperature-related mortality burden in China: Ad-dressing
   the dual influences of climate change and urban heat islands},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {782},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Under the dual effects of climate change and urban heat islands (UHI),
   non-optimum temperature-related mor-tality burdens are complex and
   uncertain, and are rarely discussed in China. In this study, by applying
   city-specific exposure-response functions to multiple temperature and
   population projections under different climate and urbanization
   scenarios, we comprehensively assessed the non-optimum
   temperature-related mortality bur-dens in China from 2000 to 2050. Our
   results showed that temperature-related deaths will decrease from 1.19
   million in 2010 to 1.08-1.17 million in 2050, with the exception of the
   most populous scenario. Excess deaths at-tributable to non-optimal
   temperatures under representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)
   were 2.35\% greater than those under RCP4.5. This indicates that the
   surge in heat-related deaths caused by climate change will be offset by
   the reduction in cold-related deaths. As the climate changes, high-risk
   areas will be confronted with more severe health challenges, which
   requires health protection resource relocation strategies.
   Simulta-neously, the net effects of UHIs are beneficial in the
   historical periods, preventing 3493 (95\% CI: 22-6964) deaths in 2000.
   But UHIs will cause an additional 6951 (95\% CI: -17,637-31,539,
   SSP4-RCP4.5) to 17,041 (95\% CI: -10,516-44,598, SSP5-RCP8.5) deaths in
   2050. The heavier health burden in RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 indicates that a
   warmer climate aggravates the negative effects of UHIs. Considering the
   synergistic behavior of climate change and UHIs, UHI mitigation
   strategies should not be developed without considering climate change.
   More-over, the mortality burden exhibited strong spatial variations,
   with heavy burdens concentrated in the hotspots including
   Beijing-Tianjin Metropolitan Region, Yangtze River Delta,
   Chengdu-Chongqing City Group, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shandong, and
   Henan. These hotspots should be priority areas for the allocation of the
   national medical resources to provide effective public health
   interventions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Vertical Datum Transformations across the Australian Littoral Zone},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-128},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is a growing demand in Australia for better information to assess
   the risks associated with sea-level rise and coastal inundation.
   Seamless elevation data across the littoral zone is an essential
   requirement for the assessment of coastal risks and the development of
   adaptation and mitigation strategies. Seamless coastal data products
   require the integration of topographic data with offshore bathymetric
   data. A prerequisite for the integration process is that the respective
   elevation data sets be related to the same vertical datum. This article
   discusses the development of a vertical datum transformation approach to
   facilitate the creation of seamless elevation data sets across the
   Australian littoral zone, with a focus on the challenges unique to
   Australia. Review of international projects, research into the relevant
   concepts, and an investigation of the data sets available in Australia
   led to the adoption of an ellipsoid-based transformation approach. Mean
   sea-level heights related to the ellipsoid and derived from coastal tide
   gauges were used to enhance a satellite altimetry derived mean sea
   surface. Other tidal datums were modelled through hydrodynamic
   modelling, and the Australian Height Datum was achieved via Australia's
   current geoid model: AUSGeoid09. Although a transformation procedure has
   been developed, the current status and availability of Australian tide
   gauge data prevent the production of a suitably accurate and reliable
   vertical datum transformation software tool that provides full coverage
   of the Australian coast. To produce such a tool, Australia requires the
   collation of existing tide gauge data and metadata, a repository to
   store that data, an ellipsoid height survey of all tide gauges, and a
   denser network of tide gauges.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1044-1046},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Long-term investment to drive the adoption of precautionary, adaptive
   and resilience-building fisheries management measures is urgently
   required, especially given the financially difficult transition period
   to reach sustainable fisheries. In this paper a case for investing in
   the recovery of large marine ecosystems is provided based on the future
   value of recovered fish stocks. It is argued that the current
   market-based sustainable seafood movement alone will not affect the
   scale of change needed and must be complemented by investment in
   fundamental conservation measures that will lead to the recovery of
   marine ecosystems and promote long-term sustainable use. A rationale for
   addressing the economically challenging transition period is provided
   and the basis of a new financial institution to finance the measures
   necessary for realising the economic, social and environmental benefits
   of large-scale fisheries reform is proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Local Authority Responses to Climate Change in South Africa: The
   Challenges of Transboundary Governance},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recent progress and innovation are testament to the willingness of
   municipal authorities to address climate change. However, urban regions
   worldwide exhibit an immense diversity of conditions, capabilities and
   responses to the challenges of changing climatic conditions. While
   separated by politico-administrative borders, adjacent municipalities
   within such regions are connected through biophysical,
   politico-economic, and social systems likely to be reconfigured under
   changing climatic/environmental conditions. Yet, to date,
   politico-administrative borders have largely determined the parameters
   of local government climate change adaptation strategies, with
   insufficient attention to the role of inter-municipal collaboration,
   especially between neighbouring rural, peri-urban and urban
   municipalities, for co-ordinating such policies and interventions.
   Within a multi-level governance framework, this paper considers the
   recent evolution of climate agendas in the eThekwini (formerly Durban
   City Council) metropolitan municipality and the adjacent Ugu
   (predominantly rural) district municipality on the south coast of
   KwaZulu-Natal province (KZN), South Africa, focusing particularly on
   cross-border collaboration within the greater city region. The
   challenges were investigated by means of 53 in-depth, semi-structured
   interviews with municipal, regional and local authority association
   staff in November 2009, March 2012, and August 2017. Our core argument
   is that weak inter-municipal collaboration, particularly between urban,
   peri-urban and rural areas within metropolitan and functional city
   regions, has been a significant impediment to realizing transformative
   adaptation within such regions. The experiences of these two contiguous
   yet contrasting municipalities represent a microcosm of the dramatic
   discontinuities and inequalities on all variables within adjacent urban
   metropolitan and rural contexts in South Africa and beyond. Despite
   promising recent signs, the challenges of inter-municipal collaborative
   action are therefore formidable.},

Title = {Climate-induced community relocations: using integrated
   social-ecological assessments to foster adaptation and resilience},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events coupled with sea level rise and erosion will
   cause coastal and riverine areas where people live and maintain
   livelihoods to disappear permanently. Adaptation to these environmental
   changes, including the permanent relocation of millions of people,
   requires new governance tools. In the USA, local governments, often with
   state-level and national-level support, will be primarily responsible
   for protecting residents from climate-change impacts and implementing
   policies needed to protect their welfare. Government agencies have a
   variety of tools to facilitate protection in place and managed coastal
   retreat but have very limited tools to facilitate community relocation.
   In addition, no institutional mechanism currently exists to determine
   whether and when preventive relocation needs to occur to protect people
   from climate change impacts. Based on research involving four Alaska
   Native communities threatened by climate-induced environmental impacts,
   I propose the design and implementation of an adaptive governance
   framework to respond to the need to relocate populations. In this
   context, adaptive governance means the ability of institutions to
   dynamically respond to climate change impacts. A component of this
   adaptive governance framework is a social-ecological monitoring and
   assessment tool that can facilitate collaborative knowledge production
   by community residents and governance institutions to guide sustainable
   adaptation strategies and determine whether and when relocation needs to
   occur. The framework, including the monitoring and assessment tool, has
   not been systematically tested. However, the potential use of this tool
   is discussed by drawing on empirical examples of Alaskan communities
   faced with accelerating rates of erosion.},

Title = {Evaluating the impacts of greening scenarios on thermal comfort and
   energy and water consumptions for adapting Paris city to climate change},

Abstract = {Recent climate projections predict an amplification of global warming
   and more frequent extreme events such as heat waves. Therefore, the
   adaptation of cities to counterbalance these adverse changes is urgent.
   Among available adaptation strategies, urban greening is a measure that
   is frequently encouraged to improve thermal comfort or energy demand,
   but whose impacts are not well known at the scale of cities. In this
   study we evaluate the effects of various urban greening scenarios based
   on urban climate simulations across the Paris area. The modelling relies
   on the Town Energy Balance model. The scenarios tested consist of an
   increase in ground-based vegetation or an implementation of green roofs
   on compatible buildings, or the two combined. Results show that
   increasing the ground cover has a stronger cooling impact than
   implementing green roofs on street temperatures, and even more so when
   the greening rate and the proportion of trees are important. Green roofs
   are however the most effective way to reduce energy consumption, not
   only in summer but also on an annual basis. The effects the various
   greening measures may have over different seasons is finally addressed
   in order to draw up a comprehensive inventory of the climatic impacts of
   such strategies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cool Pavement Strategies for Urban Heat Island Mitigation in Suburban
   Phoenix, Arizona},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban areas are characterized by a large proportion of artificial
   surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt, which absorb and store more heat
   than natural vegetation, leading to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect.
   Cool pavements, walls, and roofs have been suggested as a solution to
   mitigate UHI, but their effectiveness depends on local land-use patterns
   and surrounding urban forms. Meteorological data was collected using a
   mobile platform in the Power Ranch community of Gilbert, Arizona in the
   Phoenix Metropolitan Area, a region that experiences harsh summer
   temperatures. The warmest hour recorded during data collection was 13
   August 2015 at 5:00 p.m., with a far-field air temperature of about 42
   degrees C and a low wind speed of 0.45 m/s from East-Southeast (ESE). An
   uncoupled pavement-urban canyon Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model
   was developed and validated to study the microclimate of the area. Five
   scenarios were studied to investigate the effects of different pavements
   on UHI, replacing all pavements with surfaces of progressively higher
   albedo: New asphalt concrete, typical concrete, reflective concrete,
   making only roofs and walls reflective, and finally replacing all
   artificial surfaces with a reflective coating. While new asphalt
   surfaces increased the surrounding 2 m air temperatures by up to 0.5
   degrees C, replacing aged asphalt with typical concrete with higher
   albedo did not significantly decrease it. Reflective concrete pavements
   decreased air temperature by 0.2-0.4 degrees C and reflective roofs and
   walls by 0.4-0.7 degrees C, while replacing all roofs, walls, and
   pavements with a reflective coating led to a more significant decrease,
   of up to 0.8-1.0 degrees C. Residences downstream of major collector
   roads experienced a decreased air temperature at the higher end of these
   ranges. However, large areas of natural surfaces for this community had
   a significant effect on downstream air temperatures, which limits the
   UHI mitigation potential of these strategies.},

Title = {Funding coastal and marine fisheries projects under the climate change
   regime},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {107},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The oceans and fisheries are strongly impacted by climate change and
   acidification, and will increasingly be so. Four multilateral funds have
   been created under the climate change regime in order to support
   developing countries' adaptation. These funds finance a number of
   projects mostly or partly related to marine and coastal fisheries. They
   include measures of a structural nature meant to modify laws, policies
   or strategies and to improve one's understanding of climate change
   impacts on fisheries; measures to improve fish stocks' resilience to
   climate change, by reducing harvesting and ecosystem-related stressors;
   and measures to improve fishing communities' resilience in terms of food
   security and livelihoods. A majority of the marine fisheries projects
   focuses on the countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of
   climate change on marine fisheries. However, many vulnerable countries
   still do not receive financial support for adaptation in the marine
   fisheries sector. The four multilateral funds operate with insufficient
   and unequal levels of transparency regarding several stages of projects'
   cycles; this raises issues of efficiency and accountability. The four
   funds also do not provide a harmonized and searchable marker dedicated
   to fisheries; this lack of transparency makes it impossible for the
   international community to comprehensively monitor progress in the
   implementation of Sustainable Development Goals 13 and 14. In any case,
   the existence of adaptation projects focused on coastal and marine
   fisheries may serve to promote the mainstreaming of ocean-related
   questions into the climate change regime.},

Abstract = {Windows delineating tolerable or ``acceptable{''} conditions associated

   a preliminary window offered by the Scientific Advisory Council on
   Global Change of the Federal Government of Germany sets limits on
   temperature change and the rate of temperature change. Investment in
   adaptation can alter the size and shape of these windows, and different
   emissions trajectories are associated with different limiting points on
   their boundaries. As a result, the value of adaptation depends upon both
   the underlying structure of the tolerable window and the basecase
   emissions trajectory. Given uncertainty about both, the best near-term
   policy should be cast in a sequential decision-making framework. Seen in
   this light, improved adaptive potential can either reduce the cost of
   sustaining tolerable climate change or increase the opportunity cost of
   holding to more restrictive boundaries.},

Title = {Mangrove Carbon Stocks and Ecosystem Cover Dynamics in Southwest
   Madagascar and the Implications for Local Management},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Of the numerous ecosystem services mangroves provide, carbon storage is
   gaining particular attention for its potential role in climate change
   mitigation strategies. Madagascar contains 2\% of the world's mangroves,
   over 20\% of which is estimated to have been deforested through charcoal
   production, timber extraction and agricultural development. This study
   presents a carbon stock assessment of the mangroves in Helodrano
   Fagnemotse in southwest Madagascar alongside an analysis of mangrove
   land-cover change from 2002 to 2014. Similar to other mangrove
   ecosystems in East Africa, higher stature, closed-canopy mangroves in
   southwest Madagascar were estimated to contain 454.92 (+/- 26.58)
   Mg.C.ha(-1). Although the mangrove extent in this area is relatively
   small (1500 ha), these mangroves are of critical importance to local
   communities and anthropogenic pressures on coastal resources in the area
   are increasing. This was evident in both field observations and remote
   sensing analysis, which indicated an overall net loss of 3.18\% between
   2002 and 2014. Further dynamics analysis highlighted widespread
   transitions of dense, higher stature mangroves to more sparse mangrove
   areas indicating extensive degradation. Harnessing the value that the
   carbon stored within these mangroves holds on the voluntary carbon
   market could generate revenue to support and incentivise locally-led
   sustainable mangrove management, improve livelihoods and alleviate
   anthropogenic pressures.},

   Pangnirtung, Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {250},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Coastal fishery systems in the Arctic are undergoing rapid change. This
   paper examines the ways in which Inuit fishers experience and respond to
   such change, using a case study from Pangnirtung, Canada. The work is
   based on over two years of fieldwork, during which semi-structured
   interviews (n = 62), focus group discussions (n = 6, 31 participants)
   and key informant interviews (n = 25) were conducted. The changes that
   most Inuit fishers experience are: changes in sea-ice conditions, Inuit
   people themselves, the landscape and the seascape, fish-related changes,
   and changes in weather conditions, markets and fish selling prices.
   Inuit fishers respond to change individually as well as collectively.
   Fishers' responses were examined using the characteristics of a
   resilience-based conceptual framework focusing on place, human agency,
   collective action and collaboration, institutions, indigenous and local
   knowledge systems, and learning. Based on results, this paper identified
   three community-level adaptive strategies, which are diversification,
   technology use and fisheries governance that employs a co-management
   approach. Further, this work recognised four place-specific attributes
   that can shape community adaptations, which are Inuit worldviews,
   Inuit-owned institutions, a culture of sharing and collaborating, and
   indigenous and local knowledge systems. An examination of the ways in
   which Inuit fishers experience and respond to change is essential to
   better understand adaptations to climate change. This study delivers new
   insights to communities, scientists, and policymakers to work together
   to foster community adaptation.},

Abstract = {A successful management plan requires clear goals and a process for
   evaluation. Without them, managers risk operational shifts in which
   continuous changes disguised as improvements may have little beneficial
   effect. The conception, design, and operation of an electric barrier and
   fishway on the Pere Marquette River of Lake Michigan serve as an
   illustration. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission operated an electric
   weir to stop migration of adult sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) and a
   fishway to provide upstream passage of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) during 2000-2009. The weir and fishway were successful in
   blocking some of the annual spawning run of sea lampreys (trapped an
   annual average of 439 sea lampreys) and it allowed passage of rainbow
   trout (an annual average of 6,091). Even with success that yielded an
   estimated density of 0.03 adult female sea lampreys per 100 m(2) of
   larval habitat upstream of the weir, lampricide treatments continued
   because the weir still allowed establishment of substantial densities of
   larval sea lampreys. Our evaluation suggests that an in-stream barrier
   must approach 100\% blockage of sea lampreys to eliminate large
   recruitment events. The failure of the weir to reduce lampricide
   treatments was due to an informally defined purpose and measures for
   success at the onset, the complexity of electric weir systems (and the
   operational problems created by such intricacy), and lack of recognition
   of the reduction in larval sea lamprey recruitment needed to succeed.
   Control of sea lampreys in the Pere Marquette River could have benefited
   from an adaptive management approach. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Climate change and its effect on marine environment, especially ocean
   warming, acidification and sea level rise, impacts fisheries in
   different ways. However, fisheries and climate change are regulated by
   different international management mechanisms, which makes the current
   fisheries management system face challenges. Realizing this, the present
   paper is designed to consider whether international law should be
   introduced to apply better management of fisheries so as to cope with
   the issues arising from climate change. In addition, the paper
   highlights the importance of incorporating relevant principles into
   future fisheries regulations by examining an existing bilateral fishery

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Bangladesh is a Least Developed Country (LDC) facing many impacts of
   climate change in the form of more frequent and severe floods, cyclones,
   droughts, sea level rise and salinity affecting large parts of the
   population through impacts on livelihoods, natural systems, agriculture,
   water supply and health. In the last two decades, Bangladesh has
   experienced four devastating floods, which may provide an early
   indication of the kinds of impacts associated with increased frequency
   and intensity of floods. This case study focuses on how the Disaster
   Management Bureau (DMB) takes into consideration the real needs and
   priorities of the community, while formulating and implementing
   programmes to enhance flood preparedness. This is being done through the
   Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP). Traditional disaster
   management models focus on disaster relief and recovery. But these have
   done little to redress rising levels of risk. An all-risk management
   framework set out in the CDMP seeks to raise the capacities of at-risk
   communities, while lowering their vulnerability to specific hazards. The
   aim is to target resources towards risk reduction through mainstreaming
   disaster management within development and emergency relief programmes
   and away from pure relief. Making an active shift towards a holistic
   risk reduction approach that shifts attention towards prevention and
   preparedness makes good sense for governments, funders and communities.
   But it requires fundamental transformations in policy and institutions.
   This takes time and requires true involvement and dedication due to
   resource constraints, bureaucracy, vested interests and poor governance.},

Title = {Assessing Potential Impacts of Sea Level Rise on Public Health and
   Vulnerable Populations in Southeast Florida and Providing a Framework to
   Improve Outcomes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {In recent years, ongoing efforts by a multitude of universities, local
   governments, federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
   have been focused on sea-level rise (SLR) adaptation in Florida.
   However, within these efforts, there has been very little attention
   given to the potential impacts of sea-level rise on human health. The
   intent of this project is to identify populations in Southeast Florida
   that are most vulnerable to sea-level rise from a topographic
   perspective, determine how vulnerable these population are from a
   socio-economic perspective, identify potential health impacts, develop
   adaptation strategies designed to assist these communities, and produce
   an outreach effort that can be shared with other coastal communities.
   The location of socially-vulnerable and health-vulnerable populations
   are correlated, but at present they are not generally in the
   geographically-vulnerable areas. Projections indicate that they will
   become at risk in the future but the lack of data on emerging diseases
   makes public health assessments difficult. We propose a redefinition of
   ``who is vulnerable?{''} to include health indicators and hard
   infrastructure solutions for flood and property protection. These tools
   can be used to help protect water resources from the impacts of climate
   change, which would, in turn, protect public health via drinking water
   supplies, and efforts to address social issues.},

Title = {Moving toward 1.5 degrees C of warming: implications for climate
   adaptation strategies},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {146-152},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The literature on adaptation to climate change indicates that limiting
   global warming to 1.5 degrees C or less would reduce damages relative to
   higher magnitudes of warming, and require less adaptive effort
   particularly by lessening the risk of extremes and reducing the
   potential need for transformative adaptation. Smaller climate change
   nevertheless poses risks of significant impacts, dislocation and
   adaptation costs in particularly exposed and vulnerable places. Climate
   change will also vary across space, and smaller, slower average change
   will likely still result in larger, rapid change for some systems and
   places (e.g. the Arctic and oceanic islands). Furthermore,
   non-linearities and power-law relationships among components of the
   earth's climate system mean that the potential for passing thresholds
   where parts of the system exhibit extreme behavior cannot be confidently
   excluded from a 1.5 degrees scenario. The potential for overshoot in a
   climate that eventually equilibrates at 1.5 degrees C or less above
   pre-industrial also means that anticipatory adaptation planning efforts
   should not be relaxed. Yet, taken together, the literature suggests that
   reactive adaptation has a better chance of keeping pace with the lower
   range of warming in many places and production systems (although not
   necessarily all), and could reduce though not eliminate the risk of
   large damages and adaptation costs in exposed and vulnerable places.
   Anticipatory adaptation investments, however, can be justified even for
   low levels of climate change and appear less sensitive to the projected
   magnitude of change in climate, and driven more by uncertainty in future
   emission and climate trajectories.},

Abstract = {The immense complexity of ecosystems severely hampers the underpinning
   of the ecological sustainability paradigm. The few existing definitions
   of ecological sustainability, such as ecosystem health, are based on the
   obsolete superorganism paradigm of ecosystems, assuming an equilibrium
   for every ecosystem. New, anthropocentric approaches, like the ecosystem
   integrity concept, surmise that ecosystems are dynamic, loosely defined
   assemblages of species, which necessitates adaptive management.
   Another complicating factor is our poor understanding of the complex
   relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The few
   hypotheses about the role of species in ecosystems, like the rivet
   popper and the functional redundancy hypotheses, are not universally
   applicable. The functional importance of an individual species is
   unpredictable and context-dependent, even for keystone species.
   Biodiversity buffers changes in environmental conditions and might be
   considered as a kind of insurance.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Algal symbionts are demonstrated to improve heat-stress tolerance in
   anemone hosts only when the two partners are closely compatible.
   Rising ocean temperatures are increasing the rate and intensity of coral
   mass bleaching events, leading to the collapse of coral reef ecosystems.
   To better understand the dynamics of coral-algae symbioses, it is
   critical to decipher the role each partner plays in the holobiont's
   thermotolerance. Here, we investigated the role of the symbiont by
   comparing transcriptional heat stress responses of anemones from two
   thermally distinct locations, Florida (CC7) and Hawaii (H2) as well as a
   heterologous host-symbiont combination composed of CC7 host anemones
   inoculated with the symbiont Breviolum minutum (SSB01) from H2 anemones
   (CC7-B01). We find that oxidative stress and apoptosis responses are
   strongly influenced by symbiont type, as further confirmed by caspase-3
   activation assays, but that the overall response to heat stress is
   dictated by the compatibility of both partners. Expression of genes
   essential to symbiosis revealed a shift from a nitrogen- to a
   carbon-limited state only in the heterologous combination CC7-B01,
   suggesting a bioenergetic disruption of symbiosis during stress. Our
   results indicate that symbiosis is highly fine-tuned towards particular
   partner combinations and that heterologous host-symbiont combinations
   are metabolically less compatible under stress. These results are
   essential for future strategies aiming at increasing coral resilience
   using heterologous thermotolerant symbionts.},

Title = {Maximising resilience to sea-level rise in urban coastal ecosystems
   through systematic conservation planning},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {221},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coastal cities and their natural environments are vulnerable to the
   impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise (SLR). Hard coastal
   defences play a key role in protecting at-risk urban coastal populations
   from flooding and erosion, but coastal ecosystems also play important
   roles in the overall sustainability and resilience of cities and urban
   centres by contributing to coastal protection. Conserving coastal
   ecosystems and maximising their resilience will ensure that urban
   coastal communities can continue to benefit from ecosystem services and
   improve their adaptive capacity to cope with adverse impacts in the
   future. Using the hyper-urbanised coast of Singapore as a case study, we
   modelled the resilience of coastal wetlands to SLR and integrated
   resilience in conservation plan-ning. We found that the responses of
   coastal habitats to rising sea level vary across the modelling periods.
   While there is a slight net gain in the extent of mangrove forests and
   tidal flats by the end of the century due to potential habitat
   conversion, the existing habitats will experience a loss in coverage.
   Highly modified coastlines associated with urbanisation impede the
   ability of existing wetlands to migrate landward, which is a key
   mechanism for coastal habitats to cope with rising sea levels.
   Systematic conservation planning can identify sites that are potentially
   resilient to SLR and incorporate factors that influence an ecosystem's
   capability to respond to change. Crucially, the relatively slow rates of
   SLR and persistence of coastal wetlands during the earlier half of this
   century present an opportunity to introduce management interventions
   aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.},

Title = {Adaptation in Fisheries and Municipalities: Three Communities in
   Northern Norway},
Booktitle = {COMMUNITY ADAPTATION AND VULNERABILITY IN ARCTIC REGIONS},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {23-62},
Abstract = {In this chapter we focus on how changing societal and climatic
   conditions have consequences for current and future vulnerability and
   adaptation in three municipalities in Northern Norway: Hammerfest and
   Lebesby, in Finnmark County, and Vestvagoy in the Lofoten Islands,
   Nordland County. Through local consultations and discussions, Fisheries
   and municipal planning were identified as having particular relevance in
   the case communities. Climate change is not perceived to be a major
   challenge locally, nevertheless, when climate projections are considered
   alongside locally defined and relevant socio-economic and climatic
   concerns that are particular to local contexts, multiple and
   interrelated factors emerge that are likely to shape future
   vulnerability. Focussing on coastal Fisheries and municipal planning as
   two major arenas for change, we find that adaptation takes place along a
   number of dimensions and at several societal levels. Adaptive strategies
   occur in response to changing socio-economic conditions, to variable
   weather and environmental conditions, or to a combination of both. There
   are three interlinked factors that our empirical Findings show are
   currently of concern for coastal Fisheries: changes in bio-physical
   conditions (ocean temperature and fish distribution and behaviour);
   Fisheries management and regulations (vessel size, species, quotas) and
   societal conditions (outmigration, market factors and transfer of
   knowledge). The interlinkages between these changes, and community
   responses to them, have first and foremost been captured and understood
   through local involvement in our research.},

Title = {Sea Level Projections From IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and
   Cryosphere Call for a New Climate Adaptation Strategy in the
   Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Denmark has a long, complex coastline, connecting the North Sea in the
   west to the semi-enclosed Baltic Sea in the east, via the
   Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas. Historical sea level records indicate that
   relative sea level (RSL) has been increasing along the Danish North Sea
   coast, south of Skagerrak, following the global mean sea level (GMSL)
   rise. In the central Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas, RSL rise has been
   practically absent, due to the GMSL rise being off-set by the
   Fennoscandian post-glacial land-uplift. The new IPCC Special Report on
   the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) reported that
   under RCP8.5 GMSL will increase more than the previous estimates in the
   IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) at the end of twenty-first century
   due to Antarctic ice sheet dynamics. We performed a regionalization of
   the SROCC sea level projections for the ``Danish Climate Atlas{''}
   dataset, a nation-wide climate adaptation dataset based on IPCC and
   various national and international databases. In these complementary
   datasets, important local data have been considered, which have not been
   included in the IPCC SROCC GMSL rise estimates, i.e., more precise
   national-wide land-rise prediction and sets of sea level fingerprints.
   Our results indicate that sea level projections under RCP8.5 results in
   a > 40 cm RSL rise at the end of the twenty-first century in the
   Skagerrak Kattegat Seas, which might call for a new adaptation strategy
   in this region. The rate of mean sea level rise will exceed the rate of
   the land-rise earlier than the previous estimates by AR5 under the
   RCP8.5 scenario. In particular, we stress how these new estimates will
   affect future extreme sea levels in this region. Based on our results,
   we suggest this more recent GMSL projection needs to be considered in
   coastal risk assessments in the Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas also in this
   century.},

Title = {Community-based conservation strategies to end open access: The case of
   Fish Refuges in Mexico},
Journal = {CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Secure property rights are often seen as a precondition of incentives
   for long-term sustainable use by communities dependent on natural
   resources. Securing formal property rights can be challenging in coastal
   small-scale fisheries, which often operate under open access conditions.
   We argue that insecure, informal rights can offer one pathway for
   property-rights regime change, and may also provide greater flexibility
   for developing sustainable fishing practices compatible with climate
   change adaptation, among other policy-relevant outcomes. The process of
   establishing short-term but renewable area-based conservation tools,
   such as the Fish Refuges of Baja California Sur, Mexico, offers the
   opportunity to examine how community-based strategies can generate
   incentives for conservation despite the lack of secure property rights.
   Using in-depth qualitative methods, socioeconomic surveys, and
   ecological data from 2009 to 2019, we studied the process of engagement
   among fishers, civil society, and government. We focused on
   understanding the emerging transition from a scenario of open access and
   limited withdrawal property rights, toward locals' attaining of
   insecuredefactomanagement and exclusion property rights and longer-term
   visions of resource use and conservation. Altogether, this case
   illustrates the potential and limitations of Fish Refuges as an
   area-based fisheries and conservation tool.},

Abstract = {Precipitation projections are usually presented as the change in
   precipitation between a fixed current baseline and a particular time in
   the future. However, upcoming generations will be affected in a way
   probably more related to the moving trend in precipitation patterns,
   i.e. to the rate and the persistence of regional precipitation changes
   from one generation to the next, than to changes relative to a fixed
   current baseline. In this perspective, we propose an alternative
   characterization of the future precipitation changes predicted by
   general circulation models, focusing on the precipitation difference
   between two subsequent 20-year periods. We show that in a
   business-as-usual emission pathway, the moistening and drying rates
   increase by 30-40 \%, both over land and ocean. As we move further over
   the twenty-first century, more regions exhibit a significant rate of
   precipitation change, while the patterns become geographically
   stationary and the trends persistent. The stabilization of the
   geographical rate patterns that occurs despite the acceleration of
   global warming can be physically explained: it results from the
   increasing contribution of thermodynamic processes compared to dynamic
   processes in the control of precipitation change. We show that such an
   evolution is already noticeable over the last decades, and that it could
   be reversed if strong mitigation policies were quickly implemented. The
   combination of intensification and increasing persistence of
   precipitation rate patterns may affect the way human societies and
   natural ecosystems adapt to climate change, especially in the
   Mediterranean basin, in Central America, in South Asia and in the
   Arctic.},

Title = {Drawing on indigenous governance and stewardship to build resilient
   coastal fisheries: People and abalone along Canada's northwest coast},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {109},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Small-scale indigenous abalone fisheries on the northwest coast of
   Canada persisted for at least two millennia prior to modern commercial
   and recreational fisheries that lasted for four decades before
   collapsing, causing a coast wide closure that remains today. What
   traditional governance and stewardship practices fostered resilient
   fisheries along Canada's northwest coast and how might they inform
   collaborative institutions that foster ecologically sustainable and
   socially just coastal fisheries in future? In collaboration with two
   coastal First Nations, a policy analysis of northern abalone
   (GaalGuuhlkyan -Skidegate Haida, galgniq -Heiltsuk, Haliotis
   kamtschatkana) stewardship was conducted to assess where traditional and
   modern fisheries governance and management aligned or failed to align
   with seven theoretical principles of social-ecological resilience. The
   analysis revealed that traditional principles of reciprocity and
   contingent proprietorship of clan-based fishing areas aligned with
   resilience principles whereas contemporary centralized decision-making
   and region-wide management policies did not. Moreover, current issues of
   power asymmetry and lack of trust need to be addressed to build a future
   indigenous-state governance approach to coastal fisheries. This research
   demonstrates how indigenous resource governance and stewardship
   practices generated over millennia of social learning and
   experimentation offer insights that could be broadly applied to foster
   resilient coastal fisheries today.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade in Ireland, the dredge licensing application
   process has become a significantly more detailed and lengthy process.
   The dredging license application process now incorporates a wide and
   comprehensive range of environmental analysis and must also include
   consideration of public health. Health impact assessment (HIA) has
   increasingly become a prominent aspect of environmental impact
   assessment in Ireland as the public becomes more aware of projects and
   the planning process. Incorporating HIA into the environmental
   assessment process for dredging applications has so far been limited.
   With the advent of international and national guidelines, HIA is now
   considered to be a component in the overall environmental assessment
   process, and in particular the optioneering stage of a dredging license
   application process. Public health must also be addressed in the
   prescription of environmental mitigation measures in the final proposed
   dredging procedure. This paper reviews the HIA process in conjunction
   with environmental assessment processes currently required in Ireland
   for dredge license applications. The paper contains direction on the
   typical public health considerations that need to be included in a HIA
   process and how it plays a role in determining the eventual fate of
   dredge spoil. The paper comprises an overview of existing information
   regarding public health concerns related to dredging processes and the
   application of the principles of a HIA model into the optioneering
   process of a dredging project on the east coast of Ireland at a port
   located within an urban environment in close proximity to residential
   areas (Arklow Port, Co. Wicklow). A preliminary HIA was conducted for
   this dredging project to assess the most viable disposal method for
   moderately contaminated port sediment while minimising potential public
   health and environmental impacts. The HIA model utilised (Fehr Model)
   allowed for a preliminary assessment of four alternative dredge spoil
   disposal methods and contributed to optimising chosen disposal methods
   mitigation measures to minimise public health impacts.},

Abstract = {Climate change is altering the species composition, structure, and
   function of vegetation in natural terrestrial ecosystems. These changes
   can also impact the essential ecosystem goods and services derived from
   these ecosystems. Following disturbances, remote-sensing datasets have
   been used to monitor the disturbance and describe antecedent conditions
   as a means of understanding vulnerability to change. To a lesser extent,
   they have also been used to predict when desired ecosystems are
   vulnerable to degradation or loss. In this paper, we review studies that
   have applied remote sensing imagery to characterize vegetation
   vulnerability in both retrospective and prospective modes. We first
   review vulnerability research in natural terrestrial ecosystems
   including temperate forests, tropical forests, boreal forests, semi-arid
   lands, coastal areas, and the arctic. We then evaluate whether remote
   sensing can evaluate vulnerability sufficiently in advance of future
   events in order to allow the implementation of mitigation strategies, or
   whether it can only describe antecedent conditions a posteriori. The
   majority of existing research has evaluated vulnerability
   retrospectively, but key studies highlight the considerable potential
   for the development of early warnings of future vulnerability. We
   conclude that future research needs to focus on the development of a
   greater number of remotely sensed metrics to be used in a prospective
   mode in assessing vulnerability of terrestrial vegetation under change.

   Decision Aiding Approach Supporting Urban Development Processes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {The European Union identifies the cultural heritage of cities as the
   main driver of development strategies. From this perspective, adaptive
   reuse can play a decisive role not only in terms of increasing the life
   cycle of the heritage but also as an urban strategy capable of
   generating new economic, cultural, and social values, thus supporting
   innovative dynamics of local development. The aim is to propose an
   integrated evaluation model based on the combined use of multi-criteria
   techniques, which helps to classify adaptive reuse strategies of unused
   cultural heritage assets and supports decision-makers in the
   implementation of development strategies in vulnerable contexts. The
   case study focuses on the potential reuse of some historical
   fortifications located along the coasts of the Strait of Messina in
   Southern Italy. The results obtained show that the proposed model can be
   a useful decision support tool, in contexts characterized by high
   complexity, able to guarantee the transparency of the decision-making
   process, and in which it is necessary to highlight the elements that
   influence the dynamics of the choice for the construction of shared
   development strategies.},

Abstract = {Northern Sweden has been regarded as unaffected by acid deposition, but

   surface water (pH < 6.0, alkalinity < 50 mmol(c) m(-3)) permanently or

   northern Sweden. This paper summarizes our conclusions from a workshop
   on natural versus anthopogenic acidification held in February 1995. It
   was shown that organic substances have a key role in determining the
   acidity of surface waters in the region, although anthropogenic effects
   are documented in some coastal systems and in the southern mountain
   range. Sulfide oxidation occurs by the coast. It appears clear that many
   surface waters that were naturally acidic have been limed to unnatural
   pH levels. New criteria to screen liming candidates should be developed,
   and one such model based on water chemistry data is proposed.},

Title = {Method for Estimating Future Hurricane Flood Probabilities and

Volume = {139},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Reliable hurricane flood probability estimates are essential for
   effective management and engineering in the coastal environment.
   However, uncertainty in future climate conditions presents a challenge
   for assessing future flood probabilities. Studies suggest that in the
   future, sea-level rise may accelerate, and hurricanes may intensify and
   occur less or more often. Here, methods are presented for incorporating
   sea-level rise and future hurricane conditions into extreme-value flood
   statistics analysis. By considering an idealized coast, surge response
   functions are used with joint probability statistics to define
   time-varying continuous probability mass functions for hurricane flood
   elevation. Uncertainty in the flood estimates introduced by uncertainty
   in future climate is quantified by considering variance in future
   climate and sea level projections. It will be shown that future global
   warming can increase the flood elevation at a given return period by
   1-3\% per decade, but that climate-related uncertainty only marginally
   contributes to the overall uncertainty associated with hurricane flood
   statistics. Finally, it will be demonstrated that adaptive management
   practices are the most effective means of optimizing future coastal
   engineering activities in the face of climate change. DOI:

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sea level rise is one of the key artefacts of a warming climate which is
   predicted to have profound impacts for coastal communities over the
   course of the 21st century and beyond. The IPCC provide regular updates
   (5-7 years) on the global status of the science and projections of
   climate change to assist guide policy, adaptation and mitigation
   endeavours. Increasingly sophisticated climate modelling tools are being
   used to underpin these processes with demand for improved resolution of
   modelling output products (such as predicted sea level rise) at a more
   localized scale. With a decade of common coverage between observational
   data and CMIP5 projection model outputs (2007-2016), this analysis
   provides an additional method by which to test the veracity of model
   outputs to replicate in-situ measurements using the case study site of
   New York. Results indicate that the mean relative velocity of the model
   projection products is of the order of 2.5-2.8 mm/year higher than the
   tide gauge results in 2016. In the event this phenomena is more
   spatially represented, there is a significant role for long tide gauge
   records to assist in evaluating climate model products to improve
   scientific rigour.},

Abstract = {The paper presents the research undertaken in the coastal area of

   research is to assess the erosion rate of the coastline, to identify the
   most dynamic parts, and to improve the predictions of the future
   archaeological sites being under threat from coastal erosion. As a
   baseline, Soviet aerial images and topographic surveys were combined in
   a GIS in order to create a database and a 3D model of the coastline,
   which will serve as a base for future surveys. The most dynamic part is
   located in the North-western part, from 1958 until 1980 (22 years), 150
   m from the coastline being eroded (6.81 m/year), leading to the complete
   disappearance of the hillfort, only the South-eastern bastion remaining.
   The coastline is very dynamic, with an increasing erosion rate from
   2012, when the first topographic surveys were undertaken. There have
   been proposed mitigation measures, the most significant one is to
   completely eliminate the exploitation road along the coastline.},

Journal = {GEOGRAPHY},

Pages = {32-38},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Soils have many functions including flood alleviation and carbon
   storage, and act as repositories of micro-organisms and archaeological
   artefacts. To the farmer and to society, soils are the principal means
   of producing food. However, soil erosion impacts on these functions over
   both short and long timescales. These impacts give rise to costs to the
   farmer and to others away from the farm. Estimates show that off-farm
   costs are far greater than on-farm ones. Muddy flooding of properties,
   sedimentation and the pollution of watercourses and reservoirs are among
   the highest costs. Yet, monetary values for some impacts of soil erosion
   are not available. In the future, climate and land use changes are
   likely to increase costs unless mitigation measures are put in place.
   Limited evidence suggests that well-designed mitigation schemes cost far

Abstract = {Seaweed aquaculture in California, the United States, is at an early
   stage of development. The coastal climate and growing season contrast
   with the cold-temperate, where most seaweed cultivation in the US
   occurs. Climate change is warming coastal waters on average and
   increasing the frequency of marine heatwaves (MHWs). In California,
   those changes co-occur with predicted seasonal changes in upwelling.
   Warm, low nutrient events cause diebacks of wild Macrocystis pyrifera,
   and other wild-harvested species. Aquaculture can replace wild-harvested
   seaweeds and expand supplies of California-grown seaweeds, if
   cultivation is developed with climate-change resilience. We consider
   wild-harvested species for traits expected to increase climate resilient
   productivity. Golden kombu, Laminaria farlowii, was selected for test
   cultivation. Early life stages were successfully grown. Sporophyte
   growth rates were higher in summer than winter, confirming Golden kombu
   as a summer crop in California. Based on projections of change in
   upwelling intensity and season in California, we suggest a physiological
   screening approach for resilience to conditions expected in different
   regions of coastal California by mid-to-late 21st century.},

Title = {Resilience and adaptive capacity of Oregon's fishing community:
   Cumulative impacts of climate change and the graying of the fleet},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although there has been an increase in the research of social-ecological
   systems, there are still many gaps to understand the effects of change
   within coastal communities and ecosystems. The drivers of change include
   climate change, management regulations, demographic shifts, and market
   trends, and their intersectionality and, ultimately, impacts on
   commercial fishing communities are poorly understood. The research
   presented here explores connections between climate change and the
   increase in the average age of commercial fishermen, referred to as
   ?graying of the fleet?. Ultimately, these connections inform our overall
   objective: to understand how cumulative impacts from these two ongoing
   phenomena affect the resilience and adaptive capacity of the fishing
   community. Parsing out the connections may help managers or policy
   makers more accurately conceptualize future scenarios of community
   change and simultaneously enables the location of specific target areas
   for intervention or opportunity. Oral history semi-structured interviews
   with members of Oregon?s fishing community were analyzed and recent
   climate change projections from the literature were synthesized to
   parameterize a set of possible scenarios regarding impacts on the
   fishing community. Results indicate that climate change will likely
   intensify both the stressors contributing to and the impacts of the
   graying of the fleet in Oregon. Analysis of the cumulative impacts from
   climate change and graying of the fleet reveal a greater impact on
   resilient and adaptive capacities of Oregon?s fishing community than
   analysis of the drivers individually indicates. Therefore, an important
   implication from this research is the need to evaluate cumulative
   impacts within these coupled social-ecological systems. Relying on the
   responsive adaptability of fishing community members alone may not be
   sufficient, as their resilience and capacity to do so could be limited
   in the future.},

Title = {Optimizing preservation for multiple types of historic structures under
   climate change},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {214},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Cultural resources in coastal parks and recreation areas are vulnerable
   to climate change. The US National Park Service (NPS) is facing the
   challenge of insufficient budget allocations for both maintenance and
   climate adaptation of historic structures. Research on adaptation
   planning for cultural resources has predominately focused on
   vulnerability assessments of heritage sites; however, few studies
   integrate multiple factors (e.g., vulnerability, cultural significance,
   use potential, and costs) that managers should consider when making
   tradeoff decisions about which cultural resources to prioritize for
   adaptation. Moreover, heritage sites typically include multiple types of
   cultural resources, and researchers have yet to examine such complex
   tradeoffs. This study applies the Optimal Preservation (OptiPres) Model
   as a decision support framework to evaluate the tradeoffs of adaptation
   actions among multiple types of historic structures-wooden buildings,
   masonry and concrete buildings, forts, and batteries-under varying
   budget scenarios. Results suggest that the resource values of different
   types of historic structures vary greatly under a range of budget
   scenarios, and tradeoffs have to be made among different types of
   historical structures to achieve optimal planning objectives. Moreover,
   periodic, incremental funding and partial maintenance are identified as
   optimal funding strategies for preservation needs of cost-intensive
   historic structures. Also, adaptative use of historical buildings (e.g.,
   building occupancy) can improve the resource values when budgets are
   constrained. The OptiPres Model provides managers with a unique
   framework to inform adaptation planning efforts for a broad range of
   historic structures, which is transferable across coastal parks to
   enhance historic preservation planning under climate change.},

Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows are valuable ecosystem service providers that are now
   being lost globally at an unprecedented rate, with water quality and
   other localised stressors putting their future viability in doubt. It is
   therefore critical that we learn more about the interactions between
   seagrass meadows and future environmental change in the anthropocene.
   This needs to be with particular reference to the consequences of poor
   water quality on ecosystem resilience and the effects of change on
   trophic interactions within the food web. Understanding and predicting
   the response of seagrass meadows to future environmental change requires
   an understanding of the natural long-term drivers of change and how
   these are currently influenced by anthropogenic stress. Conservation
   management of coastal and marine ecosystems now and in the future
   requires increased knowledge of how seagrass meadows respond to
   environmental change, and how they can be managed to be resilient to
   these changes. Finding solutions to such issues also requires
   recognising people as part of the social-ecological system. This special
   issue aims to further enhance this knowledge by bringing together global
   expertise across this field. The special issues considers issues such as
   ecosystem service delivery of seagrass meadows, the drivers of long-term
   seagrass change and the socio-economic consequences of environmental
   change to seagrass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Using expert elicitation to identify effective combinations of
   management actions for koala conservation in different regional
   landscapes},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Context. Choosing the most effective combinations of actions to manage
   threatened species is difficult. Aims. This study aimed to identify the
   most effective combinations of six management actions for reversing
   population declines of koala populations in three regional landscapes
   (Coastal, Riverine and Hinterland) in north-east New South Wales,
   Australia, based on expert-elicited knowledge. Methods. A Bayesian
   network was used to combine continuous probability distributions
   representing the impact of specific management actions and combinations
   of actions. Data were derived from expert elicitation. Variation within
   and among expert judgements was captured by incorporating submodels of
   individual responses. Weevaluated alternative management solutions to
   address four mortality factors (disease and injury, vehicle strikes,
   domestic dogs and wild dogs/dingoes (Canis familiaris), and two
   habitat-related management actions (restoration and protection). Key
   results. We show that there are marked differences in the expected
   response of the koala populations to the various management options in
   the three regional landscapes over a 20-year period (2019-2039), and
   that multiple management actions are required to arrest and reverse the
   decline in koala populations of north-east NSW. Conclusions. Management
   actions for koala conservation should be based on regional context. Our
   model, in conjunction with robust expert-elicitation procedures, allows
   decision makers to distinguish effective from ineffective combinations
   of management actions for threatened species management, and has been
   structured so that new data can be incorporated into the model.
   Implications. Model design could be easily adapted to different species
   or conservation contexts, and updated as new evidence becomes available,
   making it valuable in adaptive management for local to regional-scale
   conservation problems.},

Title = {Linking Western Tethyan Rhynchonellide morphogroups to the key
   post-Palaeozoic extinction and turnover events},
Journal = {PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {553},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Genetic control undoubtedly plays the most decisive role in the
   development of characters in rhynchonellides, especially in those
   structural features such as shell microstructure and brachidial
   architecture. However, considering the relationship between shell
   microstructure and type of crura in post-Palaeozoic rhynchonellides
   supported by recent growing research, the present study links this
   striking matching to the distribution of rhynchonellide morphogroups
   around the main post-Palaeozoic mass extinction and diversification
   events, innovatively introducing the ribbing pattern as a feature widely
   argued as indicator of deeper/shallower habitats and particular
   ecological conditions. The analyses performed on the Western Tethys
   rhynchonellide database and, directly on 28 species from the
   peri-Iberian margins around selected post-Palaeozoic
   extinction/diversification episodes, reveal a recurrent distribution
   pattern according to the habitat considered (epicontinental vs.
   epioceanic). The smooth, eurinoid, septifal/arcual body plan is the
   distinctive inhabitant of deeper epioceanic environments, also being the
   last to withdraw from the epicontinental platforms when the
   environmental conditions were adverse, and the pioneers or opportunistic
   taxa conducing repopulation of these epicontinental habitats when the
   conditions were re-established after crises. The ribbed, eurinoid,
   falciform morphogroup seems to be the more resilient stock on
   epicontinental platforms in relation to ecological crises. Conversely,
   the ribbed, leptinoid, raducal group is typical inhabitant of
   epicontinental seas when normal conditions prevail and shows an uneven
   distribution unlinked to critical events, suggesting a more specialist
   pattern with a diversification related with a secondary differentiation.
   It is suggested that this distribution dynamic of morphogroups was
   controlled by the availability of requirements to generate each type of
   crura and microstructure in epicontinental/epioceanic habitats, such as
   metabolic or oxygen restrictions, or the filter-feeding efficiency of
   the lophophore. A research line starting-point is thus herein introduced
   which can lead to shed light into the adaptive strategies of
   rhynchonellides, relating particular morphotypes with potential
   triggering factors of mass extinction events.},

Title = {Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Conservation Project on Two Threatened
   Birds: Applying Expert-Based Threat Analysis and Threat Reduction
   Assessment in a Mediterranean Wetland},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We applied two recent approaches largely used in biological
   conservation: Threat Analysis (TAN) and Threat Reduction Assessments
   (TRAs), assessing the effectiveness of a project focused on two
   water-related bird species (common tern, Sterna hirundo and little tern,
   Sternula albifrons), commonly breeding in some wetlands of Italy. We
   used the IUCN standardized lexicon for the classification of threats,
   utilizing a panel of experts to assess a set of regime attributes
   (extent, severity and magnitude) of each human-induced disturbance. Our
   aims were: (i) through the TAN approach, to carry out an arrangement and
   quantification of the main threats acting on our focal species and
   select the priority ones; (ii) through the TRA approach, to test the
   effectiveness of an operational project focused on mitigating the
   threats and improving the breeding success of species (i.e., building
   rafts and floating islands to encourage their nesting). Using the TAN
   approach, experts identified the following human-induced threats (IUCN
   code): 6.1-Generic disturbance; 7.2-Water stress; 7.3-Salinization;
   8.8-Vagrant dogs; 8.8-Mediterranean gulls; 8.8-Wild boars, all
   significantly different in their magnitude. Among them, wild boars and
   Mediterranean gulls appeared the priority threats with the greatest
   extent, intensity and magnitude. Using the TRA approach, after the
   project, we assessed an overall decrease in the threat magnitude of
   23.08\% (21.42\% when considering only the threats directly affected by
   our project). These data suggest that further efforts should be devoted
   to achieving greater effectiveness of conservation actions focused on
   our target species. With limited time and resources to quantify threats,
   expert-based approaches could be useful for rapidly assessing the
   effectiveness of small conservation projects by providing a range of
   scores obtained following an analytical procedure. In this regard,
   Threat Analysis and Threat Reduction Assessment could be considered
   useful tools to support adaptive management in project management
   cycles.},

Title = {Learning from Hurricane Maria: Island ports and supply chain resilience},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The restoration of supply chain operations is critical to disaster
   recovery. When supply chains are disrupted by catastrophic events,
   island communities encounter problems with response and recovery
   different from their continental counterparts. Isolation, limited port
   capacity, lack of alternative facilities and dependence on imports
   increase the vulnerability of island communities. A focus on islands
   sheds light on broader challenges related to disaster risk reduction and
   resilience. This paper addresses these challenges in three ways. First,
   it connects the literature on supply chain management to disaster risk,
   recovery, and resilience. Second, it illustrates the unique
   vulnerabilities of island supply chains by examining two island
   communities - Puerto Rico and Hawai'i. They are exposed to similar
   hazards and threats including geographic isolation. Third, it offers key
   tactical, operational, and strategic actions on supply chain resilience
   based on the experiences from Hurricane Maria's impacts on Puerto Rico,
   directed toward emergency managers and planners working not just in
   island communities, but other isolated locations. A key lesson involves
   the importance of communications and coordination in restoring
   lifelines, networks, and social relations following disasters.},

Abstract = {The challenge for conservation managers is to ensure the long-term
   sustainability of an area by preserving its ecological and cultural
   values against predictable and unpredictable natural and human pressures
   and, at the same time, ensuring the fruition of the environmental
   resources. This research proposes an integrated use of GIS-based
   Decision Support System (DSS) with a conceptual linear model of
   vulnerability to foster conservation strategies in protected areas, by
   identifying: (1) the most vulnerable areas, requiring specific
   protection measures to enhance the natural features, as well as the
   prevention of natural and human risks; (2) the most effective management
   interventions to reduce system vulnerability to fire. The development of
   such a tool has been tested on the natural protected area of Torre
   Guaceto, through the selection of suitable indicators that enable
   discrimination among different levels of sensitivity and pressures, in
   order to provide evidence of its potential utility for the management of
   protected areas and the mitigation of their vulnerabilities. The results
   highlight that the most vulnerable areas are represented by contiguous
   patches of wetlands, the load of fuel at wetlands-agricultural lands
   interface areas, and the small patches of century-old forests,
   Mediterranean maquis and coastal dunes. On the basis of the results it
   is desirable that future researches on vulnerability should not only
   consider the ``of what to what{''}, but also consider ``for who, where
   and when{''} with a focus on the spatial and temporal scale dimensions
   of vulnerability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Quantifying Marine Sedimentary Carbon: A New Spatial Analysis Approach
   Using Seafloor Acoustics, Imagery, and Ground-Truthing Data in Scotland},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Marine sediments are important repositories of organic matter,
   effectively burying organic carbon (OC) over geological timescales thus
   providing a climate regulation service. However, the spatial
   distribution of this marine sedimentary OC store is not well
   constrained. In this study we leverage a high resolution multibeam
   echosounder (MBES) survey taken at Loch Creran, a model fjordic site on
   the west coast of Scotland, to develop a new methodology for predicting
   the distribution of OC in surface sediments. Using an integrated
   approach, we use MBES survey, video imagery and ground-truthing data to
   produce a high-resolution (2 x 2 m) map of surficial carbon and
   calculate a 10 cm stock. We find that the backscatter survey reliably
   uncovers a heterogeneous seabed and that OC correlates strongly with the
   MBES backscatter signal as a function of sediment composition. We
   estimate that there are approximately 12,346 +/- 2,677 t of OC held
   within the top 10 cm of mixed sediments across the MBES survey area
   (7.96 km(2); 60\% of the total area), upscaled to 20,577 +/- 4,462 t of
   OC across Loch Creran (13.27 km(2)). Normalised by area, we find that
   fine sediments with small fractions of sand and gravel hold more OC than
   homogenous fine sediments. This initial work proposes a novel
   methodological approach to using high resolution MBES surveys to improve
   the spatial mapping of sedimentary carbon (C) and identification of C
   hotspots, enabling consideration of this resource in sedimentary carbon
   accounting, seabed management and climate mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Ecosystem
   Approaches to Management (EAM) is a holistic, evolutionary management
   strategy designed to improve the productivity of coastal and marine
   ecosystems. NOAA has developed a vision for an ecosystem approach to
   management, and detailed its mission and outcomes for sustainable use of
   the nation's coastal and marine resources. This vision incorporates
   collaboration among NOAA, other federal, state, tribal, and local
   agencies, NGOs, academic and business communities. An ecosystem approach
   to management shifts current management practices from sectoral,
   short-term perspectives, with humans independent of ecosystems to
   ecosystem-based, long-term perspectives and humans integral to
   ecosystems. The management practices will be geographically specific,
   located in 10 recently delineated US regional ecosystems based on the
   Large Marine Ecosystem model. NOAA will work further to delineate
   sub-ecoregions, and address inland boundary issues based on coastal
   watersheds and diadromous fish habitat, as well as other boundary
   issues. NOAA has defined five EAM strategies: adaptive, incremental,
   geographically specifying management areas, accounts for ecosystem
   knowledge and uncertainties, and balances diverse societal objectives.
   In order to understand health and socioeconomic status and trends of
   these delineated ecosystems, the agency is developing a suite of of
   national level of ecosystem indicators. Over time, NOAA plans to expand
   the indicator suite to have a regional and sub-regional set for each
   ecosystem. NOAA's future steps towards EAM include improving internal
   integration and coordination to produce better products and services,
   while collaborating with partners to begin the regional process of
   ecosystem-based management.},

Title = {Attribution of surface ozone to NOx and volatile organic compound
   sources during two different high ozone events},

Abstract = {Increased tropospheric ozone (O-3) and high temperatures affect human
   health during heat waves. Here, we perform a source attribution that
   considers separately the formation of German surface ozone from emitted
   NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors during two peak ozone
   events that took place in 2015 and 2018 which were associated with
   elevated temperatures. Results showed that peak ozone concentrations can
   be primarily attributed to nearby emissions of anthropogenic NOx (from
   Germany and immediately neighboring countries) and biogenic VOC. Outside
   of these high ozone episodes, baseline ozone concentrations are
   attributed primarily to long-range transport, with ozone due to remote
   anthropogenic NOx emissions and methane oxidation adding to the
   tropospheric ozone background. We show that a significant contribution
   to modeled O-3 coming from German NOx or VOC emissions occurs mostly in
   southern Germany, emphasizing that the production of ozone depends on
   the local interplay between NOx and VOC precursors. Shipping activities
   in the Baltic and North seas have a large impact on ozone predicted in
   coastal areas, yet a small amount of ozone from these sources can also
   be seen far inland, showing the importance of transported ozone on
   pollution levels. We have also shown that changes in circulation
   patterns during the peak O-3 episodes observed in Germany during the
   2015 and 2018 heat waves can affect the contribution of different NOx
   emission sources to total O-3; thus, the possible influence of multiple
   upwind source regions should be accounted for when mitigation strategies
   are designed. Our study also highlights the good correlation between
   ozone coming from German biogenic VOC emissions and total ozone,
   although the diurnal variation in the ozone coming from biogenic sources
   is not dominated by the diurnal variation in biogenic emissions, and the
   peaks of ozone from biogenic sources are disconnected from local
   emission peaks. This suggests that the formation of O-3 from local
   German biogenic VOC emissions is not the sole factor that influences the

Title = {Socio-cultural perceptions of flood risk and management of a levee
   system: Applying the Q methodology in the California Delta},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {11-23},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is an agricultural, recreational,
   historical, and cultural center and the hub of the state's water supply
   system. For decades the region has been ripe with political
   controversies stemming from conflicting interests over its natural
   resources which all depend on the protection of approximately 1800 km of
   earthen levees that surround over 60 islands, some of which are below
   sea level and two-thirds of which are privately owned. This study uses
   the Q methodology to explore the discourses of the broad range of
   stakeholders, including farmers, land- and water-based recreation
   enthusiasts, water exporters, utilities, environmentalists, and
   government agencies, about flood risk and flood management in the Delta.
   The results of this study reveal five distinct views regarding the risk
   of submersion of one or more islands due to either overtopping during
   high waters or structural levee failures. The findings of this study
   also elucidate nuanced narratives on the viability of anticipatory
   climate change adaptation in the Delta. Proximity, sense of
   vulnerability, values, trust, and views of climate change are the
   underlying factors in these perspectives. The perspectives identified
   suggest that resolving decades of distrust among stakeholder groups will
   remain difficult; however, taking a cultural approach to understanding
   perspectives may provide an opportunity to open up the conversations to
   adaptation approaches, and thus fulfill the legal mandate to protect the
   Delta as an evolving place.},

Abstract = {Coastal urban flooding is increasing, affecting mainly to new urban
   settlements but also to the traditional ones. This is due either to sea
   level and continental climatic factors. But also because population has
   increased at the same time being coastal areas selectively affected in
   old and new settlements, leading to need on flood resilience
   improvements The planet has been suffering a global warming change
   leading to sea level rise that is happening since the Little Ice Age
   although rising since 19th century. It comes with other synergic changes
   in marine and littoral dynamics, like El Nino South sedation and
   cyclonic storms. But other relative sea level movements are interfering
   in each segment of the coast with a local or even a regional character,
   being the main problem to discern the factors affecting these vertical
   movements This paper affronts the problem of the coastal urban floods,
   analyzing their increasing and variability, discussing the rebounds and
   the subsidence, discerning them from the global change in the long term,
   and the influence of other sea level changes in the ``short term{''}:

Title = {Can Seaweed Farming Play a Role in Climate Change Mitigation and
   Adaptation?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Seaweed aquaculture, the fastest-growing component of global food
   production, offers a slate of opportunities to mitigate, and adapt to
   climate change. Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in
   sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO2 sink.
   The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production,
   with a potential CO2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions
   from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO2 km(-2) year(-1). Seaweed
   aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by
   improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when
   included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed
   aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave
   energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying
   oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean
   acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed
   aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas
   and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems
   capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market
   demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these
   limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize
   climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the
   income of seaweed farmers.},

Title = {Vegetation Dynamics in Coastal Heathlands of the Sydney Basin},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {B181-B197},
Abstract = {Heathlands are dynamic ecosystems that change in response to fire
   regimes and climate variations, as well as endogenous processes such as
   competition between component species. An understanding of how
   heathlands change through time is central to the development of
   management strategies that aim to conserve them and maintain coexistence
   of their plants and animals. We briefly review the development of this
   understanding for Sydney's coastal heathlands from the emergence of the
   first published work in the 1930s. In our previous work, we focussed on
   fire regimes and interspecific competition between plants as important
   processes that drive ecosystem dynamics (succession) and mediate species
   coexistence and diversity. Here, we synthesise our understanding of
   heathland dynamics into a state and transition framework. We first
   develop a simple classification of heathland states based on their
   composition of plant functional types and developmental stage with time
   since fire. We then propose a qualitative model that predicts
   transitions between states conditional upon intervals between fires,,
   fire-mediated life cycle processes of component plant species and
   interactions between species. We applied the model to predict
   qualitative changes in heathland state under contrasting fire regime
   scenarios, and tested example predictions using a long-term study of
   heathland dynamics in Royal National Park. Empirical observations of
   overstorey and understorey change were generally consistent with model
   predictions, subject to variability between sites. Importantly, the
   model helps to identify fire scenarios that promote dynamic coexistence
   of multiple heathland states that each support different components of
   heathland biota. We conclude that simple process models can be very
   useful for informing management decisions by describing expected
   responses to alternative management strategies. These predictions lend
   themselves to testing in adaptive management experiments that seek to
   spread risks and improve understanding of ecosystem dynamics for future
   management.},

Journal = {MARITIME POLICY \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-248},
Abstract = {In this article, we argue that sectoral adaptation efforts to climate
   change, e. g. of the ports sector, are also struggles to reshape
   economic space according to sectoral needs. Addressing globalisation,
   the effects on economic spatial hierarchies among regions and the active
   promotion of regionalisation are seen as important. Applied to the port
   industry, this allows approaching the fierce competition among European
   north range ports from an action- and power-oriented perspective.
   Climate adaptation of ports is predominantly referred to as technical
   responses to extreme events (e.g. coastal protection). A differentiated
   conceptualisation (based on still ongoing research), however, also
   addresses impacts on specific elements of the transport chain, and
   effects on the spatial function of a port (e.g. the changing
   competitiveness within the European port system). Hence, the ability of
   a specific port to adapt will also encompass the management of regional
   target conflicts, and of multi-level relations. Thus, climate adaptation
   becomes part of positional struggles in spatial hierarchies among
   regions and of conflicts about political priorities within them. At the
   same time, the limits of exclusively regional approaches in addressing
   sustainability issues without higher level support become evident. The
   article gives an overview of the literature on climate adaptation and
   its application to ports and provides a preliminary typology of forms of
   sectoral adaptation to climate change.},

Abstract = {A particular living area in the north part of Semarang has been renowned
   for its improper environmental conditions due to intensively increasing
   sea water tide overflow (inundation) every year. Many buildings do not
   meet the lowest standards of appropriate living place. Due to the
   salinity of sea water overflowing to the area, metal and electronic
   appliances are easily damaged. Regardless of this condition, occupants
   of the living area prefer to stay. This paper aims at explaining how
   occupants of the living area in the north part of Semarang city respond
   to the degradation of the living environment due to inundation. To gain
   the knowledge of the occupants' response towards the continuous
   degradation of their living environment, comprehensive interviews were
   undertaken. In addition, questionnaires were deployed to collect data on
   factors that influence the occupants to take adaptive actions; these
   data were analysed quantitatively. A survey was carried out by visually
   observing morphological changes in the surrounding environment. The
   changes were recorded ethnographically through a track record by
   interviews involving sketch/imaging tools. Ultimately, we provide an
   explanation of our observations based on responses and their influencing
   factors from the occupants in living environment with deteriorating
   conditions (inundation).},

Abstract = {Highways access have a major influence on transportation on the Java
   Island as a measure of time efficiency and freeway access. As an effort
   to achieve efficiency of time for travel between regions, the West Java
   government undertakes the 60 km Cisumdawu highway construction as the
   part of the Trans Java toll road, which connects Cileunyi, Sumedang, and
   Dawuan highway access. Unfortunately, the construction of Cisumdawu
   Highway is passing through the Baribis Fault areas which could cause
   harm during and after construction. The study of mass movement is needed
   for a mitigation action in this area. This research uses studio methods
   that analyze topographic maps, morphometric maps, satellite imagery,
   geological maps, maps of disaster-prone areas, and supported by the
   development of geographic data of Cisumdawu highway. The result shows
   risk analysis table of Cisumdawu Highway which indicates low, medium,
   and high levels of landslides potential.},

Abstract = {This article focuses oil the manner by which resource management
   regimes, often conceived far away from their areas of application, are
   integrated into the local institutions, practices, and social structures
   at a place. This process of contextualization may be especially critical
   where, for reasons of resource-scarcity, remoteness, or system
   complexity, the state cannot engage in effective program management. The
   thesis of the article is that if the program is to be sustainable,
   contextualization may be necessary and, moreover, can induce profound
   changes in the form and function of the original program. This process
   can lead to a type of governance that operates through webs of social
   relationships rather than hierarchical and bureaucratic lines of
   authority. We use this mode of analysis to show how a unique and viable
   species conservation program evolved on the Turtle Islands, Philippines,
   how the process of contextualization transformed it, and why it all
   unraveled.},

Title = {Modeling 25 years of food web changes in Narragansett Bay (USA) as a

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {654},

Abstract = {Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA) is an estuary undergoing changes
   from a combination of rising water temperatures, nutrient fluxes, and
   human uses. In this study, we created an ecosystem food web model and
   evaluated its ability to predict functional group biomasses.
   Specifically, we used Ecopath to construct 2 mass-balanced models
   covering different time periods in Narragansett Bay: a historical model
   using data from 1994-1998 and a present-day model that represents
   2014-2018. With the historical model as a starting point, we used Ecosim
   fit to time series data and projected forward to present-day values,
   forcing the model with both phytoplankton biomass and fishing mortality.
   The biomass of most mid- and upper trophic level groups increased by
   2018, with the exception of carnivorous benthos, which experienced a
   large decline. There were changes in the composition of fisheries, with
   a large increase in recreational benthivorous fish landings and a
   decrease in commercial landings of planktivorous fish and suspension
   feeding benthos. The inclusion of fishing mortality and phytoplankton
   biomass as forcing functions, as well as adjusting the vulnerability
   levels of prey, greatly improved our model fits for all functional
   groups with the exception of gelatinous zooplankton. Our ecosystem model
   was able to correctly predict the direction of change for all fish and
   fished invertebrate groups with a relatively high degree of precision,
   particularly for the upper trophic levels. Thus, this ecosystem model is
   broadly applicable and suitable to project trends in the Narragansett
   Bay food web associated with localized and adaptive ecosystem-based
   management.},

Title = {Assessment of Flood Risk Map under Climate Change RCP8.5 Scenarios in
   Taiwan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climate change has exerted a significant global impact in recent years,
   and extreme weather-related hazards and incidents have become the new
   normal. For Taiwan in particular, the corresponding increase in disaster
   risk threatens not only the environment but also the lives, safety, and
   property of people. This highlights the need to develop a methodology
   for mapping disaster risk under climate change and delineating those
   regions that are potentially high-risk areas requiring adaptation to a
   changing climate in the future. This study provides a framework of flood
   risk map assessment under the RCP8.5 scenario by using different spatial
   scales to integrate the projection climate data of high resolution,
   inundation potential maps, and indicator-based approach at the end of
   the 21st century in Taiwan. The reference period was 1979-2003, and the
   future projection period was 2075-2099. High-resolution climate data
   developed by dynamic downscaling of the MRI-JMA-AGCM model was used to
   assess extreme rainfall events. The flood risk maps were constructed
   using two different spatial scales: the township level and the 5 km x 5
   km grid. As to hazard-vulnerability(H-V) maps, users can overlay maps of
   their choice-such as those for land use distribution, district planning,
   agricultural crop distribution, or industrial distribution. Mapping
   flood risk under climate change can support better informed
   decision-making and policy-making processes in planning and preparing to
   intervene and control flood risks. The elderly population distribution
   is applied as an exposure indicator in order to guide advance
   preparation of evacuation plans for high-risk areas. This study found
   that higher risk areas are distributed mainly in northern and southern
   parts of Taiwan and the hazard indicators significantly increase in the
   northern, north-eastern, and southern regions under the RCP8.5 scenario.
   Moreover, the near-riparian and coastal townships of central and
   southern Taiwan have higher vulnerability levels. Approximately 14\% of
   townships have a higher risk level of flooding disaster and another 3\%
   of townships will become higher risk. For higher-risk townships,
   adaptation measures or strategies are suggested to prioritize improving
   flood preparation and protecting people and property. Such a flood risk
   map can be a communication tool to effectively inform decision- makers,
   citizens, and stakeholders about the variability of flood risk under
   climate change. Such maps enable decision-makers and national spatial
   planners to compare the relative flood risk of individual townships
   countrywide in order to determine and prioritize risk adaptation areas
   for planning spatial development policies.},

Title = {Modelling the impact of climate change on Tanzanian forests},

Abstract = {Aim Climate change is pressing extra strain on the already degraded
   forest ecosystem in Tanzania. However, it is mostly unknown how climate
   change will affect the distribution of forests in the future. We aimed
   to model the impacts of climate change on natural forests to help inform
   national-level conservation and mitigation strategies. Location
   Tanzania. Methods We conducted maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling to
   simulate forest habitat suitability using the Tanzanian national forest
   inventory survey (1,307 occurrences) and environmental data. Changes in
   forest habitats were simulated under two Representative Concentration
   Pathways (RCPs) emission scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2055 and
   2085. Results The results indicate that climate change will threaten
   forest communities, especially fragmented strips of montane forests.
   Even under optimistic emission scenario, the extent of montane forest is
   projected to almost halve by 2085, intersecting many biodiversity
   hotspots across the Eastern Arc Mountains. Similarly, climate change is
   predicted to threaten microhabitat forests (i.e. thickets), with losses
   exceeding 70\% by 2085 (RCP8.5). Other forest habitats are predicted to
   decrease (lowland forest and woodland) representing essential ecological
   networks, whereas suitable habitats for carbon-rich mangroves are
   predicted to expand by more than 40\% at both scenarios. Conclusions
   Climate change will impact forests by accelerating habitat loss, and
   fragmentation and the remaining land suitable for forests will also be
   subject to pressures associated with rising demand for food and
   biofuels. These changes are likely to increase the probability of
   adverse impacts to the country's indigenous flora and fauna. Our
   findings, therefore, call for a shift in conservation efforts, focusing
   on (i) the enhanced management of existing protected areas that can
   absorb the impacts of future climate change, and (ii) expanding
   conservation efforts into newly suitable regions through effective land
   use planning and land reclamation, helping to preserve and enhance
   forest connectivity between fragmented patches.},

Title = {Appraising sustainable flood risk management in the Pearl River Delta's

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {390-409},
Abstract = {The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region has experienced rapid economic and
   population growth in the last three decades. The delta includes coastal
   megacities, such as Hong Kong. These low-lying urbanised coastal regions
   in the PRD are vulnerable to flood risks from unpredictable climatic
   conditions. These can result in increasing storm surges, rising sea
   level and intensified rainstorms causing coastal and inland flooding,
   all of which impact the delta. This paper has taken the coastal megacity
   of Hong Kong as a case, focusing on two study sites: Shenzhen River and
   Tai O town, chosen for their peculiar inland and coastal flood problems.
   A sustainable flood risk appraisal (SFRA) template was developed against
   which sustainable flood risk management (FRM) practices in these sites
   were benchmarked. Thirty-eight stakeholders were interviewed during this
   research in order to understand the current FRM practices, their
   barriers and their constraints. It was found that FRM in the case study
   currently focuses on hard engineering, while neglecting other important
   sustainability indicators. A SFRA practice that takes public
   participation, equity of flood preparedness and environmental friendly
   into account could be effective in achieving sustainable flood risk
   mitigation practices in Hong Kong and other coastal cities in the PRD.},

Abstract = {One of the meteorological effects in cities is the increase in local
   temperature, which is known as urban heat island (UHI). The objective of
   this study was to detect and quantify the possible UHI in the city of
   Bucaramanga, Colombia. For this purpose, a real-time temperature
   measurement network was installed, composed of seven nodes, used to
   obtain temperature values every minute. Six of the nodes were located in
   different positions in the city, and the remaining one was used to give
   the reference measurement. The data collected were processed for
   elimination of outliers, management of missing data and noise filtering.
   Analysis of the data allowed detecting differences in the diurnal and
   nocturnal UHI intensity trends. It was concluded that the UHI intensity
   during the day varies depending on the Local Climate Zone that
   represents the location, while the UHI intensity value at night is quite
   uniform across the city, with a mean value of 1.0 degrees C. It was also
   possible to conclude that the magnitude of the daytime UHI is lower in
   the dry season.},

Title = {Feasibility of afforestation as an equitable nature-based solution in
   urban areas},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {81},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although nature-based solutions for urban heat mitigation have gained
   momentum, it is important to quantitatively assess the feasibility of
   such strategies to utilize space efficiently and prioritize lower-income
   communities, who have fewer options for climate change adaptation. Here
   we combine data from US census estimates, satellites, and
   satellite-derived products to develop a framework to target potentially
   suitable areas for urban afforestation to mitigate urban heat and
   minimize tree cover disparity. We test this framework for California and
   show that space exists for an additional 36 million (1.28 million acres
   of) trees in the state's urban areas. This would reduce the average
   urban land surface temperature by 1.8C and provide multiple co-benefits
   totaling \$1.1 billion annually, including reduction in heat-related
   medical visits (almost 4000 over 10 years) and 4.5 million metric tons
   of annual CO2 sequestration. Because funding is limited, we provide
   suitability scores for urban afforestation at the census block group
   (CBG) scale based on multiple considerations. In California,
   afforestation in CBGs with positive suitability scores will lead to
   \$712 million of net annual benefits (against an annual investment of
   \$467 million) and will serve 89\% of the \& AP;9 million urban
   residents in the lowest income quartile for their cities. This method
   can guide equitable urban afforestation efforts and be scaled to other
   North American cities.},

Abstract = {In a context of changing climate, extreme events, like floods or weather
   are expected to frequently increase. Hence, understanding the role of
   meteorological forcings affected shoreline evolution and riverbank
   erosion in spatio-temporal scales, especially Vu Gia - Thu Bon river
   coast located in Central Vietnam, is significantly remarkable. This is
   fundamental to interpret the information of shoreline and riverbank
   erosion-accretion trends. Plus, this helps coastal managers and policy
   makers give the effective solutions, interventions and strategies for
   adaptation and responding to possible changes in shoreline and
   riverbank. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to provide a deeper
   understanding the effects of meteorological forcings on shoreline and
   riverbank changes. To do this, the Google Earth images and field survey
   results in topography changes are implemented. Landsat images are added
   to better quantify the changes in shoreline and riverbank. More
   importantly, meteorological forcings extracted from the meteorological
   metadata and models are carefully analysed to have an insight into
   physical mechanisms and shoreline and riverbank behaviors. The results
   confirmed that the northeast winds are accompanied by
   stronger-than-normal tropical cyclones, which cause high waves on the
   river system. This is one of the main reasons for stronger shoreline
   erosion in Cua Dai estuary in the recent years. Additionally, the
   northeast wind-generated waves in winter are much stronger than the
   southeast wind-generated waves during the summer. The factors
   significantly contribute to the changes in shoreline and riverbank.
   Finally, precipitation is more abundant and northeast winds are more
   frequent and stronger than normal. This considerably affects the erosion
   tendency on the river sections at the positions like GiaoThuy or Ky Lam
   Bridge.},

Abstract = {The monitoring of the status and distribution of seabird populations is
   necessary to understand their spatial and temporal responses to rapid
   climate changes occurring in the Western Antarctic Peninsula area. We
   surveyed and mapped Admiralty Bay bird communities and related them to
   climate variables-temperature, temperature anomaly, Antarctic
   Oscillation Index and El-Nio Southern Oscillation Index. We recorded 13
   breeding seabird species over three seasons (2009/2010, 2010/2011 and
   2011/2012) and mapped 10 of them over an area of 149.5 ha. The ice-free
   areas with the greatest number of species were Point Thomas, Keller
   Peninsula and Hennequin Point. The most abundant species was the Adelie
   Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) followed by the Chinstrap Penguin (P.
   antarcticus). We observed that the number of breeding pairs of Gentoo
   Penguins (P. papua), Chinstrap Penguins and skuas (Catharacta
   maccormicki and C. antarctica) are related to temperature, temperature
   anomaly and El-Nio Southern Oscillation Index. The size of breeding
   populations and their distributions have been fluctuating over the last
   30 years in ice-free areas of Admiralty Bay. Most species showed a
   decreasing trend from 1978 to 2012, with the exception of Chinstrap
   Penguins, Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes giganteus) and skuas,
   which seem to be stable in numbers in the last two decades. Decreases in
   seabird populations from the Antarctic Peninsula are widely recognized
   as a response to environmental change and anthropogenic influences such
   as tourism and building activities, thus highlighting the importance of
   monitoring to support mitigation measures.},

Title = {The effectiveness of setback zones for adapting to sea-level rise in
   Croatia},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean coastal zone is particularly vulnerable to
   climate-induced sea-level rise due to rapid coastal development, leading
   to increased flood exposure in coastal areas. In Croatia, the share of
   developed coastline is still lower than in other Mediterranean
   countries, but development has accelerated since the 1960s. Available
   assessments of future coastal flood risk take into account adaptation by
   hard structural protection measures but do not consider other options,
   such as retreat from exposed areas or restricting future development. In
   this study, we provide the first assessment of the effects of setback
   zones on future coastal flood impacts on national scale. We extend the
   flood impact and adaptation module of the DIVA modelling framework with
   models of restricted future development and slow retreat (managed
   realignment) in the form of setback zones. We apply this model to a
   downscaled database of coastal segments of the coastline of Croatia. We
   find that setback zones are an effective and efficient measure for
   coastal adaptation. Construction restriction and managed realignment
   reduce the future cost of coastal flooding significantly, especially in
   combination with protection. If protection and construction restriction
   by setback zones are combined, the future cost of coastal flooding can
   be reduced by up to 39\%. Combining protection and managed realignment
   by setback zones can reduce the future cost of coastal flooding by up to
   93\%.},

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},

Volume = {184},
Number = {2},
Pages = {E16-E31},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Community-level resilience depends on the interaction between multiple
   populations that vary in individual responses to disturbance. For
   example, in tropical reefs, some corals can survive higher stress
   (resistance) while others exhibit faster recovery (engineering
   resilience) following disturbances such as thermal stress. While each
   type will negatively affect the other through competition, each might
   also benefit the other by reducing the potential for an additional
   competitor such as macroalgae to invade after a disturbance. To
   determine how community composition affects ecological resilience, we
   modeled coral macroalgae interactions given either a resistant coral, a
   resilient coral, or both together. Having both coral types (i.e.,
   response diversity) can lead to observable enhanced ecological
   resilience if (1) the resilient coral is not a superior competitor and
   (2) disturbance levels are high enough such that the resilient coral
   would collapse when considered alone. This enhanced resilience occurs
   through competitor-enabled rescue where each coral increases the
   potential for the other to recover from disturbance through external
   recruitment, such that both corals benefit from the presence of each
   other in terms of total cover and resilience. Therefore, conservation
   management aimed at protecting resilience under global change requires
   consideration of both diversity and connectivity between sites
   experiencing differential disturbance.},

   paper aims to delineate design strategies for urban greenery to maximize
   thermal benefits and mitigate the daytime UHI effect. Two site-specific
   design strategies for tree planting in the urban environment are
   proposed. The sky view factor (SVF)-based design approach and the
   wind-path design approach are evaluated in the neighbourhood scale in
   two climate-sensitive areas with different urban morphologies. Observed
   data and simulation results indicated that the cooling effect of urban
   trees is highly associated with SVF. Air temperature reduction (a 1.5
   degrees C reduction) is the most profound for the high SVF scenario,
   whereas substantial radiation shading (T-mrt reduced to 34 degrees C) is
   detected in areas with medium-low SVFs. The modelling study also showed
   that the cooling of air temperature and sensible heat were twice as high
   for vegetation arranged in wind corridors than those for leeward areas.
   The study demonstrated that tree planting in conjunction with proper
   planning is an effective measure to mitigate daytime UHI. (C) 2015

Abstract = {DISTINGUISHING THE ROLES OF NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENICALLY FORCED DECADAL
   CLIMATE VARIABILITY: IMPLICATIONS FOR PREDICTION
   Given that over the course of the next 10-30 years the magnitude of
   natural decalial variations may rival that of anthropogenically forced
   climate change on regional scales, it is envisioned that initialized
   decadal predictions will provide important information for
   climate-related management and adaptation decisions. Such predictions
   are presently one of the grand challenges for the climate community.
   This requires identifying those physical phenomena and their model
   equivalents that May provide additional predictability on decadal time
   scales, including an assessment of the physical processes through which
   anthropogenic forcing may interact with or project upon natural
   variability. Such a physical framework is necessary to provide a
   consistent assessment (and insight into potential improvement) of the
   decadal prediction experiments planned to be assessed as part of the
   IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report.},

Abstract = {Projecting the future effects of climate change on marine fished
   populations can help prepare the fishing industry and management systems
   for resulting ecological, social and economic changes. Generating
   projections using multiple climate scenarios can provide valuable
   insights for fisheries stakeholders regarding uncertainty arising from
   future climate data. Using a range of climate projections based on the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate
   scenarios, we modelled abundance of eight commercially important bottom
   dwelling fish species across the Celtic Sea, English Channel and
   southern North Sea through the 21st century. This region spans a faunal
   boundary between cooler northern waters and warmer southern waters,
   where mean sea surface temperatures are projected to rise by 2 to 4
   degrees C by 2098. For each species, Generalized Additive Models were
   trained on spatially explicit abundance data from six surveys between
   2001 and 2010. Annual and seasonal temperatures were key drivers of
   species abundance patterns. Models were used to project species
   abundance for each decade through to 2090. Projections suggest important
   future changes in the availability and catchability of fish species,
   with projected increases in abundance of red mulletMullus surmuletusL.,
   Dover soleSolea soleaL., John doryZeus faberL. and lemon soleMicrostomus
   kittL. and decreases in abundance of Atlantic codGadus morhuaL.,
   anglerfishLophius piscatoriusL. and megrimLepidorhombus whiffiagonisL.
   European plaicePleuronectes platessaL. appeared less affected by
   projected temperature changes. Most projected abundance responses were
   comparable among climate projections, but uncertainty in the rate and
   magnitude of changes often increased substantially beyond 2040.
   Synthesis and applications. These results indicate potential risks as
   well as some opportunities for demersal fisheries under climate change.
   These changes will challenge current management systems, with
   implications for decisions on target fishing mortality rates, fishing
   effort and allowable catches. Increasingly flexible and adaptive
   approaches that reduce climate impacts on species while also supporting
   industry adaptation are required.},

Abstract = {Projections of the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems are a
   key prerequisite for the planning of adaptation strategies, yet they are
   inevitably associated with uncertainty. Identifying, quantifying, and
   communicating this uncertainty is key to both evaluating the risk
   associated with a projection and building confidence in its robustness.
   We review how uncertainties in such projections are handled in marine
   science. We employ an approach developed in climate modelling by
   breaking uncertainty down into (i) structural (model) uncertainty, (ii)
   initialization and internal variability uncertainty, (iii) parametric
   uncertainty, and (iv) scenario uncertainty. For each uncertainty type,
   we then examine the current state-of-the-art in assessing and
   quantifying its relative importance. We consider whether the marine
   scientific community has addressed these types of uncertainty
   sufficiently and highlight the opportunities and challenges associated
   with doing a better job. We find that even within a relatively small
   field such as marine science, there are substantial differences between
   subdisciplines in the degree of attention given to each type of
   uncertainty. We find that initialization uncertainty is rarely treated
   explicitly and reducing this type of uncertainty may deliver gains on
   the seasonal-to-decadal time-scale. Weconclude that all parts of marine
   science could benefit from a greater exchange of ideas, particularly
   concerning such a universal problem such as the treatment of
   uncertainty. Finally, marine science should strive to reach the point
   where scenario uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty in our
   projections.},

Abstract = {Climate change and rising sea level is transforming global coastlines as
   corroborated by significant changes in the position of shoreline
   witnessed through coastal erosion or accretion. Andhra Pradesh has the
   second longest (972 km) coastline in India. The present study analyzed
   shoreline change and its future prediction by employing
   satellite-derived data and geographic information system. End point rate
   (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR) statistical tools in the Digital
   Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) were used to estimate historical
   shoreline change rate between 1973 and 2015. Erosion and accretion of
   the coastline were delineated from Landsat satellite images for 1973,
   1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015; subsequently, shoreline is predicted
   for short-term (2025) and long-term (2050) periods. The study showcased
   that the river mouths of Krishna and Godavari experienced higher rate of
   change in shoreline position influenced by the deltaic environment and
   fluvial processes. LRR model prediction depicts the average rate of
   shoreline change during 2015-2025 will be -4.64 m, while between 2015
   and 2050 it will increase to -16.25 m. The study observed that the error
   between predicted and actual shoreline is higher in the river mouth and
   deltaic plains. Predicted shoreline position will provide baseline
   information for adaptation strategies and policy framework for coastal
   management.},

Abstract = {Future global emissions of aerosols will play an important role in
   governing the nature and magnitude of future anthropogenic climate
   change. We present in this paper a number of future scenarios of
   emissions of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) by world region,
   which we combine with sulfate (SO4) assessed in terms of the emissions
   of its precursor, SO2. We find that aerosol emissions from the household
   and industrial sectors are likely to decline along almost all future
   pathways. Transportation emissions, however, are subject to complex
   interacting forces that can lead to either increases or decreases.
   Biomass burning declines in many scenarios, but the Amazon rainforests
   remain vulnerable if unsustainable economic growth persists. East Asia
   is the key region for primary aerosols, and trends in China will have a
   major bearing on the direction and magnitude of releases of BC (expected
   reductions in the range of 640-1290 Gg), OC (reductions of 520-1900 Gg),
   and SO2 (ranging from an increase of 21 Tg to a reduction of 30 Tg).
   Analysis of joint BC, OC, and SO2 emission changes identifies a number
   of key world regions and economic sectors that could be effectively
   targeted for aerosol reductions.},

Volume = {635},
Pages = {203-232},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Coral-reef ecosystems are experiencing frequent and severe disturbance
   events that are reducing global coral abundance and potentially
   overwhelming the natural capacity for reefs to recover. While mitigation
   strategies for climate warming and other anthropogenic disturbances are
   implemented, coral restoration programmes are being established
   worldwide as an additional conservation measure to minimise coral loss
   and enhance coral recovery. Current restoration efforts predominantly
   rely on asexually produced coral fragments- a process with inherent
   practical constraints on the genetic diversity conserved and the spatial
   scale achieved. Because the resilience of coral communities has hitherto
   relied on regular renewal with natural recruits, the scaling-up of
   restoration programmes would benefit from greater use of sexually
   produced corals, which is an approach that is gaining momentum. Here we
   review the present state of knowledge of scleractinian coral sexual
   reproduction in the context of reef restoration, with a focus on
   broadcast-spawning corals. We identify key knowledge gaps and
   bottlenecks that currently constrain the sexual production of corals and
   consider the feasibility of using sexually produced corals for
   scaling-up restoration to the reef- and reef-system scales.},

Title = {Drinking Water Sodium and Elevated Blood Pressure of Healthy Pregnant
   Women in Salinity-Affected Coastal Areas},
Journal = {HYPERTENSION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {464+},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Coastal areas in Southeast Asia are experiencing high sodium
   concentrations in drinking water sources that are commonly consumed by
   local populations. Salinity problems caused by episodic cyclones and
   subsequent seawater inundations are likely (partly) related to climate
   change and further exacerbated by changes in upstream river flow and
   local land-use activities. Dietary (food) sodium plays an important role
   in the global burden of hypertensive disease. It remains unknown,
   however, if sodium in drinking water-rather than food-has similar
   effects on blood pressure and disease risk. In this study, we examined
   the effect of drinking water sodium on blood pressure of pregnant women:
   increases in blood pressure in this group could severely affect maternal
   and fetal health. Data on blood pressure, drinking water source, and
   personal, lifestyle, and environmental confounders was obtained from 701
   normotensive pregnant women residing in coastal Bangladesh. Generalized
   linear mixed regression models were used to investigate association of
   systolic and diastolic blood pressure of these-otherwise healthy-women
   with their water source. After adjustment for confounders, drinkers of
   tube well and pond water (high saline sources) were found to have
   significantly higher average systolic (+4.85 and +3.62 mm Hg) and
   diastolic (+2.30 and + 1.72 mm Hg) blood pressures than rainwater
   drinkers. Drinking water salinity problems are expected to exacerbate in
   the future, putting millions of coastal people-including pregnant
   women-at increased risk of hypertension and associated diseases. There
   is an urgent need to further explore the health risks associated to this
   understudied environmental health problem and feasibility of possible
   adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Feedback mechanisms stabilise degraded turf algal systems at a CO2 seep
   site},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Human activities are rapidly changing the structure and function of
   coastal marine ecosystems. Large-scale replacement of kelp forests and
   coral reefs with turf algal mats is resulting in homogenous habitats
   that have less ecological and human value. Ocean acidification has
   strong potential to substantially favour turf algae growth, which led us
   to examine the mechanisms that stabilise turf algal states. Here we show
   that ocean acidification promotes turf algae over corals and macroalgae,
   mediating new habitat conditions that create stabilising feedback loops
   (altered physicochemical environment and microbial community, and an
   inhibition of recruitment) capable of locking turf systems in place.
   Such feedbacks help explain why degraded coastal habitats persist after
   being initially pushed past the tipping point by global and local
   anthropogenic stressors. An understanding of the mechanisms that
   stabilise degraded coastal habitats can be incorporated into adaptive
   management to better protect the contribution of coastal systems to
   human wellbeing.},

Abstract = {Floods in coastal areas occur yearly in Indonesia, resulting in
   socio-economic losses. The availability of flood susceptibility maps is
   essential for flood mitigation. This study aimed to explore four
   different types of models, namely, frequency ratio (FR), weight of
   evidence (WofE), random forest (RF), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP),
   for coastal flood susceptibility assessment in Pasuruan and Probolinggo
   in the East Java region. Factors were selected based on
   multi-collinearity and the information gain ratio to build flood
   susceptibility maps in small watersheds. The comprehensive exploration
   result showed that seven of the eleven factors, namely, elevation,
   geology, soil type, land use, rainfall, RD, and TWI, influenced the
   coastal flood susceptibility. The MLP outperformed the other three
   models, with an accuracy of 0.977. Assessing flood susceptibility with
   those four methods can guide flood mitigation management.},

Title = {Quantifying patterns of resilience: What matters is the intensity, not
   the relevance, of contributing factors},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ecological resilience, broadly defined as the magnitude of the
   disturbance a system needs to shift to an alternative stable state, is
   becoming a critical trait in the Anthropocene era. However, we are far
   from having baseline resilience data to guide decision makers toward
   more resilient ecological systems. In the last decade, the resilience
   assessment framework has taken a sum of products approach to obtain a
   resilience indicator based on the relevance and the intensity of
   multiple factors. While factor intensity relies on quantitative data,
   estimates of factor relevance rely on ordinal data with a lesser
   understanding of their relative importance to resilience, which may have
   consequences in the value of the resilience indicator. Here, we computed
   three resilience indicators to test for the quantitative impact that
   changes in factor relevance might cause to the resilience indicator. We
   defined the Inclusive Resilience Indicator of a Site (IRIS) as a
   relevance-free indicator based exclusively on factor intensity. We also
   computed the Relative Resilience Potential (RRP) and an RRP with random
   relevance values (RRPrrv) as indicators based on both intensity and
   relevance. To calculate these three indicators in rocky reefs of the
   Alboran Sea, we quantified 17 biological, environmental, and
   human-related factors known to influence resilience. We used correlation
   analyses, Linear Mixed Models, and Generalized Additive Models to
   compare the three resilience indicators and to examine their spatial
   patterns. We found highly significant positive correlations between the
   RRP, RRPrrv, and IRIS indicators (r > 0.9, p < 0.001 for all
   comparisons). All three indicators had equivalent resilience values (p =
   0.440), provided non-significant differences in their predictions (p =
   0.097), and exposed the same resilience gradients in the Alboran Sea (p
   < 0.001 for all indicators). IRIS accounted for 94\% and 99\% of the
   variance associated with RRP and RRPrrv, respectively, suggesting that
   the intensity-based IRIS can estimate resilience without the
   uncertainties associated with factor relevance. The new IRIS indicator
   proposed in our study may facilitate the acquisition of baseline data
   needed to further advance in the ecological and management implications
   of marine resilience.},

Abstract = {Temperatures in South Australia have risen 0.5-1.5 degrees C post-1950,
   a trend expected to drive ecological change. However, climate
   sensitivity, landscape resilience and management priorities vary among
   regions. We classified the vulnerability of South Australian plant
   assemblages to climate change in a framework that combines climate
   sensitivity and resilience. Generalised Dissimilarity Models (GDMs) of
   plant species composition were trained with species occurrence records
   from field plots. Resilience was represented by the proportional
   remnancy of native vegetation surrounding each location. Landscapes were
   classified using bivariate quantiles. Mean annual rainfall, summer
   maximum temperatures and spatial structure were important predictors of
   species turnover. GDMs (explaining 37-.68\% of deviance) were projected
   onto future climate scenarios to calculate sensitivity metrics. The
   Wheat Belt, mallee and Flinders Ranges were the most sensitive,
   representing a climatic transition characterised by rapid change in
   species assemblages. Southern Eyre Peninsula and western Kangaroo Island
   were classified as Resilient; the Mount Lofty Ranges, southern Flinders
   Ranges and eastern Kangaroo Island as Resistant; northern Eyre Peninsula
   and northern Hinders Ranges as Sensitive; and the Wheat Belt as
   Susceptible. The classification assists decisions on management priority
   and provenances or species selection for restoration and assisted
   migration in conjunction with other biodiversity measures.},

Title = {Place influences in framing and understanding climate change adaptation
   challenges},
Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},
Pages = {730-751},
Abstract = {The climate change literature emphasises the importance of geographical
   understanding for guiding adaptation, in which ``place{''} perspectives
   are particularly significant. After ``scale{''}, the term ``place{''}
   within the climate change adaptation literature is most often implicitly
   used in reference to a delineated and localised region, such as
   place-based risk assessment or place-based adaptation planning. Here, we
   use a case study of the Australian island-state of Tasmania to
   demonstrate the importance and particularity of place in the formation
   of climate change adaptation issues, problem definition and framing, and
   the dynamics of knowledge and praxis development across a range of
   research and industry sectors. We describe the significance of the place
   Tasmania with regard to its geographical location; its portrayal as an
   island place; and its cultural meaning and relations. Through a
   synthesis of climate change adaptation research, policy literature and
   engagement with researchers and stakeholders, we identify three emergent
   thematic place characterisations of Tasmania. We find that these
   characterisations have contributed directly or indirectly to the:
   initiation and extent of research and practical activities; the framing
   of adaptation issues and perspectives on potential adaptation responses
   in different sectors including the marine biodiversity and resources
   sector, small business and human health sectors. Exposing these
   influences is essential for focusing future adaptation activities,
   including research, planning, investment and practice, in Tasmania and
   other locations where place is a central issue.},

Title = {Governmental policies on hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) mitigation and
   its cleaner production measures - case study in Taiwan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {646-654},
Abstract = {Taiwan, a small island country located in the southeastern rim of Asia,
   is playing a vital role of mitigating hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)
   mitigation, although it is not a signatory to the Montreal Protocol.
   Furthermore, the Government has established a ministry-level
   organization, National Council for Sustainable Development (NCSD), for
   pursuing sustainability in this country and fulfilling its
   responsibility as a member of the international community. In this
   paper, the description was thus centered on reviewing the current uses
   of HCFCs and its current consumption status and cleaner production
   measures adopted by the local industries in Taiwan, and summarizing the
   governmental policies on promoting HCFCs mitigation through the
   encouragement of regulatory, economic and financial approaches. The
   preliminary analyses of the achievements of HCFCs mitigation in
   comparison with other relevant socioeconomic statistics were also
   discussed in this paper. It was concluded that Taiwan was in a positive
   trend to mitigate HCFCs consumption in the past decade (1996-2005) under
   the promotion of its policy framework. Further, the successful case
   could be developed into a sustainable development indicator in the
   environmental pollution dimension, thereby providing a demonstrated
   example for other island and developing countries in progress toward
   global sustainability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Global Mapping of Seaport Operability Risk Indicators Using Open-Source
   Metocean Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Seaport operability is key to the economic viability of ports. Metocean
   conditions (e.g., wind, short waves, and infragravity waves) affect this
   operability when certain thresholds are exceeded. This paper describes a
   method for the global mapping of seaport operability risk indicators
   using open-source metocean data. This global-scale assessment provides a
   geographic overview of operability risks and first-order insights into
   the most relevant metocean risk indicators at each location. The results
   show that locations around the equator and inland seas have lower
   operability risk than locations farther away from the equator.
   ``Hotspots{''} are mainly located along the southern capes (Cape of Good
   Hope, Leeuwin, Horn), around the `Roaring Forties', and at exposed
   locations along the oceans. Of the metocean parameters considered, short
   waves are found to be the most critical risk indicator for port
   operability at most locations. Using (the insights of) this study, port
   authorities, operators, and designers can prepare for metocean risks at
   an early stage and effectively respond with mitigation measures and
   layout adjustments to improve port operability.},

Title = {Nature-based solutions to promote human resilience and wellbeing in
   cities during increasingly hot summers},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {249-256},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Air temperatures are increasing because of global climate change. A
   warming phenomenon strongly related to global climate change is the
   urban heat island. It has been shown that the hotter temperatures
   occurring in cities during the summer negatively affect human wellbeing,
   but little is known about the potential mechanisms underlying the
   relationships between hotter temperatures, cognitive psychological
   resources and wellbeing. The aim of the present research is to
   understand whether, and how, spending time in urban green spaces, which
   can be considered as a specific kind of Nature-Based Solution (NBS),
   helps the recovery of cognitive resources and wellbeing. The main
   hypothesis is that contact with urban green is related to wellbeing
   through the depletion of cognitive resources (i.e., ego depletion).
   Moreover, we expected that individuals showing higher scores of ego
   depletion also report a higher estimate of the maximum temperature
   reached during the summer. The results of a survey (N = 115) conducted
   among visitors to Parco Nord Milano, a large urban park located in Milan
   (Italy), point out that people visiting the park during the summer show
   a higher level of wellbeing as well as a lower level of ego depletion. A
   mediation analysis shows that visiting urban green spaces is associated
   with greater wellbeing through less ego depletion. Our results also
   point out that, as expected, people showing a higher level of ego
   depletion tend to overestimate the maximum air temperature. Implications
   for future studies and applied interventions regarding the role of NBS
   to promote human wellbeing are discussed.},

Title = {The effect of pavement characteristics on pedestrians' thermal comfort
   in Toronto},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {449-459},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) has proved to have an important effect in urban
   microclimate of large cities. In particular, the materials used for the
   pavements of urban spaces and sidewalks affect pedestrians' comfort
   significantly. Dark materials store solar radiation during the day and
   reradiate it overnight. Reversely, cool materials, given their high
   albedo, are often proposed for mitigating UHI issues. This paper focuses
   on the effect on the outdoor thermal comfort of different materials in a
   main urban square in Toronto. The study is performed at the neighborhood
   scale, using the high resolution software ENVI-met. Simulations done for
   a summer heat wave in 2015 allowed predicting the maximum effect of
   pavementswith surfaces having different albedo. The physiological
   equivalent temperature (PET) is used to assess the pedestrians' thermal
   comfort. The results show the relative effectiveness of different
   pavement materials. In particular, thermal comfort evaluations are
   reported to assess the microclimate benefits of bright marbles over
   black granites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {How natural processes contribute to flood protection - A sustainable
   adaptation scheme for a wide green dike},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {739},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Effective adaptation to sea-level rise is critical for future flood
   protection. Nature-based solutions including salt marshes have been
   proposed to naturally enhance coastal infrastructure. A gently sloping
   grass-covered dike ( i.e. Wide Green Dike) can be strengthened with clay
   accumulating locally in the salt marsh. This study explores the
   feasibility of extracting salt-marsh sediment for dike reinforcement as
   a climate adaptation strategy in several sea-level rise scenarios, using
   the Wide Green Dike in the Dutch part of the Ems-Dollard estuary as a
   case study. A O-D sedimentation model was combined with a wave
   propagation model, and probabilistic models for wave impact and wave
   overtopping. This model system was used to determine the area of borrow
   pits required to supply clay for adequate dikes under different
   sea-level rise scenarios.
   For medium to high sea-level rise scenarios (>102 cm by 2100) thickening
   of the clay layer on the dike is required to compensate for the larger
   waves resulting from insufficient marsh accretion. The model results
   indicate that for our case study roughly 9A ha of borrow pit is
   sufficient to supply clay for 1 km of dike reinforcement until 2100. The
   simulated borrow pits are refilled within 22 simulation years on
   average, and infilling is projected to accelerate with sea-level rise
   and pit depth. This study highlights the potential of salt marshes as an
   asset for adapting flood defences in the future. (C) 2020 The Authors.

   hazards: A perspective on coastal communities in subduction zones},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Integrated disaster resilience approaches are paramount for enhancing
   risk management of coastal communities in subduction zones under
   climate-geological risks. Cascading compounding climate-geological risks
   are dynamic, interact, and evolve with time. Also, classical convolution
   of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure does not allow easy
   implementation of causalities and dependencies that are critical in
   modelling impact chains due to cascading compounding multi-hazards. A
   new dynamic multi-hazard catastrophe modelling framework is proposed to
   fill important research gaps in the temporal evolution of
   climate-geological risks. Systemic modelling is a key tool where
   time-dependent and interacting risks are explicitly modelled, and
   multiple risk metrics can be computed. Furthermore, a possible new
   entropy-based approach for harmonising risk metrics is presented. Such a
   harmonisation can facilitate the decision-making process for disaster
   risk reduction. Finally, a way forward for future implementation of the
   proposed methodologies is discussed with a focus on the need for the
   development of new numerical and analytical tools.},

Title = {Implications of climate change on the distribution of the tick vector
   Ixodes scapularis and risk for Lyme disease in the Texas-Mexico
   transboundary region},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Disease risk maps are important tools that help ascertain
   the likelihood of exposure to specific infectious agents. Understanding
   how climate change may affect the suitability of habitats for ticks will
   improve the accuracy of risk maps of tick-borne pathogen transmission in
   humans and domestic animal populations. Lyme disease (LD) is the most
   prevalent arthropod borne disease in the US and Europe. The bacterium
   Borrelia burgdorferi causes LD and it is transmitted to humans and other
   mammalian hosts through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. LD risk maps
   in the transboundary region between the U.S. and Mexico are lacking.
   Moreover, none of the published studies that evaluated the effect of
   climate change in the spatial and temporal distribution of I. scapularis
   have focused on this region.
   Methods: The area of study included Texas and a portion of northeast
   Mexico. This area is referred herein as the Texas-Mexico transboundary
   region. Tick samples were obtained from various vertebrate hosts in the
   region under study. Ticks identified as I. scapularis were processed to
   obtain DNA and to determine if they were infected with B. burgdorferi
   using PCR. A maximum entropy approach (MAXENT) was used to forecast the
   present and future (2050) distribution of B. burgdorferi-infected I.
   scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region by correlating
   geographic data with climatic variables.
   Results: Of the 1235 tick samples collected, 109 were identified as I.
   scapularis. Infection with B. burgdorferi was detected in 45\% of the I.
   scapularis ticks collected. The model presented here indicates a wide
   distribution for I. scapularis, with higher probability of occurrence
   along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Results of the modeling approach applied
   predict that habitat suitable for the distribution of I. scapularis in
   the Texas-Mexico transboundary region will remain relatively stable
   until 2050.
   Conclusions: The Texas-Mexico transboundary region appears to be part of
   a continuum in the pathogenic landscape of LD. Forecasting based on
   climate trends provides a tool to adapt strategies in the near future to
   mitigate the impact of LD related to its distribution and risk for
   transmission to human populations in the Mexico-US transboundary region.},

Abstract = {Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar L.) were transferred to
   full-strength seawater for 0 (initial control group), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8,
   14, 30, 42 and 60 days at four different temperatures (4.6, 9.1, 14.4
   and 18.9 degrees C). Water temperature in each tank was adjusted during
   the last 5 days in freshwater (ambient 8 degrees C) to gradually
   establish test conditions of 4.6, 9.1, 14.4 and 18.9 degrees C 24 h
   prior to transfer, Thereafter, the water in all tanks were changed from
   freshwater to seawater of identical temperature, and full salinity (33
   parts per thousand) was reached within 60 min. Physiological adaptation
   was measured as changes in plasma growth hormone levels, gill
   Na+,K+-ATPase activity, plasma chloride levels and muscle water content.
   The fatty acid composition of gill tissues was determined after 30 days
   in seawater. Ion and water balance following seawater transfer were
   significantly affected by temperature. Exposure to high temperatures
   (18.9 degrees C) resulted in a rapid increase in plasma chloride levels
   and a rise in tissue dehydration within 24 h, whereas low temperatures
   (4.6 degrees C) resulted in a delayed osmotic disturbance and a
   prolonged period of osmotic stress. Least osmoregulatory disturbance was
   observed at 9.1 degrees C. Gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity did not increase
   after seawater exposure at 4.6 and 9.1 degrees C, whereas a gradual
   increase was observed with increasing temperatures at 14.3 and 18.9
   degrees C during the first 48 h in seawater. Plasma GH increased in all
   groups during the first 24 h of seawater exposure. GH levels decreased
   during long-term adaptation in the 4.6, 9.1 and 14.4 degrees C groups,
   whereas a significant increase was observed in the 18.9 degrees C group.
   Growth increased with increasing temperature between 4.6 and 14.4
   degrees C, but decreased significantly between 14.4 and 18.9 degrees C
   demonstrating that 18.9 degrees C is above optimum for growth and
   development in seawater. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {An ecosystem approach to kelp aquaculture in the Americas and Europe},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Kelp farming is increasing along the temperate coastlines of the
   Americas and Europe. The economic, ecological, and social frameworks
   surrounding kelp farming in these new areas are in contrast with the
   conditions of progenitor kelp farming regions in China, Japan, and
   Korea.
   Thus, identifying and addressing the environmental and social impacts of
   kelp farming in these regions is vital to ensuring the industry's
   long-term sustainability. Here, a conceptual model of the human and
   natural systems supporting this nascent kelp aquaculture sector was
   developed using Maine, USA as a focal region. Potential negative impacts
   of kelp aquaculture were identified to be habitat degradation,
   overfishing of wild seeds, predation and competition with wild fish and
   genes, and transmission of diseases. Increased food security, improved
   restoration efforts, greater fisheries productivity, and alternative
   livelihoods development were determined to be potential positive impacts
   of kelp aquaculture. Changes in biodiversity and productivity resulting
   from either negative or positive impacts of kelp aquaculture were
   confirmed to have downstream effects on local fisheries and coastal
   communities. Recommendations to improve or protect the ecosystem
   services tangential to kelp farming include: define ecosystem and
   management boundaries, assess ecosystem services and environmental
   carrying capacity, pursue ecologically and socially considerate
   engineering, and protect the health and genetic diversity of wild kelp
   beds. Recommendations to ensure that kelp farming improves the
   well-being of all stakeholders include: increase horizontal expansion,
   expand and teach Best Management Practices, and develop climate change
   resiliency. Additionally, an integrated management strategy should be
   developed for wild and farmed kelp to ensure that kelp aquaculture is
   developed in the context of other sectors and goals.},

Abstract = {Climate change threatens coral reefs by causing heat stress events that
   lead to widespread coral bleaching and mortality. Given the global
   nature of these mass coral mortality events, recent studies argue that
   mitigating climate change is the only path to conserve coral reefs.
   Using a global analysis of 223 sites, we show that local stressors act
   synergistically with climate change to kill corals. Local factors such
   as high abundance of macroalgae or urchins magnified coral loss in the
   year after bleaching. Notably, the combined effects of increasing heat
   stress and macroalgae intensified coral loss. Our results offer an
   optimistic premise that effective local management, alongside global
   efforts to mitigate climate change, can help coral reefs survive the
   Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {The ecological competences in microbiomes are driven by the adaptive
   capabilities present within microbiome members. Horizontal gene transfer
   (HGT) promoted by plasmids provides a rapid adaptive strategy to
   microbiomes, an interesting feature considering the constantly changing
   conditions in most environments. This study examined the parA locus,
   found in the highly promiscuous PromA class of plasmids, as the
   insertion site for incoming genes. A novel PCR system was designed that
   enabled examining insertions into this locus. Microbiomes of mangrove
   sediments, salt marsh, mycosphere, and bulk soil revealed
   habitat-specific sets of insertions in this plasmid region. Furthermore,
   such habitats could be differentiated based on patterns of parA-inserted
   genes, and the genes carried by these plasmids. Thus, a suite of
   dioxygenase-related genes and transposase elements were found in
   oil-affected mangroves, whereas genes involved in nitrogen and carbon
   cycling were detected in salt marsh and soils. All genes detected could
   be associated with capabilities of members of the microbiome to adapt to
   and survive in each habitat. The methodology developed in this work was
   effective, sensitive, and practical, allowing detection of mobilized
   genes between microorganisms.},

Title = {A Demonstration of a Simple Methodology of Flood Prediction for a
   Coastal City Under Threat of Sea Level Rise: The Case of Norfolk, VA,
   USA},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Many coastal cities around the world are at risk of increased flooding
   due to sea level rise (SLR), so here a simple flood prediction method is
   demonstrated for one city at risk, Norfolk, VA, on the U.S. East Coast.
   The probability of future flooding is estimated by extending observed
   hourly water level for 1927-2021 into hourly estimates until 2100.
   Unlike most other flood prediction methods, the approach here does not
   use any predetermined probability distribution function of extreme
   events, and instead a random sampling of past data represents tides and
   storm surges. The probability of flooding for 3 different flood levels
   and 3 different SLR projections are calculated, and the results are
   consistent with more sophisticated methods. Under intermediate-low SLR
   projection an empirical formula is found to estimate the lower bound of
   flooding time, showing that water level that exceeds the high tide (Mean
   Higher High Water, MHHW) occurred similar to 0.3\% of the time in the
   1960s, increased to similar to 6\% in 2021, and projected to occur 100\%
   of the time by similar to 2080. Under intermediate SLR projection, 1000
   simulations of the probability of maximum annual water level were
   conducted, showing that storm surges may reach similar to 2 m over MHHW
   by 2050 and similar to 3 m over MHHW by 2100; in comparison, storm
   surges in Norfolk over the past 90 years reached 1.6 m only once. The
   method derived here could be adopted to other locations and help
   planning mitigations and adaptation strategies for cities at risk.},

Abstract = {Fisheries and aquaculture make a crucial contribution to global food
   security, nutrition and livelihoods. However, the UN Sustainable
   Development Goals separate marine and terrestrial food production
   sectors and ecosystems. To sustainably meet increasing global demands
   for fish, the interlinkages among goals within and across fisheries,
   aquaculture and agriculture sectors must be recognized and addressed
   along with their changing nature. Here, we assess and highlight
   development challenges for fisheries-dependent countries based on
   analyses of interactions and trade-offs between goals focusing on food,
   biodiversity and climate change. We demonstrate that some countries are
   likely to face double jeopardies in both fisheries and agriculture
   sectors under climate change. The strategies to mitigate these risks
   will be context-dependent, and will need to directly address the
   trade-offs among Sustainable Development Goals, such as halting
   biodiversity loss and reducing poverty. Countries with low adaptive
   capacity but increasing demand for food require greater support and
   capacity building to transition towards reconciling trade-offs.
   Necessary actions are context-dependent and include effective
   governance, improved management and conservation, maximizing societal
   and environmental benefits from trade, increased equitability of
   distribution and innovation in food production, including continued
   development of low input and low impact aquaculture.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper discusses whether existing coastal risk reduction policies in
   French Polynesia-a French Overseas Territory with a high degree of
   political autonomy-(i) consider current and future coastal risks from
   climate variability and change, and (ii) are designed to evolve as new
   knowledge on climate change emerges. The analysis relies on the study of
   risk-relevant policy documents and considers Coastal risk integration
   (i.e. extent to which coastal hazards and associated impacts are
   considered) and Adjustability (i.e. potential for the policy documents
   to be adjusted over time) as proxy outcomes for climate change policy
   integration more broadly. The results show that there are still
   important gaps relating to an insufficient incorporation of
   climate-related coastal hazards into the existing policy documents, and
   to difficulties in both implementing these documents and making them
   more climate change-compatible. While recent examples on the ground
   provide encouraging early signs towards more adjustable local policies,
   they are to date too time- and/or space-bounded to represent any real
   shift at the territory level.},

Title = {Shifting sands? Coastal protection by sand banks, beaches and dunes},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {87},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In a closely integrated system, (sub-) littoral sandy sediments, sandy
   beaches, and sand dunes offer natural coastal protection for a host of
   environmentally and economically important areas and activities inland.
   Flooding and coastal erosion pose a serious threat to these
   environments, a situation likely to be exacerbated by factors associated
   with climate change. Despite their importance, these sandy `soft'
   defences have been lost from many European coasts through the
   proliferation of coastal development and associated hard-engineering and
   face further losses due to sea-level rise, subsidence, storm surge
   events, and coastal squeeze. As part of the EU-funded THESEUS project we
   investigated the critical drivers that determine the persistence and
   maintenance of sandy coastal habitats around Europe's coastline, taking
   particular interest in their close link with the biological communities
   that inhabit them. The successful management of sandy beaches to restore
   and sustain sand budgets (e.g. via nourishment), depends on the kind of
   mitigation undertaken, local beach characteristics, and on the source of
   `borrowed' sediment. We found that inter-tidal invertebrates were good
   indicators of changes linked to different mitigation options. For sand
   dunes, field observations and manipulative experiments investigated
   different approaches to create new dune systems, in addition to measures

Title = {Intensified burn severity in California's northern coastal mountains by
   drier climatic condition},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The severity of wildfire burns in interior lands of western US
   ecosystems has been increasing. However, less is known about its coastal
   mountain ecosystems, especially under extreme weather conditions,
   raising concerns about the vulnerability of these populated areas to
   catastrophic fires. Here we examine the fine-scale association between
   burn severity and a suite of environmental drivers including explicit
   fuel information, weather, climate, and topography, for diverse
   ecosystems in California's northern coastal mountains. Burn severity was
   quantified using Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio from Landsat
   multispectral imagery during 1984-2017. We found a significant
   increasing trend in burned areas and severity. During low-precipitation
   years, areas that burned had much lower fuel moisture and higher
   climatic water deficit than in wetter years, and the percentage of
   high-severity areas doubled, especially during the most recent 2012-2016
   drought. The random forest (RF) machine learning model achieved overall
   accuracy of 79\% in classifying categories of burn severity. Aspect,
   slope, fuel type and availability, and temperature were the most
   important drivers, based on both classification and regression RF
   models. We further examined the importance of drivers under four
   climatic conditions: dry vs. wet years, and during two extended drought
   periods (the 2012-2016 warmer drought vs. the 1987-1992 drought). During
   warm and dry years, the spatial variability of burn severity was a mixed
   effect of slope, long-term minimum temperature, fuel amount, and fuel
   moisture. In contrast, climatic water deficit and short-term weather
   became dominant factors for fires during wetter years. These results
   suggest that relative importance of drivers for burn severity in the
   broader domain of California's northern coastal mountains varied with
   weather scenarios, especially when exacerbated by warm and extended
   drought. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting areas with
   high burn severity risk for fire adaptation and mitigation strategies in
   a changing climate and intensifying extremes.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, there is a clear evidence that climate change poses serious
   challenges to urban areas and their growing population, e.g. increasing
   occurrence of heat waves, drought, heavy precipitation, cyclones and
   extreme high sea level events. These changes will affect physical
   infrastructure, water supply, energy provision, transport and industrial
   production, hence resulting in a variety of ripple effects across
   different sectors of the city life. In this context, Earth observation
   (EO) has proven to be an effective tool for supporting decision makers
   in facing climate change; nevertheless, gaps still exist between the
   current state-of-the-art and the users' requirements. The FP7 DECUMANUS
   project aims at bridging this gap also by a direct strong engagement of
   city users. In particular, DECUMANUS has a principal objective to
   develop and consolidate a set of sustainable services that allows city
   managers to incorporate EO-based geo-spatial products and
   geo-information services in their climate and environmental change
   strategies to support the sustainable management of the cities in
   Europe. In this paper, we present three advanced products generated in
   the framework of the DECUMANUS land monitoring services, namely
   spatiotemporal urbanization mapping, imperviousness estimation and
   settlement patterns analysis. In particular, all of them have been
   generated according with the requirements of the project users'
   community and will allow supporting their environmental change
   adaptation strategies at the district level.},

Year = {2018},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Shandong has more than 70\% of natural coasts are under erosion. Coastal
   erosion started from the 1970's and became a very serious problem at
   1990's. The dramatic decrease of sediment supplies from rivers caused
   rapid erosion at the delta and estuary areas, especially in the
   abandoned Yellow River Delta. Most sandy coasts along the Peninsula were
   eroded due to lack of sand supply and interruption of alongshore
   sediment drift, sand dredging from the beach or the offshore area caused
   serious erosion during short time. Sea-level rise causes slow but
   constant shoreline retreats and became a more serious threat. Different
   types of hard solutions for coastal protection against erosion were used
   in Shandong. Seawalls are most widely used, especially at the Yellow
   River Delta and city center waterfront. Groynes, jetties and breakwater
   are used on the north and east sandy coast of the Peninsula. Hard
   approaches are effective to protect the coast erosion but not change the
   erosion causes and led secondary impact on the coast. Soft engineering
   solution or the combined solutions are taken into acts. Beach
   nourishment is mostly considered as the better soft solution, especially
   to those tourists attracting sandy beaches along the Shandong coast.
   Long term monitoring and continuous lessons learning from the coastal
   erosion management will be adaptive for better coast solution in the
   future. (C) 2018 China Geology Editorial Office.},

Abstract = {This article presents an innovative collaborative approach, which aims
   to reinforce and institutionalize the field of the political
   anthropology of the sea combined with the natural sciences. It begins by
   relating the evolution in coastal areas, from integrated coastal zone
   management to the notion of adaptive co-management. It then sets out
   what contribution the social sciences of politics may bring to our
   understanding of the government/governance of the sea in terms of
   sustainable development, starting with political science and then
   highlighting the importance of a deep anthropological and
   socio-historical approach. Finally, it gives us a glimpse of the
   benefits of combining the human and social sciences with the natural
   sciences to produce a critical analysis of the categories of thought and
   action associated with the systemic management of the environment,
   especially the coastal areas. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS

Title = {Ecological effects of climate change on little penguins Eudyptula minor
   and the potential economic impact on tourism},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-79},
Abstract = {Using a 40 yr demographic database of little penguins Eudyptula minor,
   we investigated anticipated impacts of climatic changes on the penguin
   population at Phillip Island, southeastern Australia, and the potential
   economic impact on the associated tourism industry over the next
   century. We project a small loss of penguin breeding habitat due to sea
   level rise, although breeding habitat is unlikely to be limiting over
   this period. However, some erosion in the vicinity of tourism
   infrastructure will undoubtedly occur which will have economic
   implications. We anticipate little direct impact of decreased rainfall
   and humidity. However, fire risk may increase, and extreme climate
   events may reduce adult and chick survival slightly. Warmer oceans are
   likely to improve recruitment into the breeding population but the
   effect on adult survival is unclear. Overall, many aspects of little
   penguin biology are likely to be affected by climatic change but no net
   negative effect on population size is projected from existing analyses.
   Ocean acidification has the potential to be a highly significant
   negative influence, but present assessments are speculative. Some of the
   predicted negative impacts can be addressed in the short-term,
   particularly those resulting from expected changes to the terrestrial
   environment. Others, particularly in the marine environment, appear to
   have limited options for mitigation locally. In the absence of evidence
   indicating population decline, economic impact may be confined to issues
   for tourism infrastructure due to increased sea-levels during storm
   events.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the impact of sea level rise and storm surge on the
   Red River delta region of Vietnam. Permanently inundated lands and
   temporary flood zones are analyzed by combining sea level rise scenarios
   for 2050 with simulated storm surge levels for the 100-year event. Our
   analysis finds that sea level rise through 2050 could increase the
   effective frequency of the current 100-year storm surge, which is
   associated with a storm surge of roughly five meters, to once every 49
   years. Approximately 10\% of the Hanoi region's GDP is vulnerable to
   permanent inundation due to sea level rise, and more than 40\% is
   vulnerable to periodic storm surge damage consistent with the current
   100-year storm. We conclude that coastal adaptation measures, such as a
   planned retreat from the sea, and construction of a more substantial
   seawall and dike system, are needed to respond to these threats.},

Abstract = {Climate change is causing shifts in the distribution patterns of
   freshwater fish at various spatio-temporal scales. Tropical freshwater
   fish are vulnerable, especially in areas where a high impact of climate
   change is predicted; thus, there is an increasing need to predict these
   shifts to determine conservation and adaptation strategies. Ecological
   niche models offer a reliable way to predict the effects of climate
   change on species distribution. Potential shifts in the distribution of
   tropical fish were tested under two scenarios (4.5 - moderate and 8.5 -
   extreme) with three general circulation models for years 2050 and 2070
   using maximum entropy software using as models two predatory species -
   the tropical gar Atractosteus tropicus and the giant cichlid Petenia
   splendida. The potential distribution of both species was associated
   with warm and humid-sub-humid conditions. Future projections showed a
   higher availability of suitable areas for both species resulting from
   the expansion of warmer conditions in the middle and upper basins of the
   Central American mountain range and centre of the Yucatan Peninsula.
   Ecological niche models of keystone or umbrella species such as A.
   tropicus and P. splendida could be useful to support conservation plans
   of protected areas. The potential distribution of both species covers
   areas of high suitability including six important biosphere reserves in
   Mexico, three protected areas in Guatemala and part of the Mesoamerican
   biological corridor. Despite the potential expansion of the present
   distribution range suggested by the models, it is important to consider
   the biological and ecological requirements of the species and the
   ecological implications of these potential shifts in distribution. Both
   scenarios could have several implications at genetic, population, and
   ecosystem levels.},

Title = {Natural and nature based features for environmental enhancement and
   coastal storm risk management: a case study on Marco Island, Florida,
   United States},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Natural and Nature-Based systems provide an opportunity for adaptive
   response to Coastal Storm Risk Management and Sea Level Rise. The
   Tigertail Lagoon/Sand Dollar Island Restoration on Marco Island,
   Florida, presents a case study designed to maintain and enhance an
   existing coastal barrier system consisting of a 3-km-long sand spit and
   tidal lagoon ecosystem that is otherwise evolving toward closure. The
   case study is part of a nature-based adaptive management plan to restore
   and stabilize the sandspit and tidal lagoon through cyclic use of
   sediment within the system. This approach seeks to preserve existing
   protective habitats and landforms that also serve as natural coastal
   barriers to protect upland development. Design of the restoration plan
   considers the functions of a wildlife nature preserve and evolution of
   complex tidal inlet morphologic features bordered by a heavily developed
   barrier Island. The design aims to restore and enhance a sandspit
   degraded by a sequence of storms since Major Hurricane Irma impacted
   Southwest Florida in 2017 and improve the existing deteriorated habitat
   by enhancing tidal exchange through restoration of the lagoon flow
   channel. Total wetland area will be increased by relocating the sand
   spit seaward of its present location to where it was located in
   approximately 2017. The reconstructed beach berm will provide enhanced
   resiliency to high frequency weather events. Sediment will be sourced
   from the existing sand spit and an innovative sand trap that will
   maintain the lagoon entrance open while providing beneficial re-use for
   excess sediment that continues to accumulate at the end of the spit.
   Components of the project were analyzed using existing engineering
   models and methods such as the Coastal Modeling System (CMS) and XBeach.
   Enhancing and preserving this barrier island feature and productive
   ecosystem provides an example of the enhanced coastal resiliency
   provided by natural and nature-based systems that are adaptable and
   responsive to sea level rise and ongoing coastal processes.},

Title = {Adaptive Responses of the Sea Anemone Heteractis crispa to the
   Interaction of Acidification and Global Warming},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simple Summary This study investigated the effects of the interaction of
   acidification and warming on the photosynthetic apparatus and sterol
   metabolism of sea anemone Heteractis crispa. Thermal stress is the
   dominant driver of the deteriorating health of H. crispa, which might be
   relatively insensitive to the impact of ocean acidification;
   upregulation of chlorophyll content is suggested as an important
   strategy for symbionts to adapt to high pCO(2). However, warming and
   acidification (alone or combined) significantly affected the cholesterol
   or sterol levels. Indeed, environmental changes like warming and
   acidification will affect the sterol metabolism and health of H. crispa
   in the coming decades. Ocean acidification and warming are two of the
   most important threats to the existence of marine organisms and are
   predicted to co-occur in oceans. The present work evaluated the effects
   of acidification (AC: 24 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 900 mu atm CO2), warming
   (WC: 30 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 450 mu atm CO2), and their combination
   (CC: 30 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 900 mu atm CO2) on the sea anemone,
   Heteractis crispa, from the aspects of photosynthetic apparatus (maximum
   quantum yield of photosystem II (PS II), chlorophyll level, and
   Symbiodiniaceae density) and sterol metabolism (cholesterol content and
   total sterol content). In a 15-day experiment, acidification alone had
   no apparent effect on the photosynthetic apparatus, but did affect
   sterol levels. Upregulation of their chlorophyll level is an important
   strategy for symbionts to adapt to high partial pressure of CO2
   (pCO(2))(.) However, after warming stress, the benefits of high pCO(2)
   had little effect on stress tolerance in H. crispa. Indeed, thermal
   stress was the dominant driver of the deteriorating health of H. crispa.
   Cholesterol and total sterol contents were significantly affected by all
   three stress conditions, although there was no significant change in the
   AC group on day 3. Thus, cholesterol or sterol levels could be used as
   important indicators to evaluate the impact of climate change on
   cnidarians. Our findings suggest that H. crispa might be relatively
   insensitive to the impact of ocean acidification, whereas increased
   temperature in the future ocean might impair viability of H. crispa.},

Title = {Probabilistic projections of the Atlantic overturning},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {127},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {579-586},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Changes in the Atlantic overturning circulation have a strong influence
   on European temperatures, North American sea level and other climate
   phenomena worldwide. A meaningful assessment of associated societal
   impacts needs to be based on the full range of its possible future
   evolution. This requires capturing both the uncertainty in future
   warming pathways and the inherently long-term response of the ocean
   circulation. While probabilistic projections of the global mean and
   regional temperatures exist, process-based probabilistic assessments of
   large-scale dynamical systems such as the Atlantic overturning are still
   missing. Here we present such an assessment and find that a reduction of
   more than 50 \% in Atlantic overturning strength by the end of the 21 (s
   t) century is within the likely range under an unmitigated climate
   change scenario (RCP8.5). By combining linear response functions derived
   from comprehensive climate simulations with the full range of possible
   future warming pathways, we provide probability estimates of overturning
   changes by the year 2100. A weakening of more than 25 \% is found to be
   very unlikely under a climate protection scenario (RCP2.6), but likely
   for unmitigated climate change. The method is able to reproduce the
   modelled recovery caused by climatic equilibration under climate
   protection scenarios which provides confidence in the approach. Within
   this century, a reduction of the Atlantic overturning is a robust
   climatic phenomena that intensifies with global warming and needs to be
   accounted for in global adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Future of Coastal Lagoons in Arid Zones under Climate Change and
   Anthropogenic Pressure. A Case Study from San Jose Lagoon, Mexico},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {In arid and semiarid zones, groundwater plays a key role in the ecology
   and availability of freshwater. Coastal lagoons in arid zones have great
   importance as a refuge for species of flora and fauna, as a source of
   freshwater, and for recreational purposes for local communities and
   tourism. In addition, as environments under natural stress, they are
   suffering pressure from anthropogenic activities and climate change,
   especially in zones with intense touristic development as in the case of
   the Baja California Peninsula in northwest Mexico. In this paper, we
   analyze the future of a coastal lagoon impacted by climate change and
   anthropogenic pressures. We constructed a groundwater MODFLOW-SWI2 model
   to predict changes in freshwater-saltwater inputs and correlated them
   with the geospatial analysis of the distribution and evolution of the
   water body and surrounding vegetation. The methodology was applied to
   the San Jose lagoon, one of the most important wetlands in the Baja
   California peninsula, which had been affected by anthropogenic
   activities and endangered by climate change. According to our water
   balance, the deficit of the San Jose aquifer will increase by 2040 as a
   result of climate change. The water table north of the lagoon will drop,
   affecting the amount of freshwater inflow. This reduction, together with
   an increase of evapotranspiration and the sea-level rise, will favor an
   increase of mineralization, reducing the surface water and groundwater
   quality and in consequence affecting the vegetation cover. Without
   proper management and adequate measures to mitigate these impacts, the
   lagoon may disappear as a freshwater ecosystem. Results of this research
   indicate that the use of a groundwater flow model, together with a
   geospatial analysis provide effective tools to predict scenarios for the
   future of coastal lagoons, and serve as a basis for land planning,
   nature conservation, and sustainable management of these ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Several studies have highlighted the significant impact of climate
   change on agriculture. However, there have been little empirical
   enquiries into the impact of climate change on marine fish production,
   particularly in Bangladesh. Hence, this study aims to investigate the
   impact of climate change on marine fish production in Bangladesh using
   data from 1961 to 2019. Data were obtained from the Food and Agriculture
   Organization, Bangladesh Meteorological Department, the World
   Development Indicators, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used
   to describe the dynamic link between CO2 emissions, average temperature,
   Sea Surface Temperature (SST), rainfall, sunshine, wind and marine fish
   production. The ARDL approach to cointegration revealed that SST (beta =
   0.258), rainfall (beta =0.297), and sunshine (beta =0.663) significantly
   influence marine fish production at 1\% and 10\% levels in the short run
   and at 1\% level in the long run. The results also found that average
   temperature has a significant negative impact on fish production in both
   short and long runs. On the other hand, CO2 emissions have a negative
   impact on marine fish production in the short run. Specifically, for
   every 1\% rise in CO2 emissions, marine fish production will decline by
   0.11\%. The findings of this study suggest that policymakers formulate
   better policy frameworks for climate change adaptation and sustainable
   management of marine fisheries at the national level. Research and
   development in Bangladesh's fisheries sector should also focus on marine
   fish species that can resist high sea surface temperatures, CO2
   emissions, and average temperatures.},

Abstract = {CO2 disposal in the deep ocean is expected to be an effective option for
   mitigating the increase in CO2 on the earth.  We have investigated the
   behaviour of liquid CO2 using test facilities which can simulate the
   pressure and temperature of the deep ocean.  Phase equilibrium data of
   the CO2-seawater system and the conditions of CO2 clathrate formation
   were confirmed.  In addition, we measured the pH value of seawater
   saturated with CO2 at high pressure.  The data presented in this paper
   are considered indispensable for evaluating the possibility of CO2
   disposal in the deep ocean.},

Abstract = {In the recent few decades, climate variability had severely affected the
   socio-economic and environmental conditions worldwide. Frequent shifts
   in the atmospheric circulation patterns affect large parts of the globe,
   predominantly the arid and semi-arid regions facing severe to moderate
   droughts. Therefore, precursors of drought events and their associated
   mechanisms are important to understand. This study explores the possible
   cycles and precursor conditions that might be employed for predicting
   upcoming droughts in Pakistan. Standardize precipitation index and the
   single Z-index are used to detect and rank the drought years. Moreover,
   composite analysis is carried out to explore the large-scale circulation
   anomalies related to extreme drought events. Results demonstrate that
   extreme drought events are highly correlated with wind patterns and
   intrinsic weather system in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This study
   analyzed air temperature, sea level pressure and geopotential height in
   the average time-period of January to March, sea surface temperature
   from October to December, and wind vectors in March to May as precursors
   that could be employed to predict the occurrence of droughts in
   Pakistan. This information is of significance for policymakers to plan
   climate change adaptive measures accordingly.},

Title = {Spatial and Temporal Trends in the Timing of Budburst for Australian
   Wine Regions},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Background and Aims. This research investigates spatial and temporal
   trends in budburst timing across Australian wine regions from 1910-2019.
   The potential drivers of these observed trends were then identified,
   including anthropogenic climate change and large-scale climate drivers
   (El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and
   Southern Annular Mode (SAM)). Methods and Results. The timing of
   budburst was approximated using accumulation measurements applied to
   Australia wide gridded temperature data. We show that the modelled
   budburst date has been gradually shifting to earlier in the year for
   most (95\%) Australian wine regions, at an average rate of one day every
   24 years. This linear trend in budburst timing is likely to be
   associated with steadily increasing air temperatures due to
   anthropogenic climate change. Significant interannual variability was
   also observed and was correlated with IOD and SAM; however, no
   significant relationship was found with ENSO. Positive IOD phases result
   in budburst occurring on average four days earlier than the long-term
   average; however, this can be as high as eight days. Conclusions. The
   results of this study highlight that budburst timing for wine grapes is
   not a stationary phenomenon and is influenced by both natural and
   anthropogenic conditions. Significance of the Study. Understanding
   variability and trends in modelled budburst timing will assist tactical
   and strategic management practices and improve phenological modelling
   and adaptation planning for climate change.},

Title = {Urban water capacity: Irrigation for heat mitigation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {78},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Our world has been continuously urbanized and is currently accommodating
   more than half of the human population. Despite that cities cover only <
   3\% of the Earth's land surface area, they emerged as focal points of
   human activities, and confront numerous environmental challenges as a
   result of changes in landscapes, hydroclimate, ecosystems, and
   biodiversity. In particular, the built environment usually experiences
   exacerbated heat stress induced by global climate and landscape changes,
   commonly known as the urban heat island effect. Urban irrigation, as a
   climate adaptation and mitigation strategy, is effective in cooling the
   built environment, but exhibits large uncertainties in the trade-off
   between water use and heat mitigation capacity. Here we show the
   efficiency of cooling effect induced by irrigation of urban vegetation,
   represented by a novel metric, viz. urban water capacity, analogous to
   the heat capacity, across the contiguous United States (CONUS) during
   summertime via numerical simulations. The urban water capacity is
   calculated as the average irrigation depth per degree of urban
   temperature reduction; the values are 4.52 +/- 0.77 mm day(-1) degrees
   C-1 and 7.27 +/- 1.27 mm day(-1) degrees C-1 (mean +/- standard
   deviation) for surface and near-surface air cooling, respectively, over
   the CONUS. The robustness of urban water capacity is further exemplified
   in an extreme heat wave event, during which the warming anomaly is
   partially offset by the additional cooling from urban irrigation.
   Estimates of water capacity provide a quantitative metric for evaluating
   the efficacy of irrigation in urban planning under current heat stress
   and future warming.},

Abstract = {Saltmarsh-mangrove ecotones occur at the boundary of the natural
   geographic distribution of mangroves and salt marshes. Climate warming
   and species invasion can also drive the formation of saltmarsh-mangrove
   mixing communities. How these coastal species live together in a
   ``new{''} mixed community is important in predicting the dynamic of
   saltmarsh-mangrove ecosystems as affected by ongoing climate change or
   human activities. To date, the understanding of species interactions has
   been rare on adult species in these ecotones.
   Two typical coastal wetlands were selected as cases to understand how
   mangrove and saltmarsh species living together in the ecotones. The
   leaves of seven species were sampled from these coastal wetlands based
   on their distribution patterns (living alone or coexisting) in the high
   tidal zone, and seven commonly used functional traits of these species
   were analyzed.
   We found niche separation between saltmarsh and mangrove species, which
   is probably due to the different adaptive strategies they adopted to
   deal with intertidal environments.
   Weak interactions between coexisting species were dominated in the high
   tidal zone of the two saltmarsh-mangrove communities, which could be
   driven by both niche differentiation and neutral theory.
   Synthesis. Our field study implies a potential opportunity to establish
   a multispecies community in the high tidal zone of saltmarsh-mangrove
   ecotones, where the sediment was characterized by low salinity and high
   nitrogen.},
